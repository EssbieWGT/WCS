FIRST ON FOX: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have arrested Afghan national Jaan Shah Safi, an alleged ISIS-K supporter brought into the country under former President Joe Biden's Operation Allies Welcome, in Waynesboro, Virginia.

Safi was arrested as President Donald Trump and his administration confront a surge of terror cases tied to Afghan arrivals that occurred under the Biden administration.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Wednesday that Safi arrived in the U.S. on Sept. 8, 2021, in Philadelphia.

He applied for Temporary Protected Status (TPS), though his application was terminated when DHS Secretary Kristi Noem ended TPS for Afghans.

DEMS' RESPONSE TO ISIS LEADER ARREST 'DISTURBING,’ SAYS FATHER OF MARINE KILLED AT ABBEY GATE

ICE agents arrested Safi Wednesday.

""Today, our heroic ICE officers arrested Jaan Shah Safi, a terrorist who provided material support to ISIS-K,"" Noem said in a news release. ""The Biden administration brought this terrorist into the U.S. under the disastrous Operation Allies Welcome program. This terrorist was arrested miles from our nation’s capital, where our brave National Guard heroes, Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe, were shot just days ago by another unvetted Afghan terrorist brought into our country.

""The Biden administration created one of the worst national security crises in American history. Biden let into our country nearly 190,000 unvetted Afghan aliens, only determining who they were and their intentions when they were already on American soil,"" she continued. ""President Trump has been working every day since Jan. 20 to clean up this unmitigated national security crisis.""

BOULDER TERROR ATTACK PUTS BIDEN-ERA IMMIGRATION POLICIES IN THE HOT SEAT: 'MUST BE FULLY REVERSED'

The DHS accused the Biden administration of relying on unvetted referrals to admit nearly 190,000 Afghan nationals into the U.S.

The Trump administration put a stop to Afghan refugee resettlement after Trump returned to the Oval Office in January because it saw the program as a massive threat to national security.

Safi’s arrest marks the third of an Afghan national who was released into the country under Biden in less than a week, according to DHS.

On Nov. 26, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who was also released into the U.S. under Operation Allies Welcome, allegedly committed a terror and ambush-style attack on two National Guard members, killing one, just blocks from the White House.

On Nov. 25, just a day before the attack, Mohammad Dawood Alokozay was arrested by local authorities and the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force after allegedly making bomb threats in Fort Worth, Texas.

The family appealed that decision, but it was dismissed on Oct. 31, after which they sought asylum in Canada.

Speakers in Portland focused on the lives and personalities of the detained students.
Portland Assistant Superintendent Abdullahi Ahmed, speaking as a private citizen and not a representative of the district, and Rep. Deqa Dhalac, D-South Portland, also gave speeches during the event.","PORTLAND — A day after the season’s first storm blanketed the city, hundreds of students marched through the snow to protest the detention of two of their peers, and the increased presence of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in their city.

“No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” they chanted.

“Funding for jobs and education, not for mass incarceration!”

More than 500 students from Portland’s public middle and high schools and the private Waynflete School marched from Monument Square to City Hall on Wednesday afternoon in a show of solidarity for their detained classmates and other Mainers affected by immigration enforcement.

The event comes weeks after two Portland high schoolers, 16-year-old Joel Andre and 14-year-old Estefania Andre, were detained by ICE along with their mother and older sister after being denied asylum in Canada. The family is originally from the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

An immigration judge ordered the removal of the family in February because they had entered the country illegally, according to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. The family appealed that decision, but it was dismissed on Oct. 31, after which they sought asylum in Canada.

As of last week, Joel and Estefania were being held in immigration custody in Texas with their mother, while their older sister was separated from the family and is being held in New York. Todd Pomerleau, an attorney representing the family, said his firm has filed a petition with the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston to review the family’s request to stay in the country.

Pomerleau said in a phone call Wednesday that he and his colleagues are working to have the family released from custody so they can be reunited.

Joel is a junior at Deering High School and Estefania is a freshman at Casco Bay High School.

Wednesday’s event was organized by Casco Bay seniors Evie Jones and Caroline Chong, and Waynflete junior Omari Brent, who said they quickly received support from other schools and community groups. Jones and Chong said after news broke about the detention of the Andres, students in the freshman class at their school were deeply upset, which inspired them to organize the rally.

Students left their schools around 12:15 p.m. (organizers said they worked with the Greater Portland Metro to send extra buses to Casco Bay and Deering high schools) and arrived in Monument Square, where they gathered before marching to fill the plaza in front of City Hall.

From the steps of the municipal building, students, teachers and other community members said through megaphones that Maine and Portland should be safe places for immigrants and refugees to live, work and go to school. They stressed the importance of speaking up for those who can’t out of fear.

“We are the only ones who can break the pattern and work towards a country that embraces peace and diversity,” Chong said.

Speakers in Portland focused on the lives and personalities of the detained students. Estefania was described by her classmates as a bright light, and by her teacher Kerry Herlihy as the first student to class every day, who would share her lunch with everyone, and as “someone who can bring joy into any room she enters.” And Joel was a beloved member of Portland’s soccer community, who teammate and Deering senior Jack Borland called loyal, supportive, and the “guy who shows up when no one else does.”

“Instead of being in school, and instead of practicing with us, instead of living in a community that loves him, Joel is sitting in a detention facility in Texas,” Borland said. “Not because he’s dangerous, not because he’s done harm, but because our system is broken. It targets people of color, treating them with suspicion first and humanity second.”

Speakers also criticized the actions of ICE agents in Portland and around the country, while signs held by attendees called for an end to the agency.

The public walkout came just one day after President Donald Trump, who has made aggressive immigration enforcement a hallmark of his second term, targeted Somali Americans during a Cabinet meeting, calling them “garbage.” His administration also pledged to increase ICE presence in Minnesota, which like Maine has a large population of Somali immigrants.

Deering junior Anfa Ahmed’s sign read “ICE should only be in my drink.” She didn’t know the Andre family directly, but showed up because, she said, nobody should have to go through what they have, and to stand with the community.

“I believe it’s important that we all come together to face this issue head-on,” she said.

Portland Assistant Superintendent Abdullahi Ahmed, speaking as a private citizen and not a representative of the district, and Rep. Deqa Dhalac, D-South Portland, also gave speeches during the event.

“No one should be forced into the shadows simply because they came here searching for a better life,” said Dhalac, the former mayor of South Portland and the country’s first Somali-American mayor. “No one should be caged for seeking safety.”

The demonstration ended with a singalong to the Woody Guthrie folk anthem “This Land is Your Land.”

“You know, people will rally behind him, you know … making America great, whatever that means, right?” Nasir Abdi, a patron at 24 Somali Mall, echoed the sentiment.","Everything seemed normal at Minneapolis’s Somali markets: Men sat in barber chairs, women browsed colorful garments at the boutiques and patrons sampled fried sambusas and rice dishes at the eateries, sometimes as the Muslim call to prayer was sung at low volume over the loudspeakers.

But beneath the calm surface, a quiet anxiety was palpable.

Pockets and purses hung a little heavier with immigration documents and passports as the specter of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown loomed over the gathering spots for the Somali diaspora in the Twin Cities – home to the nation’s largest population of people from the East African country.

A new Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation targeting undocumented Somali immigrants has begun in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, a source with knowledge of the plans told CNN Wednesday. The cities are the latest target of Trump’s sweeping deportation push that has seen a surge of federal agents flooding the streets of blue cities like Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans.

With the President of the United States disparaging their community as “garbage,” many in Minneapolis’s Somali community were feeling unsettled – as evidenced by the sparser than normal crowds at two different malls and the occasional shuttered shop.

A young man working at a bakery at the Karmel Mall south of downtown Minneapolis said the shopping center on Tuesday night was dead compared to usual.

The man, who only gave his first name, Fawzi, said he is nervous even though he was born in Minneapolis.

“I feel scared,” he said. “Imagine you’re just sitting in your car and then just someone walks up and is like, ‘Yo, you gotta come with me.’”

At the sprawling indoor mall, offices offering visa and overseas shipping services are interspersed with henna shops, rows of boutiques selling traditional Somali attire, colorful prayer mats and gold jewelry. Overhead, a blue ceiling with white stars symbolizes the flag of Somalia.

At another market about 2 miles away, 24 Somali Mall, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey paid a visit to calm jangled nerves and show his support on Wednesday afternoon.

Frey was waiting in line to buy a Somali confection at a bakery when a woman went up to him and showed him her green card. She told him she was carrying it because she was scared.

“I mean, she’s an American citizen,” Frey later told CNN. “She’s been here for 25 years, in Minneapolis.”

Carrying ID cards and papers out of fear

As the mayor posed for photos and chatted with shoppers at 24 Somali Mall, a different scene played out just outside.

Three vehicles with tinted windows and Virginia plates pulled to a stop near a man who was panhandling on a snowy street. Multiple armed men in law enforcement vests marked “ERO,” or Enforcement and Removal Operations, came out, CNN witnessed.

They asked him for his identification before letting him go, the man later told CNN.

The man, who declined to give his name, said he is a 35-year-old US citizen who was born in Buffalo, New York.

He said he showed the agents his “papers,” and added he wouldn’t have had a problem with doing so had the agents not been so “aggressive.”

“They grabbed my hand,” he said. “You shouldn’t do that. … Other than that I got no problem being verified.”

Frey noted that of the more than 80,000 people of Somali descent in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the vast majority are citizens or legal residents; just a few hundred have temporary protected status – a protection that President Donald Trump has threatened to remove.

“It’s a fairly small number, but again, they are here legally,” he said, adding he fears federal agents will violate the Constitution by “arresting American citizens for looking like they’re Somali.”

Others told CNN they, too, were carrying ID cards and papers for fear of getting stopped.

Kamal Ali, who runs a dump truck business with his father and brother, made sure to stick his passport in his wallet before heading to Karmel Mall to grab dinner.

“I don’t want no issues,” said the 39-year-old, who said he came to the US at age 10 with his parents after living in a refugee camp in Somalia.

The mayor on Wednesday signed an executive order to prohibit federal, state and local law-enforcement agents from using city-owned parking lots, ramps, garages or vacant lots for staging immigration enforcement operations.

The order was modeled on a similar policy in Chicago, where federal immigration authorities had previously used municipal lots to stage operations, Minneapolis city officials said in a statement.

Frey’s order will also create a “signage template” for local businesses and property owners who want to mark their property as off-limits for these activities, the statement said.

Abdul Abdullahi, who runs an employment office at 24 Somali Mall, said he finds Trump’s words about the Somali community “shameful.”

“It’s very unfortunate for someone in the highest office in the world to generalize and demean a whole community by saying that they are garbage – they’re of no good,” said Abdullahi, 39, who said he’s been living in Minneapolis for decades. “This is just an attempt to divide us – an attempt to pit us against each other.”

When asked about comments from President Donald Trump about not wanting Somali immigrants in the United States, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, speaking with CNN, cited data analysis on Somalis in Minneapolis and other parts of the country that suggests there is “widespread fraud, particularly marriage fraud, when it comes to immigration.”

Nearly 58% of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority — 87% — are naturalized US citizens.

Citizens of Somalia were first granted Temporary Protected Status in 1991 when the country was plunged into chaos after dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown. In 2013, the US officially recognized the Somali government in Mogadishu for the first time in two decades.

Somalis have maintained Temporary Protected Status “due to insecurity and ongoing armed conflict that present serious threats to the safety of returnees,” according to the legislation.

Mixed opinions within the community

Not all who spoke with CNN were critics of Trump. Some said they voted for him.

Among them was a 40-year-old patron at Karmel Mall who said he attended a Trump rally in Minneapolis in 2019 but was turned away as the venue was filled to capacity.

“The economy was really good the first term,” said the man, a mechanical engineer who only wanted to share his first name, Mohamud. “I’m a numbers guy.”

Still, Mohamud said he believes Trump’s rhetoric will boost the president’s standing at the expense of the local Somali community.

“This will give him a boost of support,” he said. “You know, people will rally behind him, you know … making America great, whatever that means, right?”

Nasir Abdi, a patron at 24 Somali Mall, echoed the sentiment.

“This is just a show,” he said.

Some Somali residents addressed a $300-million fraud scandal in Minnesota in which dozens of people – the vast majority of them of Somali descent – were charged.

Trump referenced the scandal, which diverted money meant to feed children during the pandemic to fraudsters, a week before Thanksgiving, calling Minnesota a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity” as he announced plans to terminate Temporary Protected Status for Somali residents in the state.

“There’s a few bad apples, you know, that committed crimes and broke the law, but at the same time, you can’t do a collective punishment,” said Ali, the man who works at his family’s dump truck business.

Frey put a similar point in stronger terms.

“If you stole food from children and money that should have gone towards housing, you should go to jail,” he said, while eating a plate of goat meat and rice at 24 Somali Mall. “You do not hold an entire community accountable for the actions of the fraudsters.”

He added: “I’m Jewish, and nobody ever held me accountable for Bernie Madoff’s financial crimes.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-12-03t131100z-2034913129-rc2m8ia0h3fk-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-minnesota.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-12-04 06:57:27.988310

Those on the list were arrested for crimes such as aggravated assault with a firearm, domestic abuse, driving under the influence, home invasion and sexual battery, among others.

New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick sparked backlash last week after saying that illegal immigration by foreign nationals in the U.S. is a ""civil issue"" and that her agency would not enforce certain immigration laws.

""We will not enforce civil law, and so our support is to make sure they're not going to get hurt and our community is not in danger,"" Kirkpatrick said.

Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said on social media that she spoke with Kirkpatrick about the remarks and reaffirmed that ""it is a state crime to obstruct ICE and federal immigration enforcement.""

The Trump administration has put an emphasis on its crackdown on illegal immigration, with DHS Secretary Kristi Noem accusing the Biden administration of using DHS to ""invade the country with terrorists.""

""If you think about what Joe Biden did with the Department of Homeland Security, he used this department to invade the country with terrorists.

On Tuesday, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) released new guidance pausing immigration from 19 countries, 12 of which were on full travel bans while the other seven were under partial restrictions. The impacted nations are Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

The immigration pause, which is effective immediately, applies to nationals from the 19 listed nations who entered the U.S. on or after Jan. 20, 2021, the date of former President Joe Biden's inauguration. Migrants from one of the 19 countries who came into the U.S. after that date will be subjected to a re-review process that could include an interview to screen for all possible national security and public safety risks.

It also impacts all green card and citizenship applications for anyone hailing from one of the now-restricted countries. Individuals from one of the 19 nations who have already passed the citizenship test will not be able to have U.S. citizenship ceremonies until after the guidance is lifted.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/ice-new-orleans-immigration-protest.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 05:56:46.785716

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement about the New Orleans operation that it is “targeting criminal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies that force local authorities to ignore U.S. immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrest detainers,” or requests to hold people authorities have arrested for ICE.

Trump had not specified as of Wednesday morning how many guard troops he would send.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that those targeted in New Orleans include people released after being arrested for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto and rape.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, has said he welcomes the administration’s intervention in the Democrat-run city, which has logged significant drops in crime and is on pace to have its lowest number of homicides in nearly 50 years, according to crime data from the police department.

Shortly after the DHS announcement, the FBI in New Orleans said that federal agents and state police will launch a joint effort to “deter assaults on federal officers and attempts to obstruct law enforcement action” during DHS’ immigration enforcement in the city.

Ahead of the start of immigration operations in New Orleans, some of the state’s immigrants said they were afraid and were taking precautions, with one Honduran immigrant telling Noticias Telemundo he hadn’t left his home in two weeks. “We’ve stopped going to work because our fear is that we’ll be stopped,” the immigrant, who was not shown on camera and whose name was withheld, said. “We’re shut in, and like me there are many.”

On Wednesday, New Orleans resident Rocío Tirado said she was delivering groceries and paychecks to families who were too scared to leave their homes. “They’re afraid because everybody’s hiding,” she told NBC News.

Tirado said only eight of 140 children had come to soccer practice Tuesday night; many of their parents are immigrants.

“This is just sad,” she said. “It’s horrible to see it.”

Tirado added she has been waking up at 6 a.m. to drive some of the children to school because their parents are too scared to leave their homes.

“Some of these people have a work authorization and they have Social Security,” she said, and they are still too scared.

It’s also affecting children, Tirado said, recalling a child who told her she called her mom three times from school and got scared the one time she didn’t pick up. “She was scared her mom was gone,” she said.

The state and New Orleans had seen growth in their Latino and immigrant populations since Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when citizens and noncitizens arrived to clean and restore the city and surrounding areas. Much of the state’s Latino population is based in Jefferson Parish, where Hispanics are 19% of the population. The parish includes the city of Kenner, where Hispanics are about 30% of the population.

The Trump administration also began an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis, a senior law enforcement official told NBC News Wednesday.

Confirmation of that launch follows reports that the administration was planning an immigration crackdown this week in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, where a number of Somali immigrants and their family members live.

A senior law enforcement administration official told NBC News that ICE officers are not specifically targeting Somali immigrants and their families but may be arresting some who they allege have violated immigration laws.

On Tuesday, President Donald Trump ended a Cabinet meeting by unleashing a tirade against Minnesota’s population of Somalis, saying “they should go back to where they came from” and calling Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., “garbage.”

“I don’t want them in our country. I’ll be honest with you, OK. Somebody will say, ‘Oh, that’s not politically correct.’ I don’t care. I don’t want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason,” Trump said. The president previously also attacked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, calling him a slur that disparages people with disabilities.

A representative for Omar did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday, but she said on X: “His obsession with me is creepy. I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.” Omar’s family fled the civil war in Somalia and lived in a Kenyan refugee camp before she moved to the U.S. and became a citizen.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251203-immigration-enforcement-new-orleans-mn-1320-00aedf.jpg",N,,2025-12-04 03:57:41.721468

Most of them entered the United States with a special status called humanitarian parole under a program called Operation Allies Welcome.
Mr. Trump has announced additional measures that could jeopardize the ability of Afghans in the United States to remain permanently.","In the frenzied American exit from Afghanistan, Obaidullah Durani, a fighter pilot who had been trained by U.S. forces, was scrambling to get his family out, too. His daughter, Hela, was hoisted over the fence by a Marine at the Kabul airport as the family rushed to make a departing plane. But Mr. Durani’s wife, Shafaro, was separated from him and their two children and never made it onto an evacuation flight.

Allowed to enter the United States through a special program for people who worked with American forces, Mr. Durani settled in Arizona, with his infant daughter and toddler son. He had never changed a diaper in his life, he said, but he was now a single father juggling parenting with delivery jobs. Yet he felt safe in the United States and hopeful that the family would eventually be reunited.

That all changed with the deadly attack on National Guard members last week in Washington, D.C., which authorities say was carried out by a 29-year-old Afghan man.

Following the attack, President Trump directed his administration to suspend all Afghan immigration cases and immigration agents have been ordered to track down nearly 2,000 Afghans who have what are known as final deportation orders but are not in detention.

That threatens the lives built by the Duranis and thousands of other Afghan families in the United States.

Mr. Trump has seized on the shooting to intensify his broader anti-immigration campaign, and he has sought to depict the attack and the man charged, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, as evidence of a dangerously broken system he inherited from President Biden.

“We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here or add benefit to our country,” the president said on Truth Social. “If they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”

All told, about 200,000 Afghans who were considered wartime allies of the United States have been admitted to the United States since the chaotic pullout that concluded the 20-year occupation. Many had worked alongside U.S. troops in combat or on bases; others were employed by organizations — including The Times and other media outlets — as well as institutions that supported U.S. operations or interests.

The rhetoric and the threats from Mr. Trump have stirred panic in communities that are home to many Afghan arrivals, including the Phoenix area where about 4,000 have settled since 2021.

On Monday, after school pickup, Mr. Durani was among dozens of Afghans who crowded the Arizona Refugee Center, a nonprofit in Mesa, outside Phoenix, seeking answers.

He and his children have a green card interview scheduled for Dec. 17. He had many questions: Would the interview still take place? And, if it did, could his family end up being detained? Deported? What about his wife, whose process to enter the United States was now at a standstill?

“Every Afghan is worried,” said Mr. Durani, who delivers Amazon packages. “They shouldn’t punish all of us because of one person.”

“I’m here contributing, working, paying my taxes,” he said. “This is a country of laws and democracy; the man has been arrested.”

“Right now, if you leave the country, you might not be allowed back,” Ms. Peterson told one caller, who had plans to visit family members in Pakistan. “It’s too risky, even if you have a green card.”

Mirwais Daudzai, who also visited the center, works at the Phoenix airport assisting passengers who require wheelchairs. He greets them with a smile, asks about their journeys and eases them into the chairs. When travelers learn that he fled to the United States from his native Afghanistan, he said many tell him they are glad he is safe in America. Some slip him a generous tip.

That kindness seemed to vanish last week, Mr. Daudzai said, after the deadly attack in Washington, D.C., and the anti-immigrant measures announced by the government.

On Thanksgiving, the day after the shooting, a traveler was about to hand Mr. Daudzai a $20 bill, but shoved it into her pocket instead after hearing he was from Afghanistan.

It happened again over the long holiday weekend, Mr. Daudzai said. It was a hostility he had not previously encountered since arriving in the United States.

“Before this problem, I’m so happy and relaxed in this country,” said Mr. Daudzai, 31. “I have a job, I’m safe, I have no enemies.”

Now, “people are looking at all Afghans as terrorists,” said Mr. Daudzai, who was a police officer in his homeland and is in the United States with his wife. Both have active green card applications.

In the days since the shooting, U.S. officials have disclosed that Mr. Lakanwal was part of a paramilitary force that worked with the C.I.A. and was admitted to the United States as part of the effort to protect Afghan allies after the Taliban returned to power. Earlier this year, Mr. Lakanwal was granted asylum, which allowed him to remain in the United States and to seek a green card and citizenship.

For years, the admission into the United States of Afghans who supported the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan has enjoyed bipartisan support.

Before being allowed into the United States, the evacuees underwent extensive vetting. Many spent weeks or months in overseas way stations, such as Qatar, where they had to complete security checks, medical screenings and immigration paperwork. Once in the United States, they typically spent weeks on military bases before being resettled in communities across the country.

Most of them entered the United States with a special status called humanitarian parole under a program called Operation Allies Welcome. They then applied for asylum, which put them on the path to permanent residency in the country that gave them safe haven.

“They have worked for the last four years to achieve stability and integrate into American life,’’ said Ms. Larsen, co-founder of the refugee center in Mesa, Ariz.

Thousands of Afghans awaiting approval have been stranded in third countries, including Pakistan, which has stepped up its own expulsion of Afghans who have settled there.

The Trump administration had already sharply restricted Afghan immigration as part of a travel ban announced in June, dashing hopes of many separated families that they would be reunited any time soon.

But the future of many Afghans, both those already in the United States and those hoping to immigrate, has been clouded by the Nov. 26 shooting, which killed one Guard member, Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and wounded another, Andrew Wolfe, 24.

Mr. Trump has announced additional measures that could jeopardize the ability of Afghans in the United States to remain permanently. Among them is a plan to conduct new security checks of people already granted green cards, or lawful permanent residency.

As of Tuesday, the Trump administration has suspended the processing of all immigration applications filed by nationals of 19 countries, including Afghanistan, who had been barred from entering the United States under an executive order Mr. Trump issued in June. It is unclear when, or if, the suspension might be lifted.

Hekmatullah, 38, who said he was a former spokesman for the Ministry of Transport in Afghanistan, visited the center to seek camaraderie with fellow Afghans. His immigration status is especially precarious.

He, his wife and their three young daughters fled first to Iran, then to South America, where they joined the wave of humanity trudging through the perilous Darien Gap to make their way to North America.

They crossed the U.S. border with Mexico early last year and headed to Phoenix, where a brother-in-law, a former cargo plane pilot, had been resettled in 2021.

Hekmatullah, who spoke on condition that he be identified only by his first name to protect relatives in Afghanistan, applied for asylum, got a work permit and found a job at the airport.

His daughters, 11, 9 and 7, are thriving in school and already speak flawless English. In Afghanistan, they would be deprived of educational opportunities because they are girls.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/03/multimedia/00nat-phoenix-afghans-1-lfwv/00nat-phoenix-afghans-1-lfwv-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 01:56:36.105991

Texas appealed Biery’s ruling, sending the case to the same court where a three-judge panel recently blocked Louisiana’s Ten Commandments law from taking effect.","More legal battles are brewing over Texas’ requirement that schools display posters of the Ten Commandments, as a federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on the constitutionality of a state law that has the potential to reach the U.S. Supreme Court.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on Jan. 20 will hear both the Texas case and a similar case happening in Louisiana, which was the first state to pass a requirement to post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.

The Texas lawsuit is one of several cases that families of various religious and nonreligious backgrounds have brought forward challenging the state’s Ten Commandments law. Two federal district judges have blocked more than two dozen Texas school districts from complying with the law, saying that the legislation is unconstitutional.

The rulings in those cases only apply to the 25 school districts named in the lawsuits. The civil rights organizations sued another 16 districts in early December. In that class action lawsuit, they asked a federal judge to block every Texas school district from displaying the Ten Commandments.

The attorney general’s office has insisted that school districts not involved in the lawsuits implement the law. It sued the Round Rock, Leander and Galveston districts in November for allegedly not complying with the requirement as arguments over its constitutionality proceed in federal court.

Attorneys representing the families and the attorney general’s office have argued in court over the role Founding Fathers like Thomas Jefferson and James Madison played in developing the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment, which protects people's freedom of religion.

Both parties have debated the influence of the Ten Commandments on the country’s legal and educational systems, and whether the version of the Ten Commandments required to go up in schools belongs to a particular religious group. They have also sparred over whether the law reflects an attempt by Texas officials to coerce students into adhering to Judeo-Christian principles.

Texas' Ten Commandments law was one of the latest measures passed by the Republican-controlled Legislature earlier this year. Critics say the law inappropriately injects religion into the state's public schools, attended by roughly 5.5 million children.

Here are the latest details about the cases against the law:

The latest

U.S. District Judge Orlando L. Garcia on Nov. 18 ordered 14 districts to remove the posters from classroom walls by Dec. 1. Garcia concluded that the law “makes it impossible” for children to avoid the Ten Commandment displays. He noted that districts have a “strong incentive” to comply with the law, citing the state’s recent lawsuit against the Galveston school district for its alleged noncompliance.

In August, U.S. District Judge Fred Biery blocked 11 other school districts from posting the Ten Commandments. Biery concluded that the law favors Christianity over other faiths, is not neutral with respect to religion and is likely to interfere with families’ ""exercise of their sincere religious or nonreligious beliefs in substantial ways.""

""There are ways in which students could be taught any relevant history of the Ten Commandments without the state selecting an official version of scripture, approving it in state law, and then displaying it in every classroom on a permanent basis,"" Biery wrote in his opinion, adding that the law ""crosses the line from exposure to coercion.""

Texas appealed Biery’s ruling, sending the case to the same court where a three-judge panel recently blocked Louisiana’s Ten Commandments law from taking effect. Texas requested that all 17 active judges on the court hear the case, as opposed to a three-judge panel.

The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and a coalition of religious freedom organizations are representing the families in both cases. Attorneys had expressed hope that other districts would not implement the law, but they later told the court in a legal filing that many districts are implementing it or have signaled an intent to do so.

Soon after Biery’s ruling, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton called on every school district not blocked by the courts from posting the Ten Commandments to follow the law. Paxton has sued the Galveston, Round Rock and Leander school districts for allegedly not complying. The Leander district pushed back, saying it is in compliance.

The background

Senate Bill 10, by Republican Sen. Phil King of Weatherford, required the Ten Commandments to be displayed in classrooms on donated posters sized at least 16 by 20 inches. Gov. Greg Abbott signed the law in late June, the day after the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found a similar law in Louisiana was ""plainly unconstitutional."" The court ruled that requiring schools to post the Ten Commandments would cause an ""irreparable deprivation"" of First Amendment rights. An Arkansas judge ruled similarly in a separate case.

Supporters argue that the Ten Commandments and teachings of Christianity broadly are vital to understanding U.S. history, a controversial message that has resurged in recent years as part of a broader national movement to undermine the long-held interpretation of church-state separation. Texas GOP lawmakers have passed a number of laws in recent years to further codify their conservative religious views, a trend encouraged and celebrated by Christian leaders.

""This issue is likely to get to the United States Supreme Court,"" Biery, the judge, told a San Antonio courtroom prior to opening arguments in one of the Texas cases.

Biery’s August ruling blocking the law from taking full effect applied to the following school districts: Alamo Heights, North East, Lackland, Northside, Austin, Lake Travis, Dripping Springs, Houston, Fort Bend, Cypress-Fairbanks and Plano.

The latest ruling from Garcia blocks the law in the following districts: Comal, Georgetown, Conroe, Flour Bluff, Fort Worth, Arlington, McKinney, Frisco, Northwest, Azle, Rockwall, Lovejoy, Mansfield, McAllen.

Two of those districts — Arlington and McAllen — are no longer part of the lawsuit but agreed to follow the court’s rulings.

Another group of parents filed a similar lawsuit in Dallas during the summer. That lawsuit does not appear to have made any meaningful progress. A judge has threatened to dismiss the case if the plaintiffs do not provide required legal documents to the defendants by Dec. 1.

The most recent lawsuit, filed on Dec. 2, asks the court to block the law in the rest of the state, but it specifically names the following districts in the complaint: Argyle, Birdville, Carroll, Clear Creek, Deer Park, Fort Sam Houston, Hurst-Euless-Bedford, Katy, Liberty Hill, Magnolia, Medina Valley, Pearland, Prosper, Richardson, Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City and Wylie.

What are the plaintiffs saying

Oral arguments in the first Texas case, Rabbi Nathan v. Alamo Heights Independent School District, concluded in August, several weeks after 16 families represented by the religious freedom organizations sued the state over what their lawyers called “catastrophically unconstitutional"" legislation.

""Posting the Ten Commandments in public schools is un-American and un-Baptist,"" Griff Martin, a pastor, parent and plaintiff in the lawsuit, said in a statement. ""S.B. 10 undermines the separation of church and state as a bedrock principle of my family's Baptist heritage. Baptists have long held that the government has no role in religion — so that our faith may remain free and authentic.""

The lawyers made a similar argument during a November hearing for Cribbs Ringer v. Comal Independent School District, the latest legal filing, which includes more than a dozen new families.

In the lawsuit brought by the North Texas parents, the plaintiffs, who identify as Christian, said the law was unconstitutional and violated their right to direct their children's upbringing.

One of them, a Christian minister, said the displays will offer a message of religious intolerance, ""implying that anyone who does not believe in the state's official religious scripture is an outsider and not fully part of the community."" That message, the minister argued, conflicts with the religious, social justice and civil rights beliefs he seeks to teach his kids.

Another North Texas plaintiff, a mother of two, is worried she will be ""forced"" to have sensitive and perhaps premature conversations about topics like adultery with her young children — and also ""does not desire that her minor children to be instructed by their school about the biblical conception of adultery,"" the suit states.

The plaintiffs in the ACLU suits come from diverse religious backgrounds, including families who are nonreligious. Allison Fitzpatrick said in a statement that she fears her children will think they are violating school rules because they don't adhere to commandments like honoring the Sabbath.

""The state of Texas has no right to dictate to children how many gods to worship, which gods to worship, or whether to worship any gods at all,"" said Annie Laurie Gaylor, co-president of the Freedom From Religion Foundation, which brought the lawsuit alongside the ACLU.

The attorneys called the version of the Ten Commandments in SB 10 a “state-sponsored Protestant version,” which was corroborated by their witness, constitutional law professor and religious history expert Steven Green. They argued against the notion that the Ten Commandments were central to the development of the country’s legal and educational systems, which Green agreed lacked historical support.

The ACLU lawyers have also noted that students are legally required to attend school and have virtually no way to avoid seeing the state's required version of the Ten Commandments, which they say interferes with children's and families' rights. The U.S. Supreme Court has already found public schools' display of the Ten Commandments unconstitutional, and the attorneys have made clear that only the Supreme Court can overturn its previous rulings.

What the state is saying

The attorney general’s office has argued that the Ten Commandments are part of the nation’s history and heritage, and that previous rulings from federal courts and the U.S. Supreme Court blocking the commandments from going up in classrooms did not examine that historical significance.

Attorneys for the state have noted that the Supreme Court recently shot down the test that courts previously relied on to determine when a government had unconstitutionally endorsed or established a religion. And attorneys pointed out a decades-old ruling in a Nebraska case, regarding a Ten Commandments monument on city property, where an appeals court decided in favor of the monument that displayed the same version of the commandments Texas wants to show in public schools. They relied on that ruling to make the case that SB 10 does not favor a particular religious group.

""There is no legal reason to stop Texas from honoring a core ethical foundation of our law, especially not a bogus claim about the ‘separation of church and state,' which is a phrase found nowhere in the Constitution,"" Paxton said in a recent statement.

The attorney general’s viewpoints were supported in court by Mark David Hall, a professor and author who studies religious liberty and church-state relations. Hall, the state’s expert witness, recently wrote a book that considers how “Christian Nationalism Is Not an Existential Threat to America or the Church.”

Attorney William Farrell from the attorney general’s office described SB 10’s requirement as a “passive display on the wall” that does not rise to the level of coercion because students can choose to ignore the posters if they wish. The law would ""probably cross the line,"" he said, if it also incorporated the Ten Commandments into lessons or assignments — but that is not the case.

The posters must only go up if they are donated to the school, he further argued, and the law does not specify what would happen if districts choose not to comply. The state views that as evidence that it poses no threat or harm to families, even though Attorney General Ken Paxton recently issued a legal advisory threatening action if schools do not comply and has sued three districts for their noncompliance.

“SB 10 doesn’t restrict anything,” Farrell said. “It doesn’t exclude anything or specifically require any … participation by students.”",https://cdn.houstonpublicmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/26111335/20250626_TenCommandments_03-1500x1000.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 22:57:39.363625

Minneapolis parking executive order

What we know:

The order comes after reports that federal immigration agents in Chicago used municipal lots as staging areas before city leaders issued a similar order, according to a news release from the mayor's office.

Executive Order 2025-02 requires city departments to take the following actions:

Identify all city-owned or city-controlled parking lots, parking ramps, vacant lots, or garages that could be used for staging civil immigration enforcement operations;

Post clear signage stating that the space may not be used by any government entity for those purposes: ""This property is owned and/or controlled by the City of Minneapolis. The City of Minneapolis does not authorize this property to be used, and it may not be used, by any federal, state, or local government entity or personnel as a staging area, processing location, operations base, or any other similar use for civil immigration enforcement operations.""

Immediately report any violation of the Executive Order.

Design an optional signage template for private property owners and leasers who wish to lawfully restrict civil immigration enforcement activities in non-public areas.

What they're saying:

Mayor Frey released the following statement:

""Minneapolis is — and will remain — a city that stands up for our residents. City parking lots need to be used for City purposes, which do not include civil immigration enforcement. There’s no place in our Minneapolis for fear-based tactics or operations that undermine community trust. This Executive Order makes it clear: City parking lots, ramps, garages, and vacant lots cannot and will not be used to stage civil immigration enforcement operations.""

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara shared the following statement:

""Our work as a police department depends on the community, which includes immigrant communities. Everyone must feel safe seeking help, reporting crimes, and working with our officers.""

What we don't know:

It is not clear how the city plans to enforce this executive order.

FOX 9 has reached out to Minneapolis officials to ask what enforcement actions they can take and will update this story if the city responds.

President Trump targeting Minneapolis Somali community

The backstory:

Twin Cities leaders say an immigration enforcement operation by the Trump Administration to target reportedly undocumented Somali residents in Minneapolis is underway, and federal agents are already knocking on doors.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said at a Tuesday news conference as many as 100 federal agents will be deployed to the Twin Cities with a specific purpose to target the Somali community. Federal agents have also previously exercised other operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte in recent months.

A local immigration attorney in the Somali community tells FOX 9 he is hearing from clients that an immigration enforcement operation is already underway, and started over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend.

The source tells FOX 9 one of his clients called him from Fort Snelling after being arrested by ICE officials Tuesday morning outside his home, on his way to work. The client is seeking asylum, with a pending case and authorization to work in the U.S. The man arrested has been in the U.S. for less than two years.

New surveillance video obtained by TMZ is showing the ICE arrest of a woman with a family connection to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt in a Revere, Massachusetts, parking lot.

Bruna Ferreira, 33, was detained by ICE agents on Nov. 12 while she was driving to her son's school in New Hampshire.

Ferreira's son is the nephew of Karoline Leavitt.

Video shows Ferreira parked in a parking lot in a silver sedan. She attempts to reverse but is quickly surrounded by several SUVs before ICE agents jump out and approach Ferreira's driver's side window.

According to police, the video shows the rear/side parking lot of 585 Revere Beach Parkway.

Ferreira is quickly placed in handcuffs after getting out of the car and is led to another car off-camera.

The agents drive away from the scene, including one who gets into Ferreira's car and drives off.

Ferreira migrated with her family to the United States from Brazil as a child, coming to the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-era program that shielded immigrants brought to the country from deportation.

She was awaiting the last step in the green card application process when ICE arrested her.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson released the following statement on Ferreira's arrest:

""ICE arrested Bruna Caroline Ferreria, a criminal illegal alien from Brazil. She has a previous arrest for battery. She entered the U.S. on a B2 tourist visa that required her to depart the U.S. by June 6, 1999,"" the statement read. ""She is currently at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center and is in removal proceedings. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, all individuals unlawfully present in the United States are subject to deportation.”

According to a statement provided to WCVB from a source familiar with the matter, Karoline Leavitt has not spoken to Ferreira in many years:

""This individual is the mother of Karoline’s nephew and they have not spoken in many years. The child has lived full-time in New Hampshire with his father since he was born. He has never resided with his mother.""

Michael Leavitt, Karoline Leavitt's brother, also released a statement in November, saying that his ""only concern has always been the safety, well-being, and privacy of [his] son.""

In a conversation with WCVB-TV sister station WMUR-TV, Michael Leavitt, a New Hampshire resident, said that his son lives with him and his wife full-time, but that Ferreira has maintained a relationship with her son.","https://kubrick.htvapps.com/htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/images/news-2-go-thumbs-2025-11-25t224836-361-692678b49e14f.png?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",N,,2025-12-03 21:57:50.751105

Since last week’s deadly shooting, the administration has rolled out the most sweeping set of policy changes yet to curtail legal immigration.
What is the state of the U.S. refugee program?
Why hasn’t there been any immigration program reform?","President Trump was elected in part because of his promise to overhaul immigration in America, cracking down on people who cross the border illegally and ramping up deportations across the country.

Nearly a year into his first term, his overhaul has been swift and dramatic, reshaping American families and communities. In the past week, after the shooting of two National Guard troops by an asylum recipient from Afghanistan, Trump’s crackdown on legal immigration pathways has escalated further.

Earlier this year, I asked for your questions about immigration, and you had hundreds. Today, I’m bringing you up-to-date answers from colleagues who cover immigration and more from all over the country — and the world.

Is seeking asylum no longer applicable when entering the U.S.? — Maureen Mercury, Palm Desert, Calif.

Hamed Aleaziz, who covers federal immigration policy, says:

On the first day of his presidency, President Trump moved to reduce access to asylum by barring migrants who crossed the border illegally from being eligible for it. The order was challenged in court, and it has been partially blocked.

But Trump went even further this past week by pausing all asylum applications filed by migrants inside the U.S. with the Department of Homeland Security. As of June, the agency had more than 1.5 million pending asylum applications.

The remaining way for people to get asylum is in immigration court — during deportation proceedings.

Exactly what is “the legal process” to become a citizen? — Fran Fischer, Schenectady, N.Y.

Madeleine Ngo, who covers immigration and economic policy, and Jazmine Ulloa, a New York-based immigration reporter, explain:

The process of applying for U.S. citizenship has for years been long and involved several steps, including an application, background checks, tests and an interview. One must first establish legal residency for a time, through visas, green cards or other forms of immigration relief that in themselves can be difficult to obtain.

This year, the Trump administration has further narrowed the path for legal immigration in different and significant ways. It created a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visas, which are granted to skilled foreign workers. And it’s harder now to become a U.S. citizen.

The administration has reinstated a more difficult civics test and stepped up social media vetting for people applying to naturalize. Immigration officers have also been directed to check for more “positive attributes,” like family caregiving and stable employment.

Since last week’s deadly shooting, the administration has rolled out the most sweeping set of policy changes yet to curtail legal immigration. It has barred Afghans from entering the country, and paused all immigration applications filed by immigrants from 19 countries, mostly from the Middle East or Africa, that it restricted from travel to the United States earlier this year. That’s in addition to the pause on asylum decisions that Hamed mentioned above.

That has resulted in canceled citizenship ceremonies and interviews for immigration status, and immigration lawyers have been left puzzled as their clients have been turned away from appointments for green cards and other forms of relief with no explanation. The changes, lawyers say, are also likely to further delay the path to citizenship for people in an already backlogged system.

What is the state of the U.S. refugee program? How many legal refugees have been deported? Other than the white South Africans, have any other refugees been granted entry? Where did the appropriated funds go that were promised, but rescinded, for refugee resettlement? — Marsha Campbell, Kansas City, Mo.

Zolan Kanno-Youngs, who covers the White House, tells us:

The Trump administration has drastically shrunk the U.S. refugee program designed to help those fleeing war and persecution across the globe. Applicants for the refugee program often wait years overseas before they are vetted to travel to the United States.

In October, the administration lowered the ceiling of refugee admissions to just 7,500 for the fiscal year that started that month, down from the cap of 125,000 set by the Biden administration last year. The administration is prioritizing those limited slots mostly for white Afrikaner South Africans, who once ran South Africa’s brutal apartheid system.

Almost every other refugee in the world faces a ban after Trump signed an executive order when he came into office freezing the program.

There have been limited exceptions. According to documents obtained by The New York Times, federal agencies worked this year to resettle a limited number of Afghans who helped U.S. soldiers during the war. But that will also probably stop after Trump’s recent crackdown on Afghans.

The administration is also considering other changes to the refugee program, including overhauling it to give preference to English-speaking applicants, like Europeans who have been “targeted for peaceful expression of views online such as opposition to mass migration or support for ‘populist’ political parties.” Those proposals have not yet been finalized.

As for the funding: According to a congressional staff member who was briefed on the refugee program and insisted on anonymity, at least some of the money for the program is available for three years, and some of it is most likely still being used on the limited number of Afrikaners resettled into the U.S.

When an immigrant is deported and sent somewhere other than their native country (for example to Uganda rather than El Salvador), what happens to them? — Angela Mack, Branford, Conn.

Julie Turkewitz, our Bogotá-based Andes bureau chief, writes:

Since taking office, the Trump administration has used the threat of being sent to a far-flung nation to try to deter illegal migration, and officials have sent hundreds of people to places that are not their native lands.

Receiving countries have included Panama and El Salvador in Latin America, and Eswatini in Africa.

A group of about 300 sent to Panama were locked in a hotel in Panama City, then in a jungle-side detention camp, before being freed. Some agreed to return to their home countries, while others were granted temporary legal status in Panama.

A group of more than 200 Venezuelan men sent to El Salvador spent four months in a maximum-security prison, and dozens of them later told The Times that they had experienced systematic abuse on the inside. Independent forensic experts told reporters that much of the abuse described met the United Nations definition of torture.

In July, the men were sent back to Venezuela. Many are living at home in Venezuela, according to interviews with The Times, while a small group was detained by the Venezuelan government, which has declined to comment on their whereabouts.

In other cases, like in Eswatini, migrants have also been detained in third countries before ultimately being sent home.

Why are ICE agents allowed to cover their faces when they are arresting people? How is that legal? — Susan F., Beacon, N.Y.

Sabrina Tavernise, a writer-at-large on American politics, says:

It is extremely unusual for law enforcement to wear masks in stable democracies, as I wrote this year. It also goes against the direction of things in the U.S., where police departments have been adopting more transparency, with tools like body cameras. But it is not technically illegal, and federal immigration officials say it’s necessary to prevent immigration officers from being doxxed.

However, a number of blue states and municipalities, including California, have been passing or proposing laws against it (as red states have done against mask-wearing by protesters). It is not yet clear how courts will respond.

Many industries including agriculture, building and hospitality rely on immigrant labor in the United States. Why hasn’t there been any immigration program reform? — Jim Russell, Ore.

Here’s Jennifer Medina, who covers national politics:

To put it simply: There’s been a lack of political will.

It has been nearly four decades — dating to the Reagan administration — since Congress passed a major immigration overhaul meant to both give legal status to the millions of immigrants then living illegally in the United States, while stopping any new flows of unauthorized immigration. In reality, the bill did little to stem the tide, and conservatives now often deride it as “amnesty.”

The backlash to that bill has shaped the immigration debate ever since, with Republicans demanding more and more restrictions before agreeing to relief for the roughly 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The closest Washington has come to passing any major reform came in the first Obama administration, but a compromise bill passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate ultimately stalled in the Republican-controlled House.

Many business leaders, especially in agriculture, have pressed Republicans for some legal pathway to allow more immigrants to work in this country. Their demands for a legislative fix have been rebuffed by the Trump administration, although the president earlier this year directed his administration to ease enforcement in the hospitality and agriculture sectors.

Finally, many readers asked how the deportation of immigrants working in low-wage jobs has affected American businesses and the economy. Has it led to a labor crunch?

I brought that question to Lydia DePillis, who covers the American economy:

You’re right that many of those deported — currently up to 527,000, according to the Department of Homeland Security — work in typically low-wage industries. Undocumented immigrants are most concentrated in landscaping, domestic work, janitorial services, agriculture, meatpacking and construction.

It’s hard to know exactly how this is showing up in the labor market, particularly because so much of the data we would typically rely on has been delayed by the government shutdown. But so far, with a few isolated exceptions, deportations do not appear to have caused acute labor shortages because demand for those services has also been depressed. To the extent that employers are replacing their deported workers, they are most likely doing so with other immigrants who have similar skill sets.

Wages do not appear to be rising as a result. Pay for workers at the bottom of the income spectrum has fallen well behind high earners over the past year.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/03/multimedia/newsletter-1-bhzc/newsletter-1-bhzc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 21:57:03.815853

ICE detained the man as he was driving his kids home, which is just steps from 24 Mall.","Minneapolis resident Naley Abdulle was driving across town when she heard over the phone that her brother had been arrested outside the family’s home Tuesday morning.

Her brother, Omar Abdulle, had just left the snow-covered walk to his car when authorities rushed in and apprehended him.

Omar, a father of two young children, is one of several Minnesotans detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) this week as part of an immigration crackdown, following a series of social media posts and public statements by President Donald Trump attacking the state’s Somali community.

Family members and immigrant advocates report a series of actions across the Twin Cities, with federal agents appearing outside homes, showing up in cars with Uber stickers, knocking on doors in the immigrant-dense Cedar-Riverside towers in Minneapolis, and targeting local Somali malls and a Latino day laborer spot.

On Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey signed an order prohibiting federal and local agencies from staging civil immigration operations from city-owned lots, ramps or garages.

“City parking lots need to be used for City purposes, which do not include civil immigration enforcement,” Frey said in a news release. “There’s no place in our Minneapolis for fear-based tactics or operations that undermine community trust.”

About a dozen elected officials gathered at the Brian Coyle Center in Cedar-Riverside, a community center in a hub for East African communities, to mobilize efforts in responding to ICE arrests and show support for the Somali community.

“He [Trump] can start with us, but it will not end with us,” state Sen. Zaynab Mohamed said. “We are a nation of immigrants and of rights, but only if we are brave enough to defend it.”

She also said that ICE is not notifying elected officials of arrests ahead of time. An ICE spokesperson said Wednesday that the agency had no further comment.

Several speakers, including state Rep. Aisha Gomez, Rep. Mohamud Noor, Sen. Omar Fateh and Minneapolis Council Member Jamal Osman highlighted the chaos of the past few days, as multiple calls and social media posts report ICE officers in vehicles making seemingly random arrests — including stopping two Somali U.S. citizens Tuesday.

The total number of arrests over the past few days is still unclear, said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations. Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee member Erika Zurawski told Sahan Journal that their organization has heard of at least five individuals arrested Monday and Tuesday.

Minneapolis elected officials also emphasized the importance of sharing information about protecting the rights of immigrants and documenting ICE enforcement activity. More information to inform immigrants of their rights is available in Somali at the link here.

Amiin Harun, an immigration attorney in Minneapolis, said the increased ICE presence in the Twin Cities doesn’t have a clear target and seems to be about more than normal immigration enforcement.

Only about 4,200 of the more than 80,000 Somalis living in Minnesota are not U.S. citizens, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Many of those 4,200 are green-card holders.

Harun said he has heard of ICE targeting Somalis with pending asylum or Temporary Protected Status applications, or without any legal status. Those with pending applications are known to ICE and usually are required to routinely check in with immigration officials. If the administration has decided to deny those people status, it would be easy to bring them in, Harun said.

“What’s happening in Minneapolis seems to be more creating fear and creating chaos,” Harun said.

Members of the Somali community are calling his office for advice, he said. People are afraid of going out to shop, eat and worship. He spoke with a man who was approached by ICE as he left his apartment building for work this week.

“They seem to be targeting anybody who looks to them to be a Somali person,” Harun said.

For the small number of Somalis living in the United States with a final order of removal, it’s unclear where they would be deported. Conditions in Somalia remain bleak, Harun said, and families fear that relatives could be deported to a third country where they have no ties.

On Wednesday, elected officials and Somali immigrants crowded in a room at the St. Cloud Public Library in a news conference to stand together against the ICE operation.

“We feel we are targeted unfairly,” said Abdi Ibrahim, director of programs at the Center for African Immigrants and Refugees Organization that serves many Somali Minnesotans in St. Cloud.

A neighborhood under lockdown

In an interview with Sahan Journal, Amano Dube, the director of Pillsbury United Communities’ Brian Coyle Center, which oversees multiple programs, said he had received reports that Tuesday night, ICE agents entered the C Building at Cedar-Riverside. They knocked on doors, but no one answered.

“This is not about catching illegals or criminals, but about targeting an entire community. Somali people are resilient; they will come back from this stronger than before,” Dube said.

An employee at a nearby Somali restaurant, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisal, said ICE agents detained one person in the F building parking lot this morning, but after learning he was a U.S. citizen, he was released.

The employee also said that another person was arrested in the same parking lot last night around 11 p.m.

Dube said that in the past 48 hours, since ICE agents were spotted in Cedar-Riverside, the entire neighborhood has been under lockdown due to fear of being detained.

“The truth is, ICE said they are looking for Somali illegals and criminals, but they are snatching everyone, whether they are Somali, Ethiopian, Eritrean, or Oromo, because they don’t know the difference,” he said.

Dube said people in the community are afraid to leave their homes and go about their daily routines.

Bump in immigration enforcement

At a Tuesday afternoon news conference, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Minneapolis police received increased reports of federal immigration enforcement actions over the weekend and into the week.

One such incident came Monday evening near the Somali 24 Mall in south Minneapolis. There, Kali Mohamed was among many who witnessed multiple ICE agents arrest a Latino man from his car.

Mohamed, a policy aide for Council Member Jamal Osman, said he witnessed the ICE arrest as he was on his way with a friend to 24 Mall, which has lived near for nearly two decades.

“I’m here literally every single day,” Mohamed said of 24 Mall. “I came home from work and was just trying to grab a cup of tea.”

As they were walking to the 24 Mall entrance, Mohamed and his friend heard a commotion. Mohamed’s friend took out his phone and started filming.

The video starts right after the officers detained the man. Mohamed said the officers identified themselves as ICE agents doing immigration enforcement.

At the start of the video, a girl is heard crying for her dad. Two armed law enforcement officers are walking in the middle of the street next to an abandoned sedan with the driver’s door open. One of the masked officers shines a flashlight near the person filming the video. Later on, one of the officers is seen entering a black SUV with a displayed Uber sign on the windshield.

ICE detained the man as he was driving his kids home, which is just steps from 24 Mall. After they detained him, the agents left the man’s car idling in the middle of the street. Mohamed said a bystander later parked the car.

Mohamed and his friend went into the family’s home and tried to console the mother and children. One of the kids was a baby who wasn’t more than 4 or 5 months old, Mohamed said.

Mohamed ended up calling Council Member Jason Chavez, who came over, interpreted for the family and helped connect them to legal resources.

“We said, ‘If ICE comes back, don’t open the door,’” Mohamed said.

‘Stop taking people’

From her south Minneapolis home on Wednesday afternoon, Naley filled in the picture of her younger brother, who is now in detention at Freeborn County Jail in Albert Lea.

Naley lives with her husband and their seven children. After the arrest, she said her children were afraid to attend school or go to work. She worries about her brother, she said, especially because he needs medication for high blood sugar.

Omar has a pregnant wife and a 6-month-old baby in Rochester, but he sometimes stays with her in Minneapolis because of his job. “My brother is a good man,” she said, “He is a hard worker and he came here to find peace.”

“Please Donald Trump, stop taking people,” she said. “Stop taking human beings like you, we needed to save our lives and that’s why we’re here.”",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ICECommunityResponse_12-3-06697.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 21:57:55.167894

Act 399, which makes interfering with immigration enforcement operations an obstruction of justice, took effect August 1.
“Individuals who interfere with ICE, Border Patrol, or assault law enforcement are committing a State crime and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” she said in a release Wednesday.
“There are lots of cases which support the constitutionality of laws that restrict people from inhibiting law enforcement from doing their jobs.” he said.
Ahead of the sweep, Helena Moreno, New Orleans’ Democratic mayor elect, put out a webpage advising immigrants about how to handle encounters with immigration enforcement officers.","A new state law against interfering with immigration officers is so broadly written that it violates the First Amendment by limiting free speech, the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana argues in a new lawsuit.

Filed as immigration officers descend on southeast Louisiana for an operation dubbed “Catahoula Crunch,” the lawsuit, now pending in federal court in the Eastern District of Louisiana, targets Act 399. That law, by state Sen. Jay Morris, R-West Monroe, makes it a crime to “knowingly commit any act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts.” The lawsuit also names Attorney General Liz Murrill, who has publicized the law ahead of the Border Patrol’s arrival in New Orleans.

Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy, or ISLA, the main plaintiff in the lawsuit, is a New Orleans-based organization that offers legal help to immigrants in Louisiana. In November, it stopped offering “Know Your Rights” workshops to immigrants because it feared doing so would violate Act 399, the lawsuit says.

“ISLA wishes to advise people about the rights of immigrants during Operation Swamp Sweep, but the newly added language included in Act 399 makes doing so without legal assurances virtually impossible,” attorneys for the ACLU wrote, using an earlier name for the immigration crackdown in New Orleans.

The lawsuit asks the court to declare that the law violates the First Amendment, and to block the state from enforcing it against ISLA. It also alleges the law violates the Fourteenth Amendment because it is overly vague.

“I have not received service of process of this complaint apparently filed today,” Murrill said in a statement Wednesday. “Our law is constitutional and we look forward to defending it in court.""

Act 399, which makes interfering with immigration enforcement operations an obstruction of justice, took effect August 1. People who break the law face up to six months in prison if the offense involves an official act of a government agent, and up to one year in prison if it involves a civil immigration proceeding. They could also face up to $5,000 in fines.

Murrill has repeatedly warned the public against breaking the law during the roll-out of the Catahoula Crunch operation.

“Individuals who interfere with ICE, Border Patrol, or assault law enforcement are committing a State crime and will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law,” she said in a release Wednesday.

In the past, ISLA has used Know Your Rights workshops to inform immigrants that they can demand warrant signed by a judge if ICE appears at their homes, and that they may film ICE arrests, the ACLU’s lawyers wrote.

ISLA those educational activities around Nov. 18, after news broke that the Border Patrol would be leading an immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and Mississippi, the lawsuit says.

""The ability to challenge government action without facing arrest is what separates a free nation from a police state,"" said Alanah Odoms, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana. ""Louisiana is choosing the police state. We're going to court to protect every Louisianan's First Amendment right to speak truth to power.""

Morris, who authored Act 399, said he believes it will hold up in court.

“There are lots of cases which support the constitutionality of laws that restrict people from inhibiting law enforcement from doing their jobs.” he said.

Catahoula Crunch follows Border Patrol-led operations in Chicago and North Carolina that drew backlash over the tactics federal agents used. In Chicago, federal agents tackled protesters, shot pepper balls at the heads of journalists and clergy members, used tear gas and rubber bullets without warning, and laughed as a protester’s ear bled, a federal judge wrote in a scathing review of those tactics informed by body camera footage.

Greg Bovino, who heads the Border Patrol, has said the agency is protecting officers from threats they received after arriving in Chicago.

In Louisiana, 250 Border Patrol agents plan to detain at least 5,000 people across a region stretching from Baton Rouge to Mississippi, according to internal documents reported last month by The Associated Press.

Ahead of the sweep, Helena Moreno, New Orleans’ Democratic mayor elect, put out a webpage advising immigrants about how to handle encounters with immigration enforcement officers.

“Be aware, Officers must have a warrant signed by a judge to enter your home,” the page says. “ICE ‘warrants’ are not signed by judges; they are ICE forms signed by ICE officers and they do not grant authority to enter a home without consent of the occupant(s).”

The page also says undocumented immigrants have the right to remain silent, but that anyone stopped by an immigration law enforcement agent should not run, argue with, resist or fight the officer.

Louisiana’s Act 399 also expanded the definition of malfeasance in office, making it a crime if a public official or employee “takes any official action, fails to perform an official duty, or refuses a lawful request for cooperation” from federal immigration authorities “with the intent to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere, ignore, or thwart federal immigration enforcement efforts.”

Nor can state or local law enforcement release people they know “illegally entered or unlawfully remained in the United States” without giving advance notice to ICE.

Either of those actions would carry a penalty of up to 10 years in prison.

The law conflicts with a 12-year-old settlement that bars the Orleans Parish Sheriff’s Office from holding some detainees past their release dates in order to help federal immigration authorities. Under the agreement, deputies may not heed ICE detainer requests unless a person was charged with murder, aggravated rape, aggravated kidnapping, armed robbery with a firearm or treason.

""Our city of Gresham is under attack, federal agents are carrying out violent sweeps against innocent people,"" said Ana Munoz, during public testimony. ""They are not targeting criminals, they are targeting our neighbors, our co-workers, our family, our friends.""

Others testified that people in Gresham have rearranged their lives hoping to avoid being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

""This is a crisis,"" testified Raquel Barajas. ""Businesses are losing, families are being torn apart, and children are scared to go to school.""

Gresham City Council members listened as one after the other, community members urged the city to declare a state of emergency. The cities of Hillsboro, Forest Grove, Salem, Cornelius, and Woodburn have all recently declared states of emergency.

In Gresham, community members said they hoped doing so would allow the city to direct funds to nonprofits that could help community members in crisis.

Gresham's council did not vote on the issue Tuesday night since it wasn't on the agenda but said they would discuss it in the coming weeks. They also released a statement that read, in part:

""We understand this is an important issue for many of our residents, and want to assure them that their safety and wellbeing remain our top priority. while council considers feedback from the community, we will continue to relay the concerns of our residents to our federal elected representatives and their staffs.""

A DHS spokesperson said via email that fraud prevention will “ensure that those who are most vulnerable can receive the services they need.
The Minnesota Disability Law Center has also been helping several clients neglected by DHS after being cut off from services.
Wilson confirmed that a notice from DHS sent to an ICS provider stated that DHS couldn’t give any detail into why payments to that provider were being withheld exactly.
“Our clients are not hearing from DHS at all, so they’re just confused and don’t understand what’s happening,” she said.","The Minnesota Department of Human Services’ effort to quash fraud has led to a new problem: Disabled Medicaid recipients aren’t getting the services they need and are legally entitled to, according to attorneys for the disabled.

Most affected thus far: People who receive Integrated Community Support services, or ICS, which help people with disabilities live independently in the community rather than in an institution.

The ICS program also helps Minnesota stay in compliance with the law, as set forth in the U.S. Supreme Court case Olmstead v. LC, which ruled that the unnecessary segregation of people with disabilities from their community is a form of discrimination.

Attorneys for people with disabilities say their clients are being cut off from ICS following DHS’s suspension of payments to ICS providers in an effort to crack down on fraud that has riddled some other programs. A Minnesota Disability Law Center client with bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, PTSD and ADHD was receiving laundry, cleaning and check-in services from her ICS provider for six months before her services were abruptly suspended in October from DHS’s payment pause.

“There was no real transition; they just stopped providing the services,” said Chad Wilson, an attorney for the Minnesota Disability Law Center.

A DHS spokesperson said via email that fraud prevention will “ensure that those who are most vulnerable can receive the services they need. We acknowledge these same efforts can cause confusion or worry, especially if a recipient experiences a disruption in services.”*

Fraud in Minnesota’s human services has become a high-profile political issue, recently drawing attention from President Donald Trump, who used the issue to attack Minnesota’s Somali-American community. Following federal charges against dozens of people alleging they defrauded a child nutrition program, an autism treatment program and Housing Stabilization Services, DHS moved to address fraud in other services, turning its attention to pausing payments in ICS starting in September and implementing a prepayment review process for 14 programs, including ICS, starting in December.

But DHS has gone too far and is now hurting people who need help, the attorneys say.

Brianna Boone is an attorney at the Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services, an organization which represents multiple ICS recipients who’ve been cut off from services without clear guidance from DHS on how to proceed.

“Due process is the main thing I want. DHS should at least be explaining and notifying recipients about what is going on,” Boone said.

The Minnesota Disability Law Center has also been helping several clients neglected by DHS after being cut off from services. Wilson said that one of his clients didn’t receive clear information from DHS on how to get a new provider after the client’s provider was put under investigation in September.

Providers affected by the September ICS payment pause have not yet been told by DHS why their services were flagged as suspicious, according to Josh Berg, director of services at Accessible Space, a disability services provider. While his organization was not flagged, Berg said he has spoken to providers who were. Wilson confirmed that a notice from DHS sent to an ICS provider stated that DHS couldn’t give any detail into why payments to that provider were being withheld exactly.

In a November statement, DHS Inspector General James Clark said that DHS’s investigations “have uncovered credible allegations that providers have repeatedly billed us for services that have not been provided. They are putting peoples’ health and safety at risk and that is unacceptable.”

The DHS spokesperson said in email that the pause in payments does not prevent providers from continuing services — though they’d be doing so without getting paid while DHS investigates. DHS informs providers with paused payments that they are responsible for transitioning recipients to other care; additionally, DHS deploys regional specialists to make sure recipients get the care they need, the spokesperson said in the email.

In Boone’s view, DHS is not doing enough to notify recipients about what’s happening or provide assistance to transfer providers; instead, she said, DHS is relying on providers and case managers to pass along information to clients.

“Our clients are not hearing from DHS at all, so they’re just confused and don’t understand what’s happening,” she said.

""You told me to look into Minnesota and their fraud on visas and their programs — 50% of them are fraudulent, which means that that wacko Governor Walz either is an idiot or he did it on purpose,"" Noem said during President Trump's last cabinet meeting of the year.

Noem did not provide evidence. CBS Minnesota on Wednesday reached out to the department seeking that data and also more information about the process for investigating allegations of fraud for visas. A spokesperson has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Ana Pottraz Acosta, visiting professor at the Immigration and Human Rights Clinic at the University of Minnesota Law School, said the 50% figure ""doesn't sound plausible"" based on her two decades of experience as an immigration attorney.

""I think before giving any credence to those numbers, I really would want to see more specific data from the Department of Homeland Security to substantiate those allegations because they're very, very serious and really should not be made unless there is data or information to back up those claims,"" she said.

Acosta added that the rate of immigration fraud is relatively low overall because the penalties for doing so are serious.

""If you file an application that is fraudulent, it results in a bar for you being able to get any other immigration benefits in the future,"" she explained. ""And marriage fraud in particular, the government is pretty skeptical of people who marry a U.S. citizen, so the burden is on you to present a lot of evidence to establish that you do have a bona fide relationship.""

In September, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced an operation in the Twin Cities looking at 1,000 cases of potential immigration fraud. Those investigations yielded 42 referrals to U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement and just four for arrest, which is roughly 0.5% of those cases.

Noem also accused DFL Gov. Tim Walz of possibly allowing fraudulent visas. In a statement to WCCO, the governor's office pointed out that states don't handle immigration cases.

The Wisconsin Supreme Court has agreed to hear a lawsuit challenging five Wisconsin sheriffs’ practices of holding detainees in their jail for handoffs to ICE.

The ACLU filed the lawsuit in September on behalf of the immigrant rights group Voces de la Frontera. It names sheriff’s offices in Brown, Kenosha, Marathon, Sauk and Walworth counties as respondents.

All five sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers — nonbinding requests that a law enforcement agency assist ICE in taking custody of a person suspected of being in the country illegally by holding an inmate in a jail up to 48 hours past the person’s scheduled release. The local law enforcement agency can then pass the detainee directly to ICE officers.

The lawsuit argues that the detainers qualify as an arrest and that state statutes prohibit law enforcement agencies from making arrests based on ICE’s administrative warrants.

While most Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices honor ICE detainers, the lawsuit claims that five named offices received roughly a quarter of all detainers issued to Wisconsin sheriffs’ offices between January and July of this year.

The sheriff’s offices have differing relationships with ICE. Brown and Sauk counties, for instance, also contract with ICE to hold immigrant detainees in their jails, meaning a person could remain in the same jail after entering ICE custody. Kenosha County has no such contract, but it does participate in a federal grant program that partially reimburses local law enforcement agencies for incarceration costs in exchange for data on undocumented inmates.

ICE records list more than 130 arrests at county jails in Wisconsin between January and July of this year. Nearly 40% of those arrested were awaiting a ruling in their first criminal case.

In its initial petition, Voces de la Frontera urged the Supreme Court to immediately take up the case as a statewide concern. The court’s order, published on Wednesday afternoon, allows the plaintiffs to skip the lower courts entirely.

Liberal justices have a 4-3 majority on the court. At least four unnamed justices voted to immediately accept the case. Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley, both conservatives, dissented. Justice Brian Hagedorn, who often votes with conservatives, discussed the process in an opinion that did not specify his vote.

“When this court grants review in a case, we almost always let our grant order proceed without comment or dissent,” he wrote, later adding: “Even if some of my colleagues publicly record their dissent, as in this case, that does not necessarily reveal which justices voted for or against the petition in closed conference.”

Voces de la Frontera has 30 days to file a brief in the case. The court has not yet scheduled oral arguments in the case.

None of the five sheriffs’ offices named in the lawsuit immediately responded to requests for comment.

“We are reviewing the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s order and evaluating our next steps in this litigation,” Milwaukee attorney Sam Hall, who is representing all five sheriffs, wrote in an email Wednesday evening. “We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement.”",https://i0.wp.com/wisconsinwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/asse6560894.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&quality=100&ssl=1,N,,2025-12-03 20:56:39.898241

Mr. Trump has seized on immigration as a potent political weapon, demonizing immigrants and equating them with crime and disease.","Somalia’s leader said Wednesday that it was “better not to respond” a day after President Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage” during a xenophobic tirade.

“We are not the only country that Trump insults,” Prime Minister Hamza Abdi Barre told an audience at an innovation summit in Mogadishu, the Somali capital, in response to a question about Mr. Trump’s comments, according to video published by Shabelle TV, a local media network. “Sometimes it’s better not to respond,” he said.

Somalia, a nation of 19 million people in the Horn of Africa, has long regarded the United States as a key ally in the fight against the Al Shabab terrorist group. Though the Trump administration has slashed foreign aid budgets in recent months, the United States gave around $128 million to Somalia in the 2025 fiscal year.

But on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the country “stinks” and that he did not want Somali immigrants in the United States. “We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting at the White House.

Anwar Abdifatah Bashir, the executive director for the East African Institute for Peace and Governance, described Mr. Trump’s comments as “naked insults,” but said the Somali government was unlikely to criticize the Trump administration because it still provides Somalia with some financial support.

The Trump administration dismantled the United States Agency for International Development earlier this year, cutting off vast sums of foreign assistance to the world’s poorest countries, including Somalia. Many Somalis are still struggling with the dire humanitarian crisis that followed years of severe drought, which killed at least 43,000 people there in 2022 alone, and heavy rains and floods in 2023.

“If they keep silent, they are indirectly subscribing to his bombastic and hyperbolic rhetoric,” said Mr. Bashir.

Mr. Trump has used such rhetoric throughout his rise in politics, including in his first term as president, when he demanded to know why the United States would accept immigrants from Haiti and African nations, which he described as “shithole countries,” rather than, say, Norway.

But he has long been especially focused on Somalis in the United States, and in particular, on Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who came to the United States from Somalia as a refugee and became a citizen 25 years ago.

Somalis began migrating to Minnesota in large numbers as the East African nation descended into civil war in the mid-1990s. There are about 79,400 Somalis in the state, of whom just over half were foreign-born, according to recent data from Minnesota Compass, a research group in the state.

Immigrant activists and local officials say that the vast majority of Minnesotans with Somali roots are American citizens or legal permanent residents. Nationally, about 73 percent of Somali immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the Census Bureau.

Mr. Trump has seized on immigration as a potent political weapon, demonizing immigrants and equating them with crime and disease. In a social media post on Thursday night, Mr. Trump claimed that Somalis were “taking over” Minnesota and that Somali gangs were “roving the streets looking for ‘prey.’”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/03/multimedia/03int-somalia-trump-reaction-01-chjl/03int-somalia-trump-reaction-01-chjl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 21:57:08.249359

Trump, a Republican, said in a social media post that Cuellar “bravely spoke out against Open Borders” and accused Biden, a Democrat, of going after the congressman and his wife “for speaking the TRUTH.”

Federal authorities had charged Cuellar and his wife with accepting thousands of dollars in exchange for the congressman advancing the interests of an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. Cuellar is accused of agreeing to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House.

Cuellar has said he and his wife are innocent. The couple’s trial had been set to begin next April.

“Henry, I don’t know you, but you can sleep well tonight,” Trump wrote in his social media post announcing the pardon. “Your nightmare is finally over!”

Cuellar thanks Trump for the pardon

Cuellar, who spoke to reporters outside his congressional office on Wednesday, thanked Trump in a brief statement.

“I think the facts have been clear about this, but I would also say I want to thank God for standing during this very difficult time with my family and I,” he said. “Now we can get back to work. Nothing has changed. We will continue working hard.”

Cuellar was asked if he was changing parties and said, “No, like I said, nothing has changed.”

A spokesperson for Biden did not respond to messages seeking comment.

The U.S. Constitution gives the president broad power to grand pardons for federal crimes. The pardons don’t erase a recipient’s criminal record but can be seen as act of mercy or justice, often in cases that further public welfare.

Trump’s pardons this year have included a string of unlikely beneficiaries who are boldfaced names and frequently politically aligned with the president. He pardoned dozens of Republicans accused of participating in his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. He gave clemency to all of 1,500-plus people charged in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He’s also pardoned a former Republican governor of Connecticut, an ex-GOP congressman and reality TV stars who had been convicted of cheating banks and evading taxes.

In addition to Cuellar, Trump on Wednesday also pardoned Timothy J. Leiweke, a veteran of the sports and entertainment industry who co-founded Oak View Group.

Leiweke was indicted in July — by Trump’s own Justice Department — for, as federal prosecutors put it at the time, “Orchestrating a conspiracy to rig the bidding process” for a university arena in Austin, Texas. Leiweke had pled not guilty but received what Trump called “a full and conditional pardon” in a clemency statement that didn’t include details on why the president was reversing the case.

Cuellar’s daughters sought a pardon for him

In Trump’s social media post, he included a copy of a letter that Cuellar’s two daughters, Christina and Catherine, had sent to him on Nov. 12 asking that he pardon their parents.

“When you and your family faced your own challenges, we understood that pain in a very human way,” Cuellar’s daughters wrote in their letter. “We watched from afar through the eyes of daughters who knew what it felt like to see parents under fire.”

Cuellar later told reporters, “I know that my daughters sent a letter, but letters are sent not knowing what’s going to happen on that.”

One of Henry Cuellar’s lawyers, Eric Reed, said Wednesday that his legal team made a “pretty substantive presentation” to the Justice Department several months ago seeking dismissal of the charges. He declined to comment on what specifically Cuellar’s legal team discussed with the department but said the arguments made were not political in nature.

In a statement, Imelda Cuellar’s lawyers said Wednesday they were gratified by Trump’s pardon of their client.

“She has always maintained her innocence,” the statement said.

Henry Cuellar still faces an Ethics Committee investigation in the House. It began in May 2024 shortly after his indictment and was reauthorized in July. The committee said it was in contact with the Justice Department about mitigating the risks associated with dual investigations while still meeting its obligations to safeguard the integrity of the House.

Cuellar, who has served in Congress for more than 20 years, is a moderate Democrat who represents an area on the Texas-Mexico border and has a history of breaking with his party when it comes to immigration and firearms.

He was among the most vocal critics of the Biden administration’s response to a record number of migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. He also is one of the last Democrats in Congress who opposes abortion rights.

Trump was asked later Wednesday by a reporter if he spoke with GOP leaders in the House about pardoning the Democratic congressman and if there were any concerns it might strengthen Cuellar’s prospects next year.

Trump said, “It didn’t matter” and that Cuellar was targeted for his comments critical of immigration.

“He represents the people on the border and he saw what was happening,” Trump said

The Democrat earlier Wednesday filed to run for reelection.

Cuellar is not the only Democrat Trump has pardoned this year. February, he pardoned former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, five years after he had commuted his sentence in a political corruption case.

Like in Cuellar’s case, Trump suggested that New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat, faced federal corruption charges because he made comments critical of Biden’s immigration policies.

Trump did not pardon Adams, but after Trump took office, the Justice Department moved to drop the case against the mayor, who had begun working with the Republican administration on immigration issues.

A top Justice Department official, who was also Trump’s defense lawyer in several of his cases, stepped in to seek dismissal in the case.

Trump Administration Using Punitive Fees as a Pretext to Deport Vulnerable Children

View Video from the Press Conference Here(link is external)

WASHINGTON, D.C. – Congressman Dan Goldman (NY-10), Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), and Congresswoman Delia Ramirez (IL-03) introduced the Upholding Protections for Unaccompanied Children Act today, new bicameral legislation that reverses punitive provisions in the Big Beautiful Bill that threaten the safety and legal rights of unaccompanied children seeking refuge in the United States.

“Republicans turned their billionaire tax giveaway into a weapon against the most vulnerable children on earth,” Congressman Dan Goldman said. “Kids who have fled trafficking and abuse should not be forced to pay thousands of dollars just to ask our government for safety. Our bill restores basic decency, repeals these cruel fees, and protects children from being rushed back into danger without due process. Protecting unaccompanied children has always been bipartisan and it is our moral and legal duty to ensure it remains that way.”

Senator Cortez Masto said, “As members of Congress, it’s our duty to stand up for those who can’t stand up for themselves. That includes the unaccompanied children who come to the United States after escaping trafficking and abuse. It’s essential that we reverse the Republican tax law’s cruel provisions and protect these kids.”

Congresswoman Delia Ramirez said, ""The Trump Administration and Republicans have made it clear that all immigrants, even immigrant children, are targets in their mass detention-for-profit scheme. As they infused over $150B taxpayer dollars into their fascist agenda, they simultaneously stripped unaccompanied children seeking asylum of essential protections. Instead of care and safety, unaccompanied children are now met with more trauma, pain, and uncertainty. We must ensure the safety and guarantee due process for unaccompanied children and that is why I am a proud co-lead of the Upholding Protections for Unaccompanied Children Act of 2025.""

Kind President Wendy Young said, “H.R. 1 severely undermines core protections and anti-trafficking safeguards for children who arrive in the United States alone. The new immigration fees and massive fee increases it imposes make seeking protection in the United States cost-prohibitive for children, and easier for traffickers to leverage debt to endanger children. Senator Cortez Masto and Representatives Dan Goldman and Delia Ramirez’s Upholding Protections for Unaccompanied Children Act is essential to ensuring that unaccompanied children are not denied access to protection because of cost.”

H.R.1’s unprecedented and exorbitant fees function as a financial wall that prevents children from seeking safety and exposes them to heightened risk of trafficking, exploitation, and deportation back into dangerous conditions. It imposes a new five-thousand-dollar Border Apprehension Fee on any child who arrives between ports of entry while fleeing violence or trafficking, a pathway that is often the only realistic option for children escaping imminent harm. It requires children to pay a mandatory asylum application fee, as well as new annual asylum maintenance fees for every year their case remains pending in the government’s years long backlog. It also increases basic immigration court fees from roughly 100 or 200 dollars to 900 dollars, placing essential motions and appeals far out of reach for children who need a fair chance to present their cases. Additionally, H.R. 1 provides funding for intrusive and traumatizing body examinations which threaten the safety and wellbeing of minors who are victims of abuse and trafficking. The bill also provides funding for summary deportations of unaccompanied children who have not been robustly screened for signs of trafficking or allowed a full review of their case before an immigration judge.

The Upholding Protections for Unaccompanied Children Act would:

Exempt unaccompanied children from all H.R. 1 fees tied to humanitarian protection, including asylum fees, annual maintenance fees, immigration court fees, and the $5,000 Border Apprehension Fee.

Eliminate H.R. 1’s fee on abandoned, abused, or neglected children applying for Special Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) Status.

Repeal the H.R. 1 provision funding summary returns of “specified unaccompanied children” without robust trafficking screenings or full review before an immigration judge.

Repeal H.R. 1 provisions funding intrusive and traumatizing body examinations of children in federal custody.

Prohibit the use of ORR funds to share children’s sponsor information with DHS for enforcement purposes, which deters safe family reunification and prolongs detention.

Congressman Goldman has made upholding the safety and well-being of vulnerable children navigating our immigration system a top priority since taking office.

This summer, Congressman Goldman led 77 of his colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to the House Appropriations Subcommittee to direct the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) to submit a report to Congress detailing the status of unaccompanied children’s immigration proceedings. The letter also asks the Committee to include language in its FY2026 report encouraging EOIR to continue using specialized juvenile dockets to improve fairness, efficiency, and child protection in immigration court proceedings.

Earlier this year, Goldman led 97 of his colleagues in sending a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum urging them to immediately reinstate legal services for over 26,000 unaccompanied migrant children in the United States.

Last Congress, Goldman, alongside Senator Michael Bennet (D-CO), Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Congresswoman Maria Salazar (FL-27) introduced the bipartisan ‘Children’s Court Act’ to combat the immigration court backlog and strengthen due process rights for children. U.S. Representatives Hillary Scholten (D-MI), and Lori Chavez-DeRemer (R-OR) also joined as original cosponsors of this legislation.

As the Trump administration cracks down on immigration from Afghanistan following the shooting of National Guard troops by an Afghan national, Congress isn’t looking eager to use the one bit of leverage it has to keep the door open for foreigners who fought alongside U.S. troops.

The Special Immigrant Visa program, which provides a pathway to U.S. permanent residence to Afghans who supported the 20-year U.S. mission in the country, is set to stop taking applications at the end of this month, with far fewer visas available than the number of people applying.

The most recent adjustment to the program authorized 50,500 visas; as of June this year, the State and Homeland Security departments had used 41,092 of them, leaving fewer than 10,000 of the visas available — far less than what advocates say is needed. Lawmakers have lifted the visa cap and extended the program’s deadline since it began in 2009, but now Congress is showing little support for doing that again. The alleged shooter of two National Guard members — one fatally — worked in a CIA-backed Afghan army unit before entering the U.S. in 2021. He had an active Special Immigrant Visa application underway, according to the AfghanEvac advocacy group.

Reps. ZACH NUNN (R-Iowa) and JASON CROW (D-Colo.) tried unsuccessfully to include an extension of the program in this year’s annual defense policy bill. The measure needed a waiver from the House Judiciary Committee, which didn’t grant it.

Nunn’s spokesperson MARK MATAVA told your anchor that the lawmaker “remains committed to ensuring that any future legislation reflects both our national security priorities and our obligation to those who stood with us in combat. Congressman Nunn is actively working with both the Armed Services and Appropriations Committees to identify a viable path forward.”

Crow told NatSec Daily: “After the war, America made a promise to protect those who protected us. We need to live up to our commitments.”

Asked about possibilities for extending the program, House Judiciary spokesperson RUSSELL DYE wrote NatSec Daily, “In light of recent events, these might be the dumbest questions that I’ve ever received.”

A number of senators who spoke to NatSec Daily today were torn over the program.

“We need to do better vetting on Afghan nationals, but I also recognize that there were many who were essential in helping our troops during the conflict,” said Sen. SUSAN COLLINS (R-Maine).

“No one’s been vetted. I support a full pause and a vetting of people who are here,” said Sen. ERIC SCHMITT (R-Mo.).

Meanwhile the executive branch continues to crack down.

Last week, the State Department paused issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports, including people in the SIV program. On Tuesday U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services posted a policy memorandum ordering new restrictions. Those include a hold on all applications for asylum; a hold on green card application processing for people from countries President DONALD TRUMP designated as high risk, including Afghanistan; and a “re-review” of people from those countries who entered since former President JOE BIDEN took office.

If the SIV program doesn’t get extended, that will leave about 5,900 SIV slots open as of Dec. 1, while some 35,000 people have applied and received “Chief of Mission” approval, said SHAWN VanDIVER, founder and president of AfghanEvac.

RWANDA-CONGO CONFAB: One of the eight peace deals Trump claims to have brokered is getting a pomp-filled ceremony in Washington on Thursday, though it may also expose how much work there is to be done to get lasting peace between Congo and Rwanda.

Trump is set to welcome the leaders of the two countries at the White House for bilateral and trilateral meetings. Then they’ll continue on to a signing ceremony of what the White House has described as a historic peace and economic agreement at the building formerly known as the U.S. Institute of Peace. A number of other African leaders, including Kenyan President WILLIAM RUTO, will also attend. The countries’ foreign ministers signed a preliminary agreement at the White House in June.

All of this is aimed at ending years of fighting in eastern Congo, which has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands more. Despite all of the fanfare, that hasn’t yet happened, with the warring Congolese army and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels continuing to trade fire as recently as this week. Both blame each other for ceasefire violations.

Our own Felicia Schwartz caught up with YOLANDE MAKOLO, the Rwandan government spokesperson who has played part in the efforts and is in Washington for the ceremony. Asked about the timing of the signing now, when so many issues remain to be resolved, she said, “It signals that the administration is still engaged at the highest level. It keeps the scrutiny on the issues, which can be easily forgotten because there’s so much happening.”

Makolo added: “At the end of the day, it’s up to us as the Africans and as the people involved to keep it going in the right direction. ... What we want, in addition to the end of conflict and peace, is meaningful economic engagement, especially high quality U.S. firms working on both sides of the border so that’s, that’s a good incentive for both of us.”

BETTER LATE THAN NEVER: The EU is set to ban Russian gas imports starting next year, turning away from dependence on Russian energy more than three years after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, our own Ben Munster reports.

Although European imports of Russian gas have tanked since 2022, the bloc still relies on Russia for roughly 19 percent of its intake. Under the new agreement, the EU will halt imports of different types of Russian gas in phases by fall 2027. The Commission is also looking to enact a ban on Russian oil imports.

“We were paying to Russia €12 billion per month at the beginning of the war for fossil fuels. Now we’re down to €1.5 billion per month. ... We aim to bring it down to zero,” European Commission President URSULA VON DER LEYEN told reporters today. “This is a good day for Europe and for our independence from Russian fossil fuels — this is how we make Europe resilient.”

Meanwhile, our own Bjarke Smith-Meyer and Gregorio Sorgi report today that the European Commission is proposing using frozen Russian assets to grant Ukraine a loan of €165 billion. But that proposal is likely to meet resistance from the Belgian government, which has repeatedly pushed back against using the assets held in the country over concerns of Russian retaliation.

“The text the Commission will table today does not address our concerns in a satisfactory manner,” Belgian Foreign Minister MAXIME PRÉVOT told reporters. “We have the frustrating feeling of not having been heard.”

RAFAH CROSSING CONFUSION: Israel said today that it would reopen the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt in the coming days to allow injured and sick Palestinians to seek medical care in Egypt, The New York Times reports.

COGAT, the Israeli military liaison on humanitarian affairs, declared that the crossing would reopen only one way, letting Palestinians depart into Egypt but not return through the passage. According to COGAT, the crossing will be overseen by the European Union in coordination with Israel and Egypt.

The World Health Organization estimates that more than 16,500 people need to leave Gaza for medical care.

But the Egyptian government maintains that it isn’t coordinating with Israel to reopen the crossing, amid disputes over whether to allow Palestinians to return through the passage into Gaza. While Israel and Hamas had agreed to reopen the crossing as part of the October ceasefire deal, Israeli officials later said that it would remain closed until further notice, conditional upon the release of the remaining hostages’ bodies.

The remains of two hostages have yet to be returned to Israel. Hamas handed over another body for identification today, but a set of remains it gave to Israel for identification Tuesday did not match either of the two missing hostages.

DO BETTER: White House National Cyber Director SEAN CAIRNCROSS is facing bipartisan pressure to combat artificial intelligence-driven cyberattacks, following a recent report of a Chinese hacking incident.

Sens. MAGGIE HASSAN (D-N.H.) and JONI ERNST (R-Iowa) penned a letter, obtained by our own Maggie Miller (for Pros!), to Cairncross on Tuesday night stressing their concerns about hackers using AI tools to target organizations. The senators cited a report from Anthropic last month that detailed how Chinese hackers had used the company’s Claude Code tool to target companies and government agencies around the world.

“The emerging threat to U.S. cybersecurity posed by foreign adversaries deploying autonomous AI systems requires a robust response from your office and other federal agencies,” the senators wrote.

They also requested that Cairncross respond to questions about how his office was investigating the Anthropic attack, whether U.S. government agencies were targeted in the attack and how Congress can act to support efforts to combat such threats.

The letter comes as the cyber director and his staff are developing a new national cyber strategy, though it’s unclear when that document could be released.

The Complex

SIGNALGATE RETURNS: After a nine-month investigation, the Pentagon inspector general determined that Defense Secretary PETE HEGSETH’s discussion of Yemen strike plans on a Signal chat earlier this year endangered U.S. troops and risked exposing strategic information. But the watchdog also said Hegseth had the authority to do so, our own Joe Gould and Maggie Miller report today.

The inspector general is set to release two reports Thursday, Joe reports. The first finds that while Hegseth did potentially jeopardize U.S. troops and missions, he did not break government classification rules in his Signal messages since the Pentagon chief has the power to legally declassify information before sending it.

Pentagon spokesperson SEAN PARNELL said the review was a “total exoneration” of Hegseth, adding that “this matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”

The second report came to a broader conclusion about the Pentagon’s communications, finding that it lacks a secure messaging tool, forcing officials to use commercial apps that don’t clear the bar for top-level security.

On the Hill

NOW OR NEVER (OR NEXT YEAR): Senate Majority Leader JOHN THUNE has begun the process of confirming a slate of 88 Trump nominees before lawmakers head home for the year — more than a fifth of which are for senior Pentagon roles, our own Leo Shane III reports for Morning Defense today (for Pros!).

Twenty Trump picks for Department of Defense roles are among the nominees that could be confirmed in a single vote under a newly passed batch-confirmation rule.

Not included in the roster: KEITH BASS, Trump’s pick to lead the Pentagon’s health system. Bass’ nomination has stalled for months over concerns with his handling of cases related to “Havana syndrome” during his time at the CIA, where he was ousted in 2021. If he isn’t confirmed by the end of the year, Bass will have to be renominated and begin the process all over again in 2026.

Broadsides

ME BEFORE YOU: The U.S. is lashing out at NATO allies for putting their own defense industries over American weapons-makers.

Deputy Secretary of State CHRISTOPHER LANDAU slammed European allies during a meeting of NATO foreign ministers today, telling them not to “bully” U.S. arms suppliers out of participating in Europe’s push to rearm, our own Victor Jack reports.

The EU is endeavoring to ramp up defense industry production amid increasing threats from Russia. Those efforts have emphasized local production while sidelining U.S. weapons-makers, drawing ire from the Trump administration.

“No one’s shocked by the U.S. line that Europe shouldn’t be protectionist,” one NATO diplomat said of Landau’s comments. “But what did you expect, … tact or nuance from the U.S.?”

Secretary of State MARCO RUBIO skipped the ministerial meeting, marking the first time in more than 20 years that the U.S.’s top diplomat missed the confab.

As Christians, we must,"" said Bishop Michael W. Fisher of Buffalo, New York.
""In terms that the merest of children can understand, Jesus details what it means to be a faithful follower and the reward which awaits those concerned with the well-being of others,"" wrote Bishop Fisher.
Quoting the encyclical, Bishop Fisher said that Pope Leo XIII directly condemned ""the ideas of the totalitarian and the imperialistic state, as well as that of exaggerated nationalism.""
Quoting Pope Pius XII ─ who warned of the dire consequences of neglecting migrants' spiritual and material needs ─ Bishop Fisher added, ""There never has been a period during which the Church has not been active in behalf of migrants, exiles and refugees.""","(OSV News) ─ A New York state bishop has echoed a recent call from the nation's Catholic bishops to respect God-given human dignity, regardless of immigration status.

""As a nation, we know in our hearts that we can and should do better. As Christians, we must,"" said Bishop Michael W. Fisher of Buffalo, New York.

The bishop publicly released his pastoral letter ""Once Aliens, Too"" Dec. 1, having shared it with clergy Nov. 28 ahead of the first Sunday of Advent.

Addressing clergy, he also acknowledged the ""horrible tragedy"" of the Nov. 26 shootings of two West Virginia National Guard members on duty in Washington ─ an attack that killed one and critically wounded the other ─ by a suspect who is an immigrant from Afghanistan.

Bishop Fisher's letter ─ drawing extensively on Scripture, multiple papal documents and Catholic social teaching ─ joins a growing chorus of statements and messages stressing the need to uphold human rights amid the Trump administration's crackdown on unauthorized immigration, which has included sweeping enforcement raids and third-country deportations.

As of Nov. 16, well over 65,000 individuals are in ICE custody, with 73.6% of those detained having no criminal conviction. Many of those with convictions were responsible for minor offenses such as traffic violations, according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops approved a special pastoral message on immigration Nov. 12 amid their annual fall meeting in Baltimore, with the Catholic bishops of New York state releasing a separate message Nov. 13 entitled ""For You Too Were Once Aliens,"" a title referencing the divine command in Leviticus 19:33-34 to care for the alien and the stranger.

Bishop Fisher's pastoral letter, along with the USCCB and New York State Catholic Conference messages, all point to Catholic social teaching on immigration, which balances three interrelated principles ─ the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation's duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

Bishop Fisher noted in his letter that he sought to offer ""some personal perspective"" on the recent USCCB message, which condemned the ""indiscriminate mass deportation of people"" and the ""dehumanizing rhetoric and violence"" against immigrants, while describing condemnation of law enforcement officers acting within their proper authority as ""unacceptable.""

He began by quoting from the 25th chapter of Matthew's Gospel, in which Christ judges the nations based on their works of kindness and mercy.

""In terms that the merest of children can understand, Jesus details what it means to be a faithful follower and the reward which awaits those concerned with the well-being of others,"" wrote Bishop Fisher. ""In demonstrating love and care for the most vulnerable ─ and compassion toward society's outcasts ─ we serve Christ Himself.""

While ""the bishops are under no illusions about the complexities involved with reforming our nation's immigration system,"" and ""fully accept"" that the government has a duty to secure the nation's borders, ""the requirement to act with charity toward friend and stranger alike, however, takes precedence over all other imperatives,"" said Bishop Fisher.

He said that Catholic social teaching ─ which articulates the living out of holiness while building a just society ─ ""begins with the premise that every person, regardless of nationality or legal status, possesses inviolable dignity and fundamental rights.""

Bishop Fisher cited Pope Leo XIII's 1891 encyclical ""Rerum Novarum"" as a ""foundational teaching on the inherent rights of the working class,"" one ""which also asserts the right of people to migrate, particularly when deprived of the dignity of having access to life's basic necessities.""

Quoting the encyclical, Bishop Fisher said that Pope Leo XIII directly condemned ""the ideas of the totalitarian and the imperialistic state, as well as that of exaggerated nationalism.""

The bishop also cited Pope Pius XII's 1952 encyclical, ""Exsul Familia Nazarethana,"" which he said ""evoked the Holy Family's exile in Egypt as a model for all refugee families, as well as the Church's duty to care for migrants, regardless of the reasons for their displacement.""

Quoting Pope Pius XII ─ who warned of the dire consequences of neglecting migrants' spiritual and material needs ─ Bishop Fisher added, ""There never has been a period during which the Church has not been active in behalf of migrants, exiles and refugees.""

""Catholics are to regard migrants not as strangers but as true brothers and sisters,"" he said.

The bishop said St. John Paul II had ""further amplified"" that requirement, stating in his 1996 message for World Migration Day that ""for Christians, the migrant is not merely an individual to be respected in accordance with the norms established by law, but a person whose presence challenges them and whose needs become an obligation for their responsibility.""

Pope Francis had ""issued a rebuke and call to action"" in the 2020 encyclical ""Fratelli Tutti,"" which ""made clear that the moral stature of a society is measured by how it treats the vulnerable,"" said Bishop Fisher.

Pope Leo XIV has carried that message forward, with his first apostolic exhortation, ""Dilexi Te"" recalling ""the long history of the Church's requirement to show preference for the poor and demonstrate compassion toward immigrants,"" said Bishop Fisher.

Advent, during which ""our hearts and minds are filled with expectation of the One who comes to us disguised as a vulnerable child from a distant place,"" prompts renewed reflection on ""our obligations to 'the stranger' among us,"" said Bishop Fisher.

""Mindful that our ancestors were also 'once aliens' in need of compassion, care, and opportunity, we must speak out for those who desire only the same,"" he wrote.",https://img.hghlnd.com/imgix/https://detroitcatholic.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/1132244/20251202T1635-BUFFALO-FISHER-PASTORAL-IMMIGRANTS-1808847.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 18:59:35.567775

Republicans in the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature support a bill that would withhold money from counties that don't comply with ICE detainers.","A divided Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to take a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an immigrant rights group arguing that it is illegal for local jails to hold immigrant detainees at the request of federal authorities.

The Wisconsin lawsuit comes as federal agents have launched high-profile immigration crackdowns in cities including Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Another operation is expected in the coming days in Minnesota, targeting Somali immigrants. The enforcement tactics have been met with protests and lawsuits.

A majority of justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court voted to take the ACLU case directly as an original action, rather than have it first work its way through lower courts. The court is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.

Four justices, who were not named, voted to accept the case, while conservative Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley dissented. Justice Brian Hagedorn, who most often sides with conservative justices, wrote separately to discuss the process, but he did not reveal how he voted.

None of the justices discussed the merits of the case in the order agreeing to take it.

The court's decision means there could be a final ruling in the case by the middle of 2026, far faster than if it first had to wind its way through lower courts. All briefs in the case are due within two months, and the court will set a date for oral argument sometime after that early next year.

The ACLU brought the lawsuit against five county sheriffs in September on behalf of Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant rights group based in Milwaukee.

""This is a historic step toward ensuring that Wisconsin's law protects all residents, not just those with power and privilege,"" said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera. ""Honoring ICE detainers has subjected hardworking immigrants to unlawful arrests for far too long.""

The lawsuit contends that it is illegal for local jails to hold immigrants on detainers sent by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to local sheriff's offices. The lawsuit was filed against sheriffs in Walworth, Brown, Marathon, Kenosha and Sauk counties, all of which honor those requests.

Sam Hall, one of the attorneys for the sheriffs, said they were reviewing the court's order and evaluating next steps.

""We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement,"" he said in an email.

The sheriffs had argued that because the lawsuit involves a complicated area of the law — federal immigration law and the relationship between federal and state and local law enforcement — the case was best ""resolved and refined"" by first going through the lower courts, rather than skipping directly to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Honoring an ICE detainer means the sheriff agrees to hold the person for 48 hours after they otherwise should have been released under state law. The goal of detainers is to give ICE agents more time to pick someone up if they are suspected of being in the country illegally.

The ACLU wants the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prohibit sheriffs from holding people on ICE detainers, which are based on administrative warrants. Holding someone for extra time must be authorized by a judicial warrant, in which a court determines there is probable cause to keep them longer, the ACLU argues in the lawsuit.

The ACLU argues that keeping the person in custody for that extra time constitutes an illegal new arrest. It is illegal because Wisconsin law does not allow officers to make civil arrests except in certain circumstances, none of which apply to immigration enforcement, the lawsuit argues.

In the first seven months of this year, ICE sent more than 700 requests to local jails across Wisconsin, asking them to hold someone 48 hours beyond when they were set to be released, the lawsuit contends.

The petition from the family of Alejandro Carranza says the military bombed his fishing boat on Sept. 15, when he was sailing off Colombia’s Caribbean coast, in violation of human rights conventions. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights received the complaint Tuesday, and while the Trump administration has said it supports the commission’s work, the U.S. does not recognize the jurisdiction of an international court associated with the commission. Therefore, any recommendations that could result from the family’s petition would not be binding.

The family’s attorney, Daniel Kovalik, said Carranza’s four children and spouse want to be compensated as their loved one was their primary breadwinner. He explained that the family chose the commission because of the obstacles that a federal case would face, but the possibility has not been ruled out either.

“The U.S. does not subject itself to accountability, so we’re using the avenues we have before us,” Kovalik said Wednesday. “We believe that a decision in our favor, combined with public pressure, can get us that compensation and also can end the killings in the Caribbean.”

The strikes that led to the complaint

The U.S. military has killed more than 80 people since early September, when it began striking vessels that the Trump administration has said were carrying drugs toward the U.S. The strikes began off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast and later expanded to the eastern Pacific Ocean.

The U.S. also has built up its largest military presence in the region in generations, which many see as part of a strategy to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to resign.

The Trump administration has not provided any details of the people killed in the strikes, but it has insisted that its intelligence confirmed that members of foreign terrorist organizations were operating the targeted vessels.

The U.S. military’s Sept. 15 strike killed three people. Asked at the time what proof the U.S. has that the vessel was carrying drugs, President Donald Trump told reporters that big bags of cocaine and fentanyl were spattered all over the ocean. However, images of what Trump described were not released by the military or the White House.

Kovalik denied that Carranza’s boat was carrying drugs and said he did not know if other people were on the vessel. Kovalik, who is also representing President Gustavo Petro in the U.S. after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on him, said he met the Carranzas at their home in northern Colombia.

Petro, the leftist leader of a traditional U.S. ally, has called the boat attacks “murders,” questioning the disproportionate use of force.

Family says its received threats after allegations

The petition cites as evidence of Carranza’s killing stories from The New York Times and The Washington Post regarding the family’s allegations and statements by U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. It also says the family has received threats since Carranza’s death.

“The victims do not have adequate and effective resources in Colombia to obtain reparations ... moreover, even if such resources existed, the victims could not exercise them safely, given that they have been threatened by right-wing paramilitaries simply for denouncing Mr. Carranza’s murder,” according to the petition, which was first reported by The Guardian.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the complaint.

The attacks have increasingly come under scrutiny after the Washington Post reported that Hegseth issued a verbal order to “kill everybody” on the first boat targeted by the military and an admiral approved a follow-on strike said to have killed two survivors of the initial hit. Hegseth has said the admiral “made the right call” and he “had complete authority to do” so.

Trump on Tuesday said the U.S. would start doing strikes on land soon, though he didn’t specify where and said attacks might occur in countries besides Venezuela, suggesting Colombia.

“You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take,” Trump said to reporters. “We know everything about them. We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we’re going to start that very soon, too.”

Later, when asked to elaborate, Trump said he was speaking about countries that are manufacturing and selling fentanyl or cocaine. The president said he heard that Colombia is manufacturing cocaine and selling it to the U.S. Colombia is the world’s top cocaine producer.

“Anybody that’s doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,” Trump said. He added a few moments later, “Not just Venezuela.”

“We want to make sure that we’re as welcoming as possible,” Andrew Giuliani, the executive director of the White House Task Force on the World Cup, told reporters on Wednesday.

But US President Donald Trump’s escalating anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies are raising concern over Washington’s promise of a welcoming tournament.

Giuliani talked up the US Department of State’s efforts to shorten wait times for interviews for visitor visas, allowing fans from across the world to come to the US during the World Cup, which Mexico and Canada will co-host.

Despite Giuliani’s assurances, he also confirmed that there will be no special World Cup exemptions for fans from 19 countries that are under a US travel ban. He also did not rule out targeting undocumented immigrants for removal around matches.

Daniel Norona, Americas advocacy director at Amnesty International USA, slammed the US administration’s approach.

“You cannot have unity if you’re promoting discrimination, if you’re promoting repression, and if you’re pushing to silence anyone who disagrees with you,” Norona told Al Jazeera.

“So I don’t think that we can call this a moment of unity if they are doing the opposite of what unity means.”

Travel ban

Two of the nations included in the travel ban – Haiti and Iran – are participating in the tournament.

Asked repeatedly about the travel restrictions, Giuliani kept reiterating that players and direct support staff from banned countries will be issued visas, but that fans may not. “Visas are a national security issue, each and every one of those there,” he said.

But the US has already refused to issue visas for some members of the Iranian delegation to attend the World Cup group stage draw on Friday.

Giuliani also dismissed the effect of the travel ban on Haitian fans, noting that the national team’s coach, Sebastien Migne, recently said that he has never been to the Caribbean nation, which has been plagued by gang violence, humanitarian crises and natural disasters.

Trump’s ban also applies to Haitians outside Haiti. And Norona highlighted that the crackdown could affect Haitians inside the US who may want to cheer on their team as the Trump administration continues to roll back immigration protections for the country.

Norona said Trump’s policies are the “antithesis” to the World Cup, which is synonymous with openness and welcoming people from across the globe.

“We are concerned that this will create a non-welcoming and overall hostile environment for the fans and players and everybody who is involved in the World Cup,” Norona told Al Jazeera.

Giuliani did not rule out Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids targeting undocumented immigrants at World Cup venues.

The US is home to about 14 million people without regular immigration status, including many from the football-loving Latino community, who have lived in the country for years and established new lives and families.

“I’ve known the president for 25 years,” said Giuliani, who is the son of Trump’s former personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. “The president does not rule out anything that will help make American citizens safer.”

Norona said the immigration raids do not make anyone safe.

“They just promote a chilling effect for the rest of the fans and the rest of the football community that want to attend their games,” he said.

Trump’s ‘unique style’

It is not just undocumented immigrants who have been on the receiving end of Trump’s crackdown.

Over the past months, the administration has pushed to deport people who are in the country legally, including visitors, foreign students and permanent residents, over criticism of Israel.

In addition to targeting dozens of students who participated in Gaza solidarity protests, ICE agents arrested British commentator Sami Hamdi in October and held him for two weeks before removing him from the country for his advocacy for Palestinian human rights.

“The chilling effect here is not only on undocumented people residing in the US. The chilling effect is to anyone who might express a discontent or a disagreement with the current administration,” said Norona.

For his part, Giuliani stressed that it is a “fictional narrative” that Trump does not want foreigners coming into the US.

“What he’s talked about is he wants to make sure that people can come into the United States legally. That way, we also can make sure the games [and] other experiences are safe and secure,” he told reporters.

On Tuesday, however, Trump had launched an anti-immigrant tirade, calling Somali people in the US “garbage”.

Al Jazeera asked Giuliani about Trump’s rhetoric and how it may clash with the message of unity that US officials are emphasising around the World Cup.

“The president has a unique style. I think it’s why he’s such an effective leader, to be perfectly honest, and I think it’s why he actually is the consummate host for this incredible World Cup that is going to be the largest in human history,” Giuliani said.

He went on to suggest that Trump’s bigoted approach was a form of honesty.

“In terms of the president’s rhetoric, he’s unique in that regard. He’s a New Yorker like me. Sometimes we say things that are a little different than polished politicians,” Giuliani said.

“But I think that’s also why he’s been able to actually really get to the hearts of so many Americans – because he is completely honest with them.”

Norona, however, said Trump’s comments send a “discriminatory” and “racist” message.

“I don’t think it’s style; it’s a deliberate choice of words,” he added. “It’s something that should be reprehensible for everyone.”

FIFA Pace Prize

Trump has been showing ample interest in the World Cup and football generally. He attended the Club World Cup final in New Jersey in July, and he has been regularly hosting FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the White House.

Last month, he welcomed Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo to a state dinner in Washington, DC, during the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The US president will also attend the tournament’s draw on Friday, when the world football governing body will present its inaugural FIFA Peace Prize.

FIFA has been facing calls to demand protection for immigrants at football matches. The organisation has also been criticised for its close ties with Trump.

During the Club World Cup, FIFA did not promote its usual antiracism messages at the tournament, a move that appeared to be in line with Trump’s opposition to diversity and inclusion programmes.

FIFA did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment by the time of publication.

“FIFA’s so-called peace prize is being awarded against a backdrop of violent detentions of immigrants, national guard deployments in US cities, and the obsequious cancellation of FIFA’s own antiracism and anti-discrimination campaigns,” Minky Worden, who oversees sport for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.

""This is a historic step toward ensuring that Wisconsin’s law protects all residents, not just those with power and privilege,"" said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera.

December 3, 2025 – This week, the New York Times reported the administration’s plans for targeted immigration enforcement operations of Somali immigrants in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. The plan includes adding roughly 100 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers from across the country to this disturbing, Islamophobic, and racist effort.

Minnesota is home to roughly 84,000 people of Somali descent who have created very deep roots in the United States. Threats of detention and deportation create a very serious climate of fear and uncertainty.

Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota (ILCM) Executive Director, Jennifer Stohl Powell, said: “ILCM stands with our Somali clients and community members, who are being unfairly vilified by the administration and targeted by current ICE enforcement actions. The majority of Somalis in Minnesota entered as refugees, and many are now U.S. citizens. We urge all non-citizens to know their immigration status and carry proof of that status. Non-citizens have rights, including the right to remain silent, the right not to sign anything without speaking with an attorney, and the right not to open the door unless officers present a judicial warrant with the correct name and address.”

The Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota condemns the racist and Islamophobic actions of the Trump administration. We will continue to defend the rights of immigrants and refugees and offer resources and legal services to protect and strengthen our communities.

We urge all community members to know their rights when interacting with ICE:

You have the right to remain silent.

You have the right to speak to a lawyer.

Do not sign anything. ICE may try to get you to sign documents that hinder your situation.

You do NOT need to open your door unless agents present a signed judicial warrant with your correct name and address.

You may document and record enforcement activity from a safe distance.

If you see an enforcement activity, please immediately contact the Immigrant Defense Network helpline at (612) 255-3112. As a bystander, you have the legal right to record, document, and observe from a safe distance.

If you or someone you know has been detained, call 651-641-1011 within our detention line intake hours to obtain general information about court proceedings, the Minnesota Detention Project, and the services the project provides. The ILCM Detention Line intake hours are Mondays 2-4pm and Thursday 1-3pm.

The chilly breeze and sandy shores in this Oregon fishing city have shielded this town from scorching heat for decades. But despite the mist in the air, rumors here spread like wildfire.

The latest of those hunches came straight from city officials and has since commanded national attention. Newport City Manager Nina Vetter and Mayor Jan Kaplan signed onto a Nov. 10 statement suggesting the Trump administration could be planning Oregon’s first Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility. The site they suspected? The municipal airport of the city, home to more than 10,000 people.

All they had were a few clues. A life-saving rescue helicopter had just been relocated from the Coast Guard’s Newport Municipal Air facility to a station in North Bend nearly 70 miles away. A defense contractor wanted to lease land in December next to that facility in support of “federal operations.” Job listings showed private companies were recruiting detention officers with ICE experience in Newport.

Fast-forward more than three weeks, and hundreds of Oregonians from Newport and nearby have turned out to two public meetings to voice unanimous opposition to the facility. The state of Oregon has filed a federal lawsuit seeking the return of the helicopter, and a local group supporting fishermen has done the same, winning a 14-day order just before Thanksgiving to return it to Newport. In the meantime, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, Gov. Tina Kotek, and U.S. Rep. Val Hoyle have all sought answers from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to no avail.

“Until we can get confirmation, we can’t talk about zoning and permits and and we can’t talk about how it might affect our economy and whether we want these things here,” said state Rep. David Gomberg, D-Otis. “Should a community be able to have some say on whether a major facility like this moves into the neighborhood? I think the answer is yes, but the federal government is not owning up.”

Across Oregon, local governments have debated the extent to which they should resist or comply with increasingly aggressive federal immigration policy, declaring states of emergencies, seeking assistance from local law enforcement and turning off license plate reading cameras for fear of sensitive data being leaked. The city of Hillsboro, for instance, recently backtracked on a directive warning city employees against filming ICE officers, a policy it justified by citing the homeland security department’s claim that such activity could constitute harassment.

Newport’s response, however, opened with a more unapologetically adversarial stance toward the federal government. The approach risked drawing the ire of the homeland security department, which has not shied away from slamming journalists and politicians who it claims are stoking fear and spreading misinformation. Local officials and advocates statewide, meanwhile, have bet on going public ahead of what they anticipate will be a lengthy legal and political battle.

“People know that we can win on this,” said Sidra Pierson, a senior organizer for the Cottage Grove-based Rural Organizing Project. “There’s a precedent in Oregon from being the first state to pass a sanctuary law.”

The nonprofit claimed a major victory when it won a suit against the city of Cottage Grove and its police department following reports of immigration authorities accessing local jails and police officers racially profiling local residents. It marked the only instance so far of the public successfully suing a local law enforcement agency in Oregon for violating its sanctuary laws, which prohibit local and state law enforcement resources being used for federal immigration enforcement without a court order. The group also helped secure the end of immigration detentions at Sheridan’s federal prison in 2018 and an ICE contract with The Dalles’ regional Oregon jail in 2020.

‘A public accountability campaign’

Even though a federal defense contractor has since withdrawn its inquiry about leasing land at the airport and some other contractors’ job postings have been taken down, there are still signs the federal government is interested in Newport.

Wyden, who hosts town halls in every county every year, had about 600 people attend his Nov. 23 meeting in Newport. Some attendees waved small flags decorated with a crossed-out ice cube and others held American ones.

Sitting in the front row were members of the local nonprofit Newport Fishermen’s Wives and a 14-year-old girl who recounted the moment she found out about her father’s September ICE detainment. Wyden invited her to share her story, nodding toward her during his answers to constituent questions.

“Donald Trump is not doing what he said he would do in 2024. He said on immigration he was going to go after terrorists, drug cartels, murderers, people committing violent crime,” he said. “Nobody said that he was going to go after that little girl’s dad.”

Listening intently was Newport City Councilor Angel Aparicio-Reyes and his 8-year-old daughter. The 32-year-old was born in Newport and returned to the town after meeting his wife in Washington and attending school in California. Though Spanish was the primary language of his household as a child, he has memories of local doctors and teachers from elementary school helping him communicate in English without judgement.

Now he’s had to sit his daughter down, warning her that him being a citizen may not be enough to stop ICE from detaining him because of his appearance. The city is 16.7% Latino, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, and Aparicio-Reyes said many families are beginning to have that conversation with their kids.

“There are still people out there that do not like us,” he said. “It’s a very real thought that I could be taken away.”

Such a possibility across the Oregon Coast has tugged at heartstrings, but it has also led some to turn to the court of public opinion.

Newport City Councilor CM Hall at an emergency city meeting Nov. 12 said she was “willing to call out and name the people who take these jobs that are posted.” Hotels have informed Newport officials about a federal contractor attempting to book hundreds of rooms for up to a year starting in December on the Oregon Coast.

The Lincoln City chapter of the progressive group Indivisible told the Capital Chronicle it’s discussing a “public accountability campaign” to provide residents information about which companies are supporting ICE’s efforts on the Oregon Coast.

It would not be the first time the helicopter’s removal spurred the town into action ahead of the dangerous Dungeness crab fishing season. In late 2014, the nonprofit Fishermen’s Wives took the Obama administration to federal court over the closure of Newport’s Coast Guard facility. Congress ended up passing a law that requires notice and explanation from the homeland security department should a reduction in Coast Guard facility activity take place.

But the Trump administration has not provided details on its plans in Newport. In a prior statement, the U.S. Coast Guard asserted that the Newport air facility is a staging site for specific events where there has never been a permanent assigned aircraft. ICE did not respond to the Capital Chronicle’s requests for comment.

Taunette Dixon, a member of the Newport Fishermen’s Wives who is set to begin fishing with her husband on a family boat in the coming weeks, described that claim as “wordsmithing a bit.” She noted that there has always been a Newport helicopter in rotation from the Coast Guard’s North Bend station. The Newport Coast Guard facility was established in 1987 after the fishing vessel Lasseigne capsized about 20 miles off the coast two years prior, killing three crewmen.

“They have minutes before they have a lack of use of their limbs. Within an hour, even if they have a flotation device, they don’t have a high survival rate,” Dixon said. “So we are looking at them recovering our loved ones, not rescuing our loved ones.”

Limited options

Concern about a Newport ICE facility comes amid the Trump administration’s aggressive crackdown on immigration nationwide. U.S. Customs and Border Patrol reported more than 560 arrests in October throughout the Portland area, and at least 300 detentions in November were reported statewide, according to the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition’s hotline. The GOP’s summer tax and spending law infused a record $165 billion in funding for the homeland security department.

An ICE contractor on Nov. 20 also asked the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development about a “proposed action” in Newport using the 1972 Coastal Zone Management Act. The law allows for a federal agency to supersede a state’s objections to its project should it be “consistent to the maximum extent practicable.” Oregon could sue if it contested the federal government’s assessment.

But in some ways, the issue is not squarely partisan. State Sen. Dick Anderson, R-Lincoln City, told the local radio outlet KYAQ that he doesn’t “see where a detention facility in Newport would be helpful.” On the East Coast, an attempt to scout a New York Coast Guard site for detention purposes drew swift opposition from a local Republican U.S. representative, The New York Times reported Nov. 14.

There was also interest in Oregon for ICE under the Biden administration. An August 2024 ICE request for information sought facilities in West Coast states, including Oregon, that “may be publicly or privately owned and publicly or privately operated.” Biden’s Department of Justice worked in federal court to strike down California law banning private immigration detention centers in 2022, casting doubt on the enforceability of a similar 2021 Oregon law.

If legal battles were not able to stop a Newport ICE facility, Lincoln County would likely see a significant increase in the detention and arrest of immigrants, as research on similar areas nationwide has shown. That could significantly impact life for the local Guatemalan and Mexican community, who play a key role in the area’s fish-processing, floristry, landscaping, nursing and tourist economy.

Eva Gonzalez Muñoz, board president of local community group Centro de Ayuda, remembers moving to Newport as a 6-year-old in 1991, recalling only one other family from Mexico in the city at the time. Her landlords had relocated her family from a previous hotel they owned in Lake Tahoe, California.

This year, Muñoz said her group has paused several community celebrations and events, because no one wants to make themselves a target. A widely-condemned December 2024 letter circulating in Lincoln County encouraged people to track and report “brown folks” without permanent legal status to authorities. And a local conservative group reportedly crashed a recent legal briefing on immigrant rights arranged by another local Latino community group.

“We are witnessing people not going to work, not going to the stores,” Muñoz said. “We’re trying to scramble to find funding to be able to help these people pay their rent, pay their food, and we are actually delivering food to households that do not want to go outside.”

The city of Newport, in the meantime, has tapped outside legal counsel with the explicit goal of responding to the federal government’s plans for a potential ICE facility. Kate Sinkins, a Lincoln City-based immigration attorney, suspects the municipal airstrip attracted the federal government as a potential vehicle for enacting quick deportations. But as she put it: “They have a fight on their hands.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/91d89e9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+290/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2d%2F24%2Fa95e67d64124afcf4ab8676e0a03%2Fnewport-airport.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 16:58:04.392398

Trump, a Republican, has largely stood by his defense secretary, among the most important Cabinet-level positions.
As he defends his job, Hegseth has spoken to both Wicker and Rogers, the top lawmakers overseeing the military.
Rogers said he was “satisfied” with Hegseth after that conversation, while Wicker said that he told Hegseth that he would like him to testify to Congress.
“You don’t suddenly change your judgment level or change your character when you get confirmed to be secretary of defense,” Kaine said.","And now, in what may be his most career-defining moment yet, Hegseth is confronting questions about the use of military force after a special operations team reportedly attacked survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say the second strike would have violated the laws of armed conflict.

“These are serious charges, and that’s the reason we’re going to have special oversight,” said Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Republican chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

The scrutiny surrounding Hegseth’s brash leadership style is surfacing what has been long-building discontent in Congress over President Donald Trump’s choice to helm the U.S. military. And it’s posing a potentially existential moment for Hegseth as the congressional committees overseeing the military launch an investigation amid mounting calls from Democratic senators for his resignation.

Hegseth vowed a ‘warrior culture,’ but lawmakers take issue

Since working to become defense secretary, Hegseth has vowed to bring a “warrior culture” to the U.S. government’s most powerful and expensive department, from rebranding it as the Department of War to essentially discarding the rules that govern how soldiers conduct themselves when lives are on the line.

Hegseth on Tuesday cited the “fog of war” in defending the follow-up strike, saying that there were explosions and fire and that he did not see survivors in the water when the second strike was ordered and launched. He chided those second-guessing his actions as being part of the problem.

Yet the approach to the operation was in line with the direction of the military under Hegseth, a former infantry officer with the Army National Guard, part of the post-Sept. 11 generation, who was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and earned Bronze Stars.

During a speech in September, he told an unusual gathering of top military brass whom he had summoned from all corners of the globe to the Quantico Marine Corps Base in Virginia that they should not “fight with stupid rules of engagement.”

“We untie the hands of our warfighters to intimidate, demoralize, hunt and kill the enemies of our country,” he said. “No more politically correct and overbearing rules of engagement, just common sense, maximum lethality and authority for warfighters.”

WATCH: ‘Do the honorable thing and resign,’ Hegseth tells military leaders who dislike new approach

But now lawmakers and military and legal experts say the Sept. 2 attack borders on illegal military action.

“Somebody made a horrible decision. Somebody needs to be held accountable,” said Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican who in January held out support for Hegseth until only moments before casting a crucial vote for his confirmation.

“Secretary Talk Show Host may have been experiencing the ‘fog of war,’ but that doesn’t change the fact that this was an extrajudicial killing amounting to murder or a war crime,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. “He must resign.”

Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who served 30 years active duty in the Air Force, finishing his career at the rank of brigadier general, said he hasn’t been a fan of Hegseth’s leadership. “I don’t think he was up to the task,” Bacon said.

Will Hegseth keep Trump’s support?

Trump, a Republican, has largely stood by his defense secretary, among the most important Cabinet-level positions. But the decisions by Wicker, alongside House Armed Services Chair Mike Rogers of Alabama and the top Democrats on the committees, to open investigations provide a rare moment of Congress asserting itself and its authority to conduct oversight of the Trump administration.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., who shepherded the defense secretary’s nomination to confirmation, has said the boat strikes are within Trump’s authority as commander in chief — and he noted that Hegseth serves at the pleasure of the president.

“I don’t have, at this point, an evaluation of the secretary,” Thune said at the start of the week. “Others can make those evaluations.”

But Hegseth also has strong allies on Capitol Hill, and it remains unclear how much Republicans would actually be willing to push back on the president, especially when they have spent the first year in his administration yielding to his various demands.

Vice President JD Vance, who cast a rare tiebreaking vote to confirm Hegseth, has vigorously defended him in the attack. And Sen. Eric Schmitt, another close ally to Trump, dismissed criticism of Hegseth as “nonsense” and part of an effort to undermine Trump’s focus on Central and South America.

“He’s not part of the Washington elite,” said Schmitt, R-Mo. “He’s not a think tanker that people thought Trump was going to pick. … And so, for that reason and others, they just, they don’t like him.”

WATCH: Trump and Hegseth distance themselves from follow-on strike on suspected drug boat

Tension between some Republican lawmakers and the Pentagon has been rising for months. Capitol Hill has been angered by recent moves to restrict how defense officials communicate with lawmakers and the slow pace of information on Trump’s campaign to destroy boats carrying drugs off the coast of Venezuela.

As he defends his job, Hegseth has spoken to both Wicker and Rogers, the top lawmakers overseeing the military. Rogers said he was “satisfied” with Hegseth after that conversation, while Wicker said that he told Hegseth that he would like him to testify to Congress.

Hegseth at first tried to brush aside the initial report about the strike by posting a photo of the cartoon character Franklin the Turtle firing on a boat from a helicopter, but that only inflamed criticism of him and angered lawmakers who felt he was not taking the allegations seriously.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Hegseth a “national embarrassment,” adding the defense secretary’s social media post of the cartoon turtle is “something no serious leader would ever think of doing.”

What information will Congress get?

Later this week, the chairs of the armed services committees, along with the top Democrats on the committees, will hear private testimony from Navy Vice Adm. Frank “Mitch” Bradley, who the White House has said ordered the second strike on the survivors.

Republicans have been careful to withhold judgment on the strike until they complete their investigation, but Democrats say that these problems with Hegseth were a long time coming.

Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, pointed back to Hegseth’s tumultuous confirmation hearing, at which issues were raised with his management of nonprofits, as well as allegations of a sexual assault and abuse, and drinking on the job. Hegseth had vowed not to consume alcohol if confirmed.

“You don’t suddenly change your judgment level or change your character when you get confirmed to be secretary of defense,” Kaine said. “Instead, the things that have been part of your character just become much more dire and existential.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/12/2025-12-02T192632Z_845686934_RC2H8IAIFWDO_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 19:56:48.978722

“Honoring ICE detainers has subjected hardworking immigrants to unlawful arrests for far too long.” The lawsuit contends that it is illegal for local jails to hold immigrants on detainers sent by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to local sheriff's offices.
“We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement,” he said in an email.
The ACLU wants the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prohibit sheriffs from holding people on ICE detainers, which are based on administrative warrants.
Republicans in the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature support a bill that would withhold money from counties that don't comply with ICE detainers.","MADISON, Wis. (AP) — A divided Wisconsin Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to take a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of an immigrant rights group arguing that it is illegal for local jails to hold immigrant detainees at the request of federal authorities.

The Wisconsin lawsuit comes as federal agents have launched high-profile immigration crackdowns in cities including Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina. Another operation is expected in the coming days in Minnesota, targeting Somali immigrants. The enforcement tactics have been met with protests and lawsuits.

A majority of justices on the Wisconsin Supreme Court voted to take the ACLU case directly as an original action, rather than have it first work its way through lower courts. The court is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices.

Four justices, who were not named, voted to accept the case, while conservative Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley dissented. Justice Brian Hagedorn, who most often sides with conservative justices, wrote separately to discuss the process, but he did not reveal how he voted.

None of the justices discussed the merits of the case in the order agreeing to take it.

The court's decision means there could be a final ruling in the case by the middle of 2026, far faster than if it first had to wind its way through lower courts. All briefs in the case are due within two months, and the court will set a date for oral argument sometime after that early next year.

The ACLU brought the lawsuit against five county sheriffs in September on behalf of Voces de la Frontera, an immigrant rights group based in Milwaukee.

“This is a historic step toward ensuring that Wisconsin’s law protects all residents, not just those with power and privilege,"" said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera. “Honoring ICE detainers has subjected hardworking immigrants to unlawful arrests for far too long.”

The lawsuit contends that it is illegal for local jails to hold immigrants on detainers sent by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to local sheriff's offices. The lawsuit was filed against sheriffs in Walworth, Brown, Marathon, Kenosha and Sauk counties, all of which honor those requests.

Sam Hall, one of the attorneys for the sheriffs, said they were reviewing the court’s order and evaluating next steps.

“We are confident, however, that Wisconsin sheriffs who honor ICE detainers do so fully within the bounds of Wisconsin law and the federal legal framework governing immigration enforcement,” he said in an email.

The sheriffs had argued that because the lawsuit involves a complicated area of the law — federal immigration law and the relationship between federal and state and local law enforcement — the case was best “resolved and refined” by first going through the lower courts, rather than skipping directly to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Honoring an ICE detainer means the sheriff agrees to hold the person for 48 hours after they otherwise should have been released under state law. The goal of detainers is to give ICE agents more time to pick someone up if they are suspected of being in the country illegally.

The ACLU wants the Wisconsin Supreme Court to prohibit sheriffs from holding people on ICE detainers, which are based on administrative warrants. Holding someone for extra time must be authorized by a judicial warrant, in which a court determines there is probable cause to keep them longer, the ACLU argues in the lawsuit.

The ACLU argues that keeping the person in custody for that extra time constitutes an illegal new arrest. It is illegal because Wisconsin law does not allow officers to make civil arrests except in certain circumstances, none of which apply to immigration enforcement, the lawsuit argues.

In the first seven months of this year, ICE sent more than 700 requests to local jails across Wisconsin, asking them to hold someone 48 hours beyond when they were set to be released, the lawsuit contends.

Republicans in the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature support a bill that would withhold money from counties that don't comply with ICE detainers. The measure passed the Assembly, and if the Senate approves the bill it would head to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who is likely to veto it.

Republicans in the GOP-controlled Wisconsin Legislature support a bill that would withhold money from counties that don’t comply with ICE detainers. The measure passed the Assembly, and if the Senate approves the bill it would head to Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who is likely to veto it.

“Under the Trump Administration, we have seen a shocking surge in the detention of people who have committed no crimes being locked up in increasingly horrifying conditions,” said Jayapal.
We must pass this legislation to protect dignity and civil rights in America.” “We are witnessing appalling conditions for immigration detention and a clear disregard for basic human rights,” said Smith.
“Real change will take time, but immigration detention is an urgent threat that demands immediate action.
This legislation is a guide for Congress working to dismantle walls and prisons and invest in an immigration system grounded in humanity.” “Trump’s cruel mass detention and deportation agenda has reached a previously unimaginable scope and scale, skyrocketing the number of people in immigration detention,” said Setareh Ghandehari, Advocacy Director of Detention Watch Network.","WASHINGTON, D.C. — U.S. Representatives Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) and Adam Smith (WA-09) are today introducing the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act, legislation to enact guardrails and oversight on immigration detention, and to ensure civil and human rights are protected.

“Under the Trump Administration, we have seen a shocking surge in the detention of people who have committed no crimes being locked up in increasingly horrifying conditions,” said Jayapal. “People are being held in squalor, largely in private, for-profit detention facilities, all to pad the bottom lines of prison corporations that donate to Donald Trump and Republicans. As Trump has struck down legal pathways and made it nearly impossible to come to or stay in this country, even for those who have been here for decades, this will only continue to get worse. We must pass this legislation to protect dignity and civil rights in America.”

“We are witnessing appalling conditions for immigration detention and a clear disregard for basic human rights,” said Smith. “No one should be subjected to overcrowded cells, denied medical care, or held in facilities that profit off of human suffering. This legislation establishes the oversight and guardrails needed to end these abuses and ensure that people are treated with dignity.”

Since President Trump returned to office, the use of immigration detention has skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, with over 66,000 people detained. During that period of time, 23 people have died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody. Nearly 73 percent of those detained have no criminal convictions, and many of those with convictions have only minor offenses, including traffic violations.

Detained people in these facilities are being held in inhumane living conditions, with reports of overcrowding forcing 35 men to share one toilet and sleep head to toe on concrete floors, of people being served only a cup of rice a day or rotting food, and of people having their medications withheld or being denied necessary medical care. Further, the Trump Administration has restarted the practice of detaining families and children, which has long been criticized as unsafe and inflicting irreversible harm on children.

This is while the Trump Administration has blocked Congressional oversight, despite death reports that do not line up with autopsy reports. In the case of Chaofeng Ge, ICE stated that he died by suicide, while his attorney alleges he was found with his hands and feet tied.

The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act would:

Repeal mandatory detention;

Prohibit the detention of families and children in family detention;

Create a presumption of release and impose a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and vulnerable populations, including pregnant women, survivors of torture or gender-based violence, people with serious mental or physical illness or disability, LGBTQ individuals, asylum seekers, and people over age 60;

Phase out the use of private detention facilities and jails over a three-year period;

Require DHS to establish civil detention standards that provide, at minimum, the level of protection in the American Bar Association’s Civil Immigration Detention Standards;

Mandate the DHS Inspector General to conduct unannounced inspections with meaningful penalties for failure to comply with standards; and

Require DHS to admit Members of Congress to detention facilities for unannounced inspections.

“The reintroduction of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act could not come at a more urgent moment,” said Haddy Gassama, Senior Policy Counsel at the ACLU. “We are witnessing an unprecedented expansion of the immigration detention system, with billions of taxpayer dollars being funneled into the hands of private prison corporations, profiteers who are building and operating abusive detention facilities, while deaths in custody and other egregious abuses reach record levels. These are not abstract policy failures; they are the lived realities of the 66,000 people disappeared into an inhumane system that has long thrived on opacity, minimal oversight, and virtually no accountability.

“The reintroduction of the Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act comes at a critical moment, as the harsh realities of immigration detention are no longer hidden but visible in every empty seat once occupied by a loved one sent to detention,” said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, Senior Policy Counsel at the National Immigration Law Center. “Real change will take time, but immigration detention is an urgent threat that demands immediate action. The National Immigration Law Center welcomes the re-introduction of this important bill and urges Congress to act quickly to secure its passage.”

“The National Immigrant Justice Center is grateful for members of Congress fighting for communities increasingly under attack, facing inhumane conditions in a system driven by private contractors profiting off the imprisonment of human beings,” said Jesse Franzblau, Associate Director of Policy, National Immigrant Justice Center. “The Dignity for Detained Immigrants Act is pivotal legislation that works to end the private incentive to fill up prisons, fund communities and not cages, and combat impunity for the persistent human rights violations that occur everyday in immigration detention. This legislation is a guide for Congress working to dismantle walls and prisons and invest in an immigration system grounded in humanity.”

“Trump’s cruel mass detention and deportation agenda has reached a previously unimaginable scope and scale, skyrocketing the number of people in immigration detention,” said Setareh Ghandehari, Advocacy Director of Detention Watch Network. “In more than 200 detention facilities across the country ICE subjects people to medical neglect, overcrowding, horrendous conditions of confinement, and rampant transfers that disappear people into the detention system, sowing confusion and cutting people off from their loved ones and support networks. As the administration aggressively expands the detention system and puts people’s lives in jeopardy at a cost to all Americans, Congress must take immediate and decisive action to intervene. While this bill does not fully end the inhumane and unnecessary system of immigration detention, it takes a bold step forward by ending mandatory detention, ending privatized detention, enacting critical safeguards and reversing the trend of constant, unchecked growth.”

,Human Rights,2025-12-03 20:31:38+00:00,WIRED,The Trump Administration Wants Immigrants to Self-Deport. It's a Shit Show | WIRED,Vittoria Elliott,,,,,https://www.wired.com/story/trump-administration-wants-immigrants-to-self-deport/,"The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport.
It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.
Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained.
On May 9, the White House announced Project Homecoming, claiming the government would provide assistance for immigrants seeking to leave.
Her request to leave, Loya says, was granted: The woman then bought $3,000 worth of plane tickets to leave the country.","A young, pregnant Venezuelan woman came to the US without documentation last year. After giving birth and settling in Ohio, she found that trying to stay in the country was too hard. She had no family support for herself and her newborn, and struggled to find work and housing. So she decided to self-deport.

The Trump administration has been virtually begging immigrants in the US to self-deport. It’s self-deportation, the White House says, or risk the wrath of ICE, the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

But self-deportation has been nearly impossible for this woman and others like her, lawyers and immigration activists tell WIRED. Guidance from the US government for those who have decided to self-deport has been confusing and sparse, leaving many immigration attorneys and advocates in the dark. Some immigrants trying to leave the country voluntarily through government-endorsed mechanisms say they have found themselves in limbo or, worse, detained.

CBP Home, the app from Customs and Border Protection that’s supposed to help immigrants self-deport, is only somewhat helpful, and it launches some immigrants into a confusing and drawn-out bureaucratic process, says Jessica Ramos, an immigration attorney practicing in Ohio who represents the stranded woman. That, coupled with little help from the US government, has made getting out of the US “an odyssey,” Ramos claims.

Ramos’ client, who asked not to be named but gave permission for her story to be shared, does not have a Venezuelan passport or the money for a flight. She says she filled out her information on the CBP Home app, then received a notice that she would receive a call from the US government to help her arrange her departure. She says the call never came.

This isn’t what’s supposed to happen: In March, the Department of Homeland Security released CBP Home, which theoretically facilitates self-deportation, providing a form for undocumented immigrants to fill out. It also offers help booking tickets for those needing assistance, the waiving of fines, “cost-free travel,” and a $1,000 bonus. Those who use the app aren’t supposed to have criminal histories and are also meant to be “temporarily deprioritized” for detention and deportation. Initially, CBP Home was advertised as an all-in-one app that would help with everything from travel documents to financial assistance.

Immigration has become the centerpiece of the Trump administration’s policy agenda, and the White House has heavily encouraged immigrants in the US to leave of their own volition. On May 9, the White House announced Project Homecoming, claiming the government would provide assistance for immigrants seeking to leave. According to the presidential proclamation, Project Homecoming promises to facilitate “travel for those lacking valid travel documents, and offers a concierge service at airports to assist with booking travel.”These services, the project said, would eventually be backed with $250 million the government had previously utilized to support refugees. In a statement issued in October, DHS claimed that more than 1.6 million people have “voluntarily self-deported” in 2025.

“It’s proven very difficult to get clear information from the government,” says Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Council.

According to Ramos and other immigration lawyers, CBP Home “is mostly a self-reporting tool as opposed to [how] they initially advertised it.”

Ramos says she attempted to contact the local Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) office to help her client from Venezuela self-deport, but couldn’t get through. “They no longer have a way to reach them,” she says. “It all goes to a customer service hotline of sorts.”

So Ramos helped her client pack her bags. “I literally walked her into the [local] ERO's office and said, ‘She's ready to go home. You can have her. She's with her son. She has provisions for a couple of days now. Please take her home.’” Ramos claims that the staff at the ERO office told her, “‘We're not a travel agency, she just needs to go home on her own.’”

When Ramos pointed out that the agency advertises help for people who want to leave, she says they said that was a national office initiative. Ramos and her client eventually left.

She says her client has still been unable to leave the US. “She's desperate to go home,” says Ramos.

“For those who come here illegally and lack travel documents, DHS is actively working with the State Department to acquire travel documents,” claims DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin. “Additionally, if an illegal alien designates a third country and has the required travel documents, DHS will assist with their travel … DHS offers full-service assistance and contacts eligible participants during the process via phone or email. This is to expedite the vetting or arrange travel.”

Others who attempt to sign up for self-deportation through CBP Home have faced the opposite problem: being detained despite trying to leave voluntarily.

“When the CBP Home app was introduced, we asked our members to let us know about their experiences using it,” says Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, a nonprofit organization for immigration lawyers. “We've heard of a couple cases of people using the app to try to facilitate their return to their home country, but they still end up getting detained, either while they're waiting for their flight out of the country or while they are physically trying to leave the country.”

For those who do manage to successfully self-deport using the CBP Home app, the Trump administration says it will offer a financial reward of $1,000. But few of the attorneys and experts who spoke to WIRED knew of cases where people had received that money once they left. (On Monday, DHS seemingly offered a Cyber Monday deal with the same $1,000 stipend to anyone who agreed to self-deport, continuing the Trump administration’s efforts to turn mass deportation into one big joke.)

In May, a group of voluntary deportees to Honduras and Colombia received Visa debit cards loaded with the promised $1000. Ibañez Whitlock, the senior policy counsel at the National Immigration Law Council, says the government has since switched to wire transfers due to issues people had accessing the funds on the cards. While she says that the National Immigration Law Council has heard of at least some self-deportees receiving the $1,000, it’s unclear exactly how many people have gotten paid.

“I have not heard of any cases of people successfully using it and receiving that money,” says Dojaquez-Torres.

“To say that illegal aliens have not ‘received’ their stipend is grossly misleading and factually incorrect,” claims McLaughlin. “This streamlined self-deportation process does involve vetting to make sure there is no fraud and that those deemed ineligible, like criminal aliens, cannot abuse this program. Everyone who is eligible and qualifies to receive a stipend to date has been issued a stipend.” DHS did not respond when WIRED asked how many immigrants have received the stipend.

When reached for comment, the White House referred WIRED to DHS.

Receiving the stipend, should it happen, can bring its own complications. On October 3, the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the government’s programs of unaccompanied minors, confirmed the release of a memo informing those working with undocumented teenagers in HHS shelters that DHS would be offering “a one-time resettlement support stipend of $2,500” to children 14 years and older “who have elected to voluntarily depart” the country.

Lawyers who spoke to WIRED alleged that the offer was hardly voluntary. Children who did not sign could be detained indefinitely, and lawyers claim that DHS indicated that their families living in the US could be arrested and deported. Children who aged out of being minors while in custody would also face the risk of being immediately transferred to a regular ICE holding facility.

“We have real concerns regarding the coercive way that this is set up, as well as the lack of transparency,” says Laura St. John, legal director at the Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project in Arizona. St. John says at least one client who was approached about the $2,500 offer was asked to sign a document that she says would have waived their rights to fight their case in immigration court, but also future potential asylum claims. St. John alleges the agreement also included “major fees and penalties if the child should ever return.”

Some advocates are also concerned about who could take advantage of these payments to children. “It's important to understand that a lot of these kids are either smuggled or trafficked into the United States,” says Wendy Young, president of Kids in Need of Defense (KIND), a nonprofit that provides pro bono legal representation to unaccompanied minors. “Those criminal elements would certainly be aware that a child was returning home with $2,500 potentially in their pocket, or to be paid after their return. That would have put them at greater risk and vulnerability of the cartel who trafficked or smuggles them coming back in and saying, ‘I want that money.’”

“Many unaccompanied minors had no choice when they were dangerously smuggled into this country. ICE and the Office of Refugee and Resettlement at HHS are offering a strictly voluntary option to return home to their families,” claims McLaughlin. “This voluntary option gives UACs a choice and allows them to make an informed decision about their future.”

Dojaquez-Torres says that the government has also begun to exert a new kind of financial pressure on immigrants leaving the US. In addition to leveling fines that totaled millions of dollars against immigrants should they stay in the US, the country has frozen the US-based assets of some deportees after they return home, Dojaquez-Torres says. That measure was previously reserved for people with ties to criminal activity.

But the worsening conditions in detention facilities has continued driving people to self-deport. “Even if they have a legal mechanism to potentially stay in the United States, [people] are giving up on their cases because they're just so concerned about going into detention,” St. John says. “This administration is using every possibility to make life unlivable in this country for people.”

Those with an existing immigration case who opt to take voluntary departure, where an immigrant can pay for their own trip home within a certain window of time allocated by a judge, have also faced difficulty.

In Colorado, a Venezuelan woman who was granted voluntary departure says she was turned away at the airport. The woman’s husband had been detained and deported; she wanted to leave with him. Her hope was initially to leave in the spring, says Andrea Loya, the executive director at Casa de Paz, an immigrants’ rights support group in Colorado, who was working with the woman.

Her request to leave, Loya says, was granted: The woman then bought $3,000 worth of plane tickets to leave the country. But when she showed up at the airport, she wasn’t allowed to board, Loya says. “They didn't have passports when they made it to the airport … she couldn’t leave the country by air.”

The woman was frustrated enough to eventually show up at the local detention facility in Aurora, Colorado, and ask the guards to deport her. Just like Ramos’ client, she says she was told to leave. Loya says that she has since lost contact with the woman “because she decided to essentially coyote her way to Mexico … She was going to try to [go by land] from Denver to Mexico City to try to see if she could get documents there.”","https://media.wired.com/photos/692fef2d4276d5a182161789/191:100/w_1280,c_limit/politics_self_deportation_immigration_trump.jpg",N,,2025-12-03 16:57:38.769440

AILA applauds efforts to bring dignity, justice, oversight, and accountability to the detention system. This bill will accomplish important reforms to immigration detention for which AILA has long advocated. This includes provisions to:

Repeal mandatory detention

Prohibit detention of families and children in family detention

Phase out private detention facilities and jails

Require DHS to establish civil detention standards

Create a presumption of release

Impose a higher burden of proof to detain primary caregivers and vulnerable populations

AILA encourages stakeholders to contact their representatives to express their support for the bill’s advancement through the House.

On December 3, AILA member Sarah Owings joined Congresswoman Jayapal and other bill sponsors at a press conference introducing the bill. Owings said:

“The Trump Administration has massively expanded detention to far more people than any previous administration and has stripped away oversight and accountability mechanisms to prevent abuses and harm to people who are detained. The current system rewards profit and prejudice over justice and common sense. The administration is blocking access to legal counsel and family at detention facilities and is effectively denying people their fair day in court. To safeguard health, protect safety, and uphold due process, Congress must act now to reform this broken system and honor our nation’s commitments.”

Immigration detention facilities are sites of serious and repeated allegations of abuse, including allegations of sexual assault, violations of religious freedom, medical neglect, and the punitive use of solitary confinement. Conditions in detention, including a lack of adequate medical care, can be deadly. In 2025, more people have died in ICE adult detention than in any year since 2004.

Paul.

According to press reports, the operation could begin within days.

The move comes as President Trump has disparaged Somalis with increasingly inflammatory rhetoric, including in today's lengthy Cabinet meeting at the White House.

The president made a point of singling out Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who is Somali.

DONALD TRUMP, President of the United States: We're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country.

Ilhan Omar is garbage.

Minnesota is home to the nation's largest Somali community.

Michael Dell, the billionaire founder of Dell Technologies, and his wife, have pledged more than $6 billion to the Trump administration, with the funds designated for investment accounts for children known as Trump Accounts.

MICHAEL DELL, CEO, Dell: We believe the smartest investment that we can make is an investment in children.

GEOFF BENNETT: The Dells' donation will provide $250 each to 25 million eligible children under the age of 10 who live in zip codes where the median household income falls below $150,000.

Mr.

Trump's tax bill created the accounts, which will be rolled out next summer.

Withdrawals from the accounts cannot be made until a child turns 18.

The Pentagon today held its first briefing in nearly half-a-year as it faces bipartisan backlash over that September attack on an alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean.

The credentialed attendees were a host of right-wing media figures, including Laura Loomer and former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz.

Millions of Americans woke up this morning to their first snow of the season, as windy, icy weather rolled across the Northeast.

The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings across New England, where some areas have already received more than half-a-foot of snow.

Several other states will see a mix of snow and rain, like in Pennsylvania, where wet, slushy conditions led to hundreds of accidents.

The storm already hit the Midwest, creating more treacherous travel after the Thanksgiving holiday.

This pile-up in Central Missouri yesterday brought highway traffic to a standstill.

Forecasters say another storm could bring winter weather to the mid-Atlantic later this week.

Veronica Escobar, who represents Texas’ 16th Congressional District in El Paso, and El Paso County Commissioner David Stout.
Escobar said that El Paso is a “loving, welcoming community” and that the majority of its residents do not agree with Homan’s divisive message.
The El Paso County Commissioners Court unanimously passed the resolution Nov. 24.
“That’s the truth,” said Homan, who served as acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Trump’s first administration.
LISTEN: EL PASO MATTERS PODCAST","The planned presentation by U.S. border czar Tom Homan at the University of Texas at El Paso this week has generated concerns among some students, local elected leaders and human rights groups.

Homan, a native of New York, previously worked as a police officer and Border Patrol agent, investigator and administrator. He advocates for the deportation of undocumented immigrants and family separation policy, and opposes sanctuary cities.

The free presentation is slated for 7 p.m. Thursday in the university’s Undergraduate Learning Center, Room 106. Registration for the event is ongoing. Seating is on a first-come, first-served basis.

Event organizers said that Homan will talk about the importance of border security followed by a question-and-answer session with the audience who were told “to exhibit decorum and act accordingly.” UTEP’s chapter of Turning Point USA will serve as hosts.

Turning Point USA, a national nonprofit organization that advocates for conservative politics in high schools, colleges and universities, was co-founded by Charlie Kirk in 2012. Kirk, who was shot and killed while speaking at a Utah university in September, held controversial stances on various issues and advocated for mass deportations and a halt to immigration altogether.

Members of the UTEP chapter, which launched in September, did not respond to an interview request. Dana Rincon, a Turning Point USA representative, said in a Nov. 26 email that her organization was not conducting interviews before the event, but offered to send a prepared statement. El Paso Matters had not received a statement. UTEP also did not respond to questions about Homan’s visit.

The presence of Homan at UTEP upset Naomi Rees, a junior who is studying chemistry and Spanish literature at the university, one of the country’s largest Hispanic-serving institutions with a student body that is 84% Hispanic. She is one of the organizers behind a planned protest at 6:30 p.m. Thursday at Leech Grove at University Avenue and Wiggins Way.

Rees, an Austin native, said she thought speaking out against a system that harms people and violates their rights was the right thing to do. While supportive of border security, she called the Trump administration’s methods immoral and unjustified.

“I felt like I had to (protest),” the 21-year-old student said Tuesday afternoon at a café near campus. “(Homan’s) targeting people who are vulnerable and using fear to deter people from immigrating or to compel people to self-migrate.”

Rees said friends from Chihuahua, Mexico, and others from mixed-status families have told her that they support the protest, but do not plan to participate to keep from becoming a target of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Mixed-status families are households with members with different immigration statuses.

The student advocate said she expects about 30 people at the Thursday protest. Organizers have used flyers, social media and word-of-mouth to alert the public. She said this is something worthwhile.

“I need to be able to stand up for people who are and would be targeted,” said Rees, who later added, “I think that’s the best way to use (my) white privilege.”

The Border Network for Human Rights along with several other border advocacy groups have planned their own peaceful protest at 5 p.m. Wednesday at UTEP’s Leech Grove. Organizers said people will offer first-person testimonials on the harm caused by the Trump administration’s mass deportation policies, militarization of the border and ongoing assaults on human and constitutional rights.

Homan’s invitation also upset U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar, who represents Texas’ 16th Congressional District in El Paso, and El Paso County Commissioner David Stout.

Escobar said that El Paso is a “loving, welcoming community” and that the majority of its residents do not agree with Homan’s divisive message. She mentioned that he actively demonizes student Dreamers, undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and contribute to the economy and the community.

“Homan has been one of the chief architects of the Trump administration’s cruel, hardline mass deportation tactics,” Escobar said in a statement. “Despite promises to go after the ‘worst of the worst,’ their efforts have done little but terrorize families, including mixed-status families, households with immigrants who have been in the country for decades, parents of U.S. citizens, and U.S. citizens themselves.”

Because of the Homan visit, Stout authored a resolution that condemned the militarization of the border and the expansion of immigration crackdowns that are part of the Trump administration’s plan. It also reaffirmed the county’s support of immigrants, due process and human dignity. The El Paso County Commissioners Court unanimously passed the resolution Nov. 24.

Stout, in a prepared statement, said that Homan’s message goes against the values of a community that is binational, bilingual and pro-immigration.

“We cannot and will not accept a politics that treats our neighbors, our loved ones, our coworkers, as threats to be managed instead of human beings to be respected,” Stout said.

According toTransactional Records Access Clearinghouse , which tracks federal immigration data, ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection had placed more than 65,000 people in immigration detention centers as of mid-November. Of that number, 73.6% did not have a criminal record. Most of the others had minor convictions including traffic violations.

The TRAC report stated that Texas had the highest number of detainees with 17,502, followed by Louisiana with 8,137. The El Paso Camp East Montana on Fort Bliss has the largest number of detainees in fiscal year 2026 with a daily average of 2,777 detainees.

Homan previously spoke at a college campus last March when he participated in the New College of Florida 2025 Socratic Stage Dialogue Series. That presentation in front of about 200 people in Sarasota, Florida, centered on the importance of border security, an assessment of the U.S. immigration policy, and the need to hold accountable those who break the law.

A National Public Radio account of the meeting included Homan’s statements that more needs to be done to secure the border because that saves lives.

“That’s the truth,” said Homan, who served as acting director of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Trump’s first administration.

They urged the sport's governing body, FIFA, to deliver on its promises to safeguard workers, fans and journalists.

""Families, fans, players and other members of the football community have the right to enjoy the game without the fear of being detained and separated from their loved ones,"" Daniel Norona, Amnesty International USA's Americas advocacy director, told a joint news conference.

The World Cup will be co-hosted by the United States, Mexico and Canada in June and July 2026. The draw for the 48-nation tournament will be held Friday in Washington.

A Human Rights Watch report Wednesday said that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested more than 92,000 people between January and October near cities where World Cup games will be played. It noted that an asylum seeker in the United States was detained before the Club World Cup final in July.

As part of his mass-deportation drive, Trump has deployed National Guard troops to some cities that will host World Cup matches, such as Chicago and Los Angeles.

""We need FIFA and host cities and other entities to make clear whether or not ICE, the National Guard and other federal law enforcement will be at the stadiums,"" said Jennifer Li, a professor at Washington's Georgetown University Law Center. ""This isn't just kind of hypothetical.""

Human Rights Watch's Minky Worden expressed particular concern over the administration's revocation of temporary legal protections for migrants from Haiti, a country that earned its first World Cup berth in more than 50 years.

""These policies put communities at risk and threaten to undermine the integrity of the tournament itself,"" said Jamil Dakwar, director of the ACLU's human rights program.

""Without action today, FIFA risks becoming a stage for authoritarianism.""

- A new award -

The groups also warned about access for journalists, including overseas reporters seeking entry into the United States, and protections for workers and fans from abuse and discrimination.

They noted that homophobic chants were heard at a July Club World Cup match in Atlanta.

Complicating their efforts is Trump's seemingly close relationship with FIFA president Gianni Infantino, who has made repeated White House visits and is slated to unveil an inaugural FIFA Peace Prize at Friday's draw that onlookers have speculated could go to Trump.

""The relationship is too close for comfort,"" said the NAACP's Jamal Watkins.

""When Infantino aligns with Donald Trump, then you literally are sending a signal not only to the United States, but to the world, that all of the practices and policies that are coming out of this administration are OK.""

In a letter sent to FIFA last month, Human Rights Watch petitioned the governing body for the criteria used to determine a winner, a list of nominees and judges, and whether human rights considerations would inform the decision. Worden said they have not received an answer.

""Gianni Infantino has said that this FIFA Peace Prize represents five billion fans of football around the world,"" she said. ""How were the five billion fans of football consulted?""

This time local police and Illinois State Police joined federal agents in crowd control.
Illinois bars state and local law enforcement from assisting civil immigration enforcement, yet local police have joined federal agents in attacking protesters.
The call for federal agents to halt the excessive use of force against protesters in Illinois is necessary, urgent, and growing.
Governor J.B. Pritzker has publicly condemned the actions by Federal agents at Broadview and established the Illinois Advisory Commission to document complaints against federal agents and recommend reforms.","September 26, 5:30 a.m. My goggles and respirator clinked together in the passenger seat as I drove to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Broadview detention facility. Since September 8, federal agents have arrested more than a thousand immigrants in the Chicago area, many taken to Broadview.

What I witnessed that morning—and what my colleagues and I later documented—was not crowd control. It was the deliberate use of excessive force against peaceful protesters, volunteer street medics, legal observers, and journalists. It was a show of power and intentional brutality.

As the sun rose, neighbors, faith leaders, and advocates gathered outside the fence surrounding the facility. They held flags, signs, and crosses, bound by a shared passion to speak out against Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (ICE): the killing of Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, the violent arrests across the Chicago area, and reports on the cruelty of detention conditions that echo those from other ICE facilities.

Before the clock struck 9, without warning and unprompted, federal agents fired pepper-spray projectiles and tear gas canisters into the crowd. Raven Geary, a journalist, collapsed after an agent shot her in the face with a pepper ball. Agents shot Stuart Hall, a 66-year-old Army veteran, six times with pepper balls though he wasn’t advancing toward the facility. He showed me his bruises, still red a week later.

As the gas thickened, my friend grabbed my shoulder and pulled me out. We stumbled past a journalist doubled over, cameras pressed to his chest, shouting that he couldn’t see. We poured water over our eyes, gasping.

On October 3, I returned to Broadview. This time local police and Illinois State Police joined federal agents in crowd control. I watched federal, state, and local officers violently shove protesters, hitting some with clubs.

Violence by State Police continued the following week. The National Lawyers Guild reported that State Police clubbed multiple legal observers over the October 10 weekend. Block Club Chicago also documented the state police’s increased presence and use of force; one demonstrator alleged State Police dragged him into the street and attacked him.

In an October 20 filing opposing the Trump administration’s attempt to overturn a lower court’s decision blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, Attorney General Kwame Raoul highlighted ICE’s praise of state law enforcement. He cited an email from Peter Sukmanowski, assistant director of ICE’s Chicago field office, in which Sukmanowski wrote that ICE was “grateful for the leadership” of the Illinois State Police.

There is a very stark disconnect here. Illinois bars state and local law enforcement from assisting civil immigration enforcement, yet local police have joined federal agents in attacking protesters.

Especially in Illinois, this touches a very raw nerve. Less than 60 years ago, officials at the local, state, and federal level worked together to repress Black political leaders. That collaboration culminated in the shocking police killing of 21-year-old activist Fred Hampton in his bed. His name echoes through Chicago’s streets today, a symbol of how quickly “public order” can become the pretext for violence against those who speak out.

Operation Midway Blitz, and the response by federal agents and state and local police to those reacting to it, risks normalizing a level of state violence that should be unthinkable: unprovoked attacks on people expressing dissent, chemical irritants and projectile rounds aimed at journalists, legal observers beaten in the act of documentation, medics targeted while treating the injured.

The call for federal agents to halt the excessive use of force against protesters in Illinois is necessary, urgent, and growing. Governor J.B. Pritzker has publicly condemned the actions by Federal agents at Broadview and established the Illinois Advisory Commission to document complaints against federal agents and recommend reforms. Still, ensuring accountability requires more: state and local officials need to take active steps to ensure that their own forces are working to safeguard, not stymy, the rights to free expression and peaceful assembly.

Governor Pritzker, Attorney General Raoul, and the Illinois State Police should reaffirm—publicly and in practice—that state and local police protect the rights of protesters and stop responding to dissent with violence. The state government should take concrete steps to ensure the police do not deploy excessive use of force against protesters at Broadview; that they provide protesters with ample time, warning, and instructions when issuing dispersal orders; and that they refrain from arresting anyone simply for lawfully exercising their right to protest. The state should also conduct an independent investigation into the use of force by state and local law enforcement.

My phone continues to buzz with photos of protesters, of bruises, beatings, arrests, of violence incurred at the cost of speaking out. The brutality has revealed Illinoisans' enduring courage and compassion. The question is whether local and state officials will show theirs.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510CCA_ChicagoProtest_header%20image.jpg?h=c3919415&itok=F6purPF9,N,,2025-12-03 15:58:32.985622

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil liberties and immigrants rights groups in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

An email to the department after hours Tuesday was not immediately returned.

Officers making civil immigration arrests generally have to have an administrative warrant. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, they may make arrests without a warrant only if they have probable cause to believe the person is in the U.S. illegally and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained, according to Howell’s ruling.

The American Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs’ attorneys argued federal officers were frequently patrolling and setting up checkpoints in Washington, D.C., neighborhoods with large numbers of Latino immigrants and then stopping and arresting people indiscriminately.

They provided sworn declarations from people they say were arrested without warrants or a required assessment of flight risk and cited public statements by administration officials that they said showed the administration was not using the probable cause standard.

Attorneys for the administration denied it had a policy allowing such arrests.

Howell, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, said the plaintiffs had “established a substantial likelihood of an unlawful policy and practice by defendants of conducting warrantless civil immigration arrests without probable cause.”

“Defendants’ systemic failure to apply the probable cause standard, including the failure to consider escape risk, directly violates” immigration law and the Department of Homeland Security’s implementing regulations, she said.

In addition to blocking the policy, she ordered any agent who conducts a warrantless civil immigration arrest in Washington to document “the specific, particularized facts that supported the agent’s pre-arrest probable cause to believe that the person is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.”

Howell also required the government to submit that documentation to plaintiffs’ attorneys.

What We Know

Federal officials from all across President Donald Trump’s administration have become increasingly focused on Minnesota and its Somali community, which is the largest American Somali population in the country.

Trump and his administration have blamed the community for stealing “billions” of dollars from Minnesota, mainly referencing the Feeding Our Future fraud scandal. However, federal prosecutors put the estimated loss from those cases at around $250-$300 million, not in the billions. Factoring in other statewide fraud cases, a U.S. attorney acknowledged the scope of fraud could exceed $1 billion.

RELATED: Trump denigrates Walz, Omar, Somalis as feds focus on Minnesota

Many of the nearly 80 Feeding Our Future defendants are Somali, but most are U.S. citizens in the country legally, and the founder of Feeding Our Future, whom prosecutors called the ringleader, is white.

Last week, Trump directed the Department of Homeland Security to reconsider temporary protected status (TPS) for Somalia, affecting about 700 Somali nationals living in the U.S. The last count from Minnesota Compass showed nearly 80,000 Somali residents in Minnesota — roughly 1.3% of the state’s population — so fewer than 1% of those 80,000 residents have TPS. That means the vast majority are legal citizens, and over half were born in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Reaction

The federal focus has the Somali community on edge, with one community leader telling 5 EYEWITNESS NEWS that fearful calls pour in by the hour.

“We, the Somali community, are always against anyone who is breaking the law, and we would be supportive to treat those criminals, the way they should be. We don’t have anything against that,” Eid Ali said. “But I mean, this is a large community, and I don’t think it’s fair that we just characterize or just put a blanket on all of them to say that these are elements of criminals.”

RELATED: Minnesota leaders, community activists decry ‘scapegoating’ of Somalis through TPS threats

Many Minnesota officials — including Gov. Tim Walz, Rep. Ilhan Omar, state lawmakers and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul — have condemned the targeting of the Somali community by Trump and his administration, saying they’re “scapegoating.”

Homeland Security’s website lists a “do not travel” advisory for Somalia due to safety concerns amid ongoing civil war and political instability involving terrorist groups. That was a key reason Somalia first received the TPS designation more than 30 years ago in 1991.

Protesters rallied on Wednesday to end deportation flights from Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. Watch in the video player below:

U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, of Connecticut, said it is fortunate the mission was not compromised by Hegseth’s actions.

“Pete Hegseth’s behavior and lack of judgment would be a fireable offense for anyone else in the Department of Defense,” Himes said.

Pentagon knew boat attack left survivors but still launched follow-up strike, AP sources say

The Pentagon knew there were survivors after a September attack on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean Sea, but the U.S. military still carried out a follow-up strike. That’s according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss it publicly.

They say the rationale for the second strike was that it was needed to sink the vessel. The Trump administration says all 11 people aboard were killed. One of the people says what remains unclear was who ordered the strikes and whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was involved.

Former FDA officials denounce memo by current vaccine chief

A dozen prior leaders of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — appointed by Republicans and Democrats alike — issued a scathing denunciation of new FDA assertions casting doubt on vaccine safety.

The former officials say the agency’s plans to revamp how lifesaving vaccines for flu, COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases are handled — outlined in an internal FDA memo last week — would “disadvantage the people the FDA exists to protect, including millions of Americans at high risk from serious infections.”

“The proposed new directives are not small adjustments or coherent policy updates. They represent a major shift in the FDA’s understanding of its job,” the officials, former FDA commissioners and acting commissioners, wrote Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

White House says Trump stands by Hegseth after Pentagon watchdog report

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Wednesday that the Pentagon inspector general’s review of the Defense secretary’s use of the Signal messaging app affirms the administration’s statements that “no classified information was leaked, and operational security was not compromised.”

The review found that Hegseth has the ability to declassify material and did not find that he did so improperly. But it did find that he put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk when he shared sensitive information about a military strike against Yemen’s Houthi militants, according to two people familiar with its findings.

“President Trump stands by Secretary Hegseth,” Leavitt said in her statement.

Trump advisers to hold more talks with Ukraine negotiator on Thursday, AP source says

Witkoff and Kushner are set to meet Thursday with Ukraine’s lead negotiator, Rustem Umerov, in Miami for further Russia-Ukraine peace talks, according to a senior Trump administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The talks come as Trump said Witkoff and Kushner came away from their marathon session with Putin this week confident that the Russian leader wants to find an end to the conflict.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hinted at the possibility of further talks with U.S. officials during his nightly address Wednesday.

“Right now the world clearly feels that the possibility of ending the war exists, and it is necessary to support the existing activity in the talks with pressure on Russia. Exactly from such a combination everything depends — constructive diplomacy plus pressure on the aggressor. Both components work towards peace,” Zelenskyy said.

Trump criticizes Democrats’ ‘affordability’ message in Tennessee special election

Trump lamented that the Democratic nominee in Tuesday’s special congressional election “said it’s all about affordability” without going into “specifics.”

Republican Matt Van Epps won the Tennessee district by about 9 percentage points after Trump carried the district in 2024 by more than 20 points. But Trump maintained that Democrat Aftyn Behn “lost by a lot more than they thought.”

Behn sharply criticized economic policies that she said prioritize wealthy people and corporations throughout the campaign.

Trump, speaking at an Oval Office event announcing a cut in federal emissions standards, said that message was a “hoax” perpetuated by “great con people.”

Trump says Cuellar is ‘a respected person’ who was ‘treated very badly’

The president was asked if he spoke with GOP leaders in the House about pardoning the Democratic congressman and if it strengthened Cuellar’s reelection prospects.

Trump said, “It didn’t matter” and that Cuellar was targeted for his comments critical of immigration.

“He represents the people on the border and he saw what was happening,” Trump said.

Trump says his advisers believe Vladimir Putin wants to end war in Ukraine

“He would like to end the war — that was their impression,” Trump said Wednesday of special envoy Steve Witkoff and adviser Jared Kushner. “Their impression was very strongly that he’d like to make a deal.”

Trump’s comments came a day after Witkoff and Kushner, who is also the president’s son-in-law, met for more than five hours with Putin in Moscow for talks aimed at ending the Russia-Ukraine war.

Trump says administration will release video of Sept. 2 boat strike

The president was asked Wednesday if he would release video of a follow-up strike on an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean Sea in early September as Hegseth is facing bipartisan scrutiny over the operation.

“I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we'd certainly release. No problem,” Trump told reporters.

Family of Colombian man killed in US strike in the Caribbean files human rights challenge

The family of a Colombian man has filed the first formal challenge to U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats, arguing that his death was an extrajudicial killing.

The petition from the family of Alejandro Carranza says the military bombed his fishing boat on Sept. 15 in violation of human rights conventions. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights received the complaint Tuesday.

Although the Trump administration has said it supports the commission’s work, the U.S. does not recognize the jurisdiction of an international court associated with the commission, making any recommendations nonbinding.

The family’s attorney, Daniel Kovalik, said Carranza’s four children and spouse want to be compensated as their loved one was their primary breadwinner.

Pentagon says Hegseth is exonerated by investigation into his use of Signal

The Pentagon says Hegseth was absolved by the inspector general’s investigation into his use of the Signal messaging app to discuss sensitive military information.

“The Inspector General review is a TOTAL exoneration of Secretary Hegseth and proves what we knew all along — no classified information was shared,” Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement. “This matter is resolved, and the case is closed.”

Trump lets top auto executives praise his emissions standards changes

During an Oval Office event announcing a cut in federal emissions standards, Trump gave the leaders of major carmakers a chance to speak.

That included Ford CEO Jim Farley and Antonio Filosa, CEO of Stellantis, who said the new standards will be reconciled with “real customer demand.”

Trump slammed Biden-era standards meant to help combat climate change.

But Trump also used the event to talk up steep tariffs he has imposed on top U.S. trade partners. Some automotive industry leaders have opposed the tariffs, arguing that it has driven up the price of producing vehicles.

Archbishop of the military services warns against illegal acts by U.S. forces

Archbishop Timothy Broglio, who oversees the Catholic chaplains ministering to the U.S. military, urged service members Wednesday to adhere to the rule of law during its campaign to curtail drug smuggling.

“In the fight against drugs, the end never justifies the means, which must be moral, in accord with the principles of the just war theory, and always respectful of the dignity of each human person,” Broglio said in a statement.

“As the moral principle forbidding the intentional killing of noncombatants is inviolable, it would be an illegal and immoral order to kill deliberately survivors on a vessel who pose no immediate lethal threat to our armed forces,” Broglio said.

His comments come after a follow-up strike on an alleged drug-carrying boat in the Caribbean Sea in early September. On Tuesday, Hegseth defended the action, citing the “fog of war.”

Bovino touches down in Louisiana amid immigration operation

The Border Patrol commander arrived in the New Orleans area Wednesday as federal agents launched their operation.

Bovino was sighted by The Associated Press at a Home Depot parking lot in Kenner, a suburb of New Orleans where Hispanic residents account for about 30% of the municipality’s population.

Bovino, who wore a uniform and was surrounded by agents with their faces covered, has made headlines for leading large-scale, high-profile immigration enforcement campaigns — including the operation in Chicago where federal agents rappelled from a helicopter into a residential apartment complex.

MyPillow founder Mike Lindell files paperwork to run for governor of Minnesota

Lindell, a prominent backer of President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election was stolen, filed the paperwork with the Minnesota campaign board Wednesday.

But Lindell told The Associated Press that it’s “not 100%” sure yet he will run. He said he filed because the person who would run his campaign told him they needed to get things going now so he could hit the ground running.

Lindell said he’ll make his announcement on Dec. 11 at MyPillow headquarters in the Minneapolis suburbs. He noted that he previously said he was 99% sure and added that that hasn’t changed.

Hegseth was previously pressed by lawmakers about how he’d respond to the investigation

Hegseth told Fox News Channel in April that what he shared over Signal was “informal, unclassified coordinations, for media coordinations and other things.”

During a congressional hearing in June, Hegseth was pressed multiple times by lawmakers over whether he shared classified information and if he should face accountability if he did.

Rep. Seth Moulton, a Massachusetts Democrat and Marine veteran, asked Hegseth whether he would hold himself accountable if the inspector general found that he placed classified information on Signal.

Hegseth would not directly say, only noting that he serves “at the pleasure of the president.”

Lawmakers had called for the inspector general investigation in Hegseth’s Signal use

The revelations of the administration’s use of Signal sparked intense scrutiny, with Democratic lawmakers and a small number of Republicans saying Hegseth posting the information to the chats before the military jets had reached their targets, potentially put those pilots’ lives at risk.

They said lower-ranking members of the military would have been fired for such a lapse.

The inspector general opened its investigation into Hegseth at the request of the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, and the committee’s top Democrat, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island.

Some veterans and military families also raised concerns, citing the strict security protocols they must follow to protect sensitive information.

New name on the US Institute of Peace

The U.S. Institute of Peace, initially targeted by an executive order by the president and the Department of Government Efficiency, has a new name on its former headquarters: Donald J. Trump.

The president’s name is now above “The Institute of Peace” on the building.

In March, the president fired the board and the staff was dismissed. The building was handed to the General Services Administration. A federal district court overturned the action in May, but a federal appeals court reversed it weeks later. Employees have been fired twice, and the building is back with the GSA.

It is unclear when the president’s name appeared. Attempts to reach a spokesperson for the former employees were not immediately answered.

A refresher on Signalgate

In at least two separate Signal chats, Hegseth provided the exact timings of warplane launches and when bombs would drop — before the men and women carrying out those attacks on behalf of the United States were airborne.

Hegseth’s use of the app came to light when a journalist, Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic, was inadvertently added to a Signal text chain by then-national security adviser Mike Waltz.

It included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and others, brought together to discuss March 15 military operations against the Iran-backed Houthis.

Hegseth had created another Signal chat with 13 people that included his wife and brother where he shared similar details of the same strike, The Associated Press reported.

Pentagon watchdog says Hegseth’s use of Signal posed risk to US personnel

The Pentagon’s watchdog found that Hegseth put U.S. personnel and their mission at risk when he used the Signal messaging app to convey sensitive information about a military strike against Houthi militants in Yemen, two people familiar with the findings said Wednesday.

Hegseth, however, has the ability to declassify material and the report did not find he did so improperly, according to one of the people familiar with the report’s findings who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the information. CNN first reported the initial findings.

The review by the Pentagon inspector general’s office was delivered to lawmakers, who were able to review the report in a classified facility at the Capitol.

Top immigration officials tout arrival of federal agents to New Orleans

As the immigration enforcement operation launched in the New Orleans area Wednesday, some of the nation’s top immigration officials chimed in on social media.

“We are here arresting criminals who should not be here,” Bovino posted on X. The Border Patrol commander, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, described Louisiana’s state and local law enforcement as “excellent partners.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X that agents will remove “the worst of the worst” from New Orleans.

Lawmakers reviewing report on Pete Hegseth’s use of Signal

The inspector general of the Department of Defense has delivered a report reviewing the defense secretary’s use of a Signal chat in March to discuss pending military strikes in Yemen.

Senators were able to review the report in a classified facility at the Capitol and a partially redacted version of the report was expected to be released publicly later this week.

The report’s findings are not known, but its arrival on Capitol Hill adds to the scrutiny on Hegseth. Another congressional investigation is examining whether an operation in international waters near Venezuela violated military code of conduct by firing on the survivors of an initial strike that destroyed a boat allegedly carrying drugs.

Louisiana’s Republican governor welcomes federal police

Republican Gov. Jeff Landry is a close Trump ally who has moved to align state policy with the White House’s enforcement agenda.

He said Wednesday that the crackdown will target the “worst of the worst, criminal illegal aliens that have broken the law.”

“It started today and it’s going to run until we get them all off the street,” Landry said during an interview on the Walton & Johnson radio show.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino is expected to lead New Orleans enforcement, which aims to arrest 5,000 people.

Trump plans to weaken vehicle mileage rules that limit air pollution

The plan, to be announced later Wednesday, would ease pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. It would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements through the 2031 model year.

The move would be the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The Republican administration says the new rules would increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

Word about Trump’s impending action comes from several people familiar with the White House plans. They’re not authorized to discuss the matter publicly because the proposal hasn’t been announced.

Louisiana immigrant rights group challenges new law in court

A Louisiana immigrant rights group asked a judge Wednesday to declare the new state law unconstitutional, with critics arguing that the legislation could be used to punish protesters or silence opponents of the Trump administration’s federal immigration crackdown that ramped up Wednesday.

The law took, which took effect in August, expands the crime of obstruction of justice to include anyone who “knowingly” commits “any act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart” federal immigration enforcement efforts.

In that lawsuit filed in a Louisiana federal court, New Orleans-based nonprofit Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy called the law vague. Out of fear of violating the law, they’ve stopped hosting “Know Your Rights” workshops.

Treasury secretary says China on track to meet soybean purchase commitments

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is on track to buy millions of tons of American soybeans even though the purchases so far are much lower than promised.

The White House has said China committed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans by January and at least 25 million tons per year for each of the next three years.

“They are in a perfect cadence to complete that goal,” Bessent said Wednesday at the DealBook Summit.

But reports from the Agriculture Department show that China has only bought 2.251 million tons of soybeans so far.

Bessent said he thinks China’s immediate purchase commitment of 12 million metric tons should be completed by the end of February. Chinese officials have not confirmed the specific purchase promises.

Trump administration takes aim at the New Orleans’ immigration policies

Attorney General Pam Bondi has accused New Orleans of undermining federal immigration enforcement. The Department of Justice includes New Orleans in a list of 18 cities it considers to be providing sanctuary to immigrants without legal status.

New Orleans officials deny the city’s policies thwart federal immigration enforcement. City police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick has said she considers immigration enforcement to be a civil matter outside her jurisdiction.

House Democrats release photos and videos of Epstein’s private island

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are releasing 14 photos and videos of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, showing empty courtyards, a bedroom and other rooms from his villa.

Congress is pressing the Trump administration to release all of its case files on the sex trafficking investigation into the late financier. Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, said he was releasing the images “to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein’s horrific crimes.”

The Department of Justice has until mid-December to comply with legislation passed by Congress and signed by Trump to publicly release many of its documents on Epstein.

Federal agents launch immigration crackdown in New Orleans

The crackdown began Wednesday in New Orleans under an operation that a Homeland Security official said would target violent criminals, expanding the Trump administration’s sweeps that have unfolded in other U.S. cities.

The aim of the operation is to capture immigrants who were released after their arrests for crimes such as home invasion, armed robbery and rape, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

She didn’t say how many agents would be deployed under the operation. Louisiana has been preparing for weeks for an immigration crackdown that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has said he would welcome.

“Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,” McLaughlin said. “

Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, and his wife, ending the congressman’s multi-year federal legal battle.
This decision clears the air and lets us move forward for South Texas.
“I did not launch my campaign because Congressman Cuellar was in trouble, I am running because South Texas is in trouble,” Tijerina said in a statement.
“Henry stopped fighting for South Texas years ago, instead working for his DC bosses and their special interests.
But in pardoning Cuellar, Trump — who called Cuellar “beloved” in his post — has neutered one of Republicans’ best arguments.","WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced he will pardon U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo, and his wife, ending the congressman’s multi-year federal legal battle. Cuellar had faced a dozen charges of bribery, money laundering and conspiracy.

In Trump’s pardon, shared Wednesday morning via Truth Social, the president said that the Democratic congressman had been punished by a weaponized Department of Justice under former president Joe Biden for speaking out against the administration’s border policy.

“Sleepy Joe went after the Congressman, and even the Congressman’s wonderful wife, Imelda, simply for speaking the TRUTH,” Trump wrote.

Cuellar also on Wednesday filed for reelection as a Democrat, quieting speculation that he planned to switch parties. On the House floor Wednesday afternoon, numerous Democratic colleagues greeted Cuellar warmly, hugging him and shaking his hand.

Cuellar’s legal controversy began in 2022, during the Biden administration, when the FBI raided his home and office as part of a federal probe investigating the diplomatic practices of Azerbaijan. Cuellar and his wife were indicted by the Department of Justice in 2024 on 12 counts of bribery, conspiracy and money laundering centering the congressman’s alleged acceptance of nearly $600,000 in bribes from the Central Asian country and a Mexican commercial bank. The indictment alleged that the money was laundered through shell companies owned by Imelda Cuellar, and that the congressman subsequently pushed policy benefitting Azerbaijani interests.

Cuellar’s trial was set to begin in September, but a federal judge had moved the date to April — after the March primary but before what is set to be a competitive general election. Throughout his legal ordeal, he has maintained that he is innocent.

The case had already ensnared two of Cuellar’s political advisers, who pled guilty to conspiring with Cuellar to launder over $200,000 in bribes from a Mexican bank.

With Trump’s pardon, Cuellar will no longer face any legal ramifications related to the bribery case.

“I want to thank President Trump for his tremendous leadership and for taking the time to look at the facts,” Cuellar said in a statement on X. “I thank God for standing with my family and I during this difficult time. This decision clears the air and lets us move forward for South Texas.

“This pardon gives us a clean slate,” he continued. “The noise is gone. The work remains. And I intend to meet it head on. Thank you Mr. President, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.”

The president, who himself faced numerous indictments after his first term, has pursued a spree of pardons and commutations since taking office again in January. He has issued over 1,500 pardons to Jan. 6 defendants, white collar criminals, associates and now, a sitting Democratic congressman. In October, he commuted GOP Rep. George Santos’s prison sentence for wire fraud and identity theft.

Trump said the pardon would also apply to Imelda Cuellar. In his post, the president attached a Nov. 12 letter to him from Cuellar’s daughters requesting clemency for their parents and suggesting that their dad’s “independence and honesty” on border policy “may have contributed to how this case began.”

“President Trump, you once publicly said that you believed the indictment was wrong — and later, at a White House picnic, you told me personally, as you pointed to my father, that he was a ‘good man’,” Catherine and Christina Cuellar wrote in their letter. “Those words meant more than you could ever know.”

Trump echoed the Cuellar daughters’ belief about Cuellar’s border stance in his post.

“For years, the Biden Administration weaponized the Justice System against their Political Opponents, and anyone who disagreed with them,” Trump wrote. “One of the clearest examples of this was when Crooked Joe used the FBI and DOJ to ‘take out’ a member of his own Party after Highly Respected Congressman Henry Cuellar bravely spoke out against Open Borders, and the Biden Border ‘Catastrophe.’”

The longtime Laredo congressman, an institution in South Texas who has survived significant electoral challenges in both primaries and general elections, is one of Republicans’ top targets in 2026. Cuellar was already representing a seat that Trump had won by 7 percentage points; Texas Republicans aimed to make his reelection more difficult by redrawing his district to have favored Trump by 10 percentage points. One of the most moderate Democrats in the House and the only federally elected anti-abortion Democrat left in the party, Cuellar had survived every electoral challenge he had faced, including last cycle, as South Texas voters shifted right and his indictment was made public.

This cycle, he is facing a serious Republican opponent — Webb County Judge Tano Tijerina, a former Democrat, who announced his candidacy Tuesday and noted that Cuellar was facing “serious federal corruption accusations that have shaken the trust of the people he is supposed to serve,” in a statement announcing his candidacy.

On Wednesday, Tijerina said his campaign was never contingent on Cuellar’s legal troubles.

“I did not launch my campaign because Congressman Cuellar was in trouble, I am running because South Texas is in trouble,” Tijerina said in a statement. “Henry stopped fighting for South Texas years ago, instead working for his DC bosses and their special interests. That isn’t South Texas values.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CNN he agreed with the president’s pardon, even if he didn’t understand his motivation.

“The reality is this indictment was very thin to begin with,” Jeffries said. “I don’t know why the president decided to do this. I think the outcome was exactly the right outcome.”

Both Speaker Mike Johnson and National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson told Axios they did not know that Trump planned to pardon Cuellar. But Johnson told a group of reporters that he did not think it would make Republicans’ effort to hold the House majority in 2026 more difficult.

“No, that has no effect on us at all,” Johnson said. “That’s a very competitive district, and we’ll have a strong candidate in that district, and we’ll win, because we have a great record to run on.”

Republicans in Texas and in Washington have routinely brought up Cuellar’s legal woes in their campaign against him. But in pardoning Cuellar, Trump — who called Cuellar “beloved” in his post — has neutered one of Republicans’ best arguments.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) during his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, calling the congresswoman “garbage” and saying he doesn’t want Somali immigrants in the country.

In a conversation about immigration policy, the president unleashed a pointed attack on the progressive Minnesota congresswoman, who became a U.S. citizen 25 years ago after fleeing a civil war in Somalia when she was eight years old.

“We could go one way or the other, and we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country,” Trump said. “Ilhan Omar is garbage. She’s garbage. Her friends are garbage. These aren’t people who work. These aren’t people who say, ‘Let’s go, come on, let’s make this place great.’”

“These are people that do nothing but complain,” Trump said, adding, “When they come from hell, and they complain and do nothing but b—-, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”

At another point, Trump said Somalia “stinks, and we don’t want them in our country. I can say that about other countries too.”

The remarks come amid reports that federal authorities are preparing a targeted immigration enforcement operation focusing on Somali immigrants in Minnesota living unlawfully in the country.

Trump has also attacked Omar on multiple occasions in recent months. Last month, he mocked her for quoting the Constitution excessively and becoming involved in U.S. politics. He repeated that sentiment in his remarks on Tuesday.

“When I see somebody like Ilhan Omar, who I don’t know at all, but I always watch her — for years, I’ve watched her — complain about our Constitution, how she’s being treated badly, our Constitution, the United States of America is a bad place, hates everybody, hates Jewish people, hates everybody. And I think she’s an incompetent person. She’s a real terrible person,” Trump said during the Cabinet meeting.

Omar brushed off the attack in a response on social media Tuesday afternoon.

“His obsession with me is creepy. I hope he gets the help he desperately needs,” she said, in response to a clip of his remarks.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25282592716647-e1764685681847.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-03 19:56:54.129078

Here is the abstract:

The notion of “exceptionalism” has characterized immigration law for more than a century. Many constitutional and other traditional norms do not apply in the realm of immigration law. Venue, as prescribed and practiced in Immigration Courts, is yet another example of outlier conduct. Venue, a standard litigation norm, has been seriously perverted. Instead of protecting the parties involuntarily brought into Immigration Court, the immigration venue regulation vests exclusive authority in the government. As a consequence, the government not only has the sole power to initiate hearings about deportability, but it can also choose when and where to locate the proceedings. This allows the government to capitalize on geographical and legal advantages; it incentivizes forum shopping for venues with immigrant-unfriendly law in locations that maximally inconvenience the noncitizen.

Using the highly publicized deportation proceedings against Mahmoud Khalil as an exemplar of this largely invisible aspect of immigration law, this Article describes and exposes immigration venue exceptionalism, the significant role it plays, the unfairness that has developed in recent years, and the urgent need for reform. It outlines a proposal to bring venue for Immigration Court back in line with general venue provisions that apply in U.S. courts. Immigration venue, like venue in general federal litigation, should presumptively be located in the geographic region where the responding party resides or where the underlying conduct took place. If venue is situated elsewhere, a motion to change venue should presumptively be granted in order to achieve proper venue. This approach offers a strategy to restore venue determinations to the pre-remote hearing era when removal proceedings generally took place where the noncitizen was located.

“Immigration Venue Exceptionalism” follows a simple formula: identify a discrete problem, analyze that problem, and propose a solution. But behind that tried-and-true structure lies a wealth of eye-opening analysis. Perhaps particularly interesting for those coming to immigration law from the outside is the authors’ discussion of the rise of remote hearings and its implications for immigration venue. With an argument pushed forward by reference to recent events, and the Mahmoud Khalil proceedings in particular, the article also makes for an engaging and smooth read, all the more impressive given that it’s ultimately a clear-eyed effort to grapple with the realities of the United States’ immigration machinery.",https://www.yalejreg.com/wp-content/themes/bedstone/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-12-03 14:57:48.168878

Why it matters: The operation, reported to target about 5,000 arrests, marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities.
Between the lines: Federal consent rulings have long barred both the New Orleans Police Department and the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office from supporting federal immigration enforcement, putting them at odds with a 2024 Louisiana law requiring such cooperation.
Suburban law enforcement agencies, such as those in Kenner and Gretna, however, have assisted in immigration efforts, including as recently as last week.
The agencies' goal is ""to deter assaults on federal officers and attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions,"" the press release says.","The Department of Homeland Security formally launched an immigration enforcement blitz it's calling ""Operation Catahoula Crunch"" in New Orleans on Wednesday.

Why it matters: The operation, reported to target about 5,000 arrests, marks the latest escalation in the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in Democratic-led cities.

The big picture: The move follows weeks of speculation that Border Patrol agents would pivot to New Orleans after similar federal surges in Chicago and Charlotte.

The Trump administration is also pursuing a crackdown on Somali immigrants in Minneapolis this week.

Zoom in: Rumors of a DHS crackdown led by Border Patrol authorities — initially referred to as ""Swamp Sweep"" — began swirling about two weeks ago.

DHS officials declined most comment on those reports but confirmed in a Wednesday news release a plan ""targeting criminal illegal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies.""

""Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto, and rape,"" said DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin in the news release.

Reality check: Similar surges in other cities have mostly swept up people with no criminal records, according to reports.

Between the lines: Federal consent rulings have long barred both the New Orleans Police Department and the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office from supporting federal immigration enforcement, putting them at odds with a 2024 Louisiana law requiring such cooperation.

Suburban law enforcement agencies, such as those in Kenner and Gretna, however, have assisted in immigration efforts, including as recently as last week.

By the numbers: The New Orleans metropolitan area's population is about 10% foreign-born, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey, with most located in neighboring Jefferson Parish.

What they're saying: Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry (R) told Fox News he supported federal operations and was ""welcoming them to come in.""

New Orleans Mayor-elect Helena Moreno, however, decried the move and offering legal guidance for residents on her transition team's website. Born in Mexico, she will be the city's first Hispanic leader.

With NOPD's consent decree ending about two weeks ago, department superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick said she does not plan to assist immigration enforcement, calling it a civil not a criminal issue.

The FBI New Orleans Field Office and Louisiana State Police also announced a joint effort Wednesday to support the federal crackdown, according to a press release.

The agencies' goal is ""to deter assaults on federal officers and attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions,"" the press release says.

FBI agents ""will be on the streets ... to investigate and arrest anyone assaulting law enforcement officers, unlawfully impeding federal law enforcement activity, or assisting anyone to commit this criminal activity,"" said special agent in charge Jonathan Tapp.

What we're watching: ICE enforcement in other Democratic-led cities has resulted in heightened and sometimes explosive tensions and confusion between the agents and residents.

In last week's Gretna arrest, for example,agents cited a struck-down law when telling someone filming their actions to step back to 25 feet.

New Orleanians have already begun protests over the past several days, and some local businesses have posted signs denying agents entry.

From Yury Ushakov, a top aide to Putin: “We agree with some of them, as the president has told our interlocutors, while other elements elicited some criticism,” Ushakov said, “and the president made no secret of our critical and even negative attitude towards some of the proposals.”

🗳️ IN TENNESSEE

When a loss is really a win — and a win feels like a loss:

Republican Matt Van Epps is projected to win the Tennessee 7th Congressional District special election. While that should be a victory for Republicans, the margins are worrisome for the GOP.

Trumpwon this district in 2024 by 22 points. As of this morning, Matt Van Epps is leading by roughly 9 points, a relatively narrow margin. That means roughly 13 percent of GOP voters in this very red district shifted their support to Democrat Aftyn Behn.

This race is seen as a key metric of voter enthusiasm ahead of the 2026 midterms. Washington leaders poured a lot of resources into it. Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), former Vice President Kamala Harris and the president each campaigned for their respective candidates.

But it’s not all bad for the GOP: The Hill’s Caroline Vakil pointed out: “Republicans have their own reasons to feel encouraged. In spite of a challenging midterm environment next year, the GOP is still eyeing several states where it could redraw maps. And if the Supreme Court makes an early enough ruling that guts the Voting Rights Act, that could allow a slew of Southern states to redraw their maps before 2026 as well.”

‘House Republicans have an exodus problem’:

“More than two dozen GOP lawmakers have already announced their decision to leave their seats at the end of the term, and the number is expected to grow in the coming weeks as lawmakers visit their families for the holidays, complicating Republican efforts to fend off a blue wave and keep their slim majority,” report The Hill’s Sudiksha Kochi and Mike Lillis.

Why?: Lawmakers have their usual reasons for retiring. “But the numbers are on track to reach 2018 levels — when Republicans got clobbered — and the dynamic is creating huge headaches for GOP leaders scrambling to protect President Trump from a Democratic House in his final years in office.”

The numbers: “23 House Republicans so far are retiring or seeking another office, while four Republicans have chosen to resign. In comparison, 17 Democrats are retiring or seeking another office.”

Republicans are not letting the boat strike controversy go:

“Republican senators are demanding answers about who at the Pentagon ordered a follow-up strike to kill the initial survivors of a missile strike against a suspected Venezuelan drug boat on Sept. 2, a potential violation of international law,” reports The Hill’s Alexander Bolton.

It’s a big deal: “A growing number of Republican senators on Tuesday said targeting defenseless survivors clinging to the wreckage of a ship is unacceptable and undercuts the United States’s long tradition of following strict rules of engagement during military operations.”

The changes were outlined in a policy memo posted Tuesday on the website of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency tasked with processing and approving all requests for immigration benefits.

The pause puts on hold a wide range of immigration-related decisions such as green card applications or naturalizations for immigrants from those 19 countries that the Trump administration has described as high-risk. It's up to the agency's director, Joseph Edlow, on when to lift the pause, the memo said.

The administration in June banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access for those from seven others, citing national security concerns.

The ban applied to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen while the restricted access applied to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

At the time, no action was taken against immigrants from those countries who were already in the U.S. before the travel ban went into effect.

But now the news from USCIS means those people already in the U.S. — regardless of when they arrived — will come under extra scrutiny.

The agency said it would conduct a comprehensive review of all ""approved benefit requests"" for immigrants who entered the country during the Biden administration.

The agency cited the shooting of two National Guard troops by a suspect who is an Afghan national as a reason for the pause and heightened scrutiny for people from those countries. One National Guard soldier was killed and another wounded in the Thanksgiving week shooting near the White House.

""In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,"" the agency said.

The agency said in the Tuesday memo that within 90 days it would create a prioritized list of immigrants for review and if necessary, referral to immigration enforcement or other law enforcement agencies.

Since the shooting, the administration has announced a flurry of decisions it was taking to scrutinize immigrants already in the country and those seeking to come to the U.S.

Last week, the director of USCIS said in a social media post that his agency would be reexamining green card applications for people from countries ""of concern."" But the policy directive Tuesday goes further and lays out in more detail the scope of who will be affected.

USCIS also said last week that it was pausing all asylum decisions, and the State Department said it was halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, USCIS said in a separate memo that the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

Critics have said that the Trump administration's actions have amounted to collective punishment for immigrants.

California is fighting back after President Donald Trump’s administration instigated homeless housing cuts that local service providers said would be ""devastating.""

Two recently filed lawsuits accuse the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of illegally going over Congress’ head to make massive changes to the way federal homelessness funds are distributed.

“HUD’s new grant rules would effectively defund permanent supportive housing and rapid rehousing programs across the nation, eliminating proven tools that help residents exit homelessness sustainably,” Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti said in a statement. “This is another instance of the Trump administration prioritizing its political agenda above the needs of our most vulnerable community members.”

Santa Clara County and San Francisco sued the Trump administration this week, in conjunction with the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition. A separate lawsuit was filed last week by Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration and a handful of other states. It marked the 47th time California sued the Trump administration in 44 weeks.

Now, homeless service providers are waiting anxiously to see how the litigation plays out and wondering if the impending legal battle will further delay the money they desperately need.

“It’s just the matter of how long it’s going to take that concerns me,” said Robert Ratner, director of Santa Cruz County’s Housing for Health, which coordinates the county’s homelessness response. “Because while we’re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.”

The Department of Housing and Urban Development did not respond to a request for comment.

In a statement last month, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said the changes are aimed at “stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values, and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”

At issue are changes the Trump administration made to its funding policy last month. Jurisdictions applying for a piece of about $4 billion in federal homelessness funds now can’t spend more than 30% of that money on permanent housing — a significant decrease. Los Angeles County, for example, currently spends more than 80% on permanent housing. Instead, the federal government wants localities to prioritize emergency shelter and temporary housing programs that require participants to be sober or participate in treatment.

While shelters offer a temporary respite from the streets, permanent housing can end someone’s homelessness. For years, the federal government has prioritized funding permanent housing using the “housing first” method — a strategy that moves people into housing as quickly as possible, without requiring them to first get sober or agree to addiction treatment. Veering away from both of those principles marks a major policy shift.

Last year, California communities won more than $683 million in federal homelessness funds through what is called the Continuum of Care program. About 90% of that went to permanent housing projects, which currently house tens of thousands of Californians, according to Newsom. The new rule threatens to put those people back out onto the street, he said in a news release.

While we’re waiting for these issues to get resolved, we have programs that are going to run out of money to support people.

— Robert Ratner, director, Housing for Health

The new policy also prohibits the use of federal funds for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients, and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely. And it gives preference for projects in cities, counties and states that ban homeless encampments.

Both lawsuits allege that the Trump administration’s funding changes violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the Constitution by defying the rules Congress set out for distributing the funds. Congress authorized a two-year grant cycle in 2024, meaning local jurisdictions wouldn’t have to reapply for funds in 2025. The Trump administration flouted that decision when it suddenly forced jurisdictions to reapply, the lawsuits allege.

The lawsuits also claim the administration didn’t go through proper protocol before enacting the changes to its funding strategy, which would have included giving cities and counties more time to comply with the new rules, and allowing stakeholders to comment on the changes.

In Santa Cruz County, Ratner is of two minds about the lawsuits. On one hand, he believes the abrupt way the Trump administration rolled out the funding changes was “very inappropriate.” But he worries a lengthy court battle could tie up funds his county needs to pay people’s rents.

The National Alliance to End Homelessness sued the Trump administration over similar allegations tied to a smaller, $75 million pot of homelessness funding in September. A judge sided with the Alliance, and temporarily barred the federal government from distributing those funds. But now that money is frozen, unable to help unhoused residents as the case moves forward.

Ratner worries that could happen again in this case. Santa Cruz County is set to start hitting serious financial problems as soon as February, Ratner said. That’s when a $1.2 million supportive housing grant, which currently houses about 50 people in different apartments around the county, is set to expire.

The Trump administration doesn’t expect to start awarding Continuum of Care money until May. It’s unclear how the lawsuits will affect that timeline.

In the meantime, Ratner and other homeless service providers are trying to remain optimistic.

“At this point, we don’t know how long the litigation process will take, but we’re hopeful it leads to a more workable path forward,” Sacramento Steps Forward CEO Lisa Bates said in a statement. “Of course, any delay in federal funding would have real impacts on communities across the country, including ours, to operate shelters, rapid rehousing, permanent supportive housing, and essential system coordination.”

Santa Monica-based doctor Salvador Plasencia was sentenced Wednesday to 30 months years in federal prison for his role in the overdose death of Friends actor Matthew Perry.

He was also ordered to pay a $5,600 fine and immediately placed in federal custody.

Perry died Oct. 28, 2023, in his Los Angeles home. The L.A. County medical examiner determined the cause was “acute effects of ketamine.” Plasencia pleaded guilty to four felony charges in July for distributing the drug.

“Rather than do what was best for Mr. Perry — someone who had struggled with addiction for most of his life — [Plasencia] sought to exploit Perry’s medical vulnerability for profit,” prosecutors argued in a sentencing memorandum. “Indeed, the day [Plasencia] met Perry he made his profit motive known, telling a co-conspirator: ‘I wonder how much this moron will pay’ and ‘let’s find out.’”

Perry's mother and stepfather, Suzanne and Keith Morrison, called Plasencia among the ""most culpable"" of all.

""But this doctor conspired to break his most important vows, repeatedly, sneaked through the night to meet his victim in secret,"" the two wrote in a joint victim impact statement. ""For what, a few thousand dollars? So he could feed on the vulnerability of our son.""

How was Plasencia involved?

Plasencia admitted to selling Perry four vials of liquid ketamine and an open box of ketamine lozenges. Plasencia also admitted to traveling to Perry’s residence, injecting him with the drug and leaving at least one vial with Perry’s personal assistant.

Plasencia will be required to make restitution to Perry’s estate, according to his plea agreement.

His lawyers, Karen L. Goldstein and Debra S. White, said in a statement that Plasencia is not a villain.

""He is someone who made serious mistakes in his treatment decisions involving the off-label use of ketamine — a drug commonly used for depression that does not have uniform standards,"" the statement said. ""The mistakes he made over the 13 days during which he treated Mr. Perry will stay with him forever.""

Who else is involved?

He didn’t act alone, according to prosecutors. Plasencia is among five other people charged in Perry’s death, including Dr. Mark Chavez, who pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute ketamine.

Jasveen Sangha, a North Hollywood drug dealer known as “Ketamine Queen,” pleaded guilty in September to supplying the Friends actor with the drugs. She faces a maximum sentence of 65 years in federal prison. Her sentencing is set for Feb. 25. Chavez is scheduled for sentencing later this month.

The other two people involved, including Perry’s personal assistant, are scheduled for sentencing early next year.

Michael and Susan Dell will donate $6.25 billion to fund investment accounts for 25 million U.S. children, under a plan unveiled Tuesday. The money from their charitable funds would help to seed ""Trump Accounts"" ushered into law in July.

The gift would put $250 into each eligible child's account, which is meant to grow over time through investments in low-cost stock funds that track market indexes.

""The idea is to give millions of children a head start on saving for the future,"" Michael Dell told NPR. ""And we know that when children have accounts like this, even with modest sums, they have better outcomes in life.""

Michael Dell is the CEO of Dell Technologies.

Here's a brief guide to the accounts, and the Dells' plan:

Who would receive the Dells' gift?

To receive the Dell gift, children need to have Social Security numbers and be age 10 or under and born before Jan. 1, 2025.

Dell told NPR they're trying to reach kids who need the money the most, which is why the gift targets recipients who live in ZIP codes where the median income is less than $150,000.

The Dells say the gift will reach nearly 80% of children in the eligible age group, across 75% of ZIP codes in the U.S.

Parents need to create ""Trump Accounts"" to receive the gift

As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law this past summer, every American baby born from this year through 2028 is in line to automatically receive a Trump Account funded with $1,000 from the U.S. Treasury.

All kids under 18 who have a Social Security number can have one of the accounts — but they don't get that initial $1,000.

The Dell gifts are meant to help kids who are too old to receive that Treasury payment.

""What we're doing with this gift is targeting kids that are 10 and under that aren't part of the federal program,"" Dell said.

Susan Dell encouraged parents to ""mark their calendars for July 4, 2026, which is when they could claim the accounts for their children.""

How Trump Accounts work

Money in Trump Accounts would grow over time, using contributions to invest in low-cost stock funds that track market indexes. When the children turn 18, they can either convert the money into a retirement account or use the money for education, buying a home, or starting a business.

Parents and others can contribute up to $5,000 annually until the year the child turns 18.

Personal finance experts say the Trump Accounts are sort of a hybrid of existing plans. And the potential benefits would vary widely depending on how much a family can contribute.

According to the White House, maximum contributions to a Trump Account could make it worth nearly $1.1 million by the time a beneficiary is 28 years old. If no additional contributions are made, it could be worth far less: $18,100.

Essential details about how the Trump Accounts will be administered remain unknown. A recent update from Charles Schwab stated, ""At this time, it isn't clear who will open the account or where it will be held.""

The Los Angeles Unified School District is reporting a 4% drop in student enrollment compared with last year, a trend the district says is in part due to immigration raids that have terrorized LA communities.

For the 2025–26 school year, LAUSD enrolled 392,654 students, down from 409,108 the previous year, the district said. The numbers are nearly 2% below projections.

On top of the overall decrease, the district saw a “significant” decline in newcomer students who were born outside the United States.

“These declines reflect a climate of fear and instability created by ongoing immigration crackdowns, which disrupt family stability, housing, and mobility,” said LA schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho in a statement.

“When families are afraid to be seen, or when they cannot afford to remain in their communities, they are less likely to enroll, reenroll, or stay in public schools,” he added.

Carvalho said immigration fears are “exacerbating” other factors that were already contributing to statewide enrollment declines, including falling birth rates and rising housing costs.

LAUSD released numbers this week reflecting its annual count of actively enrolled students. The practice, known as “Norm Day,” takes place on the fifth or sixth Friday of the school year. This year, Norm Day fell on Friday, Sept. 19. The district then realigns its teacher workforce based on current student enrollment.

As far as newcomer students — those enrolled for three years or fewer in any U.S. school — the district’s 2023-24 end-of-year data show that 21,997 were enrolled in LAUSD. That number made up 5.2% of the student population.

In 2024-25, newcomer enrollment declined to 19,110 students, the district said. The downward trend continued in 2025–26, with recent data showing an additional decline of 1,768 students, bringing enrollment to 17,342 and reducing newcomers to 4.4% of the student population, according to LAUSD.

“While Newcomers have historically been a vibrant and growing part of our school communities, their enrollment has declined significantly over the past three years, with year-over-year decreases that mirror the uncertainty many families are living through,” Carvalho said.

In September, activists with the social justice group Centro CSO urged LAUSD to place a moratorium on potential staff displacements tied to declining student enrollment.

The Boyle Heights-based group said it was unfair for schools to make staffing decisions at a time when immigration raids have stoked fears across LA neighborhoods.

“ICE has had a chilling effect on our school communities and families, especially those with undocumented members [who] are understandably afraid to send their children to school, fearing detention, separation, or deportation,” the organization wrote in a letter addressed to LAUSD board members.

The district has not yet made it clear whether there will be any staffing changes in Eastside schools resulting from Norm Day.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0603594/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5807x3049+0+411/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F38%2F15%2F1d4ccd4345d7a8a017013c286fee%2Fap25335783393026.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 16:58:50.909085

Minnesota Senator Foung Hawj (DFL-St. Paul shared a statement condemning Trump's comments regarding the Somali community in Minnesota:

""President Trump’s racist, Islamophobic threats against Somali people endanger our neighbors. His words encourage violence toward people who came to this country seeking safety, prosperity and opportunities for their families.

11:40 a.m. - Minneapolis delegation on Trump targeting Somali-Minnesotans

The Minneapolis delegation of the Minnesota House of Representatives released a statement Wednesday in response to reports that ICE agents were being sent to Minneapolis to target Somali residents.

Here's the statement:

""Yesterday, the federal government unleashed terror on our community by abducting residents. ICE was seen in our neighborhoods, taking away vital members of our community. Residents across our city are now living in fear of targeted violence that makes us all less safe.

Donald Trump has used his platform to target members of our beloved Somali community. Because Donald Trump does not have any ideas to solve the affordability issues plaguing our communities, he can only try to distract from them by pitting Minnesotans against one another. Once again, his actions have no basis in reality or facts. The vast majority of Somali Minnesotans are citizens or permanent residents; his demands will not accomplish his goal. But once again, his words will inflame tensions, fuel racism, and endanger our neighbors.

""As the Minneapolis Delegation, we reject these efforts to sow division and terrorize our city. Somali Minnesotans are an essential and cherished part of our city and state. We cannot, and do not want to, imagine a Minneapolis without our Somali residents. They are our neighbors, family members, elected officials, doctors, teachers, and more. No matter what lies and bile Donald Trump spews about Minnesota’s Somali community, the simple truth is that our Somali neighbors make our state stronger. In the coming days, we will do everything we can to protect each other from this hostile federal government intent on dividing us.""

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that its targets would include violent criminals who were released after being arrested. For weeks, New Orleans, a city led by Democrats in a conservative state, had been nervously bracing for the agents’ arrival. Immigrant advocates had been warning residents to reduce their time outdoors as much as possible, given the outcomes of past operations in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, N.C.

Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official who was in charge of the operations in the three other cities, confirmed on X that his agents had arrived in New Orleans. Some were spotted at Home Depots on Wednesday afternoon.

Mr. Bovino and what he calls his “green team” have been criticized for their aggressive tactics in other cities, where agents were seen flooding grocery store parking lots frequented by Latinos, hanging around Home Depots to pick up undocumented people looking for work, and sometimes roughly detaining American citizens.

In announcing the New Orleans operation, the Trump administration said that it was pursuing “the worst of the worst” criminals who were in the country illegally, and included a list of 10 people it said had been released from local jails because of sanctuary city policies.

Most of the people detained in past operations, however, have not had criminal histories. In Charlotte, for example, where more than 370 people were arrested, only about 44 had criminal records, according to federal officials. The full scope of the arrested people’s crimes remains unclear.

Still, Mr. Bovino, who often engages with his critics and admirers on X, has posted on social media about a handful of the immigrants who he says have serious criminal records.

In New Orleans, immigration lawyers have warned clients and the wider immigrant community that the agents have been known to randomly approach people who look Hispanic, regardless of whether they have a criminal record.

Data shows that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than native-born Americans, but some argue that any crime committed by someone in the country illegally could have been prevented by stricter immigration enforcement.

Gov. Jeff Landry of Louisiana, a Republican, has welcomed the agents with open arms, telling Fox News last month that he hoped they could start “taking some of these dangerous criminal illegal aliens off of our streets.”

Helena Moreno, New Orleans’s Democratic mayor-elect who was born in Mexico, expressed wariness about what might come next.

“The reports of due process violations and potential abuses in other cities are concerning,” Ms. Moreno said in a statement before the operation began. “I want our community to be aware and informed of the protections available under law.”

As it has in its other deployments around the country, the Homeland Security Department gave its New Orleans operation a nickname: Catahoula Crunch. Critics have derided these seemingly whimsical names as discordant and offensive given the seriousness of the operations and the harshness of the department’s tactics.

The Louisiana State Police and the New Orleans field office of the F.B.I. announced on Wednesday that they would be collaborating “to deter assaults on federal officers and attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions” during the immigration enforcement operation.

The operation comes at the end of a remarkably challenging year for New Orleans. It began with a deadly terrorist attack in January, and over the summer the city’s mayor, LaToya Cantrell, was indicted on charges of using public funds to carry out a romantic relationship with her bodyguard, a city police officer.

New Orleans is also grappling with a budget crisis, and residents have criticized the city for becoming too economically dependent on tourism, which mostly provides low-wage jobs.

Many of the jobs in that industry are filled by immigrants.

Perhaps Trump has been freaking out more frequently because he senses his power draining away at an accelerated clip.
The lower courts’ and voters’ refusal to be cowed amounts to a calamity for a narcissist whose grip on power depends on fear and an aura of invincibility.","Donald Trump no doubt underestimated the power of lower federal courts, which may be the single biggest obstacle to his autocratic ambition. The Contrarian has covered a number of these humiliating court defeats, including failed efforts to repeal birthright citizenship, deploy National Guard to Chicago, and fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook.

The list of Trump defeats grows longer by the day. Consider:

The 3rd Circuit’s decision upholding disqualification of the faux U.S. attorney for New Jersey Alina Habba;

U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg’s resumption of criminal contempt proceedings in the District of Columbia; and

Rulings from 225 judges in more than 700 cases striking down ICE’s policy that “deprives people of an opportunity to seek release from an immigration court.”

These losses (in addition to his plunge in polls, the mass retirements of House Republicans, the Nov. 4 election shellacking, and more well-founded chatter about his mental and physical deterioration) may account for the increasing frequency of his unhinged outbursts.

In the Habba case, a 3rd Circuit panel of three judges (two appointed by President George W. Bush) unanimously ruled that since the 120-day period for the president to fill the U.S. attorney position with his appointed interim U.S. attorney (Habba) had run without Senate confirmation, she could not legally remain under the guise of “Acting U.S. Attorney.”

The court disallowed the maneuvers to preserve Trump’s power to appoint his personal attorney to the post after it became obvious that she would not be confirmed by the Senate. As recounted by the court: “(1) the President withdrew Habba’s nomination for U.S. Attorney; (2) Habba resigned as Interim U.S. Attorney; (3) the Attorney General issued an order appointing Habba as ‘Special Attorney’ to the Attorney General,” which purported to give her the same powers as a U.S. attorney.

The ruling disallowing Trump’s chicanery is critical in two respects. First, it serves to rebuff Trump’s frantic efforts to expand executive authority, thereby preserving the separation of powers (i.e., the Senate’s power to confirm nominees) that can block egregiously unqualified nominees. Second, the precedent will likely have ramifications in other cases challenging similarly unlawful maneuvers, including dismissal of the James Comey and Letitia James indictments based on the illegal appointment of Lindsey Halligan as U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. Thwarting Trump’s attempts to unlawfully elevate cronies eager to conduct his legal war of vengeance against his opponents is a major blow to Trump’s dictatorial game plan.

Meanwhile, Judge Boasberg is proceeding full steam ahead with a probe of the regime’s allegedly intentional violation of his order to pull back planes with deportees headed to El Salvador. ABC News reported on Boasberg’s order that the Trump regime submit declarations from everyone involved in the decision:

Justice Department attorneys had urged him to abandon the probe, but Boasberg said he must determine whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem or anyone else “should be referred for potential contempt prosecution.”

“In other words, the Court must decide if: (1) the court order was ‘clear and reasonably specific’; (2) ‘the defendant violated the order’; and (3) ‘the violation was willful,’” he wrote.

Justice Department attorneys said in a filing that Noem made the decision not to abide by the court’s order based on advice of the DHS’s acting attorney general. The DOJ’s declarations (or its failure to submit information as required) will determine if witnesses will be called to court to testify.

Noem’s assertion that she, not the courts, decides what is legal is precisely the sort of lawlessness and unconstitutional usurpation of Article III courts’ power that Boasberg’s inquiry may sanction. Frankly, the Trump regime’s habit of ignoring court orders has become all too frequent. Even absent a finding of criminal contempt, Boasberg’s investigation may empower other courts to crack down on Trump officials’ contemptuous conduct.

Finally, in addition to the slew of losses Trump has racked up in cases concerning deployment of the national guard and misconduct by federal agents, Politico reports that Trump’s unprecedented policy to “systematically lock up nearly all immigrants facing deportation proceedings” has been rejected by over 220 judges appointed by presidents of both parties (including 23 Trump-appointed judges) while only 8 judges (6 of whom Trump appointed) have sided with him. Politico’s report explains:

Courts, increasingly aware of the one-sided rejection of the administration’s policy, have grown exasperated by the deluge of litigation that has flooded their dockets. Some have made a partial accounting of the sheer volume of rulings against the administration. But even those don’t capture the breadth of rulings against the administration revealed on dockets across the country.

We have reached this point because the regime has abandoned 30 years of precedent “when it concluded that millions of immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for years could still be treated as ‘seeking admission’ to the country—subjecting them to mandatory detention typically only meant for new arrivals.”

Public opinion reflecting disapproval of Trump’s draconian immigration policy that plainly is not aimed at deporting the “worst of the worst” and his serial failures in court bode well for the rule of law and Americans’ long-standing belief about the positive role immigrants play in our communities.

If Trump thought his election was a green light to engage in a massive, lawless, and brutal reign of terror—with a goal of “reimmigration” (a term favored in European far-right parties for policies that amount to ethnic cleansing)—he misjudged the tenacity of lower federal courts and the decency of Americans (who have risen to the occasion in protests, rallies, and ongoing efforts to warn neighbors about ICE raids).

Perhaps Trump has been freaking out more frequently because he senses his power draining away at an accelerated clip. Among others, the lower courts have had it with him. Politically, some Republicans in Congress tentatively have begun standing up to him (e.g., insisting on the release of the Epstein files and an investigation into an alleged war crime or murder in the Caribbean), while voters and Contrarians like you have emphatically rejected him and MAGA at the polls.

The lower courts’ and voters’ refusal to be cowed amounts to a calamity for a narcissist whose grip on power depends on fear and an aura of invincibility.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said his agency will investigate allegations that money stolen from social services programs ""may have been diverted"" to the Al-Shabaab militant group in Somalia.

Similar claims about stolen state funds flowing to Al-Shabaab surfaced in 2018, in the context of fraud targeting a child care assistance program. The nonpartisan legislative auditor launched an investigation at the time but wasn't able to substantiate the allegations.

In the request, which followed ominous signs from the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, lawyers representing a consortium of media outlets and other plaintiffs said that Chicago’s immigration enforcement surge “has ended” for now, with no reports of any unconstitutional behavior by agents in nearly a month.

If the dismissal is granted, it would effectively end a case that came to symbolize the havoc Midway Blitz caused in Chicago and led to U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issuing a scathing ruling limiting the use of chemical munitions against journalists and protesters, among other restrictions.

In a statement Tuesday, the board for the Chicago Headline Club, the lead plaintiff in the case, claimed victory, saying that Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and his team of agents left town soon after Ellis’ injunction was entered on Nov. 8.

“To no one’s surprise, the federal government appealed, and the lower court’s preliminary injunction was stayed in the meantime,” the statement said. “Given that the Border Patrol and other federal agencies have reduced their presence for now, we don’t see a need to keep the court fight going. We’ll take the win.”

Lead plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Art said the litigation exposed the brutality behind the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and showed that its justifications for the use of force were “blatant lies.”

“Judge Ellis’s powerful opinion stands as the final word in this case, and as a defining document of our time,” Art, of the law firm Loevy & Loevy, said in a written statement.

According to the motion to dismiss, the Department of Justice has agreed to drop its appeal as long as Ellis dismisses the lawsuit “with prejudice,” meaning it cannot be refiled.

The decision to drop the case came after a conservative three-judge panel assigned to hear the appeal at the 7th Circuit issued an emergency stay of Ellis’ injunction last month. The court had issued an expedited briefing schedule and set arguments for later this month.

In asking the 7th Circuit for a stay, lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice wrote earlier this month that the case was a “perfect example” of a growing trend in the nation’s courts to issue sweeping injunctions that violate the separation of powers and “superintend law-enforcement activities under threat of contempt.”

In granting the stay, the 7th Circuit was clear that the government was likely to succeed on those arguments.

“The preliminary injunction entered by the district court is overbroad,” the order said. “In no uncertain terms, the district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them. … The practical effect is to enjoin all law enforcement officers within the Executive Branch.”

Ellis’ injunction was also too “prescriptive” in barring the “use of scores of riot control weapons and other devices in a way that resembles a federal regulation,” the appellate court order said.

All three judges on the panel hearing the appeal are Republican nominees. Judge Frank Easterbook was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, while Judge Michael Scudder and Judge Michael Brennan were each nominated by Trump in his first term.

While the judge’s warned not to read too much into its order for a stay, it was clear that the court was poised to severely limit — if not overturn — Ellis’ injunction, which could have greatly hampered any future efforts to rein in immigration enforcement practices should it pick up again in the spring.

In its statement Tuesday, the Chicago Headline Club said that it was “fully prepared to go to court again if federal agents return in force or if any activities of federal agents escalate into violations of our constitutional rights.”

The move to dismiss marked another twist in a legal battle that initially was drowned out by another court fight over President Donald Trump’s desire to dispatch National Guard troops to Chicago, which made national headlines leading up to U.S. District Judge April Perry’s temporary restraining order on Oct. 9.

As the National Guard issue moved to the back burner, the case before Ellis kept heating up, with repeated clashes in court over alleged violations by Border Control agents of a temporary restraining order the judge had entered in early October.

On Oct. 28, Ellis forced Bovino to come in to court to answer questions directly about the alleged violations and his understanding of her restraining order. At that hearing, she ordered Bovino to report daily to her in open court on any incidents on the streets — but the 7th Circuit quickly declared the move judicial overreach and a violation of the separation of powers.

The judge did, however, order Bovino and several other operational leaders to sit for lengthy sworn depositions. Transcripts and videos of the questioning later made public showed seven hours of terse and sometimes evasive answers from Bovino, punctuated by an occasional longer explanation about the allegedly violent mobs attacking and threatening immigration agents.

Ellis blasted Bovino for his antics and answers during his three-day deposition, issuing a scathing 233-page ruling earlier this month that described the tough-talking field general as “evasive” and accused him of “either providing ‘cute’ responses” or “outright lying.”

Among the lies, Ellis said, was Bovino’s claim that he’d been hit in the head with a rock before he deployed tear gas at protesters during a high-profile clash in the Little Village neighborhood in late October. It wasn’t until the third day of questioning that Bovino acknowledged that he was not hit by any rock.

Ellis written ruling took readers methodically through many of the high-profile melees between immigration agents and protesters during the two-month operation, including incidents in Albany Park, Old Irving Park, Evanston and the East Side.

It also revealed new information gleaned from body-worn cameras and other evidence showing how agents used tear gas and flash-bang grenades on fleeing protesters, shot a praying minister in the face with pepper balls and even used ChatGPT to help write a report.

Last week, footage from nearly four dozen body cameras that Ellis relied on to fashion her ruling released to the public, capturing in shaky, first-person style the abject chaos on the streets.

Ellis wrote in the opinion that, over and over, body-worn camera footage from the agents undermined what was eventually put in their use-of-force reports, rendering their statements unreliable.

The reports also misidentified “neighborhood moms and dads, Chicago Bears fans, people dressed in Halloween costumes, and the lawyer who lives on the block” as professional agitators, Ellis wrote, while the body cameras at times captured the agents’ apparent glee in deploying tear gas and other munitions on residential streets.

Ellis’ preliminary injunction prohibited immigration agents from deploying tear gas or other munitions before issuing two explicit warnings, required agents in the field to have body cameras and wear clear identification on their uniforms and forbids law enforcement from targeting journalists or interrupting their news gathering in most circumstances.

Unlike a previously entered temporary restraining order, the preliminary injunction was to remain in effect until a final decision on the merits of the case is made, either at trial or through a settlement.

Ellis had tentatively set a hearing on permanent injunction for March.

In its appeal brief, the Department of Justice argued Ellis’ injunction order was “untenably overbroad” and improperly empowers her to “micromanage how federal agents respond to disruptive and often violent protests throughout the Chicago area.”

“What began as a complaint by a handful of journalists and protesters alleging that federal officers targeted them with crowd-control devices at a few protests in September and early October has transformed into an instrument for judicial micromanagement of federal law-enforcement operations,” lawyers for the Department of Justice wrote in the brief.

Trump plans to weaken vehicle mileage rules that limit air pollution

The plan, to be announced later Wednesday, would ease pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. It would significantly reduce fuel economy requirements through the 2031 model year.

The move would be the latest action by the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that encouraged cleaner-running cars and trucks, including electric vehicles. The Republican administration says the new rules would increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

Word about Trump’s impending action comes from several people familiar with the White House plans. They’re not authorized to discuss the matter publicly because the proposal hasn’t been announced.

Louisiana immigrant rights group challenges new law in court

A Louisiana immigrant rights group asked a judge Wednesday to declare the new state law unconstitutional, with critics arguing that the legislation could be used to punish protesters or silence opponents of the Trump administration’s federal immigration crackdown that ramped up Wednesday.

The law took, which took effect in August, expands the crime of obstruction of justice to include anyone who “knowingly” commits “any act intended to hinder, delay, prevent, or otherwise interfere with or thwart” federal immigration enforcement efforts.

In that lawsuit filed in a Louisiana federal court, New Orleans-based nonprofit Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy called the law vague. Out of fear of violating the law, they’ve stopped hosting “Know Your Rights” workshops.

Treasury secretary says China on track to meet soybean purchase commitments

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says China is on track to buy millions of tons of American soybeans even though the purchases so far are much lower than promised.

The White House has said China committed to buy 12 million metric tons of soybeans by January and at least 25 million tons per year for each of the next three years.

“They are in a perfect cadence to complete that goal,” Bessent said Wednesday at the DealBook Summit.

But reports from the Agriculture Department show that China has only bought 2.251 million tons of soybeans so far.

Bessent said he thinks China’s immediate purchase commitment of 12 million metric tons should be completed by the end of February. Chinese officials have not confirmed the specific purchase promises.

Trump administration takes aim at the New Orleans’ immigration policies

Attorney General Pam Bondi has accused New Orleans of undermining federal immigration enforcement. The Department of Justice includes New Orleans in a list of 18 cities it considers to be providing sanctuary to immigrants without legal status.

New Orleans officials deny the city’s policies thwart federal immigration enforcement. City police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick has said she considers immigration enforcement to be a civil matter outside her jurisdiction.

House Democrats release photos and videos of Epstein’s private island

Democrats on the House Oversight Committee are releasing 14 photos and videos of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, showing empty courtyards, a bedroom and other rooms from his villa.

Congress is pressing the Trump administration to release all of its case files on the sex trafficking investigation into the late financier. Rep. Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the oversight panel, said he was releasing the images “to ensure public transparency in our investigation and to help piece together the full picture of Epstein’s horrific crimes.”

The Department of Justice has until mid-December to comply with legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Trump to publicly release many of its documents on Epstein.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to meet Trump face-to-face for first time

It will happen when she travels to Washington on Friday for the FIFA World Cup 2026 draw meet.

Sheinbaum said Wednesday that she’ll be at the draw with Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

When asked if she would also hold a private meeting with Trump, Sheinbaum said that hasn’t been determined and if a meeting is scheduled, it would be “very brief.”

Sheinbaum and Trump were scheduled to meet during the G7 summit in Canada in June, but the bilateral meeting was canceled after Trump had to travel back to Washington to address tensions between Israel and Iran.

The U.S. is co-hosting next year’s tournament — which for the first time will feature 48 national teams, up from 32 — with Canada and Mexico. The draw event will determine the World Cup’s groups and the games each team plays in the opening round.

Republican victory in Tennessee special election fails to dispel 2026 midterm concerns

Republicans held onto a reliably conservative U.S. House district in Tennessee’s special election, but only after a late burst of national spending and high-profile campaigning helped them secure a margin less than half of last year’s race.

Even with that victory, the outcome contributed to a gloomy outlook for the party going into the 2026 contests that will determine control of Congress. Republicans will need to defend much more vulnerable seats if they have any hope of keeping their House majority, while Democrats are capitalizing on President Trump’s unpopularity and the public’s persistent frustration with the economy.

“This is one of the biggest flashing red light warning signs we’ve seen yet for Republicans,” Matt Whitlock, a Republican strategist, wrote on social media. If there were similar numbers across the country next year, “we would be looking at a blue wave far worse than 2018.”

Republican Matt Van Epps, a military veteran and former state general services commissioner, defeated Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn by 9 percentage points Tuesday for the seat vacated by Republican Mark Green, who retired over the summer. Green had won reelection in 2024 by 21 percentage points.

Trump pardons Democratic congressman and his wife

Trump has pardoned Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar and his wife in a federal bribery and conspiracy case, citing what he called a “weaponized” justice system.

Trump, who’s argued that his own legal troubles were a partisan witch hunt, said on social media Wednesday that the congressman and his wife, Imelda Cuellar, were prosecuted because Henry Cuellar had been critical of President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.

Trump, a Republican, said Cuellar “bravely spoke out against Open Borders” and accused Biden, a Democrat, of going after the congressman and his wife “simply for speaking the TRUTH.”

Federal authorities had charged Cuellar, 69, and his wife with accepting thousands of dollars in exchange for the congressman advancing the interests of an Azerbaijan-controlled energy company and a bank in Mexico. Cuellar is accused of agreeing to influence legislation favorable to Azerbaijan and deliver a pro-Azerbaijan speech on the floor of the U.S. House.

Cuellar has said he and his wife are innocent.

US says it’ll restrict visas for those involved in anti-Christian violence in Nigeria and elsewhere

The move follows the designation of Nigeria as a “country of particular concern” under the International Religious Freedom Act last month, although it could apply to other nations on that list.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement Wednesday that he’d added a new policy under existing rules that will allow the State Department to restrict visa issuance to people “who have directed, authorized, significantly supported, participated in, or carried out violations of religious freedom” and their families. He said he took the step “in response to the mass killings and violence against Christians by radical Islamic terrorists, Fulani ethnic militias, and other violent actors in Nigeria and beyond.”

It wasn’t immediately clear how the new policy would be implemented as the State Department already had the ability to restrict travel to the U.S. by those involved in human rights abuses. In addition to Nigeria, the list of nations designated as “countries of particular concern” includes China, Cuba, Eritrea, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.

Bessent tight-lipped on the choice for Fed chair

When asked about the next possible Fed chair, Bessent demurred on whether the job would be offered to Kevin Hassett, who’s currently director of the National Economic Council and a top Trump advisor.

“I think the important thing to remember here is that it’s a board and then several other voters from the regional banks” Bessent said. “So the chair of the Federal Reserve has the ability to move and start the discussion. But at the end of the day, he or she is one vote.”

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says some sectors of the economy have weakened

At the New York Times DealBook Summit on Wednesday, Bessent said some sectors of the U.S. economy are weakening, including housing, which he said justifies the need for additional interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.

“Maybe it goes back to the reason we need interest rate cuts,” Bessent told host Andrew Ross Sorkin. Citing the two rate cuts in 2025, occurring at the September and October meetings, Bessent said “I am very optimistic about the economy.”

Minnesota has the largest Somali American population in the US

An estimated 260,000 people of Somali descent were living in the U.S. in 2024, according to the Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey. The largest population is in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, home to about 84,000 residents, most of whom are American citizens. Ohio, Washington and California also have significant populations.

Almost 58% of the Somalis in Minnesota were born in the U.S. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority — 87% — are naturalized U.S. citizens. Of the foreign-born population, almost half entered the U.S. in 2010 or later, according to the Census Bureau.

They include many who fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

Trump targets Minnesota’s Somali community with harsh words and policies

Recent statements by President Trump and top administration officials disparaging Minnesota’s large Somali community have focused renewed attention on the immigrants from the war-torn east African country and their descendants.

Trump on Tuesday said he didn’t want Somalis in the U.S. because “they contribute nothing.” The president spoke soon after a person familiar with the planning said federal authorities are preparing a targeted immigration enforcement operation in Minnesota that would primarily focus on Somali immigrants living unlawfully in the U.S.

Federal agents launch immigration crackdown in New Orleans

The crackdown began Wednesday in New Orleans under an operation that a Homeland Security official said would target violent criminals, expanding the Trump administration’s sweeps that have unfolded in other U.S. cities.

The aim of the operation is to capture immigrants who were released after their arrests for crimes such as home invasion, armed robbery and rape, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

She didn’t say how many agents would be deployed under the operation. Louisiana has been preparing for weeks for an immigration crackdown that Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has said he would welcome.

“Sanctuary policies endanger American communities by releasing illegal criminal aliens and forcing DHS law enforcement to risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens that should have never been put back on the streets,” McLaughlin said. “

The Trump administration also launched immigration crackdowns in Los Angeles, Chicago and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Trump-backed Republican Matt Van Epps wins US House special election in Tennessee

The Republican won the nationally watched special election in Tennessee for a U.S. House seat Tuesday, maintaining his party’s grip on the conservative district with help from President Donald Trump. But the comparatively slim margin of victory fueled Democratic hopes for next year’s midterms as the party grasps for a path back to power in Washington.

A military veteran and former state general services commissioner from Nashville, Van Epps defeated Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn to represent the 7th Congressional District.

With 99% of votes counted, Van Epps’ lead was around 9 percentage points. The previous Republican who held the seat won by 21 points last year, and Trump carried the district by 22 points.

Behn, who ran as an unapologetic progressive, ran up a huge margin in Davidson County, which is the most Democratic county in the district and home to Nashville. But Van Epps carried the rest of the district, including many deep-red counties throughout central Tennessee, as he tied himself tightly to Trump.

Pete Hegseth faces deepening scrutiny from Congress over boat strikes

Hegseth barely squeaked through a grueling Senate confirmation process to become secretary of defense earlier this year, facing lawmakers wary of the Fox News Channel host and skeptical of his capacity, temperament and fitness for the job.

Just three months later, he quickly became embroiled in Signalgate as he and other top U.S. officials used the popular Signal messaging application to discuss pending military strikes in Yemen.

And now, in what may be his most career-defining moment yet, Hegseth is confronting questions about the use of military force after a special operations team reportedly attacked survivors of a strike on an alleged drug boat off the coast of Venezuela. Some lawmakers and legal experts say the second strike would have violated the laws of armed conflict.

Group spends $250K in ads showing US citizen, Army veteran snared in immigration arrest

The group led by Trump critics is launching an online advertising campaign featuring an Army combat veteran who was detained by immigration agents and held in custody for three days this summer.

The ad by Home of the Brave shows George Retes talking about encountering a line of immigration officials on the road while heading to work outside Los Angeles.

The Department of Homeland Security says the agents were executing criminal search warrants at marijuana sites in the area and that Retes “became violent and refused to comply with law enforcement.” The images showed Retes stepping outside his car in the middle of a protest and gesturing with his arm before the agents surrounded his car.

Home of the Brave is targeting people who’ve seen ads run on streaming platforms by the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the last 30 days.

Human rights defenders from around the world, including Sarah Mardini, the Syrian refugee immortalised in the Netflix movie, The Swimmers, are slated to take the stand when proceedings before a court of appeals begin in the island’s capital, Mytilene, on Thursday.

“After years of unjustifiable delays we expect the trial on felony charges to finally start,” said Zacharias Kesses, the lawyer representing six of the defendants including Mardini. “At the heart of this case is an attempt by authorities to criminalise humanitarian assistance so that all of these aid organisations leave Lesbos.”

In 2015, at the height of the refugee crisis, Lesbos, which lies within view of the Turkish coast, was on the frontline of the greatest movement of people since the second world war.

More than 800,000 men, women and children, most fleeing Syria’s devastating civil conflict, are believed to have passed through the Aegean isle en route to Europe. In response, hundreds of humanitarians and activists rushed to Greece’s land and sea borders to help.

Among them was Mardini, a former competitive swimmer, who returned to the island after rescuing 18 fellow passengers in 2015 with her sister, Yusra, in a sinking dinghy as it attempted the crossing from Turkey. While the number of arrivals has since dropped dramatically as migration routes have shifted, Lesbos remains a magnet for people seeking asylum in Europe.

The long-awaited hearing on Thursday comes seven years after the arrests of the 24 aid workers, all volunteers with the now dissolved search-and-rescue organisation, ERCI, on Lesbos. Charges range from membership of a criminal organisation to “facilitation of entry of third-country nationals into the country” and money laundering, crimes punishable with up to 20 years in prison under Greek law.

Rights groups have described the accusations as “farcical”.

Amnesty International, which is sending a team of 12 officials to observe proceedings, says the case has played a key role in contributing to “a climate of hostility and intimidation against civil society organisations and individuals assisting people” fleeing persecution and war.

“A big delegation will be here to show our solidarity,” said Laith Abu Zeyad, a campaigner who has flown in from the organisation’s London offices to attend the trial. “These people were doing what anyone would do in similar circumstances, which is to show compassion for others in distress.”

The defendants, mostly in their twenties and thirties at the time of their arrests, have won international sympathy. In January 2023, supporters hailed the rejection of the lesser charge of espionage – regarded as a misdemeanour under Greek law – as indicative of their innocence.

Last year, in what was described as a landmark judgment, a three-member court on Lesbos threw out similar accusations of spying against 35 other aid workers ruling there was insufficient proof to prosecute further.

Greek police, in both cases, claimed activists had monitored maritime radio signals and used encrypted messaging apps to gain advance notification of the location of smugglers’ boats heading from the Turkish coast.

As they arrived on Lesbos this week, defendants whose lives have effectively been put on hold by the prolonged criminal proceedings also voiced concern about the gravity of the charges they now face.

Sean Binder, a German-born Irishman who, like Mardini, spent 100 days behind bars after his arrest in 2018, described his nervousness ahead of the trial even if he also welcomed it finally going ahead.

If found guilty, the accused will be able to appeal, but lawyers say the procedure would probably take years.

“Of course I am nervous,” said Binder, a trainee lawyer.

“Frankly, I am glad we are here … we’re now in our seventh year and we’ve just wanted to get to this point because we’re pretty confident that doing search-and-rescue is not in fact criminal, and a court will find that to be the case. Until then, there will be a suspicion of criminality hanging over not just us, but all acts of search and rescue, all humanitarianism and all solidarity.”

Ahead of the trial Amnesty International, which has championed Binder, called on Greek authorities to drop the charges.

“Sean did what any of us would hope to do in his position: help people in danger in one of the deadliest sea routes in Europe,” said Abu Zayed. “This is not just humane – it is lawful and necessary. It is farcical that this trial is happening at all.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19f743e55c2159e152b663c0a039928aa0246d72/460_0_4800_3840/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=643f48cb0b117551f4068971757519e6",N,,2025-12-03 12:56:50.808073

end of list

This was just the latest in a string of disparaging verbal attacks the US president has launched at the country’s Somali community. He posted similar remarks on social media last week and during his first term as president. Trump has also repeatedly verbally targeted Ilhan Omar, the congressional representative who is a US citizen of Somali descent.

The president has appeared to focus on immigrants from developing countries with harsh remarks or policies, except for white South Africans, for whom the US has increased quotas.

The US has paused immigration from 19 countries deemed “high risk”, citing last week’s fatal shooting of two National Guard members by an Afghan national. At the end of October, the Trump administration reduced the number of refugees the US will accept next year to just 7,500 – the lowest number since the 1980 Refugee Act – with preference to be given to white South Africans.

Then, on Tuesday, US media reported that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would carry out an operation in Somali neighbourhoods in the next few days.

Much of the Somali diaspora has settled in the US within the past 50 years. Here’s what we know about why Trump is targeting the community now.

What did Trump say?

Speaking to reporters following a US Cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump said he didn’t want Somalis in the US, describing them as “garbage”.

“We could go one way or the other, and we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country,” he said.

“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” Trump told reporters without specifying whether he was referring to citizens or irregular migrants.

“Some people will say, ‘Oh, that’s not politically correct.’ I don’t care … Their country is no good for a reason … Your country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country,” he said.

“These are people who do nothing but complain,” Trump continued. “They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing … When they come from hell, and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”

Last week, in an address to the nation following the shooting of two National Guard members, which left one dead and another critically injured, Trump ordered that people from 19 blacklisted countries who held US green or permanent residency cards be “re-examined”.

He then pivoted to the Somali community in Minnesota in that address, saying, “Hundreds of thousands of Somalians are ripping off our country and ripping apart that once great state.”

What action is the Trump administration planning against the Somali community?

US media reported on Tuesday that an ICE operation focused on Somali communities in the Minneapolis-St Paul area will take place in the next few days.

A sweep by ICE officers will round up undocumented people for deportation, AP reported, citing a person familiar with the plans.

At least 100 ICE agents are expected to flood the area. The New York Times, also citing sources close to the plan, said Somalis in the process of seeking legal status could also be swept up.

Several states in recent months have experienced ICE raids on undocumented people, including Chicago, Houston, Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta, New York City and Phoenix. By October, at least 527,000 people had been deported from the US since the Trump administration took office in January, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

In a post on X on Tuesday, Minnesota’s Governor Tim Walz slammed the plan for Minneapolis, saying that while the state welcomed support for prosecuting crime, “pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem”.

City officials also condemned President Trump’s attack on the Somali community at a press conference on Tuesday and promised not to cooperate with ICE agents conducting migrant checks.

“Obviously, this is a frightening moment for our Somali community,” Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said, describing the possible move as “terrorising”.

“That’s not American. That’s not what we are about,” he said. “To our Somali community, we love you, and we stand with you.”

Minneapolis City Council Member Jamal Osman, who came to the US from Somalia when he was 14, said at the conference: “I know many families are fearful … the city of Minneapolis stands behind you.”

“Somali Americans are here to stay,” he added. “We love this state. We love this country. This is home. We’re not going anywhere.”

Has Trump targeted the Somali community before this?

Yes. On November 21, Trump announced on his Truth Social platform that he was “immediately” terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, referring to a programme designed to provide emergency refuge for people whose countries are in crisis. About 705 Somalis are on that programme.

Without providing evidence, Trump claimed that “Somali gangs are terrorising the people of that great State” and accused Governor Walz, without proof, of overseeing a state that had become a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.

“Send them back to where they came from,” Trump said. “It’s OVER!

What triggered his remarks about the Somali community?

Trump’s accusations about the Somali community come after a conservative activist, Christopher Rufo, published allegations of welfare fraud against Somalis in Minnesota in a magazine called City Journal on November 19.

In the report, Rufo, citing unnamed “counterterrorism sources” and a police detective, claimed that Somalis benefiting from US welfare programmes were sending back huge amounts in remittances to their country, and that some of that money had ended up with al-Shabab, the al-Qaeda-linked armed group controlling some rural parts of Somalia.

One of the programmes Rufo referred to was fraudulent – the privately funded, $300m Feeding Our Future charity programme, which falsely claimed to be feeding millions of children amid the COVID-19 crisis but instead stole state funds.

Federal prosecutors have secured convictions for the ringleader, Aimee Bock, who is white, and several Somali-Americans.

In July, Somalia became one of 12 countries whose citizens are subject to a US travel ban. It was similarly placed under a travel ban during the first Trump administration.

Why has Trump targeted Ilhan Omar?

Trump also made disparaging remarks about Democratic congresswoman Omar in his Tuesday attack, calling her “garbage”.

Omar, 43, who emigrated from Somalia to the US in 1995 as a child, has represented her Minnesota district in the US Congress since 2019 and is an outspoken critic of the Trump administration.

“She’s an incompetent person; she’s a real terrible person,” Trump said on Tuesday, adding without evidence that Omar “hates everybody” and is anti-Semitic.

Trump’s verbal attacks on Omar are not new. The president has repeatedly criticised the representative, routinely picking on her hijab and mode of dressing.

Omar hit back on the latest of Trump’s latest comments on Tuesday, saying: “His obsession with me is creepy.”

Omar also pushed back against claims that Minnesota funds have been diverted to al-Shabab or that Somali gangs are rife in the state. “I challenge you to come forward with evidence … if at all there’s any,” she said at a briefing last week. “You can’t victimise a whole community for the actions of a few.”

How large is the Somali community in the US?

There are currently about 260,000 people of Somali descent residing in the US, according to data from the US Census Bureau’s annual American Community Survey. They are among the largest Somali communities outside Somalia, with other major diaspora communities found in the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Sweden and Canada.

Some Somalis arrived in the US in the 1960s as students, after the then-British Somaliland gained independence. Later, there were larger waves of people fleeing the troubled East African country’s protracted civil war, which stemmed from armed resistance to the military government of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. That lasted from 1988 until 2000, although the government continues to battle rebel groups and armed militants.

Most Somalis in the US live in Minnesota, where a number of social programmes are in existence, particularly in the Minneapolis-St Paul area, home to 63,000 people of Somali descent. States like Ohio (21,000), Washington (15,000), Virginia (3,953), Georgia (3,538), and California also have significant populations, according to the World Population Review.

How has the Somali diaspora fared in the US?

Minneapolis hosts several hundred Somali businesses, mostly in retail and food services and including restaurants, grocery stores and clothing stores.

Somalis arriving in the state during their native country’s civil war often faced challenges with learning English, but were able to take unskilled jobs, such as at meatpacking plants, according to a 2017 report by local publication MinnPost.

As the community grew, more Somalis branched into finance, health and education sectors. They also started getting into local politics. In 2019, Omar made history as the first Somali-American representative in the US Congress.

The average age of Somalis in Minnesota is young at 19, according to a 2023 report by the Minnesota state government. Most (53,000) speak English with professional or limited proficiency, but the group also has one of the lowest levels of educational attainment among foreign populations in the state.

Somalis are often described as active in the labour force, although more Somali men are employed than women. Contrary to Trump’s claims that Somalis do not work in the US, about 84 percent of male Somali refugees between 25 and 64 years were employed in the state of Kentucky compared to 64 percent of females, according to a 2016 report by the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy.

About 58 percent of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US. Of those born abroad, about 87 percent are naturalised citizens. Nearly half of that group entered the US in 2010 or later.

US authorities have in the past struggled to prevent the recruitment of young Somali-American men by al-Shabab and other armed groups. In 2007, more than 20 Somali-American men travelled to Somalia to join al-Shabab. However, only a few cases have been reported since then. In September, a 23-year-old man in Minnesota pleaded guilty to charges of attempting to join a designated armed group.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/2021-07-21T012701Z_63104431_RC28OO9MHGQF_RTRMADP_3_RELIGION-EID-KENTUCKY-1764764574.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-12-03 11:56:29.027149

According to Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, it is “exceedingly rare” for pregnant women to be in detention.
In California, Angie Rodriguez, an asylum seeker held in the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield, miscarried in July.
One of the women, she recalled, was about four months pregnant when she miscarried twins.
To see a doctor, she was bused nearly three hours each way to a medical center in Monroe, La.","Lorena Pineda was five months pregnant when masked agents picked her up on a street corner near a San Fernando Home Depot in June.

An agent grabbed her from the vending stand she ran with her sister-in-law and put her against a car. “Be careful,” she told him. “I’m pregnant.”

“Don’t think I am going to let you go because of that,” she recalled him saying.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement policy states agents shouldn’t detain, arrest or hold pregnant, postpartum and nursing mothers for “administrative violation of immigration laws” barring “exceptional circumstances” or if their release is “prohibited by law.”

But pregnant women are increasingly picked up, deported and detained under the Trump administration, advocates and lawyers contend.

Pineda, 27, was held at a downtown L.A. processing center before being transferred to San Bernardino, flown to Atlanta and then to a staging facility in Alexandria, La., and then taken on an hours-long ride to a rural part of that state — where for 3½ months she watched her belly grow and her dreams of life in America fade.

The American Civil Liberties Union has documented more than a dozen cases of what it says are pregnant women housed without proper medical care at Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Ga., and the ICE processing center in Basile, La., where Pineda was held.

In one case, a woman was shackled while she miscarried. Another woman with a high-risk pregnancy was placed in solitary confinement. In other instances, women have been denied prenatal care or not given translation services to speak with medical staff. Some complained that their pleas for medical services were ignored for weeks, according to the ACLU.

“This is only the tip of the iceberg,” said Eunice Cho, a lawyer with the ACLU and co-author of a letter sent to acting ICE Director Todd Lyons in October asking that pregnant detainees be released.

According to Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, it is “exceedingly rare” for pregnant women to be in detention. Those who are, she said, receive “regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care.”

It’s unclear just how many pregnant and postpartum women are in custody, because a congressional mandate to semiannually report the number lapsed under the Republican-led Congress.

Lawyers around the country have said their pregnant clients have been held in dire conditions. In California, Angie Rodriguez, an asylum seeker held in the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield, miscarried in July. She has since been released.

At the facility in Basile, Neysis Mairena was six months pregnant with twins when she was hospitalized after experiencing contractions last month and was shackled to a hospital bed, said her lawyer, Thea Crane.

These women, Cho said, “have been ripped away from their families, transported to detention facilities that are thousands of miles away from their families, and they’re sitting in detention in these horrifying conditions — worried not only about their families at home being deported, but also the health and safety of their pregnancies.”

McLaughlin noted that Pineda, Rodriguez and Mairena all had crossed the southern border in the last five years and were “released into the country under the Biden administration.”

The medical care in detention, she said, is probably the “best healthcare” that many immigrants have received in their life.

McLaughlin said the ACLU’s findings don’t identify women by name and amount to “anonymous, unsubstantiated and unverifiable claims.”

“Pregnant women currently make up 0.133% of all illegal aliens in custody,” she said, adding that they “are subject to elevated oversight.”

She added that “all tragic, four miscarriages occurred at South Louisiana ICE Processing Center — that is 10% of the pregnant detainees and well below the national average.”

McLaughlin said Rodriguez didn’t even know she was pregnant when she was detained and set for expedited removal.

Mairena, a Nicaraguan immigrant, was never shackled to a hospital bed and had been arrested on allegations of cruelty to a juvenile, McLaughlin said.

Crane, her attorney, said Mairena was accused of domestic abuse with child endangerment because her 7-year-old daughter was present during an altercation with her partner. Crane is fighting those charges, saying Mairena was defending herself.

Mairena was released from detention on Nov. 26, after The Times inquired about her case.

::

After her arrest, Pineda spent more than three months in a repurposed prison in Louisiana. The state has become a hub for immigrant detention under the Trump administration.

She came to know the other immigrant women housed in a large room lined with 54 beds and a television droning most waking hours. The Salvadoran mother of two said she felt her baby grow inside her as the days passed and she settled into a heartsore rhythm, bonding with strangers longing for children, family and home.

She counted at least 20 other pregnant women at the facility. Some of those she met were released, Pineda said; others were quickly deported.

One of the women, she recalled, was about four months pregnant when she miscarried twins. The woman cried and begged guards for days after to help her get pills to expel the fetuses — help that did not come before Pineda left the facility.

Another pregnant woman she met was set to be deported, but officials held her and she wound up miscarrying. Eight days later, they deported her, she said.

“Imagine,” Pineda said. “They waited until she lost the baby before deporting her.”

The conditions at the facility were difficult. Guards yelled. The meals inside, she said, were mostly junk food. Hot dogs, spaghetti. The stories she heard rattled her.

One woman she met at the facility had been arrested leaving the hospital after having a C-section. She said immigration officials eventually deported her without her child, though they were later reunited.

“I was afraid of something like this,” Pineda said. “You don’t know what’s going to happen.” She was terrified of giving birth in custody.

The Women’s Refugee Commission, a Washington, D.C., nonprofit, has been attempting to track the number of pregnant, postpartum and nursing mothers detained by immigration agents and document the conditions they face. Its leaders say they have encountered significant hurdles.

“We really don’t know what is happening inside detention centers,” said Zain Lakhani, the commission’s director of migrant rights and justice.

With the reporting requirements eliminated and access to facilities diminished after the administration ended many legal programs inside the facilities, it is hard to get a true picture. “We used to be able to speak with them and then escalate complaints, either to the office of civil rights and civil liberties or directly, sort of internally to the facility. We are no longer able to do that.”

Since launching the tracker, she said, the group has “received significant reports of pregnant, postpartum, lactating women who are being detained,” though she was not willing to share figures. There’s also evidence that ICE is not following policy to provide adequate housing, medical care and nutrition.

“These are extremely vulnerable populations that require specialized healthcare, that require a specialized nutrition and diet,” Lakhani said. “We know very clearly from all of the medical guidelines around pregnancy that you are someone who needs to be able to go to a doctor on a very regular basis. There are all kinds of routine and emergency, and just urgent kind of healthcare needs that you have.”

In July, an investigation spearheaded by Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) into human rights abuses in immigration detention found “14 credible reports of mistreatment of pregnant women, and 18 credible reports of mistreatment of children.” The reports included lack of adequate medical care, timely checkups or adequate meals.

“The inhumane treatment of pregnant women by the administration is shameful,” the Democratic Women’s Caucus wrote to acting ICE Director Lyons last month, demanding the release of pregnant, postpartum and nursing immigrants who don’t pose a security risk.

Pineda migrated from El Salvador in 2023, part of an unprecedented wave of millions who arrived at the U.S. border between 2020 and 2025. Her husband and two young children, along with her mother and brother, fled the country hoping to escape gang members who harassed and beat her husband at work, she said. Her father had already settled in the U.S.

They found a “coyote” who charged thousands of dollars and asked her mother to put up her land as collateral until the debt was paid off. But when they arrived, they found making ends meet difficult. They shuffled between homes in the San Fernando Valley, staying with relatives and sometimes strangers.

After a while, her husband had steady work in construction. Her daughter, now 7, was learning English and enjoyed school. Her 3-year-old son was making friends. Pineda and her sister-in-law had started a food stand, where she sold breakfast and pupusas to day laborers near the Home Depot.

On June 19, she rose hours before daybreak, dressed and went to her sister-in-law’s apartment. As the sun rose, they began preparing the food and were selling it in the parking lot by 6 a.m. She earned about $200 a week from the stand and used the money to help buy groceries and odds and ends for the children. She had been nervous about heading out that morning.

Two weeks earlier, raids orchestrated by U.S. Border Patrol Cmdr. Greg Bovino had upended Los Angeles’ immigrant community.

Around 8:30 a.m. agents pulled up in an unmarked car.

Pineda still has the surveillance video of the arrest on her mother’s phone. You can barely make her out.

“I couldn’t run because I was pregnant,” she said. “They handcuffed me with my hands in the back, put me in the car and took me.”

She arrived at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center on June 24. Pineda said there were medical staffers on site, but nobody equipped to conduct sonograms or any of the normal care she was accustomed to. To see a doctor, she was bused nearly three hours each way to a medical center in Monroe, La.

For the first month, she said, she couldn’t call her family.

Separated from her daughter and son by 1,500 miles and walls and fences, she had to get out of there.

“It was really hard for her,” she said of her daughter. “Every time she talked to me, she cried.”

She befriended a group of seven women. To pass the time, they weaved bracelets and rings out of plastic bags and talked about their homeland. She saw women who fought their cases.

After more than three months, guards told her that she was set to see a judge.

“I told them I didn’t want to,” she said. “I had signed my papers” to self-deport to El Salvador.

The judge set her departure date for Oct. 3 and she was told to arrange a flight to Los Angeles.

Her family skipped paying the rent and purchased her a ticket. It was Sept. 29. Guards dropped her off at the airport.

Days later, she met with immigration officials in Los Angeles. With her pregnancy nearly full term, the officials extended her departure date to March.

The day is bearing down on her.

“My husband said he won’t let me go alone,” she said. So she is trying to figure out how to pay for four tickets home. And how they will put food on the table in El Salvador.

Her mom still has a plot of land in the country where she planted fruit trees. There are mangoes, guayabas, jocotes and peaches.

And there are also the women she befriended in detention.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4c890fc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2598x1364+0+184/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F86%2F16%2F15a36b46484d9b7b5d8941b2b67f%2F1526260-la-me-ice-detained-while-pregnant-kg-08.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 11:56:33.006535

Hanne Daguman, a Norwegian woman, was among those detained by ICE at her green card interview in mid-November. She spent eight days in custody before being released two days before Thanksgiving after her husband posted a $1,500 bond.

""It was the worst period of my life. It was awful,"" Daguman said on a video call with ABC 10News reporter Laura Acevedo.

Daguman's case reflects a pattern of recent detentions. Immigration attorney Jacob Sapochnick's client, a Navy wife, was also detained for an overstay at her green card interview and released last week.

Both women had overstayed their visas but were actively working to adjust their status for green cards when they were taken into custody.

""We all know that they're going to get their green cards, but why are we playing this game in a way?"" Sapochnick said.

Daguman, who is from Norway and has Type 1 diabetes, says she was held in medical isolation during her detention. Upon her release, she was fitted with an ankle monitor and ordered to a two-week quarantine at home.

""There's a lot of anger and sadness, and I struggle with nightmares of what happened,"" Daguman said.

""Just a big relief of coming home to my husband, to my dog, having a bed to sleep in, having access to my medication,"" Daguman said.

ICE and immigration services have told ABC 10News they may arrest anyone unlawfully present in the U.S., including at USCIS offices. However, attorneys and couples working to adjust their status say they don't understand the reasoning behind the detentions, especially since the individuals are now out of custody and able to continue their green card cases.

The financial toll has been significant for affected families. The Dagumans say they've spent about $7,500 fighting Hanne's detention and expect that number to reach close to $12,000 when all is said and done.

""For what reason? If I'm gonna end up with a green card, hopefully anyways, what was the reason to put me through this?"" Daguman said.

ICE and USCIS referred inquiries about these detentions to the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review, which did not respond to requests for comment.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/56bb630/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+24/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf.cdn.uplynk.com%2Fause1%2Fslices%2F8f9%2F790551469ef2448fbb6dfa541303db12%2F8f95db7e9c8343349e6e85e46efee705%2Fposter_e03bde428d9b46359eb763bea999b1be.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 15:58:37.818045

Expand production of deeply affordable housing through a strengthened Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.
Gomez also emphasized that the bill builds on the momentum from the first-ever National Summit on the Housing Affordability Crisis, which he convened to drive a coordinated national response to the housing crisis.
“These organizations know what families know, that housing affordability is the defining challenge of our time,” Gomez said.","WASHINGTON, DC – As working families continue to face skyrocketing housing costs and a deepening affordability crisis, Congressman Jimmy Gomez (CA-34) today introduced the Make Housing Affordable and Defend Democracy Act, landmark legislation that redirects the $175 billion ICE and CBP slush fund Donald Trump created in his “Big Beautiful Bill,” and reinvests those billions directly into proven solutions that would reduce rents, expand homeownership, and incentivize the building of housing that’s affordable across the country.

“I’m introducing this bill because families across the country are being crushed by housing costs while Trump uses $175 billion to terrorize families with his own national police force,” said Rep. Gomez. “This bill flips the script. We’re taking back Trump’s anti-immigrant slush fund and investing it in real housing solutions that actually help people while putting a check on the unaccountable police force he built to go after our communities.”

The bill makes one of the largest housing investments proposed this Congress, lowering costs for renters, providing substantial support for first-time homebuyers, and incentivizing the conversion of vacant office buildings into affordable units. It would simultaneously redirect some of the most abusive and wasteful spending in the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda, including billions for ineffective border militarization, inhumane detention facilities, and unaccountable DHS and ICE programs.

The Make Housing Affordable & Defend Democracy Act would:

Create the first-ever monthly Renter Tax Credit for families paying more than 30% of their income on rent.

Provide $25,000 or more for first time homebuyers and $50,000 or more in down-payment assistance for first-generation homebuyers.

Convert vacant office buildings into affordable housing through a 20–35% Affordable Housing Conversion Credit.

Launch a Starter Home Construction Credit targeted at first-time buyers.

Expand production of deeply affordable housing through a strengthened Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.

A key difference between this bill and others is that it is paid for by the billions of dollars currently locked in draconian anti-immigrant enforcement programs and channels that funding directly into housing solutions for renters, first-time homebuyers, and incentives for affordable housing.

Gomez also emphasized that the bill builds on the momentum from the first-ever National Summit on the Housing Affordability Crisis, which he convened to drive a coordinated national response to the housing crisis.

“At the summit, I said this crisis demands a New Deal-level housing movement, and I meant it,” Gomez continued. “My son just turned three. He doesn’t understand the affordability crisis he’s inheriting yet, but he will live with the consequences if we fail to act. This bill restores the simple promise that if you work hard, you can afford a home and build a future for your family.”

The legislation is endorsed by UnidosUS, LULAC, CASA, A Way Home America, CLPHA, and CHIRLA, representing millions of renters, immigrants, low-income families, and housing advocates nationwide.

“These organizations know what families know, that housing affordability is the defining challenge of our time,” Gomez said. “We need to create a 21st century housing boom, even larger than what occurred after WWII to help house veterans. This bill is a blueprint for how we do that.”

In addition to Rep. Gomez, the Make Housing Affordable and Defend Democracy Act is cosponsored by 61 Members of Congress including Reps.

In recent days, the Trump administration has launched a particularly targeted attack on Somali immigrants in Minnesota, which contains the largest Somali population in the United States.

During a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, President Trump said, ""They contribute nothing.""

“Somalians, ripped off that state … They contribute nothing. I don't want them in our country,"" Trump said. ""I'll be honest with you. Somebody (can) say, 'Oh, that's not politically correct.' I don't care. I don't want them in our country. Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks and we don't want them in our country.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter fired back at the president, telling Somali Minnesotans, ""we stand with you.

""For decades, the Somali community has added greatly to our city,"" said Frey. ""The economic fabric, their hard work, their leadership — it has made Minneapolis a better place.""

Carter added, ""We call on ourselves, I call on myself, in the face of hatred, in the face of division, in the face of what seems to be a strategy centered around intentional chaos, to lead with listening, to lead with compassion, to engage with humanity and to ensure that we are every single day, modeling the type of behavior, the type of approach, the type of humanity we sure wish our federal representatives in Washington, D.C. would follow suit.""",https://media.kare11.com/assets/KARE/images/c3d598ef-ee03-4092-bf31-37b868584287/20251203T040633/c3d598ef-ee03-4092-bf31-37b868584287_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 12:56:58.959207

Georgia’s Democratic U.S. senators have launched an inquiry into the Trump administration’s new policy of restricting lawmaker access to immigration detention facilities.

On Monday, Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock sent a letter to Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, criticizing her department’s “arbitrary and illegal obstruction” of Congress members’ ability to conduct oversight visits at detention facilities.

It’s up to the agency’s director, Joseph Edlow, on when to lift the pause, the memo said.

The administration in June banned travel to the U.S. by citizens of 12 countries and restricted access for those from seven others, citing national security concerns.

The ban applied to citizens of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen while the restricted access applied to people from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

At the time, no action was taken against immigrants from those countries who were already in the U.S. before the travel ban went into effect.

But now the news from USCIS means those people already in the U.S. — regardless of when they arrived — will come under extra scrutiny.

The agency said it would conduct a comprehensive review of all “approved benefit requests” for immigrants who entered the country during the Biden administration.

The agency cited the shooting of two National Guard troops by a suspect who is an Afghan national as a reason for the pause and heightened scrutiny for people from those countries. One National Guard soldier was killed and another wounded in the Thanksgiving week shooting near the White House.

“In light of identified concerns and the threat to the American people, USCIS has determined that a comprehensive re-review, potential interview, and re-interview of all aliens from high-risk countries of concern who entered the United States on or after January 20, 2021 is necessary,” the agency said.

The agency said in the Tuesday memo that within 90 days it would create a prioritized list of immigrants for review and if necessary, referral to immigration enforcement or other law enforcement agencies.

Since the shooting, the administration has announced a flurry of decisions it was taking to scrutinize immigrants already in the country and those seeking to come to the U.S.

Last week, the director of USCIS said in a social media post that his agency would be reexamining green card applications for people from countries “of concern.” But the policy directive Tuesday goes further and lays out in more detail the scope of who will be affected.

USCIS also said last week that it was pausing all asylum decisions, and the State Department said it was halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, USCIS said in a separate memo that the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

Father Stephen Josoma told Boston.com that it’s a church tradition to use the Nativity scene to “hold the mirror up to what’s happening, and this year, it seemed to be, my God, it seemed to be right there in front of us.”

The congregation works with resettling immigrants and migrants, Josoma said, including some they’ve welcomed to the Parish. ICE has reportedly been targeting churches in the holiday season, Josoma said.

“They’ve done everything that they’re supposed to do, but their status could be in jeopardy, and some of our people would be in danger being killed if they did go back,” Josoma said. “It’s a cruel policy, and we can do a lot better as a country dealing with the many issues that face us.”

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today launched a federal law enforcement operation with Operation Catahoula Crunch in New Orleans, Louisiana, targeting criminal illegal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies that force local authorities to ignore U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrest detainers.

Two months into President Donald Trump’s second term, his administration gave states an ultimatum: Cooperate with his team’s immigration crackdown or lose your federal homeland security funding.

Oregon and 19 other states including Illinois, New York and California fought back and won. A federal judge ruled in September that the Department of Homeland Security couldn’t attach such strings to its grants, which states rely on for counterterrorism and emergency planning. For Oregon, nearly $18 million was at stake. The money in the past has paid for everything from bomb detectors to a security analyst’s salary.

But after winning in court, Oregon officials logged in to a federal grant website to formally accept the money, only to find the button to do so was disabled. They thought it might be a system glitch until they talked to counterparts in other states. The button did not come back online.

Homeland Security officials signaled to the states that despite losing in court, they were likely to appeal. If states wanted the money now, they would have to sign a declaration promising to cooperate with immigration enforcement if they lost in the future. States argued this would violate the judge’s order, and they won in court again.

Finally in October, the department officially removed the immigration wording to which states had objected and that the judge had said wasn’t legal.

But the administration continued to dangle the money out of reach. This time, the department rolled out a whole new set of criteria that made it harder for all states — “sanctuary” or not, blue or red — to obtain any federal terror or emergency management funding at all. They required states to estimate their populations’ net of people who had been deported and they dramatically tightened the deadline for spending the money.

Trump and his appointees have faced intense scrutiny since September, when he cited “violent radical left terrorism” as the reason for ordering National Guard troops to Portland. The city disputes the characterization and has been fighting the deployment in court.

Meanwhile, a quieter battle has been playing out over money to fight the extremist threats that emergency management officials say actually exist in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere.

Oregon auditors reported that data from a security think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, puts the state at No. 6 nationally for violent extremist attacks from 2011 to 2020. In more recent years, the FBI announced a set of attacks on electrical substations in Oregon and Washington they suspected to be the work of neo-Nazis, as well as a series of Portland area ballot-box fires that the agency linked to an extremist of unspecified ideology.

“Insurrection, conflict, violence, bombings, all those kinds of things — the dollars that we use absolutely are invested to help prevent, and help us prepare to respond to, those types of incidents,” said Mark Ferdig, who runs the Regional Disaster Preparedness Organization in the Portland area, which is funded almost entirely by grants from the Department of Homeland Security.

But in social media posts and in press briefings, the White House indicated that Trump doesn’t trust Portland to use federal funding in ways that match the president’s priorities.

“He is genuinely serious about wanting to restore order in America’s cities,” press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in an October briefing, “but it’s become apparent that the local and elected officials in Oregon do not feel the same.”

The Department of Homeland Security declined an interview request for this story. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, an arm of the department that distributes grant funding, responded to written questions from an unnamed press office email.

“Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding. The President has been clear on that,” the email said.

It said that for too long, “FEMA’s programs have strayed from their core mission turning taxpayer money into a slush fund for woke projects based on outdated and flawed methodologies.”

The agency denied holding back homeland security grants, pointing to the money it made available in September if states agreed to help with immigration enforcement.

Lynn Budd, director of the Wyoming Office of Homeland Security and past president of the National Emergency Management Association, said states should not be compelled to align themselves with any federal administration’s politics when money for disaster victims and counterterrorism is on the line.

“There should not be any political ideology involved in the grants,” Budd said.

Eroding Capabilities

The administration’s latest iteration of changes to homeland security grants has added obstacles that, this time around, threaten to make every state a casualty.

For example, states must officially certify their current population count net of people deported. States suing the government said in a court filing that the most likely source for a deportee count would be the Department of Homeland Security itself and that when North Carolina officials asked, they got no response. The states said the federal agency gave Michigan “only an approximate number of recently removed individuals” and that FEMA provided no indication of whether such estimates would be good enough. (Asked about providing states with deportee counts, a FEMA spokesperson said the agency could not comment on pending litigation.)

There’s also a much shorter window for all states to spend the money the department gives out: within the next 10 months, rather than three years. Emergency managers say the requirement is challenging because it takes time for local governments to propose specific spending to state officials, for the state to distribute the money, and for the locals to hire people or put out bids for construction.

Budd called the new deadline “pretty devastating” for all states, including Wyoming. She said states have received no explanation for the changing grant requirements.

“Do you have your crystal ball? I don’t have mine,” Budd said. “That’s one of the most frustrating things is the lack of communication.”

Asked about the reason for the latest changes, FEMA said they were intended to prevent fraud and abuse and weren’t related to the court’s rejection of earlier requirements forcing states to aid in immigration enforcement.

“These changes are neither arbitrary nor capricious,” the agency’s email stated. “They are part of a methodical, reasonable effort to ensure that federal dollars are used effectively and in line with the Administration’s priorities and today’s homeland security threats.”

While all states are affected now, sanctuary jurisdictions like Oregon remain the main force battling the administration in court. (Oregon’s sanctuary law, originated in the 1980s and enhanced in 2021, bars law enforcement officers from participating in immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant.)

Oregon estimates that without the federal money, two-thirds of its counties won’t be able to perform basic emergency management functions to prepare for and respond to disasters.

In Portland, the state’s largest city and the one with the highest terrorism risk, an average of $5 million a year in homeland security grants over the past two decades has paid for law enforcement training, rescue vehicles, bomb squad gear, mobile X-ray scanners and barriers that prevent cars from plowing into crowds.

The grant programs were established by Congress in the wake of 9/11 and initially focused on international terrorism, but local governments have since used them to boost their states’ overall disaster preparedness and combat the growing threat of domestic extremism.

Firefighters bought a drone with homeland security money and used it to investigate the arson of a 120-year-old church building in Portland. They flew the drone through wreckage investigators couldn’t set foot in because the building was likely to collapse. Investigators used it again when a 110-year-old brick apartment complex burned down.

During last year’s election, an arsonist set off incendiary devices on two ballot drop boxes in Portland and Vancouver, Washington, destroying hundreds of ballots. However, both ballot boxes were equipped with fire suppression devices that the homeland security grants had paid for. They prevented many more ballots from burning, local law enforcement said.

Homeland security money also pays for an intelligence analyst who briefs law enforcement on emerging terrorism risks and assesses the vulnerabilities of public infrastructure like water treatment plants. The analyst prepares threat assessments for major public events like professional sports games or the downtown waterfront Rose Festival, determining whether the airspace overhead should be temporarily restricted and identifying places where someone could leave a suspicious backpack.

“Those major investments that we make in planning projects and equipment and supplies and training, I think that that will essentially go away,” said Ferdig, who runs the Portland area’s disaster preparedness organization. “We’ll see more significant and rapid erosion of our capability if we are training less. And if there’s less equipment over time, it’s just going to dissipate. And that is worrisome.”

Ferdig and other Portland emergency managers started getting nervous about federal funding in early March, when they noticed that FEMA had temporarily turned off several of the computer systems used to pay grants to state and local governments. There was no warning.

Ferdig knew Trump had openly talked about abolishing FEMA and had ordered his cabinet to review the agency. The technical difficulty felt ominous to Ferdig.

Weeks later, the administration made its first attempt to withhold emergency funds from sanctuary states, prompting the lawsuit from Oregon and 19 other states.

The Ideology of Extremists

The administration’s aggressive stance on local counterterror funding is not just about pressuring states on immigration policy, according to Mary McCord, a former acting assistant attorney general for national security under President Barack Obama. It may also be driven by the types of political extremism the money is being used to combat.

When Oregon auditors reviewed the state’s efforts to combat extremism in 2022, they noted that incidents of extremist violence in the state between 2011 and 2020 were split nearly equally across political orientations.

That doesn’t fit the Trump administration’s narrative, said McCord, who is now director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at the Georgetown University Law Center.

In public statements and a September presidential memo on “Countering Domestic Terrorism and Organized Political Violence,” Trump has painted political violence as coming solely from left-wing groups. His administration has designated “antifa,” a term for loosely affiliated participants in America’s anti-fascist movement, as a terrorist organization.

State and local counterterror funding is being withheld “because it was perceived by this administration to be all directed against the right,” McCord said. “It is a multifaceted strategy of trying to say, ‘There is no violence on the right. The violence is all coming from the left.’”

Lindsay Schubiner, director of programs for the Western States Center, said Trump’s actions on disaster response and counterterrorism are disturbing when coupled with his recent deployment of the National Guard to Portland to deal with immigration protesters. Schubiner’s Portland-based nonprofit, which tracks extremism in the Northwest, has previously labeled the Trump administration a threat to democracy.

“The administration is undermining the power of states and localities by holding back funding that allows them to serve their residents,” Schubiner said, “while at the same time relying on federal troops or attempting to try to increase control over communities, quash dissent and consolidate his power.”

The White House has made clear that it does, in fact, intend to take more control over Portland’s domestic security efforts, saying the local response has been too ideologically biased.

On Oct 3., the day before a judge blocked Trump from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Leavitt, his press secretary, railed against the city and its police force for arresting a “conservative journalist” while doing nothing about “radical left-wing lunatics” she said were acting as a violent mob. (The Portland Police Bureau is among the local agencies that have benefited from homeland security grants in the past.)

Leavitt’s comments were a response to ongoing nightly protests at the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Portland. ProPublica previously reported that, while incidents of varying intensity have occurred between officers and protesters, there has been no evidence to support the administration’s claim of a “coordinated assault” on the facility.

Leavitt said the federal presence in Portland would surge to protect the ICE facility. At the same time, she broached the subject of cuts to various forms of federal aid to the city.

“We think it’s despicable that these local elected officials who swear an oath to protect their people are preventing law enforcement from doing their jobs on the ground,” Leavitt said.

The press secretary said White House officials, at Trump’s direction, were already looking into ways to reduce the city’s funding. She did not specify the type of funding or how the White House effort fit with the Department of Homeland Security’s ongoing battle with states over grant money.

“We will not fund states that allow anarchy,” Leavitt said.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC094591-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 11:56:36.941366

Today's top stories

Today, Democrats in Washington introduced a bill that would limit who the Trump administration can appoint as a temporary judge. The bill, introduced by California's Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Juan Vargas, would allow the attorney general to appoint temporary immigration judges who have served on appellate panels, are administrative judges in other agencies, or have at least 10 years of experience in immigration law. This legislation comes after the White House authorized up to 600 military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges, while eliminating the requirement for them to have prior immigration law experience. The administration has fired at least 14 immigration judges in the last two weeks, according to the union that represents them.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said yesterday that he authorized and observed the first round of strikes on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean in September, but didn't personally make the call for the second strike that killed two survivors. He says the second strike was a decision made by Adm. Frank Bradley, who leads U.S. Special Operations Command. Congress is now investigating the details of what happened, as some suggest that the orders could leave servicemembers facing eventual prosecution.

🎧 Lawmakers' questions center around whether the second strike violated U.S. law or would be deemed a war crime if the administration's claim of being at war with narco traffickers is accepted, NPR's Deirdre Walsh tells Up First. Senate Majority Leader John Thune backed the current U.S. policy, stating that the administration has the authority to conduct these attacks. But he sidestepped the question of whether he has confidence in Hegseth when asked directly. Thune did state that the Trump administration's peace through strength policies are effective, and Hegseth is part of that team.

Republican Matt Van Epps last night won the special election for a U.S. House seat in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District. Though it is a win for Republicans, Democrats are also claiming victory. This is because Van Epps won by 9 percentage points in a district where, last year, President Trump claimed victory with roughly 60% of the vote.

🎧 Yesterday's race showed that Republicans were able to motivate their base voters to head to the polls without Trump being on the ballot, NPR's Stephen Fowler says. It also showed that Democrats are moving past their losses from 2024, have motivated Democratic voters who have soured on the party, and appear to have persuaded independents that Republicans won't solve key issues.

The Trump administration has fired or attempted to fire numerous federal staff members at the U.S. Department of Education who manage and enforce federal disability law. While Secretary Linda McMahon assures that special education funding is secure, NPR found concerns among 40 parents, educators, disability rights advocates, subject matter experts and Education Department staff. They say they fear that reducing federal staff and oversight may result in a return to pre-1975 conditions, when schools denied access and services to children with disabilities.

From our hosts

by Steve Inskeep, Morning Edition and Up First host

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox got a lot of attention last September for his handling of an assassination's aftermath. Cox delivered remarks about a divided nation after the activist Charlie Kirk was killed in his state.

But Cox is involved in another issue of sweeping significance. He's promoting nuclear plants to supply data centers for artificial intelligence.

In an NPR video interview, I spoke with the governor about our divisive present and his efforts to help build the future.

Cox sees the U.S. in a race with China to dominate AI. That's one reason that Utah is doing all it can to encourage the expansion of nuclear power. ""We're trying to build it, and lots of it,"" he said. The state is working to lower regulatory barriers and lobbying the federal government to do the same.

Yet Cox knows the dangers of AI technology. He told me he's concerned that AI could supercharge the damage from social media, our addiction to devices and our disconnection from reality.

He wants states to preserve their power to regulate AI. Some in Congress have tried, so far without success, to ban states from limiting the technology.

This led to one of my questions: If we're building more power plants to supply more data centers to run more AI, are we simply going to overwhelm any efforts we make to control it?

You can hear his answer and more in our video interview.

Andy Barr, R-Ky., stood as an unwavering champion for resettling the Afghan nationals who had aided America and its allies.

“We have failed in our obligation to help many of these Afghans who risked their lives, and in many cases died, for the cause of their own country in assistance to the United States, and we owe them to help them get into our country with these visas,” Barr said then in an interview with Kentucky Educational Television.

Now a Senate candidate, Barr saw his remarks resurface and quickly go viral last week after the shooting of two National Guard members — one of whom died — in Washington, D.C. Law enforcement officials identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who served alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges including first-degree murder.

“I don’t believe we owe anything to foreigners from Afghanistan, but I do believe our politicians owe it to the American citizens that they’re supposed to represent, to not flood our country with thousands of people from the 3rd world who don’t share our values and never will,” businessman Nate Morris, one of Barr’s rivals in the GOP primary, wrote in a social media post sharing a clip from the interview.

The clash offered a preview of how the topic could jam other Republicans running in competitive primaries next year, from the already hostile Kentucky race to Sen. John Cornyn’s re-election battle in Texas and campaigns for governor in Florida and South Carolina.

It’s also a fight that reflects shifting goalposts for a GOP in which even legal immigration has become a source of debate. The attack on Guard members — which officials have said was targeted — validated warnings from several leading figures on the right, including Vice President JD Vance, who had argued that resettling Afghan refugees could yield tragic consequences.

An Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis is currently underway, a senior law enforcement official said.

It comes one day after Trump said that Somalis should ""go back to where they came from"" and made disparaging remarks about Somalia. Minneapolis has a large Somali population, and NBC News previously reported that ICE was planning an operation in Minneapolis-St. Paul this week.

The Department of Homeland Security also announced this morning that, beginning today, federal law enforcement agents would be conducting immigration operations in New Orleans.

The FBI field office in New Orleans announced a joint enforcement effort with Louisiana State Police to deter assaults on federal officers and attempts to obstruct law enforcement actions during the immigration operation.

Democratic Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García’s handpicked successor is officially getting a challenge.

Mayra Macías is a lifelong Democrat and Chicago native who has worked on Latino advocacy and promoting former President Joe Biden’s agenda. She announced her candidacy today as an independent in Illinois’ 4th Congressional District. If elected, Macías said she would caucus with Democrats.

“I’ve really focused my whole career on building and serving and making sure that we’re fighting for quality education, health care and affordable housing,” Macías said. “Under the Trump administration, we’re seeing a lot of this progress rolled back.”

García’s surprise retirement announcement in early November created a firestorm and drew a rebuke from his own party. His plans were known only to his chief of staff, Patty Garcia (no relation). Because the congressman announced his retirement after the filing deadline to run, Patty Garcia was the only one to file the required signatures before the deadline to run as a Democrat in March.

Russian President Vladimir Putin met with Trump’s special envoy tasked with negotiating an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine, as well as his son-in-law, for a “constructive” five-hour meeting yesterday, but more work needs to be done, Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy adviser to Putin, said in a video the Kremlin posted online.

Nearly four years after Putin’s full-scale invasion of his smaller neighbor, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner are grappling with an empowered Russia, with Ukraine on the back foot both on and off the battlefield. Kyiv’s troops, facing a dire manpower crisis, cling to strategic hubs, and a major corruption scandal has shaken President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government and forced the removal of his top negotiator.

James Solomon was elected mayor of Jersey City yesterday, thwarting former New Jersey Gov. Jim McGreevey’s bid for a political comeback.

Addressing supporters who had gathered to watch returns and cheer him on, Solomon said: “Now, the mission is clear. The work begins tonight. And the work that we have to do is make Jersey City affordable.”

Solomon, a City Council member since 2017, defeated McGreevey in a runoff after they finished first and second in a general election last month with seven candidates on the ballot.

The Trump administration indicated yesterday that it will begin withholding SNAP benefits from recipients in most Democratic-led states starting next week after those states refused to provide the Agriculture Department with data including recipients’ names and immigration statuses.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said during a Cabinet meeting that 29 Republican-led states have complied but that 21 states, including California, New York and Minnesota, have refused to provide the data, which was requested in February. Rollins has said her department requested the info to “root out … fraud.”

“So as of next week, we have begun and will begin to stop moving federal funds into those states, until they comply and they tell us and allow us to partner with them to root out this fraud and to protect the American taxpayer,” Rollins said at the White House meeting.

Close to 42 million people in the U.S. receive benefits for food assistance through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

More than a week after a federal judge tossed the Trump administration’s cases against two of the president’s top political foes, the Justice Department is weighing whether to re-indict former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

And the Justice Department is considering taking that step without the legal complications caused by the previous “unlawful"" actions of Lindsey Halligan as the purported top federal prosecutor in the Eastern District of Virginia.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said Nov. 24 that the Justice Department would file an “immediate appeal“ of a federal judge’s order dismissing the cases against Comey and James. But prosecutors have yet to do so.

A source familiar with the deliberations said yesterday that the department is considering seeking new, untainted indictments instead of pursuing the appeals. CNN and Reuters previously reported on the deliberations.

Van Epps won the hotly contested special election for a deep-red congressional seat in Tennessee yesterday, NBC News projects, beating back a Democratic challenge for the longtime GOP district.

Though Trump carried the 7th Congressional District by 22 points in 2024, Republican super PACs poured millions into defending the seat as Van Epps faced off against Aftyn Behn, a Democratic state representative. Democrats spent almost as much trying to capture it, as Trump’s political standing has taken a hit this year and the Democratic Party made gains in November elections in New Jersey, Virginia and other states.

Still, this red district remained reliably Republican. Van Epps, an Army veteran and former state official, ran on reliably MAGA themes and promised to continue the legacy of Mark Green, a Republican who resigned from the seat this year.

Hegseth speaks to new Pentagon 'press corps'

The US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is now speaking to the new batch of reporters who comprise the Pentagon “press corps”, according to a photo posted to social media by far-right activist Laura Loomer.

“He’s taking everyone’s questions with no scripts and no pre planned questions,” Loomer wrote. “The attacks on Hegseth by the Fake News media are unfounded. He is taking EVERY question.”

The defense department saw a mass exodus of at least 30 major news outlets after they refused to sign a new restrictive press policy.

Somali prime minister urges calm following Trump's xenophobic White House rant

Faisal Ali

Somali officials have largely remained diplomatically tight-lipped about Donald Trump’s frequent verbal attacks on the Somali community in the US and on Somalia itself, a pattern of remarks that go right back to his first term.

In a statement today, Somalia’s prime minister, Hamza Barre, kept to that approach, noting that Trump had “insulted many countries, including Nigeria and South Africa”, while urging calm.

“There are things that do not need comment, we just leave them and move on. It is better to ignore than to make his words look like an issue,” Barre said.

Barre’s tone contrasted with the government’s earlier response to a previous string of attacks on congresswoman Ilhan Omar, during which Trump called her “SCUM” and described Somalia as “plagued by persistent poverty, hunger, resurgent terrorism, piracy, [and] decades of civil war”, after she criticised Charlie Kirk’s views, following his killing.

At the time, defence minister Moallim Fiqi, who is a more outspoken Somali official, said, Iif our daughter is being targeted because of her identity, we stand firmly by her side,” adding that Omar had “elevated both her own name and the name of her ancestral homeland to a place of prominence.”

Per our earlier post about Matt Van Epps’ victory in Tennessee, Donald Trump weighed in late on Tuesday to congratulate the representative-elect.

“The Radical Left Democrats threw everything at him, including Millions of Dollars. Another great night for the Republican Party!!!” he wrote on Truth Social. The president had thrown his support behind Van Epps, who beat his progressive challenger, Aftyn Behn, by single digits.

While it’s a needed victory for the GOP, other congressional Republicans have said race foreshadows a bitter fight in the 2026 midterms.

“Tt’s going to be a turnout election, and the left will show up,” Republican senator Ted Cruz of Texas said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday. “Hate is a powerful motivator. They hate President Trump.”

DHS formally announces New Orleans immigration operation

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced it had started its immigration enforcement operation in New Orleans today.

In a statement, the department said Operation Catahoula Crunch would target “criminal illegal aliens roaming free thanks to sanctuary policies”. New Orleans is the latest Democratic-run city (albeit in a Republican-led state) to see federal immigration agents on its streets. Most recently, the Trump administration targeted Charlotte, North Carolina, and touted the arrest of more than 300 undocumented immigrants.

Today, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that “it is asinine that these monsters were released back on to New Orleans streets to COMMIT MORE CRIMES and create more victims. Catahoula Crunch targets include violent criminals who were released after arrest for home invasion, armed robbery, grand theft auto and rape.”

Somali American councillor says 'many families are fearful tonight' but 'Minneapolis stands with you'

Frances Mao

Jamal Osman, a Somali American city council member in Minneapolis, also spoke alongside Mayor Jacob Frey at last night’s press conference, delivering a message in both Somali and English to his worried community.

As reports spread on Tuesday that ICE agents were due to launch raids, he had visited affected neighbourhoods.

Osman said: “I know many families are fearful tonight, but the city stands behind you and we are here to stand with you.

“Our community has lived through fear in the past and we’re not going to let this divide us.”

He said city officials were doing everything so residents “know their rights, they know where to turn for help … Minneapolis will not abandon [you].”

He also said that everyone knew President Trump is “racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic” and “we are going to fight that. America has a history of fighting and stopping those kinds of individuals who continue to divide people and divide communities.”

“Many Somalis that live in this community are working, working at your groceries, working in your hospitals… they are successful individuals.”

The mayor and the city’s police chief also stressed that no local police would be involved in ICE operations.

Tennessee special election takeaways

Voters may have elected Republican Matt Van Epps to fill the vacant seat in the state on Tuesday, but the single-digit win is being interpreted by some as a warning sign for the GOP ahead of midterms next year.

Trump won the district by 22 points last year, while Van Epps only won by nine points over Democrat Aftyn Behn – a secure lead but seen as underperforming. Behn ran an unapologetically progressive campaign in a seat viewed as safely red.

Democrats are now left wondering what could have been if they had run a more moderate candidate, while Republicans are counting the costs of an expensive race and the departure of some voters. The district’s former representative Mark Green won the seat by 21 points last year.

Van Epps’ win now pads out the Republican majority in the house to 220-214.

Trump and other senior officials had signalled tightening restrictions on immigration – it has been a flagship policy of his second term – but this was ramped up after the deadly shooting in Washington DC last week.

The main suspect in the shooting, which killed one, is an Afghan national who entered the United States during mass evacuations as US and foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021.

He pleaded not guilty to murder charges on Tuesday.

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services memo said it “plays an instrumental role in preventing terrorists from seeking safe haven in the United States”.

The country had recently seen “what a lack of screening, vetting, and prioritizing expedient adjudications can do to the American people”, it added, citing the Afghan murder suspect.

Trump had threatened the dramatic crackdown on immigration from the 19 already-targeted countries, following the shooting of two national guard members by an Afghan suspect last week.

He said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover”.

The affected nations are: Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Yemen.

They’re among the poorest in Africa, the Middle East and central and south-east Asia.

‘We stand with you’: Minneapolis mayor supports Somali community

Minneapolis is home to the country’s largest Somali population, with about 80,000 living in the state. Most are US citizens or legal residents.

In response to Trump’s attack and the looming immigration crackdown reported, the city leaders held a press conference on Tuesday.

Mayor Jacob Frey said the city stands with its Somali community, delivering the message first in Somali and then in English.

“To our Somali community, we love you, we stand with you and we aren’t backing down,” he said. “That commitment is rock solid.”

He condemned the plan to target people who just look like they could be from the East African nation, saying it violates basic principles of American democracy.

“Targeting Somali people means that due process will be violated, mistakes will be made, and let’s be clear, it means that American citizens will be detained for no other reason than they look Somali,” Frey said.

The city’s police chief has said that his department had not received advance notice of any operations, and besides, Minneapolis police do not assist federal agents with immigration enforcement.

ICE planning operations targeting Somalis -report

The New York Times reported on Tuesday that the Minneapolis-St Paul metro area, where most Somalis reside, would see stepped-up deportation efforts this week, focusing primarily on Somalis who have final deportation orders.

It would use “strike teams” of ICE agents and other federal officers, bringing in about 100 agents from across the country, the Times reported. Other media outlets, including the Associated Press, have confirmed the reporting.

The move comes after the right has seized on several fraud cases, spanning multiple years, that involve dozens of Somali residents who prosecutors allege lied to the state to receive reimbursements for meal disbursements, medical care, housing and autism services. The Trump administration previously threatened to revoke temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, citing the state as a “hub of fraudulent money laundering activity”.

Scott Bessent, the treasury secretary, also announced on Monday that his agency would be investigating whether taxpayer dollars from Minnesotans had “been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab”, sharing a recent story from a rightwing outlet that made such claims.

Trump attacks Somali immigrants and calls Ilhan Omar ‘garbage’

Rachel Leingang

In a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, Trump went off on Somalis and Ilhan Omar, the congressional representative who is from Somalia and is a US citizen. He said Somalia “stinks” and is “no good for a reason”.

“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country, I’ll be honest with you,” he said. He called Omar “garbage” and said “we’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country”.

“These are people who do nothing but complain,” he said. “They complain, and from where they came from, they got nothing … When they come from hell and they complain and do nothing but bitch, we don’t want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.”

“His obsession with me is creepy,” Omar responded in a social media post. “I hope he gets the help he desperately needs.”

Welcome to US politics live

Good morning and welcome to our US Politics live blog, as we track the escalating attacks against immigrants being launched by the Trump administration.

Yesterday, President Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage” in a xenophobic rant in cabinet where he said “I don’t want them in our country” and they should “go back to where they came from”. It comes amid reports ICE agents are about to launch crackdowns targeting the Somali communities in Minnesota.

The Trump administration yesterday also halted all immigration for people from 19 nations – including Somalia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Haiti.

The 19 non-European countries have been under a partial travel ban since June – but this dramatic move brings to a halt all stages of the journey including green card and US citizenship processing.

It’s a move that affects countless people, and with no word as to how long the pause will last, it’s almost certain that families will remain separated for longer, in limbo.

I’m Frances Mao, stay with me as I take you through the key details.

Legal experts say federal immigration agents would not be required to follow a county mask ban.","Los Angeles County supervisors advanced an ordinance Tuesday that would prohibit law enforcement officers — including immigration enforcement agents — from wearing masks while working in unincorporated parts of the county.

The ordinance would also require all law enforcement officers to wear identification and make clear their agency affiliation.

The ban is a response to concerns from residents over unidentifiable agents conducting immigration enforcement operations across the region. Since raids began this summer, armed federal agents — their faces hidden by neck gaiters or ski masks — have repeatedly hopped out of unmarked vans and apprehended people from street corners, car washes and Home Depot parking lots. Officers often refuse to identify themselves as working with federal immigration enforcement.

Legal experts say federal immigration agents would not be required to follow a county mask ban. The county’s top lawyer, Dawyn Harrison, has said she suspects the federal government will likely argue that the county law violates the Constitution, which states that federal law takes precedence over conflicting local statutes.

“If this leads to a fight with the federal government in the courts, I think it’s a fight worth having,” said Supervisor Janice Hahn, who spearheaded the ban.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has said immigration agents need to disguise themselves to avoid having their names publicized or being “doxed.”

The motion passed 4-0, with Supervisor Kathryn Barger abstaining. Per county policy, the ban must be approved once more, and the vote is scheduled for next week. The ban would go into effect in January 2026.

“If you carry the power of a badge here, you must be visible, accountable and identifiable to the people you serve,” said Supervisor Lindsey Horvath, who co-authored the motion.

Barger had previously questioned the point of a motion that would almost certainly land them in court.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3348d11/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F65%2Fbd%2F546558834649b01f6ea6d05e6210%2F1520409-mla-me-sweater-drive-occupy-ice-la-ces-01783.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 07:56:51.205202

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil liberties and immigrants rights groups in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Officers making civil immigration arrests generally have to have an administrative warrant.
Attorneys for the administration denied it had a policy allowing such arrests.
The ruling is similar to two others in federal lawsuits that also involved the ACLU, one in Colorado and another in California.","A federal judge late Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from making widespread immigration arrests in the nation’s capital without warrants or probable cause that the person is an imminent flight risk.

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington granted a preliminary injunction sought by civil liberties and immigrants rights groups in a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

An email to the department after hours Tuesday was not immediately returned.

Officers making civil immigration arrests generally have to have an administrative warrant. Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, they may make arrests without a warrant only if they have probable cause to believe the person is in the U.S. illegally and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained, according to Howell’s ruling.

The American Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs’ attorneys argued federal officers were frequently patrolling and setting up checkpoints in Washington, D.C., neighborhoods with large numbers of Latino immigrants and then stopping and arresting people indiscriminately.

They provided sworn declarations from people they say were arrested without warrants or a required assessment of flight risk and cited public statements by administration officials that they said showed the administration was not using the probable cause standard.

Attorneys for the administration denied it had a policy allowing such arrests.

Howell, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, said the plaintiffs had “established a substantial likelihood of an unlawful policy and practice by defendants of conducting warrantless civil immigration arrests without probable cause.”

“Defendants’ systemic failure to apply the probable cause standard, including the failure to consider escape risk, directly violates” immigration law and the Department of Homeland Security’s implementing regulations, she said.

In addition to blocking the policy, she ordered any agent who conducts a warrantless civil immigration arrest in Washington to document “the specific, particularized facts that supported the agent’s pre-arrest probable cause to believe that the person is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained.”

Howell also required the government to submit that documentation to plaintiffs’ attorneys.

The ruling is similar to two others in federal lawsuits that also involved the ACLU, one in Colorado and another in California.

Another judge had issued a restraining order barring federal agents from stopping people based solely on their race, language, job or location in the Los Angeles area after finding that they were conducting indiscriminate stops, but the Supreme Court lifted that order in September.

“Several months ago he announced a travel ban on 19 third-world and failed state countries around the world.

In June, the Trump administration enacted a full travel ban on visitors from 12 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, with partial restrictions for seven more.","Kristi Noem, the US homeland security secretary, has advocated for a new travel ban on visitors from an unspecified number of countries following the shooting death in Washington DC of a national guard member by an Afghan national.

Noem posted to X her proposal on Monday night after she said she had spoken with Donald Trump, whose first-term travel ban on seven Muslim countries faced widespread criticism and followed a rocky legal path before it was eventually upheld by the supreme court.

“I just met with the President. I am recommending a full travel ban on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies,” Noem wrote.

“Our forefathers built this nation on blood, sweat, and the unyielding love of freedom – not for foreign invaders to slaughter our heroes, suck dry our hard-earned tax dollars, or snatch the benefits owed to Americans.

“We don’t want them. Not one.”

It was not immediately clear which countries she was referring to, or how such a ban would be implemented. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) told the Guardian in a short statement on Tuesday: “We will be announcing the list soon.”

Noem’s rhetoric echoes that of Trump following last week’s attack on two national guard members in Washington DC, which killed one and left the other with serious injuries.

The day following the attack the president said he would “permanently pause migration from all third world countries”, and on Friday the state department said it had stopped issuing visas for anyone with an Afghan passport.

The suspect in the shooting, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was among tens of thousands of Afghanistan citizens resettled in 2021 in a Biden-era program that followed a chaotic US military withdrawal, and was granted asylum in April this year under the Trump administration.

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, appeared on Fox News on Monday night and said Trump endorsed Noem’s call.

“Several months ago he announced a travel ban on 19 third-world and failed state countries around the world. Secretary Noem announced tonight she is recommending that travel ban widen and cover more countries around the globe,” she said.

“Coming to the US is a privilege, it is not a right. If you abuse that privilege, and if you don’t align with the values of the US, and you don’t respect our country, our culture, our laws, and our people you are not welcome here.”

Trump’s latest immigration crackdown announced last week includes “a review of all asylum cases approved under the Biden administration”, although the DHS did not clarify if it applied to only Afghanistan or all countries.

In June, the Trump administration enacted a full travel ban on visitors from 12 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East, with partial restrictions for seven more. It is facing a number of legal challenges from immigration advocacy and civil rights groups.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0db2a959337358c174a27109296b0334085ee8ca/486_23_2448_1959/master/2448.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8359e331b5c6e5ec4c802a8c745a662c",N,,2025-12-03 08:56:33.953303

What You Need To Know

Fei Zheng, a Chinese asylum seeker, was sent to Orange County Correction Facility in Goshen, New York, reportedly separating him from his 6-year-old son

This is the third time Zheng and his son were allegedly detained by ICE since crossing the border in April

Zheng was reportedly living in Queens and his son had just enrolled in school in Astoria

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security denied these claims, saying, ""ICE does not separate families""

Reports say a Chinese asylum-seeker named Fei Zheng and his son, Yuanxin, arrived at 26 Federal Plaza on Nov. 26 flanked by advocates. The two were then separated, and the father was sent to Orange County Correction Facility — some 65 miles away.

Spector says she spoke to Zheng in person after his arrest.

“He said to me, ‘I did what they said I should do. I came in for this check-in.’ And yet they arrested him and his son,” Spector said.

In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security denied these claims, saying, “ICE does not separate families… Mr. Zheng had the right and the ability to depart the country as a family and willfully chose to not comply.”

“For them to say they don’t separate families is just an outright lie because we know that they do and they did in this situation. And we know that they’ve done it with many other families,” Spector said.

Spector says last week’s arrest was the third time Zheng and his son had been held by ICE since crossing the border last spring.

They were paroled in late October and have spent the last month establishing a life in Queens. ICE maintains that it does not detain unaccompanied children except in rare instances.

“This is the case for so many of these families and individuals who are going in and following immigration law as mandated, yet they’re being arrested and detained and being disappeared. Right now, his son is disappeared,” Spector said.

Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani condemned the arrest on social media, writing, “Six-year-old Yuanxin had just enrolled in the first grade at an elementary school in Astoria. Now he’s in custody, alone. ICE won’t say where. This cruelty serves no one. It must end.”

“I’m sure he was really enjoying being in school and that’s where he should be. That’s where a six-year-old should be — with other children and learning and being with their parents and not separated and in detention,” Spector said.

She says advocates are working on getting legal support and support from local elected officials to try to release Zheng from ICE detention and reunite him with his son.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Yuanxin_zheng_jennie_spector,N,,2025-12-03 07:56:58.238774

The call for “reverse migration” is a direct warning to all people of color—Trump is telling us we do not belong in his America.
Calls for “reverse migration” or to “remigrate” will make all people of color and Muslims, regardless of citizenship status, vulnerable.
The call for “reverse migration” is a direct warning to all people of color—Trump is telling us we do not belong in his America.
It is also not a matter of “loving our Country.” Immigrants love this country despite the immense abuse they suffer.","On November 28, President Donald Trump announced via Truth Social, “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.”

This post came after an Afghan national was identified as the suspect in the shooting of Sarah Beckstrom and Andrew Wolfe, two National Guard members deployed in Washington, DC as part of the Trump’s administration nationwide crime-fighting effort. At the time of this writing, Beckstrom has passed, and Wolfe remains in critical condition.

This is a tragedy on multiple fronts. Two victims of another senseless mass shooting. The National Guard should have never been deployed in the first place. Military officials had warned that they would be in danger. This did not need to happen.

But, as a philosopher who specializes in issues of racism and immigration, I can assure you that Trump’s response is another tragedy in the making. His call for “reverse migration” is not a cure. It is the culmination of his yearlong effort to limit migration and strip immigrants of their rights and protections. In January, he issued Executive Order 14160 to restrict the constitutionally-guaranteed right to birthright citizenship. In June, the Trump administration implemented travel bans that fully or partially restrict nationals of 19 countries from entering the US. In October, the Trump administration announced that it will restrict the number of refugees it admits into the US to 7,500, with most slots being filled by white South Africans.

The call for “reverse migration” is a direct warning to all people of color—Trump is telling us we do not belong in his America.

Trump is attempting to politically capitalize on the death of a young servicewoman to further his xenophobic and Islamophobic policies. These policies will make the US weak and alone. They will divide us. Since 2015, the rate of reported hate crimes has more than doubled. Calls for “reverse migration” or to “remigrate” will make all people of color and Muslims, regardless of citizenship status, vulnerable.

This is not hyperbole. We’ve seen this same scenario play itself out repeatedly. After the 9/11 attacks, hate crimes against Muslims rose 1,617% according to the FBI. After China was blamed for Covid-19, violent attacks against Asians and Asian Americans rose. People do not see citizenship. They see skin color and judge who belongs on the basis of that.

No matter his motives, Rahmanullah Lakanwal should be given a fair trial. He should be judged for his actions and held accountable. However, he is an individual. He does not represent all Afghans, Muslims, people of color, or immigrants. Permanently pausing migration from all “Third World Countries” is a drastic overreaction with deeply racist connotations. Phrases like “Third World” or “developing” imply a hierarchy of countries—that some are ""backwards"" and ""lesser."" They are used almost exclusively to refer to formerly colonized nations in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. For Trump, these are “shithole countries.”

These connotations are not absent in Trump’s words. His decision to halt all migration from the “Third World” due to the actions of one man is racist. He is communicating that if one person of color kills someone, then all people of color are dangerous. The call for “reverse migration” is a direct warning to all people of color—Trump is telling us we do not belong in his America.

This is not about being a “net asset.” Immigrants pay taxes, contribute to the economy, and commit fewer crimes than US citizens.

It is also not a matter of “loving our Country.” Immigrants love this country despite the immense abuse they suffer. That’s why they came here. It’s why so many people around the world want to come here.

The problem, however, is that Trump fails to understand that loving this country does not mean blind acceptance or absolute loyalty. Rep. Ilhan Omar, (D-Minn.) for instance, is no less American because she criticizes the Trump administration. It is because she’s American that she stands up for the Constitution.

Love is not about submission. It is about transformation and growth. That's precisely what immigrants do. Whether it be film, music, literature, the arts, the sciences, they prove their love by enriching and broadening our culture.

All that said, Trump is right about one thing—the US system does need to fully recover. But, the problem is not immigrants. The problem is him.",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61727342&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-12-03 09:57:14.200720

“Just absolute devastation at having to hand my 5-month-old son over to my husband without knowing what was going to happen,” Katie Paul recalled of her arrest on Nov. 20.

She’s from the U.K. and met her husband Stephen Paul gaming online. They got married in the U.S. in the fall, and she had planned to return to the U.K. as they determined where they would live. But two days after their wedding, they found out she was expecting, and knew it would be a high-risk pregnancy.

“We decided that we wanted to be a family when he was born, and so we reached out to some immigration attorneys,” Katie said. “Every attorney that we spoke to said, you know, things like overstaying or unauthorized work are forgiven, and are a part of most marriage-based adjustment of statuses, and there would be no issues.”

Arrests at green card interviews began in San Diego on Nov. 12. When asked about this tactic, ICE has repeatedly said they are detaining people for overstaying their visas, saying in a statement, “Being unlawfully present in the United States is itself a violation of federal law.”

But multiple immigration attorneys have told NBC 7 that there’s an exception in federal law for direct relatives of U.S. citizens, including spouses, who are going through the green card process, and this type of enforcement is without precedent.

Katie and Stephen decided to remain in the U.S. so she could access medical care for the complications with her pregnancy, and applied for her green card. On Nov. 20, they said they took their son Alan to San Diego’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services office for Katie’s final interview, arriving nervous but prepared. They told their lawyer it was fine if she joined by phone, rather than in person, because they had “just such an easy case,” Katie said.

“We were finalizing and we were just making small talk with the immigration officer,” Katie said. “Then all of a sudden, there was two ICE agents in the room, and munchkin was asleep in my arms because he'd just been fed, and he was tired. He was curled up in his blanket, and they said that they had an arrest warrant for me.”

“We were saying, like, you know, ‘Is there any way for this not to happen? Because, you know, we've got the baby,’” she recalled. “The USCIS supervisor was in tears herself because she's a mom and she said there was nothing that she could do. And, you know, in the end, I had no choice.”

Katie said she handed their son to Stephen, who put him in his stroller and she leaned down to give him a kiss goodbye, with the whole family in tears.

Having never committed a crime, Katie then found herself in handcuffs and leg cuffs.

“Absolutely traumatizing,” she said. “When I have socks on my legs, it like it's the same kind of feeling and it just - it takes me right back to it.”

Katie said she was taken to the basement of the USCIS building, along with seven other women and some men arrested the same day, the same way. They were transferred to the federal building a few blocks south, then taken to the Otay Mesa Detention Center, some returning to the federal building, then back to the detention center again.

“I cried for about five hours straight at one point,” she said. “It was just a lot of despair because none of us understood what happened. None of us knew what was happening. It felt so abrupt. To go from your green card interview to being detained is just - I don't know, it was just crazy.”

“I was terrified that they were going to deport me straight away,” Katie continued. She said she was given a notice that she would be deported within 48 hours without seeing an immigration judge, but refused to sign it.

“I was absolutely terrified because I was expected not to see my son for however long it would take,” she said. “It felt like my heart had been ripped out.”

“It hurt then and it hurts now because it was our family being torn apart,” Stephen said. “Katie was crying when I had to take Alan, and I knew every time that she spoke to me that what she wanted most was to hold her baby again.”

The couple said a legal battle ensued and on Nov. 25, Katie called her husband to find out she was being released, with her green card approved.

“I think I screamed,” she said, her husband adding that she burst into tears. Hours later, she was released at the San Ysidro trolley station. Now back home, Katie said she feels a lot of anxiety and is afraid to go outside, unable to return to even her daily walks with her son through their neighborhood.

“There’s just the side of me that is so scared of going through it again,” she said. “When I hear a noise outside, I get quite scared.”

“I've stopped knocking on the door when I come home because I don't want her worrying that it's ICE agents coming to pick her up,” Stephen said.

The couple said they are normally intensely private, but as their case has garnered international attention, they are weathering the storm because they feel fortunate that Katie was released relatively quickly, with so many people like her still detained, still fighting their cases.

“Even though we've managed to come out of this quickly, there's a lot of people in very similar situations who haven't, who still need advocacy, who still need that help,” Stephen said. “We want to make sure that it's not just our family that's put back together. It's all the families that were torn apart.”

“If it stops it happening to anyone else then it was worth it, I think,” Katie said.",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/12/katie-paul-released.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-03 11:01:09.895435

Officials, including Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, have also said publicly that authorities are or should be using a lower standard of suspicion, Howell wrote, calling those comments “blatant misstatements” of the law.

“Rather than the possible alternative excuse that such public statements are the result of ignorance or incompetence on the part of DHS’s high-ranking officials and legal counsel, the better, straight-forward explanation is that DHS’s statements derive from an intentional policy and practice of conducting warrantless civil immigration arrests without the requisite probable cause findings,” the judge wrote.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The immigrant advocacy organization CASA, Inc. brought the lawsuit along with a group of noncitizens who have temporary protected status or are seeking asylum.

Generally, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and other federal agents must have an administrative warrant before making an arrest. Arrests made without a warrant require the officers to articulate reasons they believe arrestees are in the country illegally and likely to escape — such as when a noncitizen presents conflicting documents or admits to previous deportations.

One analysis showed that 943 immigration arrests took place between Aug. 7 and Sept. 9 this year, comprising more than 40 percent of all arrests in Washington, Howell noted.

Howell noted that the Justice Department sought to explain away the statements from Miller and Bovino by emphasizing that they weren’t lawyers and might not understand “terms of art” like “probable cause” and “reasonable suspicion.” But the Obama-appointed judge said that explanation was a “remarkable” suggestion that some of the highest ranking Trump administration policymakers were either “ignorant or incompetent, or both.”

Howell also used the ruling to scold immigration agencies for declining to properly identify themselves when making arrests, saying the practice is intended to terrorize.

President Donald Trump:

We're going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country. Ilhan Omar is garbage. She's garbage. Her friends are garbage. We don't want them in our country. Let them go back to where they came from and fix it.

Geoff Bennett:

Local officials, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, forcefully condemned both Mr. Trump's comments and the impending operation. Minnesota is home to the nation's largest Somali community.

Michael Dell, the billionaire founder of Dell Technologies, and his wife, have pledged more than $6 billion to the Trump administration, with the funds designated for investment accounts for children known as Trump Accounts.

Michael Dell, CEO, Dell:

We believe the smartest investment that we can make is an investment in children.

Geoff Bennett:

The Dells' donation will provide $250 each to 25 million eligible children under the age of 10 who live in zip codes where the median household income falls below $150,000.

Mr. Trump's tax bill created the accounts, which will be rolled out next summer. Withdrawals from the accounts cannot be made until a child turns 18.

The Pentagon today held its first briefing in nearly half-a-year as it faces bipartisan backlash over that September attack on an alleged drug trafficking boat in the Caribbean. The credentialed attendees were a host of right-wing media figures, including Laura Loomer and former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz. Gaetz is now a host on the pro-Trump network OAN.

It follows a major overhaul of Pentagon press rules this fall that require journalists to sign a restrictive new policy. That prompted an exodus of traditional news outlets from the building.

Millions of Americans woke up this morning to their first snow of the season, as windy, icy weather rolled across the Northeast. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings across New England, where some areas have already received more than half-a-foot of snow.

Several other states will see a mix of snow and rain, like in Pennsylvania, where wet, slushy conditions led to hundreds of accidents. The storm already hit the Midwest, creating more treacherous travel after the Thanksgiving holiday. This pile-up in Central Missouri yesterday brought highway traffic to a standstill. Forecasters say another storm could bring winter weather to the mid-Atlantic later this week.

Turning overseas now to Israel. Forensics experts are examining what are believed to be the remains of one of the last two hostages inside Gaza. Palestinian militants via the Red Cross handed over the remains, which Palestinian media said were uncovered in Northern Gaza.

Meantime, Palestinians in Khan Yunis mourned a freelance videographer who was one of at least four people killed today by Israeli fire across the territory. Israel's military said they were fired upon because they believed they had crossed into areas that Israel controls and posed a threat.

Pope Leo XIV has completed his first trip abroad as pontiff with an appeal for peace after spending three days in Lebanon.

Pope Leo XIV, Leader of Catholic Church: The path of mutual hostility and destruction and the horror of war has been traveled too long with the deplorable results that are before everyone's eyes.

Geoff Bennett:

He led mass along Beirut's waterfront, urging dialogue and reconciliation, as the country sees renewed fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Earlier in the day, the pope prayed at the site of the 2020 port explosion that killed 218 people and caused billions in damages,a disaster for which no officials have ever been held accountable, and the pope called for justice.

Returning to the Vatican aboard his plane, Pope Leo also urged U.S. leaders to refrain from threats of military action against Venezuela.

Two fashion giants are now one. Prada has bought its longtime rival Versace for nearly $1.4 billion. It completes a deal that's been in the work since April. Prada says the Versace brand offers significant untapped growth potential.

Meantime, on Wall Street today, stocks bounced back to across-the-board gains. The Dow Jones industrial average added nearly 200 points, the Nasdaq added more than half-a-percent, and the S&P 500 also closed slightly higher.

New York's already overburdened immigration courts have at least seven fewer judges today. That's because the Trump administration fired them. The firings are seen as part of an ongoing effort by the White House to overhaul the U.S. immigration system while ramping up deportations. We're joined now by Jeremiah Johnson, an immigration judge who was himself fired just over a week ago. He is also the executive vice president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. Welcome, Judge Johnson.

JEREMIAH JOHNSON: Thank you for having me.

CHANG: So I just want to start with what happened to you personally. How were you notified of your firing? And were you provided any explanation for why you're being let go?

JOHNSON: I was actually in a meeting with my ACIJ, my supervisor immigration judge, when a legal assistant had walked by and told us that judges were being fired. I wasn't told of who at that exact time, or wasn't myself, but then I ended up down in my chambers later on, turned on my email and found out that I was one of the judges who had been fired. So I was notified via email. And shortly thereafter, without even the ability to print that letter, I was locked out of the system.

CHANG: Oh, wow. And did that email explain why you were being fired?

JOHNSON: Pursuant to Article 2 of the Constitution, the attorney general had decided to remove me from my position. That was the only explanation given. And no thank you, either.

CHANG: Well, NPR recently analyzed the professional background of some 70 judges who were fired through early November, and we found that judges who only had work experience defending immigrants were fired at a much greater rate than those who only had experience working for the Department of Homeland Security. I'm curious, what do you make of that data?

JOHNSON: It appears to me that the immigration judges who are being fired have experience in immigration law. They're professional judges, experts in immigration law and policy. There were hiring trends in the past that favored Department of Homeland Security prosecutors and others over those with removal defense. So maybe the timing of the hiring may had something to do with that, but I do know, when I was fired on the day I was fired, colleagues of mine also had a background in the Department of Homeland Security. So you see this among all judges, professional judges, different backgrounds, and so that trend gives me pause, but I'm not certain that's the reason because the attorney general gave no reason. Just indicated that it was in her decision to remove.

CHANG: Well, we should note that in response to that NPR reporting I just cited, the Department of Justice told us, quote, ""it does not target or prioritize immigration judges for any personnel decision one way or the other based on prior experience."" So let me ask you, does that square with what you're seeing, what you've just described?

JOHNSON: What I think you're seeing is that immigration judges with experience are being targeted, are being fired.

CHANG: Experience as to either immigration defense or immigration prosecution?

JOHNSON: No, as immigration judges themselves. First, you saw people being fired who had two years' probation on the bench. Now you're seeing other judges who have experience in the law. And the same day that we were fired, you have ads promoted by the Department of Homeland Security for deportation judges. So what I think you're seeing is an attack on judges themselves, the court system themselves.

CHANG: I was just going to ask you what you think the cost of these departures will be, because there were about 700 immigration judges at the start of this year, and since then, about 140 of them have been fired or have resigned, according to the immigration judges union and NPR reporting. Is the immigration court system at a breaking point?

JOHNSON: Not at a breaking point. I would say a warning point. I do remain optimistic in the future because it is in the law that removal proceedings shall be conducted by immigration judges. Immigration judges are still on the bench. But I think Congress needs to be asking those points to the department. I think the American taxpayer should also be asking those questions. There are currently a very large backlog of cases that need to be heard.

CHANG: Yes, millions of cases, so...

JOHNSON: Yes.

CHANG: ...I mean, what are some possible solutions that could help get through that backlog?

JOHNSON: Creating an independent immigration court, hiring more, investing in immigration courts. Right now, you're seeing a divestiture almost, hiring temporary immigration judges or reallocating military personnel. While the NIJ (ph) and immigration judges appreciate the help, we want to make sure that those people are qualified and receive the proper training and experience. So I think there is a way forward, and that's with investment in the immigration courts, and we're not seeing that right now.

CHANG: But if I may push back, I mean, given this massive backlog of cases, why isn't the Trump administration's approach - this approach of firing judges and hiring new ones - worth trying?

JOHNSON: Well, they're not hiring. We saw a number of temporary immigration judges, and the administration also then has lowered the standards for hiring those immigration judges. There has not been a replacement of the number of immigration judges. So I don't think you see the investment in immigration courts. It's not just this administration. It has been a long-going neglect of the system that needs to be righted.

CHANG: That is Jeremiah Johnson, the executive vice president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. Thank you very much for joining us today.

JOHNSON: Thank you.

CHANG: And in a statement to NPR, the agency within DOJ that oversees immigration judges says that if a judge shows, quote, ""systematic bias,"" then the agency can, quote, ""take action to preserve the integrity of its system.""

Last month, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the Trump administration to release several hundred detainees on a $1,500 bond. While they waited for their immigration court dates, the former detainees would have been tracked with devices like ankle monitors or a smartphone app.

The judge ruled in response to immigration and civil rights lawyers’ allegations that Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly violated a 2022 federal consent decree restricting the use of warrantless arrests for undocumented immigrants.

But the Trump administration appealed, and on Tuesday argued to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals that the judge overstepped his authority by modifying the consent decree.

Criticism of ruling

At least one of the three judges on the panel — Trump appointee Thomas Kirsch II — seemed to agree. He criticized Cummings’ November order to release detainees along with his Oct. 7 order extending the consent decree until February. Cummings was appointed by President Joe Biden.

During nearly an hour of oral arguments, Kirsch said he was “surprised — I was shocked, actually” that Cummings’ October ruling “acts as if these are two private parties negotiating over the terms of a contract.”

U.S. Department of Justice lawyer Benjamin Hayes contended that by modifying the consent decree, Cummings was exercising power he didn’t have and forcing the administration to ignore federal law. National Immigrant Justice Center attorney Keren Zwick argued that Cummings was merely interpreting existing federal law and enforcing the consent decree in response to the Trump administration altering the playing field.

Zwick and her colleagues argue the new administration’s policy encouraging agents to carry blank warrant forms and fill them out at the scene of an arrest is a violation of the consent decree. Cummings in October agreed, writing the use of I-200 warrants was “explicitly designed” to get around the requirement that agents have probable cause to believe a person is in the country illegally and he or she is a flight risk before arresting an undocumented immigrant.

Zwick told Kirsch that Cummings was well within his rights to modify the consent decree because the use of I-200 warrants was “never contemplated” in the years she and her colleagues negotiated with DHS over the terms of the decree.

“So what?” Kirsch replied, saying that wasn’t enough for Cummings to modify or extend the decree.

Judge John Lee, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, took the opposite view on the I-200 forms.

“It seems to me odd that the government — whoever has the White House at the time — can just say, ‘Oh, well, I think this sheet of paper is good enough,'” Lee said.

Arrests exceed ‘worst of the worst’

Though the consent decree was scheduled to expire in May, plaintiffs’ attorneys had asked for an extension, which was supposed to have left it in place while the judge weighed the arguments. Cummings’ October ruling extended the decree through early February.

But since that ruling, “Operation Midway Blitz” reached a crescendo, resulting in the arrests of several thousand people. Cummings would go on to determine that not only did I-200 arrests violate the consent decree, but so did a new DHS policy on mandatory detention.

Before a Sept. 5 decision from the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants who were arrested would be released on bond after an immigration judge determined a person didn’t have a disqualifying criminal record and was not a danger to the community or a flight risk.

But in the days before Operation Midway Blitz began last month, the Trump administration’s immigration appeals board reversed decades of precedent and ruled that detention would be mandatory for any undocumented immigrant who entered the U.S. without being “admitted” by an immigration officer.

Then on Sept. 8, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh issued a decision that allows immigration officers to take a person’s “apparent ethnicity” into account when determining reasonable suspicion to question someone’s immigration status. As a result of those factors, thousands more people were arrested in Midway Blitz than the “worst of the worst” promised by the Trump administration, including immigrants who’ve been in the U.S. for decades.

During a Nov. 13 hearing, Cummings said his staff had determined that the vast majority of approximately 100 undocumented immigrants who have active cases in Chicago federal court were arrested either at work or commuting to and from work, including 20 landscapers and nine people apprehended at Home Depot or Menards, “presumably either seeking work or picking up materials.”

Based on that pattern, the judge said it was “highly likely” that many arrestees should not be subject to mandatory detention and were “unlikely ... part of the group of drug dealers, violent criminals and assorted ne’re-do-wells that fall into category that ICE calls worst of the worst.”

Cummings has repeatedly pointed out that more than 100 of his colleagues across the country have rejected DHS’ arguments on mandatory detention since the agency began testing the new legal theory in July. But the judge has also repeatedly said he doesn’t want anyone actually dangerous to be released from ICE custody. Per his orders, DHS had identified roughly 450 people who could potentially be released before the 7th Circuit halted Cummings’ order on Nov. 19.

Kirsch, though, said the lower court judge’s theory of his power over consent decrees could prove dangerous.

“What would stop the current administration from entering into a bunch of consent decrees to entrench their policy preferences on the next administration?” he asked.

Riot control weapons case dead

Meanwhile on Tuesday, protesters, clergy and media outlets who launched a high-profile lawsuit against DHS this fall over immigration agents’ use of riot control weapons said in a court filing they plan to drop their case.

Over nearly two months of litigation, attorneys for the plaintiffs corralled hundreds of videos and photos alleging agents’ inappropriate use of force against members of the public. They also forced the release of thousands of hours of body camera footage from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents participating in Operation Midway Blitz.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino into her courtroom and later called him a liar. The judge issued a temporary restraining order restricting weapons like tear gas, pepper balls, flashbang grenades and other use of force, and last month issued a more indefinite injunction.

But the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals last month stayed Ellis’ ruling, calling it “overbroad” and ruling that the judge’s injunction overstepped and “impermissibly” infringed on how the executive branch conducts law enforcement activity.

Moving to dismiss the lawsuit will prevent the 7th Circuit or U.S. Supreme Court from giving the Trump administration any permanent expanded powers against civilians. Despite the specter of losses on appeal, plaintiffs’ lawyers on Tuesday framed ending the case as a win.

Steve Art, an attorney with Loevy & Loevy, said in a statement that the lawsuit “exposed” the Trump administration’s “justifications for its conduct … as blatant lies.”

U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ruled that, while federal agents may have the authority to make warrantless immigration arrests, the way that authority has been used on the immigrant community in Washington was likely unlawful.

“Defendants are preliminarily enjoined from enforcing their policy of conducting warrantless civil immigration arrests without probable cause to believe that the arrestee is likely to escape before an administrative warrant can be obtained,” Howell wrote in the 88-page opinion.

She further certified a class, which she referred to as the “Unassisted Escape Risk Class,” that includes all individuals who, since President Donald Trump’s Aug. 11 “crime emergency,” have been or will be arrested without a warrant and without a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause.

On Aug. 11, Trump invoked Section 740 of the Home Rule Act — a 1973 federal statute granting local control of the District of Columbia to a city government — to effectively federalize the Metropolitan Police Department by declaring a “crime emergency.”

Under the emergency, Trump activated the D.C. National Guard throughout the city, leading several Republican governors to deploy their own National Guard troops. Federal agents began patrolling the streets with MPD officers, as the troops are not generally authorized to make arrests despite being the face of the crackdown.

According to recently reported numbers, more than 3,500 people have been arrested by federal agents following Trump’s declaration, with more than 40%, or 1,400, being immigration related.

Howell, a Barack Obama appointee, slammed Trump’s characterization of all immigrants who entered the U.S. without permission as “illegal alien criminals,” as a clear misunderstanding of immigration law.

“First, ‘as a general rule, it is not a crime for a removable alien to remain present in the United States,’” Howell wrote, citing the Supreme Court’s decision in Arizona v. United States. “As a legal matter, an immigration status violation is a civil violation. Consequently, viewing all immigrants potentially subject to removal as criminals is, as a legal matter, plain wrong.”

She added that the Supreme Court made clear in Arizona — where the high court ruled 5-3 to strike down Arizona’s infamous “Show Me Your Papers” policy authorizing warrantless immigration arrests — that the “perceived mistreatment of aliens in the U.S. may lead to harmful reciprocal treatment of American citizens abroad.”

A coalition of immigrant rights groups, led by the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, sued the Trump administration over its warrantless arrests policy on Sept. 25, arguing the practice has been overwhelmingly used against the Latino community in the nation’s capital and has swept up multiple U.S. citizens.

José Molina, a 47-year-old man from El Salvador who has lived in Washington for 25 years and has maintained valid Temporary Protected Status since 2001, was wrongfully arrested by ICE. The agents detained him overnight at a processing center in Chantilly, Virginia, before an ICE supervisor realized Molina had valid TPS status, which statutorily prohibits ICE from detaining him, and released him.

N.S., an anonymous 51-year-old man from Venezuela, has lived in Washington since 2024 with a pending asylum application for fear of persecution if he returned to Venezuela.

On Aug. 12, an agent with a DEA vest and ICE hat stopped N.S. in a Home Depot parking lot, where he had just finished shopping, and arrested him without a warrant or asking any questions. N.S. was held in various detention centers around the country for four weeks before agents released him on his own recognizance.

Aditi Shah, staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of D.C. and counsel for the plaintiffs, celebrated Howell’s decision in an email to Courthouse News.

“The government’s policy and practice of arresting people without a warrant and without probable cause in Washington, D.C., disregards important limits Congress has established for civil immigration arrests and has caused immense harm to immigrant communities in D.C.,” Shah said. “The court’s decision is a vital reminder that federal officials and agents are required to follow the law.”

Tuesday’s decision comes as the Trump administration moved to pause all immigration applications from 19 countries it has deemed “high risk,” including Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Yemen, Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.

Trump pushed for the blanket ban in the wake of the Nov. 26 fatal attack on two National Guard members in downtown Washington, for which a 29-year-old man from Afghanistan faces first-degree murder, assault and firearm charges.

The suspect, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, pleaded not guilty to the charges from his hospital bed while virtually attending his initial court appearance Tuesday.

The pause applies to people from Iran, Sudan, Eritrea, Haiti, Somalia and others banned by Mr. Trump in June who are seeking status from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees the immigration system. The list includes some of the poorest and most unstable nations in the world.

“The Trump administration is making every effort to ensure individuals becoming citizens are the best of the best. Citizenship is a privilege, not a right,” said Matthew Tragesser, a spokesman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, who confirmed the pause on Tuesday. “We will take no chances when the future of our nation is at stake.”

The pause applies to various immigration processes, most consequentially green card applications and U.S. citizenship requests. Immigration lawyers reported cancellations of naturalization ceremonies and interviews for immigration status, and said they were left puzzled on Tuesday as immigrants were turned away from interviews for green cards and other forms of relief with no explanation.

Ana Maria Schwartz, an immigration lawyer in Texas, said two of her firm’s clients from Venezuela learned upon arrival at a Citizenship and Immigration Services field office in Houston that their interviews had been canceled with no clear reason. Other lawyers have reported that applicants who had waited for months, sometimes years, for their interviews were suddenly finding their appointments removed from the system with no guidance on how to proceed, she said.

The pause will put further strain on a system that has already been struggling with backlogs, she said.

“Everything is being put on hold,” Ms. Schwartz said. “It is just like a traffic jam, and it is just going to get worse and worse and worse.”

Elissa J. Taub, an immigration lawyer in Tennessee, said a physician represented by her law partner had been scheduled to take his oath of citizenship and go through his naturalization ceremony this week but was notified it had been canceled. The client, who has a U.S. green card, was born in Iran but moved to Canada as a teenager and had been able to continue traveling despite the ban because of his Canadian citizenship, Ms. Taub said.

“We have been hearing through our network of immigration lawyers that this is not an isolated case,” she said. “Folks from Venezuela and Iran are having their naturalization oath ceremonies canceled.”

Trump administration officials had announced broad changes to the immigration system in recent days, including reviewing green cards provided to people from the travel ban countries, pausing asylum decisions and reassessing the asylum grants provided during the Biden administration.

Department of Homeland Security officials have framed the major changes as necessary to increase vetting of individuals already in the country.

“Nothing is off the table until every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a social media post this week.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/02/multimedia/02dc-travelban-tfhp/02dc-travelban-tfhp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-03 01:57:19.462240

Republican House members have filed impeachment resolutions against a myriad of judges this Congress after rulings against immigration policies, Trump administration funding decisions and more.

But those efforts have stalled in the House, amid concerns that moving forward would break with a centuries-old tradition of not ousting judges based solely on their decisions.

Senators will have an opportunity to weigh in on the debate during a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing Wednesday entitled, “Impeachment: Holding Rogue Judges Accountable.”

GOP-led impeachment resolutions have targeted judges from across the U.S., but Republicans have seethed in particular at Chief Judge James E. Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Republicans escalated their push for his impeachment last month after GOP lawmakers said the jurist signed off on nondisclosure orders that hid subpoenas that sought call records from the phones of Republican senators.

The phone records were sought as part of an investigation named “Arctic Frost,” which lawmakers say formed the basis of former special counsel John L. “Jack” Smith’s investigation into Trump’s attempt to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.

Sen. Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who leads the subcommittee, has called for the House to impeach Boasberg. “He is not being a judge. He is being a partisan, left-wing activist, and he needs to be removed from office,” Cruz said in a video.

Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., and others sent a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit last month calling for Boasberg to be “administratively suspended pending formal impeachment by the House of Representatives.”

The Arctic Frost complaints prompted Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, who initially filed articles of impeachment against Boasberg in March, to do so again last month.

“Judge Boasberg was an accomplice in the egregious Arctic Frost scandal where he equipped the Biden DOJ to spy on Republican senators,” Gill said in a statement. “His lack of integrity makes him clearly unfit for the gavel.”

Cruz and other senators last month also appealed to Attorney General Pamela Bondi, in a letter asking her to move to unseal an application for a nondisclosure order signed by Boasberg. Lawmakers said they believe the application is under seal in the Arctic Frost grand jury materials.

“Judge Boasberg’s order was a blatant abuse of power, and we must get to the bottom of how he arrived at the baseless conclusion that duly elected members of Congress would destroy evidence or intimidate witnesses,” the letter states.

Boasberg also elicited ire from Republicans earlier this year, after he ordered a temporary halt to the removal of all noncitizens in U.S. custody who were targeted under the administration’s proclamation based on a 1798 law known as the Alien Enemies Act.

As part of that case, Boasberg also has clashed with Trump officials in recent weeks in proceedings over potential criminal contempt of court for refusing to comply with his order stopping deportation flights.

But the House has yet to move forward with any impeachment proceedings against a judge. It would also be an extremely rare step for the House to impeach a federal judge.

Since 1803, only 15 judges have faced impeachment, the last in 2010 on charges of accepting bribes and making false statements under penalty of perjury, according to the Federal Judicial Center.

Beyond Boasberg, Republicans have filed a wave of impeachment resolutions this year against judges they disagree with.

Among the more recent resolutions, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, filed articles of impeachment against a judge in Maryland who sentenced the attempted assassin of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to more than eight years in prison.

Prosecutors had asked for a sentence of 30 years to life in prison for Sophie Roske, who is transgender and is referred to as Nicholas Roske in some court documents.

Republicans fumed over the sentence, arguing it was far too lenient and undermined the gravity of an assassination attempt against a sitting Supreme Court justice.

In delivering the sentence, Judge Deborah L. Boardman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland said that some of the actions from Roske — including turning herself in — justified a departure below the 30 years to life in prison that federal sentencing guidelines suggested.

Also apparently siding with anti-interventionists is Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell, whom the administration tapped to spearhead diplomatic outreach to Caracas.
The shifting composition of the right’s coalitions around the Venezuela issue can be explained by a handful of factors.
But in the meantime, the political situation within MAGA bears a resemblance to the situation on the ground: fluid and uncertain.","On the other side of the issue, Trump’s saber-rattling is meeting resistance from the GOP’s “restrainers,” a group that includes both “America First” nationalists like Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson as well as more conventional anti-interventionist libertarians like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Many members of the camp opposed Trump’s decision to bomb Iran in June on the grounds that it risks dragging the U.S. into another costly regime-change war in the Middle East, and they are raising similar concerns about toppling Maduro’s government in Venezuela.

Yet each coalition is subtly different than the ones that formed in other recent intra-right skirmishes over the Trump administration’s interventionist forays.

In this instance, long-time anti-interventionists like Carlson and Bannon are being joined by a handful of prominent conservatives who supported the U.S. bombing campaign against Iran. That cohort includes the divisive MAGA activist Laura Loomer, who clashed with Carlson earlier this year over his opposition to the Iran bombings but has now joined him in opposing military action in Venezuela. In a series of social media posts in recent weeks, Loomer has attacked fellow Republicans calling for the U.S. to intervene, arguing that ousting Maduro would saddle U.S. taxpayers with the cost of rebuilding the country while creating an opportunity for China to deepen its foothold in the region. (Loomer did not respond to requests for comment.)

Also apparently siding with anti-interventionists is Trump’s special envoy Richard Grenell, whom the administration tapped to spearhead diplomatic outreach to Caracas. Earlier this year, Grenell defended the U.S. bombing campaign in Iran, but he has emerged within the administration as a prominent proponent of a diplomatic resolution with Maduro’s government. In October, the administration paused Grenell’s outreach to Venezuela — a move that seemingly empowered more hawkish forces within the administration — but Grenell has continued to remain publicly committed to the potential for a peaceful resolution.

The anti-interventionist camp also has quietly won the backing of some right-leaning anti-immigration advocates, who fear that an escalation of the conflict could spur a hemispheric migration crisis that would undercut the administration’s efforts to cut down on immigration from South and Central America.

“Every foreign adventure that we’ve entered into has resulted in significant immigration,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for immigration restrictions. “That’s the way it always works, and it needs to be factored into any decision about intervening in foreign countries.”

Krikorian pointed out that the ratcheting up of tensions with Venezuela could also threaten other aspects of Trump’s immigration agenda, including efforts to deport Venezuelan immigrants back to their native country. On Tuesday, Maduro’s government announced that it would continue to accept twice-weekly deportation flights from the U.S. despite Trump’s recent decision to unilaterally declare a closure to Venezuela’s airspace, but Krikorian cautioned that the situation could get more difficult if the U.S. further escalates the conflict.

“Upping tensions with Venezuela makes it less likely we’re going to be able to get the Venezuelan illegal aliens that Biden let in out of the country,” he said.

The shifting composition of the right’s coalitions around the Venezuela issue can be explained by a handful of factors. For one, the issue mobilizes a small but influential group of conservative Hispanic voters for whom ousting Maduro remains a top-line issue — and who make up a critical part of Trump’s electoral coalition. At the same time, Venezuela — unlike Iran or Syria — sits in the U.S.’s backyard in the Western hemisphere, meaning that the knock-on effects of a protracted conflict could much more directly impact the U.S. Lastly, in contrast to the controversial strikes against Iran, the conflict with Venezuela doesn’t implicate U.S. support for Israel, an issue that continues to divide the GOP across traditional ideological lines.

The intra-right coalitions could shift further as the administration’s end game comes into clearer focus. In public, the administration has maintained that its pressure campaign is about combatting “narcoterrorism” and that it is not seeking to oust Maduro — even as it has continued to classify his government as “illegitimate,” ramped up U.S. military presence in the region and quietly discussed scenarios for a post-Maduro future.

All eight judges worked out of immigration court offices at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City, which is where U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is headquartered in the city, the official told CBS News.

One of the judges who was fired was Amiena Khan, an assistant chief immigration judge at 26 Federal Plaza, the official said. Khan oversaw other immigration judges there.

According to the official, 98 judges have been fired nationally since January, including 12 assistant chief immigration judges. The official said that an almost equal number have taken early out options, retired or resigned since the start of the Trump administration.

A spokeswoman at the Executive Office for Immigration Review at the Justice Department, which has control over immigration judges and courts, declined to comment Tuesday on personnel matters.

The New York Times first reported the firings on Monday.

There were about 700 immigration judges in the country to start the year, and we are now down below 600, the National Association of Immigration Judges official said. A tax bill passed in Congress and signed by President Trump in July called for 800 permanent immigration judges and judge teams to support them.

Since January, according to the official, the Justice Department has hired and placed 11 new permanent judges and 25 temporary judges with military backgrounds on six-month terms.

In an emailed statement, a Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News: ""After four years of the Biden Administration forcing Immigration Courts to implement a de facto amnesty for hundreds of thousands of aliens, this Department of Justice is restoring integrity to our immigration system and encourages talented legal professionals to join in our mission to protect national security and public safety.""

In July, three immigration judges spoke out about their firings by the Justice Department, telling CBS News the firings were ""arbitrary, unfair"" and ""an attack on the rule of law."" The Justice Department had no comment at the time on the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers union's allegations that several immigration judges had been fired without cause.

The immigration courts are struggling with a backlog of more than 3.4 million cases, and in September, a defense official confirmed to CBS News that the Pentagon is considering authorizing up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges.

The Trump administration loosened the job requirements for temporary immigration judges last month, allowing a wider group of government lawyers to handle cases in immigration court. Its new rule, published in the Federal Register in late August, states that the Justice Department ""no longer believes the restriction of [temporary immigration judges] to current Department employees with a threshold level of immigration law experience serves [the Executive Office for Immigration Review's] interests.""

Last month, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings ordered the Trump administration to release several hundred detainees on a $1,500 bond. While they waited for their immigration court dates, the former detainees would have been tracked with devices like ankle monitors or a smartphone app.

The judge ruled in response to immigration and civil rights lawyers’ allegations that Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly violated a 2022 federal consent decree restricting the use of warrantless arrests for undocumented immigrants.

But the Trump administration appealed, and on Tuesday argued to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals that the judge overstepped his authority by modifying the consent decree.

Criticism of ruling

At least one of the three judges on the panel — Trump appointee Thomas Kirsch II — seemed to agree. He criticized Cummings’ November order to release detainees along with his Oct. 7 order extending the consent decree until February. Cummings was appointed by President Joe Biden.

During nearly an hour of oral arguments, Kirsch said he was “surprised — I was shocked, actually” that Cummings’ October ruling “acts as if these are two private parties negotiating over the terms of a contract.”

U.S. Department of Justice lawyer Benjamin Hayes contended that by modifying the consent decree, Cummings was exercising power he didn’t have and forcing the administration to ignore federal law. National Immigrant Justice Center attorney Keren Zwick argued that Cummings was merely interpreting existing federal law and enforcing the consent decree in response to the Trump administration altering the playing field.

Zwick and her colleagues argue the new administration’s policy encouraging agents to carry blank warrant forms and fill them out at the scene of an arrest is a violation of the consent decree. Cummings in October agreed, writing the use of I-200 warrants was “explicitly designed” to get around the requirement that agents have probable cause to believe a person is in the country illegally and he or she is a flight risk before arresting an undocumented immigrant.

Zwick told Kirsch that Cummings was well within his rights to modify the consent decree because the use of I-200 warrants was “never contemplated” in the years she and her colleagues negotiated with DHS over the terms of the decree.

“So what?” Kirsch replied, saying that wasn’t enough for Cummings to modify or extend the decree.

Judge John Lee, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, took the opposite view on the I-200 forms.

“It seems to me odd that the government — whoever has the White House at the time — can just say, ‘Oh, well, I think this sheet of paper is good enough,’” Lee said.

Arrests exceed ‘worst of the worst’

Though the consent decree was scheduled to expire in May, plaintiffs’ attorneys had asked for an extension, which was supposed to have left it in place while the judge weighed the arguments. Cummings’ October ruling extended the decree through early February.

But since that ruling, “Operation Midway Blitz” reached a crescendo, resulting in the arrests of several thousand people. Cummings would go on to determine that not only did I-200 arrests violate the consent decree, but so did a new DHS policy on mandatory detention.

Before a Sept. 5 decision from the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants who were arrested would be released on bond after an immigration judge determined a person didn’t have a disqualifying criminal record and was not a danger to the community or a flight risk.

But in the days before Operation Midway Blitz began last month, the Trump administration’s immigration appeals board reversed decades of precedent and ruled that detention would be mandatory for any undocumented immigrant who entered the U.S. without being “admitted” by an immigration officer.

Then on Sept. 8, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh issued a decision that allows immigration officers to take a person’s “apparent ethnicity” into account when determining reasonable suspicion to question someone’s immigration status. As a result of those factors, thousands more people were arrested in Midway Blitz than the “worst of the worst” promised by the Trump administration, including immigrants who’ve been in the U.S. for decades.

During a Nov. 13 hearing, Cummings said his staff had determined that the vast majority of approximately 100 undocumented immigrants who have active cases in Chicago federal court were arrested either at work or commuting to and from work, including 20 landscapers and nine people apprehended at Home Depot or Menards, “presumably either seeking work or picking up materials.”

Based on that pattern, the judge said it was “highly likely” that many arrestees should not be subject to mandatory detention and were “unlikely … part of the group of drug dealers, violent criminals and assorted ne’re-do-wells that fall into category that ICE calls worst of the worst.”

Cummings has repeatedly pointed out that more than 100 of his colleagues across the country have rejected DHS’ arguments on mandatory detention since the agency began testing the new legal theory in July. But the judge has also repeatedly said he doesn’t want anyone actually dangerous to be released from ICE custody. Per his orders, DHS had identified roughly 450 people who could potentially be released before the 7th Circuit halted Cummings’ order on Nov. 19.

Kirsch, though, said the lower court judge’s theory of his power over consent decrees could prove dangerous.

“What would stop the current administration from entering into a bunch of consent decrees to entrench their policy preferences on the next administration?” he asked.

Riot control weapons case dead

Meanwhile on Tuesday, protesters, clergy and media outlets who launched a high-profile lawsuit against DHS this fall over immigration agents’ use of riot control weapons said in a court filing they plan to drop their case.

Over nearly two months of litigation, attorneys for the plaintiffs corralled hundreds of videos and photos alleging agents’ inappropriate use of force against members of the public. They also forced the release of thousands of hours of body camera footage from U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents participating in Operation Midway Blitz.

U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino into her courtroom and later called him a liar. The judge issued a temporary restraining order restricting weapons like tear gas, pepper balls, flashbang grenades and other use of force, and last month issued a more indefinite injunction.

But the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals last month stayed Ellis’ ruling, calling it “overbroad” and ruling that the judge’s injunction overstepped and “impermissibly” infringed on how the executive branch conducts law enforcement activity.

Moving to dismiss the lawsuit will prevent the 7th Circuit or U.S. Supreme Court from giving the Trump administration any permanent expanded powers against civilians. Despite the specter of losses on appeal, plaintiffs’ lawyers on Tuesday framed ending the case as a win.

Steve Art, an attorney with Loevy & Loevy, said in a statement that the lawsuit “exposed” the Trump administration’s “justifications for its conduct … as blatant lies.”

“The injunction broadly obstructs the enforcement of the nation’s laws, chills the exercise of executive power, and subverts the constitutional structure.” ____","In what appears to be a longer-term legal strategy, the plaintiffs in an injunction case limiting the use of force by immigration agents during Operation Midway Blitz on Tuesday abruptly moved to dismiss the underlying lawsuit in the midst of an appeal by the Trump administration.

In the request, lawyers representing a consortium of media outlets and other plaintiffs noted that the immigration enforcement surge “has ended” in Chicago — at least for now — and that “counsel has not received a single report of unconstitutional behavior that necessitated this case” since Nov. 8.

If the dismissal is granted, it could effectively end a case that came to symbolize the havoc Midway Blitz caused in Chicago and led to U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issuing a scathing ruling limiting the use of tear gas or other munitions against journalists and protesters, among other restrictions.

In a statement Tuesday, the board for the Chicago Headline Club, the lead plaintiff in the case, claimed victory, saying that Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino and his team of agents left town soon after Ellis’ injunction was entered.

“To no one’s surprise, the federal government appealed, and the lower court’s preliminary injunction was stayed in the meantime,” the statement said. “Given that the Border Patrol and other federal agencies have reduced their presence for now, we don’t see a need to keep the court fight going. We’ll take the win.”

Lead plaintiffs’ attorney Steve Art said the litigation exposed the brutality behind the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement and showed that its justifications for the use of force were “blatant lies.”

“Judge Ellis’s powerful opinion stands as the final word in this case, and as a defining document of our time,” Art said in a written statement.

Meanwhile, the Chicago Headline Club said that it was “fully prepared to go to court again if federal agents return in force or if any activities of federal agents escalate into violations of our constitutional rights.”

According to the motion to dismiss, the Department of Justice has agreed to drop its appeal as long as Ellis dismisses the lawsuit “with prejudice,” meaning it cannot be refiled.

A DOJ spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

The decision to drop the case came after ominous signs from a conservative three-judge panel with the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which issued an emergency stay of Ellis’ injunction last month. It’s not immediately clear if the appeals court would drop the matter entirely. The court had issued an expedited briefing schedule and set arguments for later this month.

In asking the 7th Circuit for a stay, lawyers for the U.S. Department of Justice wrote earlier this month that the case was a “perfect example” of a growing trend in the nation’s courts to issue sweeping injunctions that violate the separation of powers and “superintend law-enforcement activities under threat of contempt.”

Days later, a conservative three-judge panel of the 7th Circuit granted the stay and set the case for expedited briefing, saying the government was likely to succeed on those arguments.

“The preliminary injunction entered by the district court is overbroad,” the order said. “In no uncertain terms, the district court’s order enjoins an expansive range of defendants, including the President of the United States, the entire Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, and anyone acting in concert with them. … The practical effect is to enjoin all law enforcement officers within the Executive Branch.”

Ellis’ injunction also requires government officials to submit all future guidelines for use of force to the court for review, “a mandate impermissibly infringing on principles of separation of powers on this record,” the appeals court said.

The injunction was also too “prescriptive” in barring the “use of scores of riot control weapons and other devices in a way that resembles a federal regulation,” the appellate court order said.

All three judges on the panel hearing the appeal are Republican nominees. Judge Frank Easterbook was nominated by President Ronald Reagan, while Judge Michael Scudder and Judge Michael Brennan were each nominated by Trump in his first term.

While the judge’s warned not to read too much into its order for a stay, it was clear that the court was poised to severely limit — if not overturn — Ellis’ injunction, which could have greatly hampered any future efforts to rein in immigration enforcement practices should it pick up again in the spring.

In her injunction ruling, Ellis earlier this month revealed new information gleaned from body-worn cameras and other evidence showing how agents used tear gas and flash-bang grenades on fleeing protesters, shot a praying minister in the face with pepper balls and even used ChatGPT to help write a report.

The 233-page written ruling took readers methodically through many of the high-profile melees between immigration agents and protesters during the two-month operation, including incidents in Albany Park, Old Irving Park, Evanston and the East Side.

Ellis wrote in the opinion that, over and over, body-worn camera footage from the agents undermined what was eventually put in their use-of-force reports, rendering their statements unreliable.

The reports also misidentified “neighborhood moms and dads, Chicago Bears fans, people dressed in Halloween costumes, and the lawyer who lives on the block” as professional agitators, Ellis wrote, while the body cameras at times captured the agents’ apparent glee in deploying tear gas and other munitions on residential streets.

Ellis’ preliminary injunction prohibits immigration agents from deploying tear gas or other munitions before issuing two explicit warnings, requires agents in the field to have body cameras and wear clear identification on their uniforms and forbids law enforcement from targeting journalists or interrupting their news gathering in most circumstances.

Unlike a previously entered temporary restraining order, the preliminary injunction was to remain in effect until a final decision on the merits of the case is made, either at trial or through a settlement. Ellis had tentatively set a hearing on permanent injunction for March.

In its appeal brief filed last week, the Department of Justice argued Ellis’ injunction order was “untenably overbroad” and improperly empowers her to “micromanage how federal agents respond to disruptive and often violent protests throughout the Chicago area.”

“What began as a complaint by a handful of journalists and protesters alleging that federal officers targeted them with crowd-control devices at a few protests in September and early October has transformed into an instrument for judicial micromanagement of federal law-enforcement operations,” lawyers for the Department of Justice wrote in the brief. “The injunction broadly obstructs the enforcement of the nation’s laws, chills the exercise of executive power, and subverts the constitutional structure.”

While plaintiffs characterized their move as a win, the case was headed toward a skeptical appeals court.

The court filing Tuesday noted that the federal officers led by senior U.S. Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino “are no longer operating in the Northern District of Illinois.” Bovino left the Chicago area last month for North Carolina, but sporadic immigration arrests have continued by other federal agents.

“We got the relief that we were looking for. They left,” said David Owens, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. “When the emergency goes away, things change.""

The attorneys also noted a blistering 223-page opinion by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis last month that outlined her findings in issuing a preliminary injunction restricting federal agents’ use of force.

The fate of the order was up in the air after an appeals court last month deemed it “overbroad” and “too prescriptive.” But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also cautioned against “overreading” its stay of Ellis' injunction and said a quick appeal process could lead to a “more tailored and appropriate” order. Arguments before the three-judge panel were set for later this month.

Owens declined to detail the plaintiffs’ legal reasoning in dropping the case, including if the appeals court’s intervention played a role.

The injunction was in response to a lawsuit filed by news outlets and protesters who claimed federal officers used excessive force during an immigration crackdown that has netted more than 3,000 arrests since September across the nation’s third-largest city and its many suburbs. Among other things, Ellis’ order restricted agents from using physical force and chemical agents such as tear gas and pepper balls, unless necessary or to prevent an “an immediate threat.” She said the current practices violated the constitutional rights of journalists and protesters.

“Because of the work of many Chicagoans, including the brave plaintiffs in this case, the brutality of Operation Midway Blitz was carefully documented for all to see, the constitutional rights of civilians across the region were vindicated, and the Trump administration’s justifications for its conduct were exposed as blatant lies,” said attorney Steve Art. “Judge Ellis’s powerful opinion stands as the final word in this case, and as a defining document of our time.”

A message left Tuesday for the Department of Homeland Security was not immediately returned. The department oversees both the U.S Border Patrol and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

DHS and Bovino have defended the operation in Chicago, saying agents were going after criminals and faced hostile crowds.

The case also precipitated a trove of new details about the immigration operation in the Chicago area, including through private interviews with Bovino, body camera footage and witness testimonies in court. Ellis cited each of these in her opinion, describing agents launching tear gas without warning, aiming rubber rounds at reporters, tackling protesters and laughing as blood oozed from a demonstrator’s ear — scenes that Ellis says were flatly at odds with the government’s own narratives.

Federal court weighs case over abrupt termination of Montana State University students' immigration status

The defense stated that the federal government ""ran into a buzzsaw"" of lawsuits after the March 2025 Student Criminal Alien Initiative (SCAI) began.

Through SCAI, federal agents searched the names of foreign students through the National Criminal Information Center's (NCIC) database, which tracks encounters with law enforcement.

Research returned thousands of hits, which prompted the termination of what's called SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor System Records).

Universities nationwide sent letters to foreign students warning of deportation.

Then, in April, the ACLU's lawsuit on behalf of the graduate students began. Later that month, the government reversed course and temporarily restored the SEVIS records.

Fast forward to Dec. 2, where the defense urged dismissal without prejudice since they say the government has no intent to engage in similar conduct.

The day before the shooting was carried out, the Trump administration announced it would review all refugee admissions that were issued under the Biden administration, some 200,000 people over four years.
Lakanwal, who served in a CIA-backed counter-terrorism unit during the war, came to the U.S. under Biden but was approved for asylum under the Trump administration.
“This guy was vetted by both the Biden and Trump administrations, and that’s not the issue here, the vetting.
“We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country,” Trump said of Somalians.","President Trump’s threats to crack down on immigration are leaving migrants bracing as the administration said it will close the door on many legal pathways to the U.S. following a shooting that killed a National Guard member.

Since the Wednesday shooting killed 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, Trump and his Cabinet members have proposed a dizzying number of reforms as part of a Thanksgiving pledge to “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries.”

The Trump administration has paused all pending asylum applications for those from across the globe seeking refuge in the U.S. And for those from the 19 countries already covered by the travel ban, Trump has said he would pause review of their immigration cases, threatening also to revoke their green cards. He also said the U.S. would not issue any visas to citizens of Afghanistan, the home country of shooter Rahmanullah Lakanwal.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested the policies could stretch even further, threatening action “on every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches and entitlement junkies” in a remark that sparked concern the Trump administration could expand its existing travel ban.

To immigration advocates, the shooting has become cover to carry out drastic immigration moves that were likely already eyed by the administration.

“You have to take a broader view that this is a president that has a documented history of using tragedies, using external developments, using things like the pandemic as pretext to pursue specific ends when it comes to immigration,” said Jorge Loweree, managing director at the American Immigration Council.

“What happened is an absolute tragedy, and we need to do everything we can to prevent that sort of thing from happening. But there’s very clearly a much broader goal here, which is to severely reduce legal immigration to the U.S. by whatever means possible.”

Others lamented that the actions of one person have become the basis for a series of immigration actions that will have far-reaching consequences.

“They are going after not only all Afghans, but also it’s expanded to all people applying for asylum, all individuals who are from countries that are on the travel ban list, and they’re even looking toward expanding the travel ban as well,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, senior director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, noting that the Trump administration initially considered 36 countries for the travel ban.

“They’re just going taking this one very tragic incident and expanding it … just using it as an excuse to do what they’ve always intended to do and go after individuals from, as the president said, Third World countries.”

Trump on Thanksgiving said the moves were needed to “allow the U.S. system to fully recover …and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States.”

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL,” he wrote on Truth Social.

All the measures proposed by Trump would target legal immigrants to the United States.

The day before the shooting was carried out, the Trump administration announced it would review all refugee admissions that were issued under the Biden administration, some 200,000 people over four years.

The directive was seen by some as specifically targeting the roughly 80,000 Afghan citizens who fled the country amid the fallout from the U.S. withdrawal in 2021 and were evaluated by the Biden administration.

Lakanwal, who served in a CIA-backed counter-terrorism unit during the war, came to the U.S. under Biden but was approved for asylum under the Trump administration. He was vetted by counterterrorism authorities and had received what is known as chief-of-mission approval, verifying his work for U.S. forces as part of the process to gain a green card.

“This guy was vetted by both the Biden and Trump administrations, and that’s not the issue here, the vetting. Nothing failed with the vetting,” said Shawn VanDiver, president of AfghanEvac, who said the resulting immigration moves amount to collective punishment.

“[It’s a] colossal waste of resources. Refugees are already vetted to the fullest extent before they get here, and every person who’s a non-citizen or in a temporary status here is continually vetted when they’re here.”

Dalal-Dheini said the result of putting so many immigration applications on pause actually jeopardizes safety.

“They’re putting all these hundreds of thousands of people in limbo because of the action of one person, and that doesn’t do anything to improve our national security,” she said.

“If they just stop vetting these people to stop adjudicating their cases, people who are a national security threat may not be discovered. If they’re delaying these cases, if they’re spending all this time to re-examine individuals who have already been vetted — so refugees or green card holders — you’re now taking away resources for the adjudicators to be able to actually adjudicate new cases of people who have not been vetted before,” she said.

“This, in fact, is probably going to harm our national security more than improve it.”

Trump at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday forecast some future immigration moves, saying officials were preparing for a wave of new enforcement efforts, including one targeting Somali immigrants in Minneapolis.

“We’re going to go the wrong way if we keep taking in garbage into our country,” Trump said of Somalians.

Somalia is already included on the existing travel ban list, as is Afghanistan, while Burundi, Chad, Cuba, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Myanmar, Sudan, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela and Yemen fill out the rest of the list.

Trump’s comments about stopping migration from “all Third World countries” also raised questions about what countries might be included.

“There are a number of countries, some very, very large countries, who, depending on how you define a developing nation, or, as the president says, a Third World country, could be on that list, including, potentially, a country like India,” Loweree said.

But he sees a larger trend from Trump’s immigration moves, as further narrowing of immigration pathways to various countries inevitably stops people from coming to the U.S.

“The president’s intent on targeting a broad sort of swath of the world when it comes to the narrowing of our immigration system,” Loweree said.

“All of these different changes, some of them may be relatively small, but when you add them together, they create many different layers that prevent specific populations of people from being able to navigate the system, and therefore shut them out entirely,” he said.

“That is the goal, targeting specific people that the administration deems to be undesirable and cutting them out of the system.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/AP25336623814461-e1764696291426.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-12-02 19:56:32.282415

Mayor Jacob Frey was joined by St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, Ward 6 Council Member Jamal Osman, Police Chief Brian O’Hara and other city leaders to respond to these reports and address community members directly.

You can watch the City’s full press conference on YouTube.

“Minneapolis is proud to be home to the largest Somali community in the country,” said Mayor Jacob Frey. “They are our neighbors, our friends, and our family – and they are welcome in our city. Nothing Donald Trump does will ever change that.”

The City of Minneapolis has the most vibrant Somali-American community in the nation. The City is proud of this community and the many achievements of people who have immigrated from Somalia and now call Minneapolis home. The City stands with our immigrant neighbors and we want to reaffirm that the City of Minneapolis does not work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on civil immigration enforcement operations.

""I am proud to say I am a Somali-American. This country welcomed me and my family 26 years ago,” said Council Member Jamal Osman, Ward 6. “I know many families are fearful tonight...but I want you to know that the City of Minneapolis stands behind you. Our community has lived through fear in the past. We're going to stay informed, we're going to stay safe and we're going to support each other.”

The City of Minneapolis works every day to ensure Minneapolis is a welcoming place for all, regardless of immigration status. This includes providing clear information about rights and resources on how to get help and adhering to our strict policy against City participation in civil immigration enforcement activities.

While the City cannot prevent ICE from being in Minneapolis, we will do everything in our power to keep our communities safe. The Minneapolis Police Department is here to protect everyone. If there is illegal or dangerous conduct, MPD officers will respond to assess and de-escalate any situation that is a threat to people or property, and ultimately, maintain public safety.

""I know how real the fear is in our community. People are going to want to speak out, to protest, and to exercise their First Amendment rights. Those are the rights of everyone in our community, and I want to be clear that we will absolutely defend people's rights to do just that,” said Chief Brian O'Hara, Minneapolis Police Department. ""I also ask that if demonstrations do happen around any type of immigration raid, that they remain non-violent so that we can keep everyone in our community safe, so that we minimize the risk of any tragedy happening, or the immigrant communities that are already suffering to suffer that much more.""

Minneapolis is a Welcoming City; know your rights

Minneapolis is a Welcoming City; a place where all should feel safe, respected and included, regardless of immigration status. The City of Minneapolis works hard to put these values into policy and practice because we know that when everyone in our city feels like they belong, we all benefit.

The government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro on Tuesday announced that the twice-weekly flights will go on following a request from the Trump administration. That reverses a Venezuelan government Saturday announcement indicating that U.S. immigration authorities had unilaterally suspended the flights.

An overflight and landing application submitted Monday by U.S.-based Eastern Airlines requests permission for an arrival Wednesday. The agreement authorizes flights on a Boeing 777-200 from Phoenix, Arizona, to land at Maiquetía International Airport, the Venezuelan government said. The application was made public Tuesday by Venezuela's foreign affairs minister.

Venezuelans have been steadily deported to their home country this year after Maduro, under pressure from the White House, did away with his long-standing policy of not accepting deportees from the U.S. Maduro has since framed their return as a triumph, saying Venezuelans are being repatriated from harsh conditions in U.S. detention.

Immigrants arrive regularly at the airport outside the capital, Caracas, on flights operated by a U.S. government contractor or Venezuela's state-owned airline. More than 13,000 immigrants have returned so far this year on the chartered flights, the latest of which arrived Friday.

The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs. The flights have continued despite U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean and off Venezuela's Caribbean coast.

Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.

The Trump administration has also claimed some of the drug cartels are controlled by Maduro. Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. would start doing strikes on land soon, though he didn't specify where and said attacks might occur in countries besides Venezuela, suggesting Colombia could see military strikes.

""You know, the land is much easier, much easier. And we know the routes they take,"" Mr. Trump said to reporters as he met with his Cabinet at the White House. ""We know everything about them We know where they live. We know where the bad ones live. And we're going to start that very soon too.""

Later, when asked to elaborate, the president said he was speaking about countries that are manufacturing and selling fentanyl or cocaine. The president said he heard that Colombia is manufacturing cocaine and selling it to the U.S.

Colombia, indeed, is the world's top cocaine producer.

""Anybody that's doing that and selling it into our country is subject to attack,"" Mr. Trump said. He added a few moments later: ""Not just Venezuela.""

Tuesday's Cabinet meeting came amid calls for investigations and bipartisan concerns in Congress that a follow-up strike on an alleged drug boat may have constituted a war crime.

As tensions continue to escalate between the two countries, Pope Leo XVI on Tuesday called for the U.S. to pursue dialogue and even economic pressure on Venezuela to achieve its goals, rather than threats of military action.

Leo, history's first American pope, told reporters aboard the papal plane returning from Lebanon that the Venezuelan bishops conference and the Vatican Embassy in Caracas were trying to calm the situation and look out for the plight of ordinary Venezuelans.

""The voices coming from the United States change, with a certain frequency at times,"" he said. ""On the one hand, it seems there was telephone conversation between the two presidents, on the other, there's this danger, this possibility of an activity, an operation including invading the territory of Venezuela.""

He stressed that he didn't have further information. ""Again I believe it's better to look for ways of dialogue, perhaps pressure — including economic pressure — but looking for other ways to change, if that's what the United States wants to do.""",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/02/e9c4f6d2-4ad5-463c-91c1-ba738761d6aa/thumbnail/1200x630/cd79722477184b509a6d04983f14f2f8/gettyimages-2248653392.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 18:58:02.511153

“But if individual states want to prohibit partisan gerrymandering, they should do what Florida did and put it into their state constitution.","Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he and Chairman Tom Cotton, R-Ark., would also be meeting with Bradley on Thursday.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized Bradley, commander of Special Operations Command, to order the strikes on Sept. 2 that have drawn scrutiny from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

Lawmakers outside of committee leadership, like Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have expressed interest in hearing from Bradley.

“I’ve heard that there’s an effort to bring him here perhaps next week, but nothing definite as yet, and I would insist that the that the whole committee hear from him, not just some select group of senators,” Blumenthal said today.

""This is what you and the press don't understand,"" Hegseth continued. ""You sit in your air-conditioned offices up on Capitol Hill, and you nitpick and you plant fake stories in The Washington Post.""

The defense secretary added, ""Everybody phrases anonymous sources, not based in anything, not based in any truth at all. And then you want to throw out really irresponsible terms about American heroes, about the judgment that they made.""

Trump did not answer the question about the strikes directly, saying only that his administration's actions against alleged drug boats have saved lives.

""To me, it was an attack,"" Trump said. ""It wasn't one strike, two strikes, three strikes. Somebody asked me a question about the second strike. I didn't know about the second strike.""

Yesterday, the White House confirmed the second strike on the boat in September. That follow-up strike killed survivors of the initial attack, and lawmakers opened inquiries into the situation.

Earlier in his remarks, Hegseth said that for the ""first couple of strikes — as you would, as any leader would want — you want to own that responsibility.""

""So I said, I'm going to be the one to make the call after getting all the information, and make sure it's the right strike,"" Hegseth said. ""That was Sept. 2.""

He added that while he watched the first strike live, he ""didn't stick around for the hour, two hours, whatever, where all the sensitive site exploitation digitally occurs,"" noting that he moved to his next meeting.

A few hours later, he learned that a commander decided to ""sink the boat and eliminate the threat,"" Hegseth said, adding that this was the ""correct decision.""

Opponents of the effort argue the law prohibits partisan gerrymandering and that without new census data or a court order, Florida should not be drawing a new map.

“While that partisan redistricting battle is not illegal in other states, that is illegal in the state of Florida,” said Amy Keith, executive director of Common Cause Florida. “63% of Floridians voted to pass the Fair District Amendment, and that very clearly said Congressional districts in Florida cannot be drawn with the intent to favor a political party or an incumbent.”

Jessica Lowe-Minor, president of the League of Women Voters of Florida, pointed to a 2019 Supreme Court ruling, Rucho v. Common Cause, which largely opened the door for states to conduct more aggressive partisan gerrymandering under federal law.

“The U.S. Supreme Court said, well, no, there really isn’t a federal prohibition on gerrymandering,” she said. “But if individual states want to prohibit partisan gerrymandering, they should do what Florida did and put it into their state constitution. So the U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged that Florida’s state constitution prevents partisan gerrymandering, so we expect that the legislature will respect that and the courts will respect that.”

Instead, District Court Judge A. Bruce Jones ordered outside attorneys representing Polis to provide a full response to the lawsuit by next week. He affirmed that a former state employee and a nonprofit law firm both had standing to sue the governor in a challenge of his May decision to turn over sensitive personal information to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Scott Moss, who was then a state employee, had alleged that cooperating with ICE would violate state laws, including a new law that Polis signed at nearly the same time he decided to comply with the subpoena.

The judge’s ruling, issued last week on the day before Thanksgiving, is a blow to Polis’ attempt to both end the litigation and give ICE some records about the sponsors of undocumented and unaccompanied children. In June, a few weeks after the lawsuit was filed, Jones had blocked some state employees from complying with the subpoena.

Though he didn’t specifically block Polis from otherwise turning over the records, Jones indicated that doing so in any way would violate state laws that generally prohibit state and local employees from providing personal information to ICE.

After the June ruling, Polis’ attorneys moved to dismiss the case and said they now planned to turn over only some of the records to ICE. They argued that Moss, who left state employment during the summer, no longer had standing to sue and that Towards Justice, a nonprofit law firm that’s also part of the litigation, had no legal eligibility, either.

But Jones ruled otherwise last week and rejected Polis’ motion to dismiss. The governor’s response to the allegations in the suit are due by Dec. 10.

The state hired private attorneys to represent Polis at public expense after the Colorado Attorney General’s Office said it had a conflict because it had earlier provided legal advice to the governor in the matter.

“Governor Polis has spent well over $100,000 in taxpayer money trying to make this case go away so that he can continue collaborating with ICE behind closed doors,” Laura Wolf, the attorney representing Moss in the case, said in a statement Monday. “We are encouraged by the court’s ruling, and we will continue to fight for the rights of every person placed at risk by Governor Polis’s efforts to facilitate immigration enforcement in violation of Colorado law.”

Shelby Wieman, a spokeswoman for Polis, said in a statement that the governor is “committed to protecting Coloradans against human trafficking.”

“While he disagrees with the decision, he respects the opinion regarding standing and cannot comment further on pending litigation,” Wieman wrote Monday.

In its subpoena, ICE said it wanted information on the sponsors of unaccompanied children so it could check on them as part of an alleged criminal investigation. Neither the agency nor Polis’ office has provided any evidence that such an investigation exists, and Jones previously noted that the governor seemingly took no steps to confirm that ICE is legitimately investigating trafficking before he decided to cooperate with the agency. The subpoena references federal law related to immigration enforcement.

Wieman has previously not responded to questions about whether the state is using any of its own resources to check on the children.",https://www.greeleytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/TDP-L-snap102225-cha-408.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-12-02 17:59:10.719818

The report cites an anonymous Trump administration official and documents obtained by the Times.

The plan calls for the deployment of “strike teams” comprising ICE officers and other federal officials. The anonymous official told the Times that roughly 100 officers and agents from around the country have been brought into the operation.

Local elected officials tried to project resolve and support.

“I know many families are fearful tonight, but I want you to know that the city and I stand behind you,” said Minneapolis Council Member Jamal Osman, who represents the largest East African community in the city, during a press conference Tuesday.

The news comes after an increase in anti-Somali rhetoric among right-wing leaders, including President Donald Trump, following the publication of an article claiming — with little evidence — that Somali-American immigrants accused of defrauding Minnesota’s public programs are providing the money to the terrorist group al-Shaabab.

Federal officials have investigated fraud in Minnesota’s public programs for years, and of the dozens of people charged so far, the majority are Somali-American. Terrorism financing has not been among the fraud-related charges.

“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump said during Tuesday’s cabinet meeting.

Data on the immigration statuses of the roughly 90,000 Somali-Americans in Minnesota is not readily available, but the vast majority of Somali people in Minnesota have legal status, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday. Roughly half of Somali-Americans in Minnesota were born in Somalia, according to 2024 Census data.

Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter stood together at Tuesday’s press conference, decrying the president’s comments.

“Mistakes will be made — and let’s be clear — it means that American citizens will be detained for no other reason than the fact that they look like they are Somali,” Frey said.

Protestors have squared off with federal officers — and sometimes local police — at raids in Minneapolis and St. Paul this year. Law enforcement officers have used crowd dispersal tactics like pepper spray, tear gas, rubber bullets and sound cannons.

Both Minneapolis and St. Paul are sanctuary cities, meaning their local police do not question residents’ immigration status or enforce immigration law, which is a federal responsibility. But both police departments have helped immigration authorities control the large crowds of protesters that have convened outside of raids.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Tuesday his officers will protect demonstrators’ First Amendment rights, and that the department is rewriting its immigration enforcement policy based on feedback from community organizations.

“I also ask that if demonstrations do happen around any type of immigration raid, that they remain nonviolent — so that we can keep everyone in our community safe, so that we minimize the risk of any tragedy happening, or the immigrant communities that are already suffering to suffer that much more,” O’Hara said.

On Nov. 21, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was “terminating” Temporary Protected Status for Somali people in Minnesota.

December 2, 2025

WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the wake of last week’s tragic shooting in Washington, D.C., our hearts are with all those grieving this senseless act of violence, especially the families and loved ones of U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom who was killed and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe who remains in critical condition.

As communities across the country mourn this tragedy, the Arab American community also stands in solidarity with our Afghan, Somali, Sudanese, and other communities from the 19 nations now facing punitive immigration actions under the Trump Administration’s new rollback of immigration protections.

We know this fear too well. After 9/11, Arab, Muslim, African, and South Asian communities faced an initial wave of mass deportations and then were forced to endure NSEERS, a discriminatory registration and surveillance program that profiled entire nationalities for the actions of a few. We remember how quickly grief was weaponized into suspicion, how families were torn apart, and how trust in government was profoundly damaged.

Today, as new policies emerge in response to the D.C. shooting, including mass reviews of green cards, halted immigration processing, and sweeping security measures applied collectively by nationality, we must be clear: the actions of a single individual can never justify the targeting of entire communities. Collective punishment is not safety. It is injustice.

Just as we reject acts of violence, we reject the framing that equates entire nationalities or countries with “threat” and creates fear and suspicion among our neighbors. Security is not achieved with bigotry. What we urge instead is fairness, transparency, due process, and respect for the dignity of all immigrant communities.

As Arab Americans we know firsthand that when one community is targeted, no community is safe. Our fight for justice cannot be selective.

We call on elected leaders, civil society organizations, and all Americans of conscience to stand with our friends and neighbors from Sudan, Somalia, Afghanistan, and beyond. Protect their rights. Uphold their dignity. And let us reaffirm together that this country is strongest when its immigrant communities are valued — not feared.

In its statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the Haitian TPS cancellation was warranted because the administration determined that conditions inside Haiti improved sufficiently for Haitians to return there.
FAMN officials slammed the decision.
“FANM denounces this [DHS] conclusion as factually indefensible and dangerously detached from the verified conditions on the ground,” said FAMN officials.
“We call on federal leaders to uphold justice, protect lives, and correct this grave error without delay,” FANM officials said.","Miami’s leading Haitian immigrant advocacy group is calling for the protection of hundreds of thousands of Haitians with Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, saying they contribute to the U.S. economy and that their homeland remains unstable and dangerous.

The Family Action Network Movement held a news conference in Little Haiti Tuesday morning to protest the administration’s decision last week to end TPS for Haitians, effective Feb. 3, 2026.

“This devastating and irresponsible action places up to half a million Haitian nationals at immediate risk of deportation to a nation facing severe political instability, escalating violence, and deepening humanitarian crises,” FAMN officials said in a statement before Tuesday’s press conference.

The administration announced last Wednesday it was ending TPS for 500,000 Haitian migrants — despite new reports from organizations like the U.N. that say conditions inside Haiti are as unsafe as they've ever been.

In its statement, the Department of Homeland Security said the Haitian TPS cancellation was warranted because the administration determined that conditions inside Haiti improved sufficiently for Haitians to return there.

""After consulting with interagency partners, Secretary (Kristi) Noem concluded that Haiti no longer meets the statutory requirements for TPS.

""This decision was based on a review conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, input from relevant U.S. government agencies, and an analysis indicating that allowing Haitian nationals to remain temporarily in the United States is inconsistent with U.S. national interests,” said DHS officials.

FAMN officials slammed the decision.

“FANM denounces this [DHS] conclusion as factually indefensible and dangerously detached from the verified conditions on the ground,” said FAMN officials. “Returning people to Haiti under these conditions would place thousands of lives at immediate risk.”

“This is a cruel, unjust, and politically motivated decision,” said FANM Political Director Paul Christian Namphy.

FANM officials argue that TPS holders from Haiti and other countries contribute billions annually to the U.S. economy and pay $5.2 billion each year in federal, payroll, state, and local taxes.

WASHINGTON, DC – DECEMBER 2, 2025 — Today, Congresswoman Summer L. Lee (PA-12) joined Rep. Yvette Clarke (NY-11), Rep. Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Senator Ed Markey (D-MA), along with a growing coalition of civil rights advocates, to reintroduce the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Civil Rights Act — comprehensive legislation to prevent companies from using biased and discriminatory AI-powered algorithms to help make critical decisions in Americans’ lives, ensure algorithms are tested before and after deployment, and increase transparency of complex algorithms used for critical decisions.

“I represent neighborhoods that know what it feels like to be overpoliced, underinvested, and overlooked. If artificial intelligence is shaping people’s lives, then we must mitigate the harm it causes. This legislation puts up the necessary guardrails in an age of disinformation and misinformation. I’m grateful to Representatives Yvette Clarke, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley for co-leading this effort and for Senator Ed Markey for his partnership on this bill. We can and should be innovative with our technology, but never at the cost of our civil rights,” said Rep. Lee.

“The AI Civil Rights Act represents a bold new front in our ongoing battle to protect the rights, dignity, and safety of every American. From developers to deployers, this legislation will place strict, strong, and unambiguous guardrails on the creation and use of artificial intelligence. I am deeply grateful to Senator Ed Markey for his steadfast leadership in introducing this critical bill. Together, we are making it very clear that innovation must never come at the expense of civil rights or justice,” said Rep. Clarke.

“As AI innovation grows, it is incumbent on us all to prioritize the safety, rights, and opportunity of all people—especially the Black, brown, and marginalized communities who disproportionately bear the burden of biased and discriminatory systems,” said Rep. Pressley. “We cannot allow AI to be the latest chapter in America’s history of exploiting marginalized people. That is why the AI Civil Rights Act is necessary—to invest in an approach rooted in equity that safeguards all of our civil rights and liberties.”

“This legislation comes at an inflection point for our country. Artificial intelligence has become a part of our everyday lives and grown into a projected $244 billion industry. A major risk of this new technology is the biases and discrimination that are built into algorithms – denying people housing or jobs based on race or gender. Our bill would place critical guardrails to ensure that the technologies of the future do not harden the injustices of the past,” said Rep. Jayapal.

“We must address AI-powered bias and discrimination in the AI age,” said Senator Markey. “Under the AI Civil Rights Act, America would show leadership in AI—not just technological leadership, but moral leadership. We cannot abandon our principles in reckless pursuit of technological superiority. Otherwise, we risk building a future where innovation races ahead, but justice falls behind. I am grateful for Congresswomen Clarke, Pressley, Jayapal, and Lee for their partnership on the AI Civil Rights Act. We will not allow for AI to stand for accelerating injustice.”

“The Lawyers’ Committee is proud to work in partnership with Senator Markey, Representatives Yvette Clarke, Summer Lee, Ayanna Pressley, and Pramila Jayapal as they introduce the AI Civil Rights Act to help ensure that AI systems are fair and equitable, as they become a large part of our daily lives. Most AI tools are built using data that reflects generations of racial discrimination, redlining, and segregation. Algorithms built on information about a troubled past can create new models that replicate these traumas as if they should be the norm for the future. So, increased transparency and accountability in the development and deployment of these technologies are critical steps for combating algorithmic bias. The Lawyers’ Committee has been on the front lines of this issue, litigating in the courts and leading policy debates focused on the impacts and opportunities of emerging technology for Black people and other communities of color. We all deserve technology that works for us, not against us. Adopting appropriate human-centered guardrails is both logical and a critical need. We know that with fierce defenders of civil rights and democracy in Congress like the sponsors and co-sponsors of the AI Civil Rights Act, we can make that ambition a reality,” said Damon Hewitt, President and Executive Director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.

“Technologies, including AI systems, are only innovative if they help people. AI should be a tool that works for all of us, no matter where we come from, the color of our skin, our age, or how much money we have. But every day, qualified people are unjustly locked out of jobs, housing, education opportunities, and health care, or are wrongly jailed or imprisoned because of AI systems that discriminate. AI is powerful, so when it discriminates it can supercharge bias,” said Maya Wiley, President and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. “The AI Civil Rights Act offers a way forward towards fairness and accountability by helping us see how AI is working, ensuring better accuracy, and holding companies that create and use AI accountable for protecting our rights. We are grateful for Senator Markey and Congresswoman Clarke’s commitment to creating a strong pro-civil rights federal standard that ensures we can all reap the benefits of the AI revolution.”

“With corporations increasingly using AI systems to hire, fire, surveil, and make disciplinary decisions, workers need common-sense civil rights protections. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) Civil Rights Act introduced by Senator Markey and Congresswoman Clarke will do just that. It establishes critical guardrails to prevent AI discrimination, requires transparency from corporations around how they use AI, and holds corporations accountable when their AI systems perpetuate bias. This bill will be helpful in the labor movement’s ongoing fight to make sure that AI benefits workers instead of harming their jobs, rights, and freedoms,” said Jody Calemine, Director of Advocacy at the AFL-CIO.

“The AI Civil Rights Act is the bold, innovative policy we need today to ensure a just tomorrow for us all. The premise is simple: the AI tools and systems used at the most critical decision points in our lives – mediating our access to homes, employment, healthcare, and opportunities –should be demonstrated to be accessible and fair before being unleashed on the American public. With this technologically sophisticated bill, anchored in enduring American commitments to freedom, Senator Markey ushers in a new day for civil rights and digital equity,” said Alondra Nelson, Distinguished Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress.

“AI is shaping access to opportunity across the country. ‘Black box’ systems make decisions about who gets a loan, receives a job offer, or is eligible for parole, often with little understanding of how those decisions are made. The AI Civil Rights Act makes sure that AI systems are transparent and give everyone a fair chance to compete,” said Cody Venzke, Senior Policy Counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.

“Artificial intelligence is fast becoming a part of everyday life, impacting all of our major decisions from housing and employment to education and healthcare. We thank Senators Markey and Booker, and Representative Clarke, for their proactive leadership in safeguarding our civil rights. The AI Civil Rights Act ensures that AI technologies do not reinforce existing inequalities, and instead contribute to a more just and equitable society,” said the National Urban League.

The legislation is co-led in the House by Representatives Summer Lee (PA-12), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Yvette Clarke (NY-11), and Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and led by Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) in the Senate. The legislation is co-sponsored by Senators Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), and Representatives Wesley Bell (MO-01), André Carson (IN-07), Judy Chu (CA-28), Danny K.

The New York Times, which cited documents and an official who spoke anonymously, was first to report the operation in Minneapolis.

The latest federal immigration effort comes as President Donald Trump ended his Cabinet meeting on Tuesday by asserting he does not want Somali immigrants in the United States, referring to them as “garbage” who should “go back to where they came from.”

“I don’t want them in our country,” he said. “Their country is no good for a reason. Their country stinks, and we don’t want them in our country.”

The president’s remarks represent an escalation of his attacks against Somalis, particularly in Minneapolis. He has repeatedly signaled out Somalis since last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, even though the alleged shooter is an Afghan who had nothing to do with Somalia.

Minneapolis officials held a news conference about the issue this afternoon.

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agency does “not discuss future or potential operations.”

Republicans have introduced a handful of bills aimed at limiting the Census to just citizens.","Republicans on the House Oversight Committee advanced a blatantly unconstitutional bill Tuesday to exclude noncitizens from the decennial census counts.

The legislation, introduced by Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-N.C.), would require a citizenship question on the census starting in 2030, and then limit apportionment — the divvying of 435 congressional seats across the states and the corresponding allocation in the Electoral College — to just citizens.

If enacted, the proposal would contravene the U.S. Constitution, which calls for apportioning congressional seats according to a “counting the whole number of persons in each State.” That language clearly and deliberately uses “persons” instead of “citizens.”

“The bill attempts to exclude non citizens from being counted when drawing congressional districts, which clearly violates the 14th Amendment,” House Oversight ranking member Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) said Tuesday. “This [citizenship] question will destroy the accuracy of the census and devastate numerous communities across the country. Non-citizens will avoid answering the census, leading to undercounts across the country.”

Republican backers argued that counting the roughly 21 million non-citizens undermines the voting power of citizens.

“Non-citizens are not evenly distributed among the states and some states end up with greater representation in Congress based on a higher concentration of non-citizens,” said House Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) “This dilutes the ‘one-person, one-vote’ principle for citizens in states with fewer non-citizens.”

The committee voted 20-19 down party lines to advance the bill.

Tuesday’s legislation is just the latest in MAGA Republicans’ multipronged campaign to remove non-citizens from the census. In his first administration, President Donald Trump attempted to exclude undocumented immigrants from the 2020 Census. Opponents immediately sued and the case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which blocked the proposed change on procedural grounds while ducking the underlying question of its legality. The Supreme Court also blocked the Trump Administration’s separate attempt to add a question on citizenship status to the Census.

Trump’s unilateral attempts were ultimately doomed because the Constitution empowers Congress — not the president — with the “actual enumeration” of apportionment. But even if Congress enacted a law excluding non-citizens from the census, the Apportionment Clause of the Constitution would still present a considerable barrier.

On Tuesday, Democrats accused their Republican colleagues of trying to game the electoral system. “We’re here to fight for every single person who lives in our country, to make sure they have fair representation, and to make sure that we are funding our states adequately,” said Rep. Emily Randall (D-Wash.). “We are not here to try and rig elections so that more Republicans win.”

Setting aside the legal and constitutional issues, excluding unlawful immigrants from the Census count on apportionment would likely shift congressional seats to GOP-dominated states, although by how much isn’t clear. The Pew Research Center estimated in 2020 that doing so would have netted Alabama, Ohio, and Minnesota each an additional House seat while California, Texas, and Florida would have each lost one seat. At a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Tex.) estimated that removing noncitizens from the census count would shift 12 congressional seats to predominantly Republican states.

The GOP’s preoccupation with a citizens-only census comes amid Trump’s wider efforts to stem a crushing defeat in the 2026 midterms as his polling figures continue to plummet to record lows through every administrative ploy available, no matter how dubious. He’s repeatedly called for holding an additional, mid-decade census excluding non-citizens, even though federal law prohibits such a count from being used in apportionment. Over the summer, Trump launched a mid-decade redistricting war, saying Republicans were “entitled” to five extra seats in Texas, which has now spread across the nation.

Republicans have introduced a handful of bills aimed at limiting the Census to just citizens. The House passed a similar bill last year that then stalled in the Senate.

Shortly before Trump took office this year, a handful of Republican-led states sued the Commerce Department for including noncitizens in the Census. That case has been paused since the new administration began.

The longstanding suffrage slogan of “one person, one vote” was first articulated into constitutional law by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1963, which held that, along with the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection clause, the “conception of political equality from the Declaration of Independence, to Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, to the Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Nineteenth Amendments can mean only one thing — one person, one vote.”",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_3181-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-02 15:58:04.993743

The operation could begin in the coming days and is expected to zero in on people in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area who have final orders of deportation, the person said. Teams of immigration agents would spread across the Twin Cities in what the person described as a directed, high-priority sweep, though the plans remain fluid and subject to change.

The prospect of an immigration operation centered on Somali migrants is likely to deepen tensions in Minnesota as Trump has become increasingly focused on people of Somalian descent living in the U.S., saying recently that they “have caused a lot of trouble,” rhetoric that community leaders say has inflamed tensions and revived fears of profiling.

Minnesota has the nation’s largest Somali community. Many fled the long civil war in their east African country and were drawn to the state’s welcoming social programs.

Hundreds of people are expected to be targeted in the operation, the person said. As with previous immigration operations, so-called incidental arrests are possible, meaning people who aren’t targeted but lack legal status could also be detained if encountered during the sweep, the person said.

The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations that have not been publicly disclosed. The operation was first reported by The New York Times.

Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agency would not discuss “future or potential operations.”

“Every day, ICE enforces the laws of the nation across the country. What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,” McLaughlin said.

Trump and other officials in his administration have used increasingly harsh language in recent days against Somalis living in the U.S., after a conservative news outlet, City Journal, claimed that taxpayer dollars from defrauded government programs have flowed to the Somali group al-Shabab.

Last month, Trump said he was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Somali migrants living in Minnesota, a legal safeguard against deportation for immigrants from certain countries. A report produced for Congress in August put the number of Somalis covered by the program at just 705 nationwide.

Responding to news reports about the potential enforcement activities, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said in a post on X, “We welcome support in investigating and prosecuting crime. But pulling a PR stunt and indiscriminately targeting immigrants is not a real solution to a problem.”

Trump has claimed immigrants from Somalia were “completely taking over the once great State of Minnesota” and has demeaned Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee last year.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a social media post Monday that his agency was “investigating allegations that under the feckless mismanagement of the Biden Administration and Governor Tim Walz, hardworking Minnesotans’ tax dollars may have been diverted to the terrorist organization Al-Shabaab.”

Jaylani Hussein, a Somali American who is executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said his group has heard of “less than a dozen” immigration arrests within the local Somali community in recent days.

But Hussein said around 95% of Somalis in Minnesota are U.S. citizens, so the numbers of those at earlier stages of the immigration process are a “pretty small” proportion of the community. He said they estimate that 50% of the community was born in the U.S.

“We believe this is political rhetoric and an attack against our community,” Hussein said. “But additional ICE agents means additional pressure on the wider immigrant community,” he said, referring to Hispanics and other Africans.

Hussein said the reported crackdown plan is yet another example of the Trump administration “demonizing the Muslim community.” And he said it’s not new that when somebody in the community commits a crime, the entire community will get accused. He said that’s been true of other ethnic groups through American history.

The complaint, filed on Friday in the U.S. Court of International Trade, argues that Mr. Trump misused a 1977 law in his move to implement tariffs on products from more than 100 countries.

The lawsuit asserts that Congress, not the president, has the authority to set tariffs, and that Mr. Trump exceeded the authority granted to him by the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.

“The text of IEEPA does not use the word ‘tariff’ or any term of equivalent meaning,” Costco states in the lawsuit, which was reported earlier by NBC News. The act allows the president to regulate or prohibit foreign transactions during a national emergency, but does not authorize the imposition of tariffs, according to the lawsuit.

Kush Desai, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement that the “economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter.”

It has said in the past that its use of the IEEPA is lawful because the law gives the president the authority to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property to deal with emergencies.

The challenge by Costco, the largest warehouse club chain in the United States, echoes arguments that a number of small businesses have already made before the Supreme Court in lawsuits against Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Costco argues that the Trump administration’s implementation of them has created chaos. The tariffs have been “threatened, modified, suspended, and reimposed, with the markets gyrating in response,” the lawsuit says. The lawsuit does not disclose how much Costco has paid in tariffs.

Importers like V.O.S. Selections, a wine and spirits company, and Learning Resources, Inc., an educational toymaker, have already secured major rulings against the administration in lower federal courts. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments last month and is expected to rule on the legality of the tariffs in the near future.

Mr. Trump argues that tariffs have helped bring the government “hundreds of billions of dollars,” and the administration has warned of a severe economic impact should businesses be allowed to seek refunds if the government loses the Supreme Court case.

If the administration loses the Supreme Court case, there are other ways to tax imports. Multiple trade authorities exist that would allow the president to impose tariffs that are not subject to the IEEPA, and some of those provisions are already in use.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/02/multimedia/02trump-news-costco-01-gfjt/02trump-news-costco-01-gfjt-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 17:59:21.328838

Today, Sen. Ossoff is leading Senate colleagues in launching an inquiry with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pressing the administration for answers about obstruction of Congressional access to detention facilities.

Since the beginning of 2025, there have been numerous, publicly reportedThis is an external link examples of members of Congress and their staff facing obstructed access to ICE facilities nationwide, including to ICE field offices where people are being detained.

Sen. Ossoff is joined by Senators Ron Wyden (D-OR), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Ed Markey (D-MA), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD).

“Obstructing Congressional access to immigration detention facilities violates Federal law and undermines Congress’s inherent authority to conduct oversight that ensures detained individuals’ human rights and protects Americans from agency waste, fraud, and abuse,” Sen. Ossoff and the group wrote.

“Members of Congress and their staff must be allowed, pursuant to Congress’s inherent oversight authority and as required by Federal law, to access any facility where individuals are held in federal custody to monitor and prevent these abuses and ensure accountability and compliance with standards for detention,” Sen. Ossoff and the group continued.

Today’s inquiry follows two recent reports from Sen. Ossoff’s ongoing investigation into human rights abuses in U.S. immigration detention.

In October, Sen. Ossoff released the second report of his ongoing investigation, which uncovered 85 credible reports of medical neglect, including cases that reportedly led to life-threatening injuries and complications, and 82 credible reports of denial of adequate food or water, including cases that reportedly led to malnutrition or dehydration.

In August, Sen. Ossoff released the first report of his investigation, which uncovered credible reports of abuse of pregnant women and children in immigration detention across the country.

Sen. Ossoff continues working to strengthen oversight of DHS.

In 2024, Sen. Ossoff launched an inquiry with DHS into delays deploying licensed child welfare professionals to assist children who are temporarily in U.S. Southern Border facilities.

In 2022, Sen. Ossoff led an 18-month bipartisan investigation into medical mistreatment of women in U.S. detention, which uncovered that female detainees at the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia were subjected to “invasive, and often unnecessary gynecological procedures.”

,Litigation,2025-12-02 18:31:35+00:00,Los Angeles Times,These federal judges are building a legal wall against Trump's assault on transgender rights,"Michael Hiltzik, www.latimes.com, michael-hiltzik",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-12-02/federal-judges-bring-trumps-assault-on-transgender-rights-to-a-screeching-halt,"President Trump wasted no time before turning the right wing’s cherished assault on transgender rights into government policy.
These cases raise questions about the professionalism of Trump’s DOJ that have been raised by other federal courts on other topics.
As I’ve written, the Trumpian hand-wringing over the “mutilation” of children via gender-affirming therapy or surgery melds medical ignorance with fantasy.
“Congress never authorized a roving mandate to regulate and alter state-licensed medical care,” he wrote.
Whitehead concluded that the subpoena — compounded by Bondi’s news release — was aimed “not to investigate legal violations but to intimidate and coerce providers into abandoning lawful medical care.” (Emphasis his.)","President Trump wasted no time before turning the right wing’s cherished assault on transgender rights into government policy.

On the very day of his inauguration, he issued an executive order titled, “Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.”

The order purported to “recognize two sexes, male and female,” as federal policy. “These sexes are not changeable,” it stated. It labeled “gender ideology” and “gender identity” as a “false claim.”

The order directed federal agencies to “remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.”

About a week later, Trump posted an order banning federal spending on gender-affirming therapies for children, which he defined as “mutilation” based on “junk science.”

Under Atty Gen. Pam Bondi, Trump’s Justice Department took action. On July 9, Bondi boasted of having sent “more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in performing transgender medical procedures on children.”

In her news release, Bondi said the subpoenas targeted “medical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology.”

That’s when Trump’s campaign ran into a judicial brick wall. In recent weeks at least three federal judges blocked some of these subpoenas as flagrantly illicit overreach.

At least two questioned the DOJ’s actions in these cases, with one warning that a federal official’s inaccurate declaration could be interpreted as perjury. Another implied that a DOJ filing in his courtroom might have reflected “deliberate misuse ... of court procedure.” (I am indebted to Chris Geidner of Lawdork.com for pulling these facts together.)

These cases raise questions about the professionalism of Trump’s DOJ that have been raised by other federal courts on other topics. Those include the invalidation of the appointments of three U.S. Attorneys put in place to pursue criminal charges against Trump’s political enemies, and the rejection by grand juries of indictments proposed by Trump-appointed prosecutors.

“The Department has defeated many of these lawsuits all the way up to the Supreme Court and will continue to defend the President’s agenda with the utmost professionalism,” a DOJ spokeswoman told me by email.

The transgender cases may have a more personal effect on millions of struggling youths and families. As I’ve written, the Trumpian hand-wringing over the “mutilation” of children via gender-affirming therapy or surgery melds medical ignorance with fantasy.

Therapies such as puberty blockers or hormone treatments typically are administered to minors only after painstaking medical consultations, and actual surgeries aren’t commonly performed on minors by reputable medical providers.

Trump made an assault on transgender treatments a plank in his campaign platform, spinning a weird claim that schools had been subjecting innocent children to secret operations. “The school decides what’s gonna happen with your child,” he said. “And you know, many of these childs [sic] 15 years later say, ‘What the hell happened? Who did this to me?’” None of that happens in the real world.

After the Supreme Court invalidated bans on same-sex marriage in 2015, Republican strategists found “the struggle over trans rights” to be “an especially potent wedge issue,” observes political scientist Paisley Currah, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Brooklyn College, in a new report in the New York Review of Books.

Their target, Currah writes, is “a very small proportion of the population (roughly 2.8 million people above the age of thirteen), not well understood by most Americans, living in ways that confounded common assumptions about sex.”

For the most part, this war has unfolded at the state level. North Carolina passed its notorious “bathroom bill,” requiring residents to use only the bathrooms designated for the sex on their birth certificates, in 2016. The measure drew widespread threats of boycotts by sports leagues and corporations, prompting its repeal the following year.

Legislators soon found an approach more tolerable for the public: banning transgender women from participating in women’s sports. In 2015 there were 21 antitrans bills introduced in state legislatures; in 2025 there were more than 1,000.

In June the Supreme Court’s six-member conservative majority appeared to bless this approach by turning away a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans puberty blockers and hormones for trans youth, even when parents and physicians prescribe them. With this ruling, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a ringing dissent, “the Court abandons transgender patients and their families to political whims.”

She might have added that Trump’s intimidation works. Medical providers coast-to-coast, including Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C., and Kaiser Permanente, ended gender-affirming care for minors to avoid legal hassles; some institutions even ended such care for adults, although that care isn’t targeted by the government.

None of that means that there aren’t guardrails on the federal antitrans campaign, which brings us back to the judges placing a collar on the DOJ.

In the most recent ruling issued Nov. 21, federal Judge Mark Kearney of Philadelphia took aim at subpoenas Bondi served on Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Purporting to be investigating the mislabeling and misuse of puberty blockers and hormones, the DOJ demanded the hospital’s “billing and insurance records, communications with manufacturers and sales representatives, and the names and complete medical and psychological records of children receiving gender-affirming care,” Kearney wrote.

The hospital acceded to most of this request, but did not provide the identities of its child patients and their families and their confidential medical files.

Kearney quashed those subpoenas, ruling that the privacy rights of the children and their families “substantially outweighs” the DOJ’s “need to know the children’s names, addresses, and treatment.”

Kearney noted that federal law left questions about medical care entirely to the states; policy disagreements such as those pitting the DOJ against the hospital are not federal crimes. “Congress never authorized a roving mandate to regulate and alter state-licensed medical care,” he wrote.

He also focused on a declaration filed in court on Oct. 6 by DOJ official Lisa K. Hsiao, stating that “the government is aware of a lawsuit filed just this year” with “allegations of a minor being put on puberty blockers after his first visit and cross-sex hormones after his second with no meaningful assessment.”

As it happens, there is no such lawsuit. The day after Hsaio’s declaration was filed “under penalty of perjury,” Kearney observed, it was withdrawn and replaced with one that removed the reference to a lawsuit and substituted the claim that the government was aware only of “concerning allegations” about the treatment.

The hospital said in court that it hadn’t been served with any such lawsuit. Kearney questioned “the veracity of Director Hsiao’s sworn statements” and noted that DOJ lawyers agreed with him that “false statements may be subject to a perjury investigation.”

Kearney’s ruling followed one issued Sept. 9 by federal Judge Myong Joun of Boston. Joun quashed the entire subpoena issued to Boston Children’s Hospital seeking extensive information about its personnel and medical records of patients, including their Social Security numbers and home addresses.

“It is abundantly clear,” he wrote, that the administration’s “true purpose” is to interfere with the state’s right to authorize gender-affirming care, “to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.”

In the third case, federal Judge Jamal Whitehead of Seattle on Oct. 27 threw out a subpoena the government served on QueerDoc, a telehealth provider serving patients in the West. The subpoena demanded complete personnel files for all QueerDoc employees and all private information about patients for whom it prescribed puberty blockers or hormones.

Whitehead concluded that the subpoena — compounded by Bondi’s news release — was aimed “not to investigate legal violations but to intimidate and coerce providers into abandoning lawful medical care.” (Emphasis his.)

Whitehead also found that a legal filing in which the DOJ cited legal gounds for the subpoena “represents a fundamental misunderstanding — or deliberate misuse — of court procedure”: Filings of its kind generally were used to correct minor clerical errors in a previously filed document, he noted, not for making new legal arguments after the deadline. In this case the filing underscored that the government was targeting “the provision of gender-affirming care itself, not any legitimate federal violation.”

The government appealed the Joun and Whitehead rulings though not, as yet, Kearney’s action. The battle to protect treatment for transgender youths is plainly not over.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/b815f38/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7702x4044+0+547/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f%2Fc3%2Fa701ceba41079c5ad7eedb8dd8d5%2F2239800802.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 14:57:12.118174

Green, Hamed Aleaziz, Tony Romm, Motoko Rich, Simon Romero, David C. Adams, William K. Rashbaum, Maggie Haberman, Kenneth P. Vogel",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/12/02/us/trump-ukraine-putin-news,"When asked by a reporter on Thursday what Somalis had to do with the accused Afghan shooter in Washington, Mr. Trump said, “Ah, nothing.
But Somalis have caused a lot of trouble.” Since his first term, Mr. Trump has attacked Somalis in derogatory, xenophobic terms.
A White House official said Mr. Trump had not seen the letter before his announcement on Friday about the pardon.
The description was reminiscent of how Mr. Trump often refers to the four separate criminal cases against him.
Mr. Stone received a pardon from Mr. Trump in the final full day of the president’s first term.","The directive for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., came immediately after Mr. Trump’s remarks. The effort, which is beginning this week, focuses largely on Somalis with final deportation orders who are living in the Twin Cities, though the official said that others who are still seeking legal status could be swept up as well. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing operation.

The plan calls for the deployment of so-called strike teams, which are made up of ICE officers, agents and other federal officials. Roughly 100 officers and agents from around the country have been brought in for the operation, the official said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said in a statement that the agency does not discuss “future or potential operations.”

“What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,” she added.

The targeting of Somali migrants is the latest piece of Mr. Trump’s intensifying immigration crackdown across the country, one that the administration is expanding to block legal pathways for many migrants in the wake of the National Guard shooting.

At the White House, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff, has ramped up pressure to increase arrests in recent months. The targeting of migrants in the Twin Cities comes after similar efforts in other metropolitan areas across the country.

In recent months, federal officials have launched immigration operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Charlotte, N.C., setting off protests about what critics say are overly aggressive tactics and mistreatment by agents. D.H.S. has said that operations identify immigrants who are in the country illegally and that the enforcement actions are necessary to follow through on Mr. Trump’s promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants.

The surge of federal agents to cities has also served another purpose: to scare migrants in the hopes that they will leave the country voluntarily.

While there have not yet been images of large-scale arrests in the Minneapolis area, immigration operations often vary in scale and residents in the city have been on edge amid Mr. Trump’s increasingly dark rhetoric.

In recent days, the president has moved to end temporary legal protections for Somalis. Many of them have had the protections for decades under a program for migrants from countries in crisis.

Minnesota is home to the largest diaspora of Somalis in the world, a community whose members began migrating to the state in large numbers as the East African nation descended into civil war in the mid-1990s. Immigrant activists and local officials say that the vast majority of Minnesotans with Somali roots are American citizens or legal permanent residents.

Nationally, about 73 percent of Somali immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the Census Bureau.

When asked by a reporter on Thursday what Somalis had to do with the accused Afghan shooter in Washington, Mr. Trump said, “Ah, nothing. But Somalis have caused a lot of trouble.”

Since his first term, Mr. Trump has attacked Somalis in derogatory, xenophobic terms.

In a social media post on Thursday night, Mr. Trump claimed that Somalis were “taking over” Minnesota and that Somali gangs were “roving the streets looking for ‘prey.’” He accused Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who came to the United States from Somalia as a refugee and became a citizen 25 years ago, as someone who “probably came into the U.S.A. illegally.” Mr. Trump said she was “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab.”

In a statement, Jacklyn Rogers, a spokeswoman for Ms. Omar, said, “The congresswoman thinks his obsession with her is unhealthy and hopes he gets help.”

The president also said that Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was “seriously retarded” for welcoming immigrants from Somalia.

In a response posted on social media, Mr. Walz said: “Donald Trump is focused on pitting people against each other. The center of his agenda is cruelty — not lowering prices or making life better for Americans.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Somalis in Minneapolis had ripped off American taxpayers, citing a New York Times report on an investigation into fraud that had taken place in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali diaspora. But just a small group of people were actually convicted of fraud. Somali Americans in the state say such broad accusations have unfairly pilloried an entire community.

Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the two largest cities in the state, have policies that bar local law enforcement officials and other municipal employees from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. But high-profile federal operations earlier this year have tested the limits of those policies.

In June, federal law enforcement agents, including immigration officials, carried out an operation in a commercial district close to downtown Minneapolis, which led to scuffles with dozens of protesters. The Minneapolis Police Department joined federal agents at the scene in an effort to de-escalate the situation, which angered some local officials and residents.

Federal officials later said the operation involved a narcotics investigation.

More recently, scores of protesters clashed with law enforcement officials during two immigration enforcement operations in Saint Paul. One, in mid-November, resulted in the arrest of 14 people at a paper distribution company.

Ernesto Londoño in St. Paul, Minn., contributed reporting.

Roger J. Stone Jr., Mr. Trump’s longtime on-and-off political adviser, said on his radio show that he had sent the letter, which was dated Oct. 28, to Mr. Trump hours before the president announced his plan to pardon Mr. Hernández. When asked whether he had been compensated for his role, Mr. Stone said he was not.

A White House official said Mr. Trump had not seen the letter before his announcement on Friday about the pardon. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying the administration by matter of routine did not discuss pardons on the record.

Mr. Trump discussed the planned pardon with reporters over the weekend in terms similar to those Mr. Hernández had used in his letter, saying that “the people of Honduras really thought he was set up, and it was a terrible thing.”

“He was the president of the country, and they basically said he was a drug dealer because he was the president of the country,” Mr. Trump said. “And they said it was a Biden administration setup. And I looked at the facts, and I agreed with them.”

Read Former Honduran President’s Letter to Trump

The New York Times has obtained the four-page letter that former President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras sent President Trump.

Read Document 4 pages

Mr. Hernández’s lawyer said on Tuesday that his client had been released from a federal prison in West Virginia. The White House confirmed the pardon had been issued.

The pardon had caused an uproar before it was carried out, given the serious narcotics crimes of which Mr. Hernández was convicted and Mr. Trump’s stated ambition of curbing the flow of drugs into the United States, and, in particular, his monthslong push against Nicolás Maduro, the Venezuelan leader.

The Trump administration has engaged in a highly controversial and potentially illegal practice of bombing boats in the waters around Venezuela that officials insist are piloted by drug traffickers bringing their wares into the United States. In fact, a separate social media post from the one that promised a pardon for Mr. Hernández argued, shortly before elections in Honduras, that the next president should not give Mr. Maduro greater regional control.

Mr. Hernández’s letter contained all the ingredients that, over time, foreign leaders, lobbyists and others who interact with Mr. Trump have found effective: flattery, a sense of shared persecution and an appeal to Mr. Trump’s perception of himself as the final arbiter of justice.

Addressing Mr. Trump as “your Excellency,” Mr. Hernández, who last year was sentenced to 45 years in prison for flooding the United States with cocaine, wrote, “I have found strength from you, Sir.”

“Your resilience to get back in that great office notwithstanding the persecution and prosecution you faced, all for what, because you wished to make your country Great Again,” Mr. Hernández wrote. “What you accomplished is unprecedented and truly historic.”

Mr. Hernández was convicted last year, but the investigation that led to his imprisonment began years earlier, before Mr. Trump was elected the first time. Investigators with the Drug Enforcement Administration and Manhattan federal prosecutors worked their way up a chain of cooperators involved in what they said — and multiple juries agreed — was a conspiracy to traffic enormous amounts of cocaine through Honduras and into the United States.

In his letter, though, Mr. Hernández characterized the case as a fly-by-night affair run by unscrupulous prosecutors in an office Mr. Trump has long resented — the U.S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York — and directed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Vice President Kamala Harris. The description was reminiscent of how Mr. Trump often refers to the four separate criminal cases against him.

“The politicization and selective application of justice in my case is undeniable,” Mr. Hernández wrote in his letter, adding, “I was prosecuted without solid evidence, based on the testimonies of violent traffickers and professional liars motivated by revenge and by get-out-of-jail deals.”

He also worked to remind Mr. Trump of their personal relationship, reminiscing about remarks Mr. Trump had made at the 2018 Israeli American Council National Summit, in which he had spoken about halting the flow of drug trafficking at the Southern border.

“We’re winning after years and years of losing,” Mr. Trump said then. “We’re stopping drugs at a level that has never happened.”

Mr. Hernández, reflecting on the remarks from prison, informed the president that “those words meant a great deal to me, my family and the Honduran people.”

The pardon of Mr. Hernández is a stark contrast to his administration’s treatment of his co-conspirator, who has been credited with helping to secure the former Honduran president’s conviction.

The co-conspirator, Amilcar Alexander Ardon Soriano, testified at Mr. Hernández’s trial that he had served as the mayor of the municipality of El Paraíso while running drugs, participated in torture and murdered two people, and that he was responsible for the deaths of more than 50 others.

Mr. Ardon said he had asked lawmakers whom he had bribed to vote for Mr. Hernández as the president of the Honduran Congress. In return, Mr. Ardon said, Mr. Hernández promised to protect him from prosecutors.

Mr. Ardon was sentenced in January to time served. But he was immediately taken to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. His lawyer, Jeffrey Cohn, petitioned ICE and the Justice Department to defer Mr. Ardon’s deportation, arguing that his life would be at risk if he were sent to Honduras.

“Typically, a cooperator like that will be protected from deportation because the threats of violence and reprisal against him for that kind of cooperation are self-evident,” Mr. Cohn said in an interview on Monday.

Mr. Ardon was deported in April. He was immediately taken into custody by the Honduran authorities, charged with crimes related to the accusations brought in the United States. He is in prison in Honduras awaiting trial.

“If I were Alex, and I were sitting in a Honduran jail, the last thing I would want to hear is Juan Orlando is coming home when I was the one who put him in jail for 45 years,” Mr. Cohn said.

Mr. Trump issued more than 200 pardons and commutations in his first term, most of them at the very end of his term. Mr. Biden far eclipsed that number, and Mr. Trump is on pace for a similar statistic. So far, he has issued more than 2,000 pardons and commutations, most of them to people arrested in connection with the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.

Mr. Stone received a pardon from Mr. Trump in the final full day of the president’s first term. Mr. Stone was among a small group of people who had been charged and convicted with crimes in connection to the special counsel’s investigation into possible ties between Russia and Mr. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Stone maintained his innocence, and Mr. Tump and his allies have viewed that investigation as illegitimate for nearly a decade.

The lawsuit asserts that Congress, not the president, has the authority to set tariffs, and that Mr. Trump exceeded the authority granted to him by the law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA.

“The text of IEEPA does not use the word ‘tariff’ or any term of equivalent meaning,” Costco states in the lawsuit, which was reported earlier by NBC News. The act allows the president to regulate or prohibit foreign transactions during a national emergency, but does not authorize the imposition of tariffs, according to the lawsuit.

Kush Desai, a spokesman for the White House, said in a statement that the “economic consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump’s lawful tariffs are enormous and this suit highlights that fact. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court’s speedy and proper resolution of this matter.”

It has said in the past that its use of the IEEPA is lawful because the law gives the president the authority to “regulate” the “importation” of foreign property to deal with emergencies.

The challenge by Costco, the largest warehouse club chain in the United States, echoes arguments that a number of small businesses have already made before the Supreme Court in lawsuits against Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

Costco argues that the Trump administration’s implementation of them has created chaos. The tariffs have been “threatened, modified, suspended, and reimposed, with the markets gyrating in response,” the lawsuit says. The lawsuit does not disclose how much Costco has paid in tariffs.

Importers like V.O.S. Selections, a wine and spirits company, and Learning Resources, Inc., an educational toymaker, have already secured major rulings against the administration in lower federal courts. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments last month and is expected to rule on the legality of the tariffs in the near future.

Mr. Trump argues that tariffs have helped bring the government “hundreds of billions of dollars,” and the administration has warned of a severe economic impact should businesses be allowed to seek refunds if the government loses the Supreme Court case.

If the administration loses the Supreme Court case, there are other ways to tax imports. Multiple trade authorities exist that would allow the president to impose tariffs that are not subject to the IEEPA, and some of those provisions are already in use.

“Looks like Honduras is trying to change the results of their Presidential Election,” he wrote online on Monday night. “If they do, there will be hell to pay!”

His evidence? He said Honduran election officials had “abruptly stopped counting” at midnight the night before.

In reality, Honduras’s election agency had updated the results at about noon local time on Monday, roughly nine hours before Mr. Trump’s post. And the delay since then was expected.

That is because Honduras employs an electoral system that reports a first tranche of votes — transmitted from polling stations digitally — as preliminary results. Workers then verify all vote tallies by hand, and there is often a delay in between. It is difficult to send all tallies digitally because internet connections can be sparse and unstable in some parts of the country.

The preliminary results on Monday showed a virtual tie in the race. With 57 percent of ballots reported, two right-wing candidates, Nasry Asfura and Salvador Nasralla, each had 40 percent of the vote. Just 515 ballots separated them.

Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Asfura in the days ahead of the vote, warning Hondurans that the United States would “not be throwing good money after bad” at the country if his preferred candidate did not win. He called Mr. Nasralla a “borderline Communist.” And he also said he would pardon a former Honduran president, Juan Orlando Hernández, who had been convicted of helping smuggle cocaine into the United States.

Mr. Trump’s post on Monday was another extraordinary intervention in the Honduran election, as he stoked controversy, without evidence, just as election officials were calling on citizens to remain patient and peaceful.

Analysts and officials in Honduras and abroad had expressed concerns ahead of the vote that the election could be contested, because the candidates had repeatedly accused one another of plans to rig the results. Many of those accusations had targeted the left-wing governing party, whose candidate trailed by a wide margin in the preliminary results on Monday.

That fueled worries that Honduras could see a repeat of the unrest that followed the 2017 election, when a similar delay in the vote count sparked disputed results and destructive protests.

Yet on Monday, international election observers said that the election had few issues and that they would continue to monitor the count. Even with the razor-thin margin in the race, the nation was calm, and some businesses began to remove the plywood they had installed in windows in case of protests.

Ana Paola Hall, a top Honduran election official, said Monday afternoon that the National Electoral Council, or CNE, had finished reporting the digitally transmitted first tranche of votes from around the country.

She explained that officials were turning their attention to hand-counting remaining tallies, and then going back to verify all the results.

“In the face of this technical tie, we must remain calm, have patience, and wait for the CNE to finish counting,” Ms. Hall wrote online. She lauded the nation for its peaceful response.

On Monday night at a CNE office in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, election workers and military personnel unloaded sealed boxes from trucks as a man with a megaphone called out their respective numbers. The boxes were taped shut and labeled with the slogan “building democracy.”

A man who showed identification as an election official said that the vote count was on schedule and that workers had started counting the physical tallies at 10 p.m. local time, about an hour after Mr. Trump’s post.

“It is imperative that the Commission finish counting the Votes,” Mr. Trump said in his post. “Democracy must prevail!”

During the meeting on Tuesday at the Kremlin, Mr. Witkoff was expected to discuss with Mr. Putin a U.S.-backed peace proposal that was revised by American officials after recent negotiations with Ukrainian diplomats. The initial version of the U.S. plan that emerged last month was seen by Ukraine and its European allies as echoing the maximalist demands Russia has made since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Russian media showed footage of Mr. Putin beginning his meeting with Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner at a large white table in the Kremlin. Joining Mr. Putin were Yuri Ushakov, the top Kremlin foreign policy aide, and Kirill Dmitriev, Mr. Putin’s special envoy and head of the Russia Direct Investment Fund. They began by exchanging pleasantries, with Mr. Witkoff saying he had a beautiful walk around Moscow before the meeting.

Mr. Witkoff’s visit to Moscow, his sixth since January, is taking place two days after American and Ukrainian delegations met in Miami to continue negotiations over the potential peace plan. Both sides called those talks constructive but said more work was needed, without detailing the unresolved issues.

Ahead of the meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Putin said that Russia would continue to advance against Ukraine on the battlefield and portrayed the Kyiv leadership as weakened.

He said that Russian forces would expand strikes on Ukrainian ports and ships in response to attacks on Russia’s “shadow fleet” — the decrepit ships the country uses to transport oil and evade sanctions. Mr. Putin has also been casting Ukraine’s leadership as out of touch with the reality on the front.

“Ukraine’s leadership is currently preoccupied with other matters than the situation in the war zone. It’s as if they live on another planet,” Mr. Putin said on Tuesday, referring to a corruption scandal that has been roiling the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky. “And then, constantly on the move begging for money, they have no time for current affairs, either in the economy or at the front.”

In a visit to the battlefield on Sunday and in remarks ahead of Tuesday’s meeting, Mr. Putin highlighted Russia’s claims to have captured Pokrovsk, a strategic city in eastern Ukraine. Kyiv has denied that Moscow has full control of the territory.

The battlefield map maintained by DeepState, a Ukrainian group with ties to the military, showed that the Russians have taken most of the center of Pokrovsk. But Ukrainian military units said in public posts on Tuesday that the fight was still ongoing.

Andriy Kovalenko, a senior Ukrainian government official focused on Russian disinformation operations, said on Monday in a post on Telegram that the Russian military was lying about fully capturing certain cities where fighting remained fierce in an attempt to shape the opinions of Western negotiators.

“The Russians will make many attempts to exert pressure on the front in the coming weeks and will accompany this with loud statements,” Mr. Kovalenko said. “All this is done exclusively for the Western audience and to raise the stakes in diplomacy.”

He added, “The fighting for Pokrovsk continues.”

Mr. Putin also condemned European countries that have balked at the Trump administration’s Russia-tilted peace plans as being “on the side of war.” Mr. Putin said that he was engaging with the U.S. envoys because Europe’s actions “are aimed at only one thing: to completely block this peace process.”

He threatened Ukraine’s European allies, which have been scrambling to shore up their defenses against the Russian threat.

“We are not planning to fight with Europe, but if Europe suddenly starts a war with us, we are ready right now,” he said. He suggested that Russia would be willing to use even greater violence in such a conflict than it has in Ukraine, a likely reference to Moscow’s nuclear arsenal, the largest in the world.

Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told journalists earlier on Tuesday that negotiations with Mr. Witkoff and Mr. Kushner would go on “as long as necessary.” Mr. Kushner does not have a formal role in the Trump administration, but played a role in brokering the cease-fire in Gaza.

Mr. Zelensky, seeking support from European allies, met in Paris on Monday with President Emmanuel Macron of France. The Ukrainian leader then traveled to Ireland for meetings on Tuesday.

Mr. Zelensky said he would wait for an update from the American negotiators after the talks at the Kremlin and would possibly meet with them on Wednesday for an update.

The Ukrainian leader warned in a statement on X that any deal needed to ensure that Russia would not attack Ukraine again after its invasions in 2014 and 2022. Mr. Putin has demanded limits on Ukraine’s military, meaning that Russia would be free to build up its force after the signing of a peace deal, while Ukraine would face restrictions.

“We must end this war in a way that prevents Russia from coming back a year later with a third invasion,” Mr. Zelensky wrote. “They did not achieve their goal of occupying our country. But I am not sure their objectives have changed.” The Ukrainian leader has identified Western security guarantees as among the three biggest issues yet to be resolved in negotiations with the United States.

The White House has strongly pressured Ukraine to agree to a peace plan, with Mr. Trump initially giving Kyiv until Thanksgiving to make a decision. That deadline lapsed as negotiations continued, with Kyiv and its European allies trying to soften the U.S. plan.

Russia has set a series of conditions for halting the war. It has said, among other things, that Ukraine must cede its remaining territory in the Donbas region, drop its aspirations to join NATO and secure the status of the Russian language and the Russian Orthodox Church in Ukraine. Ukraine has refused to accept Russia’s demands.

Ilya Grashchenkov, a political analyst in Moscow, said that expectations were low for a breakthrough from Mr. Witkoff’s visit, but that the meeting was still significant.

“The main expectations likely boil down to maintaining a high-level communication channel during this crisis period,” he said. “This in itself is considered important for avoiding dangerous escalation.”

Mr. Grashchenkov said that with Russian growth approaching zero and the budgetary deficit widening because of soaring military expenditures, economic strain might compel the Kremlin to agree to certain compromises in the future. But, so far, Russia’s government has managed to paper over the economic cracks, he said.

Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, said in a post on Telegram, a messaging app, that Mr. Putin had “no doubt that as Ukraine loses more territory, the number of those in the West who call for a cessation of hostilities will grow.”

In November, Russian forces almost doubled the battlefield gains they made in September, according to DeepState, which uses geolocated combat footage and tips from Ukrainian Army sources to monitor battlefield developments. While still relatively small, the Russian advances highlighted the increasing strain on Ukraine’s military.

Mr. Trump, the oldest president ever sworn into his office, had M.R.I. scans in October as part of a semiannual physical exam. His annual physical was done in April.

On Sunday, during an appearance on “Meet the Press” on NBC News, Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota called on the president to release the results after Mr. Trump had impugned Mr. Walz’s intelligence. Asked by a reporter on Sunday what part of his body was scanned, Mr. Trump said aboard Air Force One, “I have no idea — it was just an M.R.I.” He then said it was not a scan of his brain.

But Dr. Barbabella’s memo did not specify that Mr. Trump had a M.R.I. scan, which uses a magnetic field to produce images of soft tissues that do not show up on X-rays. Instead, the memo describes “advanced imaging” that it said was carried out “because men in his age group benefit from a thorough evaluation of cardiovascular and abdominal health.”

The imaging was part of Mr. Trump’s “comprehensive executive physical,” Dr. Barbabella explained, referring to a detailed medical exam often offered to executives. Such exams can include tests that are not normally done when people have no symptoms of disease.

The memo said Mr. Trump’s cardiovascular imaging is “perfectly normal” with no signs that his arteries are narrowed. His “cardiovascular system shows excellent health,” the statement said.

It added that, “his abdominal imaging is also perfectly normal,” and said, “this level of detailed assessment is standard for an executive physical at President Trump’s age and confirms that he remains in excellent overall health.”

Dr. Ron Blankstein, a preventive cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said imaging could have been part of a routine checkup, though it is not recommended for people with no symptoms of heart disease.

In April, Dr. Barbabella said that Mr. Trump takes two medications to lower his cholesterol level.

Dr. Blankstein also highlighted the phrase “no evidence of arterial narrowing limiting blood flow.” It suggests, he said, that the president underwent a stress test, which could mean a doctor suspected or wanted to rule out heart disease. Most standard M.R.I. exams, he said, do not show the coronary arteries.

But there is a specialized M.R.I. scan, known as a cardiac stress exam, in which patients are given a medication that increases blood flow to the heart and then asked to lie in an M.R.I. machine for a scan. If the results are abnormal, that can indicate one or more coronary arteries is narrowed. But, Dr. Blankstein said, “a normal stress test, while reassuring that there is no critical flow limiting disease, does not rule out the possibility of coronary artery disease.”

“Stress tests are often not required in individuals who do not have symptoms” or cardiac disease, he added.

Dr. Jeffrey A. Linder, chief of general internal medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, said he found the White House statement confusing.

“There is nothing standard about an executive physical,” he said. No standards exist and what tests are included can vary widely.

And, he added, “there is no medical specialty that recommends that an otherwise asymptomatic individual get imaging.”

“There is a reason we don’t test everybody for everything all the time,” Dr. Linder said. The chance is much greater, he said, that the test would falsely point to an issue that would lead to rounds of extra testing to no avail. Instead of finding a problem, it could lead to useless treatments.

“There are real harms,” Dr. Linder said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/02/multimedia/02trump-news-promo-130pm-kmfz/02trump-news-promo-130pm-kmfz-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 13:57:19.784305

Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the two largest cities in the state, have policies that bar local law enforcement officials and other municipal employees from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement.
More recently, scores of protesters clashed with law enforcement officials during two immigration enforcement operations in Saint Paul.","The Trump administration is launching an intensive immigration enforcement operation primarily targeting hundreds of undocumented Somali immigrants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region, according to an official with knowledge of the operation and documents obtained by The New York Times.

The move comes as President Trump has fixated on Somalis living in the United States, using increasingly inflammatory language to attack them. He stepped up his rhetoric in the wake of last week’s shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, even though the man suspected in the attack is an Afghan national.

The directive for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minn., came immediately after Mr. Trump’s remarks. The effort, which is beginning this week, focuses largely on Somalis with final deportation orders who are living in the Twin Cities, though the official said that others who are still seeking legal status could be swept up as well. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe an ongoing operation.

The plan calls for the deployment of so-called strike teams, which are made up of ICE officers, agents and other federal officials. Roughly 100 officers and agents from around the country have been brought in for the operation, the official said.

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said in a statement that the agency does not discuss “future or potential operations.”

“What makes someone a target of ICE is not their race or ethnicity, but the fact that they are in the country illegally,” she added.

The targeting of Somali migrants is the latest piece of Mr. Trump’s intensifying immigration crackdown across the country, one that the administration is expanding to block legal pathways for many migrants in the wake of the National Guard shooting.

At the White House, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s deputy chief of staff, has ramped up pressure to increase arrests in recent months. The targeting of migrants in the Twin Cities comes after similar efforts in other metropolitan areas across the country.

In recent months, federal officials have launched immigration operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Charlotte, N.C., setting off protests about what critics say are overly aggressive tactics and mistreatment by agents. D.H.S. has said that operations identify immigrants who are in the country illegally and that the enforcement actions are necessary to follow through on Mr. Trump’s promise to deport millions of undocumented migrants.

The surge of federal agents to cities has also served another purpose: to scare migrants in the hopes that they will leave the country voluntarily.

While there have not yet been images of large-scale arrests in the Minneapolis area, immigration operations often vary in scale and residents in the city have been on edge amid Mr. Trump’s increasingly dark rhetoric.

In recent days, the president has moved to end temporary legal protections for Somalis. Many of them have had the protections for decades under a program for migrants from countries in crisis.

Minnesota is home to the largest diaspora of Somalis in the world, a community whose members began migrating to the state in large numbers as the East African nation descended into civil war in the mid-1990s. Immigrant activists and local officials say that the vast majority of Minnesotans with Somali roots are American citizens or legal permanent residents.

Nationally, about 73 percent of Somali immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens, according to the Census Bureau.

When asked by a reporter on Thursday what Somalis had to do with the accused Afghan shooter in Washington, Mr. Trump said, “Ah, nothing. But Somalis have caused a lot of trouble.”

Since his first term, Mr. Trump has attacked Somalis in derogatory, xenophobic terms.

In a social media post on Thursday night, Mr. Trump claimed that Somalis were “taking over” Minnesota and that Somali gangs were “roving the streets looking for ‘prey.’” He accused Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, who came to the United States from Somalia as a refugee and became a citizen 25 years ago, as someone who “probably came into the U.S.A. illegally.” Mr. Trump said she was “always wrapped in her swaddling hijab.”

In a statement, Jacklyn Rogers, a spokeswoman for Ms. Omar, said, “The congresswoman thinks his obsession with her is unhealthy and hopes he gets help.”

The president also said that Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota was “seriously retarded” for welcoming immigrants from Somalia.

In a response posted on social media, Mr. Walz said: “Donald Trump is focused on pitting people against each other. The center of his agenda is cruelty — not lowering prices or making life better for Americans.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Somalis in Minneapolis had ripped off American taxpayers, citing a New York Times report on an investigation into fraud that had taken place in pockets of Minnesota’s Somali diaspora. But just a small group of people were actually convicted of fraud. Somali Americans in the state say such broad accusations have unfairly pilloried an entire community.

Minneapolis and Saint Paul, the two largest cities in the state, have policies that bar local law enforcement officials and other municipal employees from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. But high-profile federal operations earlier this year have tested the limits of those policies.

In June, federal law enforcement agents, including immigration officials, carried out an operation in a commercial district close to downtown Minneapolis, which led to scuffles with dozens of protesters. The Minneapolis Police Department joined federal agents at the scene in an effort to de-escalate the situation, which angered some local officials and residents.

Federal officials later said the operation involved a narcotics investigation.

More recently, scores of protesters clashed with law enforcement officials during two immigration enforcement operations in Saint Paul. One, in mid-November, resulted in the arrest of 14 people at a paper distribution company.

Some earned settlement updates from the past week. First of all, the Home Secretary tweeted that the illegal entry penalty will not be applied to people who have been recognised as refugees. Thanks to Jon Featonby for spotting and flagging up that one. I personally feel this information would have been better off clearly stated in the consultation document. By Tuesday last week, five days after it opened, there had been 60,000 responses to the consultation (h/t CJ for that one). I wouldn’t be surprised if that had hit six figures by now.

Labour’s child poverty strategy is expected to be published shortly, however families that include migrants, including those with British or British born/raised children, will presumably be ignored as the earned settlement proposals will exacerbate and entrench poverty for those families. Reports have already started coming in about families choosing not to apply for or stopping claiming public funds that they are entitled to. The Guardian on the weekend told the story of this mother of a disabled child who cancelled her benefits because of fears it would lengthen the amount of time she has to wait before applying for settlement. One of the many problems here is that the proposal includes any past history of claiming benefits while in the route to settlement, so stopping now will not necessarily benefit people unless transitional provisions are put in place.

For those following the Mazur saga which has caused chaos throughout the legal sector, including in immigration, last week it was reported that CILEX has been granted permission to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal. Essential reading on what has been going on includes ILPA’s position statement on the implications for immigration practitioners, the Law Society’s Practice Note “Mazur and the conduct of litigation” as well as this piece in Legal Futures.

The Manston Inquiry emailed me last week to tell me that they have opened applications for those who want Inquiry Participant status. So now I’m telling you. More details and how to apply can be found on the website and the deadline is 8 December 2025.

On Free Movement, BID’s latest report looking at access to justice for people in immigration detention is out and things are looking more grim than ever. It was quarterly statistics day last Thursday. As ever, it is useful to consider what the Home Office is not telling us, and the data that is not published on family applications raises serious concerns about the extent to which the impact of the earned settlement proposals on families is known and has been taken into account.

There were also quite a few case write ups, including the Court of Appeal looking at article 8 claims in the context of adult siblings in a case turned high profile by both media and politicians earlier this year. There were two deportation decisions, one on the effect of withdrawal of a certification decision and a failed challenge to refusal to revoke a deportation order. Also, TOEIC cases continue to rumble through the system.

For everything else on Free Movement and elsewhere, read on.

Cheers, Sonia

Just 11 new permanent judges have been installed, despite Congress creating 800 federal immigration judiciary jobs as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Nemer’s suit, filed in Washington, DC, federal court, claims she was sacked on Feb. 5, in part, because she unsuccessfully ran for office earlier on in her career. She alleged this violated her Constitutional right to engage in political activity.

But the DOJ argued in her previous Equal Employment Opportunity complaint that the Trump administration has the right to fire employees and they let Nemer go as part of a “lawful exercise” of that authority.

Nemer began her judgeship in 2023 under former President Joe Biden’s administration. She is seeking to be reinstated.

What changes now is that “certain provisions will encourage countries to strengthen cooperation on the readmission of their nationals.
Nothing more, nothing less,” said the EU executive spokesman responsible for trade, Olof Gill.
In essence, the European Commission will have the power, after informing the EU Council and the European Parliament, to terminate trade preferences with countries that fail to comply with their obligations to repatriate their nationals residing irregularly in the EU.","Brussels – Stop some trade preferences for developing countries that do not cooperate on migration and returns. This is the main novelty of the agreement reached late last night (1 December) between the EU institutions on the revision of the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) regulation, the scheme through which 65 non-EU countries can gain privileged access to the European single market. The preferences,” reads an EU Council note, “may be withdrawn if a beneficiary country does not cooperate on the readmission of its own nationals.

Negotiations to revise the instrument, which began in 1971 and was last amended in 2014, have dragged on for almost four years. The rise of far-right parties across Europe and the assertion of an increasingly strict migration policy (with a renewed focus on returns) led to the inclusion, for the first time, of conditionality linking trade measures to the fight against irregular migration.

The European Commission “welcomed” the agreement between the co-legislators, noting that “the GSP in its current form already provides for certain conditions” for beneficiary countries. On respect for human rights and the environment, in particular. What changes now is that “certain provisions will encourage countries to strengthen cooperation on the readmission of their nationals. Nothing more, nothing less,” said the EU executive spokesman responsible for trade, Olof Gill.

In essence, the European Commission will have the power, after informing the EU Council and the European Parliament, to terminate trade preferences with countries that fail to comply with their obligations to repatriate their nationals residing irregularly in the EU. Obligations, in this sense, exist only for third countries that have concluded specific readmission agreements with Brussels, such as Ethiopia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Niger, Nigeria, Ghana, Mali, and Morocco. But also Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. In all, there are more than 20.

The Group of Socialists and Democrats stated in a note that “thanks to the persistent efforts” of its negotiators, the final agreement “ensures that any consideration of readmission is strictly a measure of last resort, subject to clear safeguards and a rigorous procedure,” whereas the European Commission’s initial proposal “risked introducing cooperation on readmission of migrants as a criterion for the withdrawal of trade preferences.”

The other conditions: human rights, environment, and the rice clause

The new framework introduces other novelties. Beneficiary countries will be required to comply with more international conventions on human and labour rights, and Brussels will have an emergency procedure for the rapid withdrawal of preferences in the event of violations of the principles of these conventions, as well as in the event of serious and systematic violations of climate change and environmental protection conventions. The EU also provided for a gradual transition for countries that will cease to be considered LDCs in the next decade and will therefore no longer benefit from the GSP regime, and lowered the threshold of imports in a specific sector above which a country temporarily loses preferences from 57 per cent to 47 per cent.

To overcome resistance from Italy and Spain, an automatic specific safeguard mechanism for rice imports has also been introduced: in the event of a significant increase over the historical average of imports into the EU, these imports will be subject to World Trade Organisation MFN (Most Favoured Nation) duties for a specific period to avoid “severe disruption of the EU rice market.” The Renew Liberal Group assured in a note that “the mechanism will be used in a proportionate manner, with safeguards before any suspension, including extended evaluation procedures for least developed countries.”

The agreement will now have to be approved by the Council and Parliament before it is formally adopted. The legislation will then apply from 1 January 2027.",https://www.eunews.it/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/000_33KD8EM-1024x667.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 11:58:25.169756

The letter, which was sent Friday, November 21, 2025, to President Donald Trump, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and National Nuclear Security Administration Administrator Brandon Williams, denounces the administration’s plans and outlines clear actions to ensure Congressional oversight, including:

Unclassified bipartisan briefings.

Assessments of the projected health, environmental, and economic impacts.

A comprehensive cost estimate of an explosive nuclear test, and more.

Key excerpt:

Renewing explosive testing will resume a dark chapter in American history that still continues to leave deep human and environmental scars. Between 1951 and 1992, over 900 nuclear tests blanketed the American West with radioactive fallout, exposing millions of Americans to devastating health effects, especially “downwind” communities in Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico. Decades of evidence from the Nevada National Security Site, the Marshall Islands, and other test regions document the lasting toll of contamination, illness, and environmental damage. Many of those harmed are still awaiting long-overdue compensation under the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA). Resuming testing will only compound these injustices, expose new generations to radiation and environmental risk while many are already denied care for past exposure, and further erode public trust in the government’s commitment to protect its own citizens.

The lawmakers released the following statements:

“Nevadans know better than anyone how reckless the Trump administration’s reversal on three decades of nuclear non-proliferation is,” Rep. Horsford said. “Some in our state continue to wait for compensation they’re due from 41 years of nuclear tests poisoning our land, air, and water – we cannot allow history to repeat itself. Nevada’s Congressional Democrats are united in our opposition to renewed testing, and our demand for accountability. That means truly understanding the impacts on the environment, economy, and local population. It means being clear-eyed about the full cost of conducting a test. And it means ensuring all of this information is available for Congressional oversight and public scrutiny.”

“For decades too many Nevadans have suffered the consequences of explosive nuclear testing and toxic radiation exposure,” Rep. Lee said. “Experts, including those in the Trump administration, have consistently testified that explosive nuclear testing is unnecessary. Instead of nuclear saber-rattling, this moment demands transparency and accountability. Congress must have oversight over nuclear testing so we can continue to protect our people, environment, and economy.”

The lawmakers’ letter requests the Trump administration take six specific actions:

Reaffirm the U.S. moratorium on explosive nuclear weapons testing and immediately halt any preparatory or infrastructure activities that signal intent to resume such testing.

Provide a full, unclassified bipartisan briefing to Congress outlining any directives, funding allocations, or site activities associated with renewed test readiness, including at the Department of Energy and the Department of Defense.

Publish an interagency assessment detailing the projected health, environmental, and economic impacts of potential testing, including radiation exposure risks to downwind communities and service members.

Deliver to Congress a comprehensive cost estimate for conducting an explosive nuclear test—including equipment, personnel, time, and cleanup—along with an explanation of the strategic rationale.

Establish an updated presumption of exposure for military personnel, federal employees, and civilians who served or lived near historic or proposed test sites, ensuring expedited access to care and compensation under the RECA.

Recommit to the principles and verification mechanisms of the CTBT and reaffirm U.S. leadership in scientific stewardship, strategic stability, and responsible global engagement. We also urge the Administration to renew efforts for a Senate consideration and ratification of the CTBT.

All three of Nevada’s Congressional Democrats are signatories on a previous Congressional letter sent November 3, 2025, expressing outrage at the administration’s intent to test nuclear weapons. More information is available here.

Representatives Horsford and Lee also co-led legislation introduced on November 7, 2025, requiring Congressional Approval for Explosive Nuclear Tests. More information is available here.

The goal of these provisions was to make sure that the government would not force people with potentially valid asylum claims back to countries in which they faced persecution without first considering their claims.
In December 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the District Court explaining why it should not dismiss the case.
For decades, the executive branch has consistently recognized that § 1182(f) does not allow the President to deny people the right to pursue a claim for asylum.
For this reason, no President has attempted to use that statute to prohibit access to the U.S. asylum process.","Under the Refugee Act of 1980, Congress required the executive branch to establish a process for any person physically present in the country or at a port of entry to seek asylum. It also prohibited government officials from sending noncitizens to places where their “life or freedom would be threatened.” In the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Congress once again addressed the nation’s asylum procedures by requiring the executive branch to exempt from expedited removal anyone who intended to seek asylum and expressed a credible fear of persecution. The goal of these provisions was to make sure that the government would not force people with potentially valid asylum claims back to countries in which they faced persecution without first considering their claims.

The Trump Administration nonetheless instituted an “Asylum Shutdown Policy” that turns away” people who are trying to present themselves at ports of entry to seek asylum, leaving them stranded in places in which they are subject to grave danger. A coalition of immigrants’ rights organizations brought suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, and the government moved to dismiss the case.

In December 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the District Court explaining why it should not dismiss the case. Our brief argues that the Policy is unlawful for three reasons.

First, the provisions of law that the Trump Administration relies upon do not give the President the power to restrict the ability to apply for asylum. Most significantly, § 1182(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) provides that the President can “suspend the entry” of anyone whose entry “would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.” As the provision’s text and history make clear, it addresses the criteria for “admission” into the country. But admissibility is not—and has never been—a prerequisite to applying for asylum. Thus, the President’s § 1182(f) power gives him no discretion to prevent people from applying for asylum.

Second, President Trump’s policy upends Congress’s deliberate decisions about how the nation’s asylum system should operate. Congress passed laws to limit the executive’s control of asylum admissions and guarantee each asylum-seeker the opportunity to have the government consider their claim. It sought to replace an ad-hoc system driven by the executive branch’s discretion with a system in which every person’s application for asylum

is fairly considered. Over the decades, Congress has reiterated that all asylum-seekers are entitled to individualized assessment of their claims, regardless of the President’s power to suspend entry.

Finally, the Trump Administration’s arguments are at odds with historical practice. For decades, the executive branch has consistently recognized that § 1182(f) does not allow the President to deny people the right to pursue a claim for asylum. For this reason, no President has attempted to use that statute to prohibit access to the U.S. asylum process.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-12-02 11:00:00.353962

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries ""of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

Here's a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:

All asylum decisions suspended

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn't trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump's January order didn't affect those cases, Edlow's social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency's pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department's immigration courts.

A focus on countries ‘of concern’

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others.

No visas for Afghans

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

A review of refugees admitted under the Biden administration

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That's nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.

Noem hints at updated travel ban

Late Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested in a post on X that more changes could be in the offing.

Noting that she had just met with Trump, Noem said she was recommending a “full travel ban” on countries she said were flooding the U.S. “with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Noem did not specifically name any countries and no timeline was given. The Department of Homeland Security said in an email Monday, “We will be announcing the list soon.”",https://media.nbcwashington.com/2025/12/GettyImages-2249378423.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-12-02 17:58:36.978648

Organizations such as Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and Lutheran Services in Iowa have felt the brunt of a state scarce of affordable immigration legal services.","Iowa immigration lawyers and legal aid groups are overwhelmed by a surge in cases due to the Trump administration's immigration policies.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in Iowa have more than doubled from 298 in 2024 to 693 in the first seven months of this year.

There is a significant shortage of immigration attorneys in Iowa, especially in rural areas where many immigrants work and reside.

ELDORA — On a September afternoon, Tim Farmer climbed into his truck, plugged his laptop charger into a car USB port and logged onto a Zoom call with Escucha Mi Voz. For over an hour, while parked outside a diner, the Perry lawyer met three families and the Iowa City immigration rights group to offer free legal help and answer questions about their immigration statuses.

Like clockwork with each family, Farmer sat up, flashed a soft smile and reintroduced himself as new faces emerged onto the screen.

""Soy Tim Farmer. Soy abogado,"" he said, introducing himself as a lawyer to each of them in Spanish.

Farmer spent Tuesday, Sept. 16 on the road, driving an hour and a half from his office in Perry to Eldora to meet a client being held at the Hardin County Jail after federal immigration agents arrested him during a traffic stop. The lawyer answered calls from clients and their families, including the worried girlfriend of the man in Hardin County who asked about visiting hours and depositing money into her boyfriend's commissary account.

Long days have become normal for Farmer who, since January, has handled a surge of calls and requests for legal services because of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration. In one of his first acts in office, President Donald Trump cancelled flights for refugees approved to come to the U.S. and ordered resettlement agencies to stop serving new arrivals, who would otherwise receive three months of help finding housing, employment and school for their children. He also declared a national emergency on the U.S.'s southern border and sought to end the humanitarian parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans.

Farmer is among Iowa's immigration lawyers who say they are overwhelmed by the number of people who need access to legal services. Even before the Trump administration's moves, services were already strapped, particularly in rural areas. The need, they say, has only grown as the administration's frequent changes to immigration policies and push for expedited deportations creates new challenges for lawyers seeking to help clients remain in the country and with their families.

From Jan. 1 to July 28, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has made 693 arrests in Iowa, according to the Deportation Data Project. The project gathered and released data showing individual case information for ICE arrests and deportations. That Iowa arrest number is more than double the 298 ICE arrests in 2024 — and more than five times the 123 reported in 2023.

In those seven months, 511 people in Iowa were either deported, left voluntarily or removed because they reentered the U.S. before they were authorized to, according to the data. That number was 211 in 2024.

Many people, including those in Iowa, have cheered the increase in arrests and deportations. They believe the country's immigration system was broken long before the crackdown — and the president is finally fixing it with his aggressive moves.

Recent ads from the Department of Homeland Security tout reasons behind the administration's push for immigration enforcement.

""America is not a nation of immigrants,"" DHS Deputy Assistant Secretary Micah Bock said in a Nov. 16 video posted on social media. ""We are a nation of citizens, and it is because of those citizens that we are an exceptional nation. The first duty of our government is to defend people's well-being, way of life and safeguard our nation's heritage.""

But the approach has had consequences, both for Iowa lawyers and for the people they work to defend.

“I worked as an immigration attorney through the first Trump administration as well and I would say that this time things are much more aggressive,"" Farmer said.

""It's not letting up anytime soon,"" he added in a Nov. 7 interview.

According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association, 211 immigration attorneys are members of the national organization's Iowa and Nebraska chapter. Of that number, about 74 are based in Iowa. While these figures are not an exact count of all Iowa attorneys practicing immigration law, they offer a glimpse of the resources available to immigrants seeking legal consultation or representation.

The list of immigration lawyers in Iowa is even smaller when taking into account specialties. Roughly one-third of American Immigration Lawyers Association Iowa lawyers handle removal proceedings, said Gunda Brost, the chapter's media liaison and an immigration attorney in northeast Iowa. More focus on business immigration and work with companies on employment visas or filings with agencies such as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or the National Visa Center.

""People who are caught up in Trump's enforcement — they are not even going to be able to find an employment immigration lawyer to take on their case,"" she said.

Those living in rural areas have fewer options, with most immigration lawyers located in larger cities such as Des Moines and Cedar Rapids.

""If you think about who the immigrants are, a lot of them are in meat packaging plants, construction ... where they are necessarily in rural areas,"" Brost said. ""In other words, it's difficult for them to access.""

Brost, whose firm is in Cedar Falls, serves clients from the area and Waterloo. The next closest immigration lawyer is in a 40-mile radius or at least an hour drive, she said.

Brost said some clients have turned to nonprofits for legal help but struggled to make appointments with staff because of the high demand or limited slots.

Access to legal representation is ""a life-changing protection,"" reported the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University data organization that tracks immigration detention. People who receive legal counsel are more likely to ""win relief from deportation,"" the group said.

Of the court cases decided nationwide from 2019 to 2024, 62% of immigrants without a lawyer were deported compared to 27% of those with one, the American Immigration Council found.

Cost and language are barriers for many, Brost said. It can be hard for clients to navigate the U.S. immigration and court system especially if their English is limited. That means access to bilingual or multilingual lawyers and quality interpreters are vital.

Of the top 10 languages spoken in immigration court, TRAC found noncitizens who speak Creole and had no legal representation were highly likely — 93% — to receive a removal order in fiscal year 2025. More than 80% of Spanish speakers also received removal orders — and over 85% were unrepresented in cases that ended in removal.

The case against one of Farmer's more high-profile clients, Pascual Pedro, a 20-year-old who was arrested and detained after a routine ICE check-in, underscores how quickly immigration lawyers must work. Pedro, a Guatemalan immigrant who lived in West Liberty with family and worked in construction, was deported to his home country a five days after his July 1 arrest.

Farmer said he didn't even have a chance to represent his client. An immigrant rights group hired Farmer July 3, but because of the July Fourth holiday, many offices were closed. The Monday after, as Farmer filed a stay of removal petition, he learned Pedro already was in Guatemala.

In 2018, Pedro, then 13 years old, fled to the U.S. from Guatemala with his father. U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials issued them both an expedited removal but only Pedro's father was deported. Pedro was issued an order of supervision, which allowed him to temporarily live in the country with strict conditions while waiting final deportation orders.

""He's basically just been living in the U.S. for the past few years at their whim,"" Farmer previously said. ""They can decide to execute the order of removal at any time, and that's what they've done.""

Wave of policy changes bring new challenges for immigration attorneys, organizations

On the drive to Eldora, Farmer's electric truck became a makeshift mobile office. Tangled ties took over the glove compartment, his blazers in the trunk. Ceaseless phone calls have replaced a pastime — listening to audiobooks of classic literature.

""I get interrupted so much,"" said Farmer, who left a law firm in Perry after 10 years to start his own private practice in January.

He anticipated a heavier workload, but not like this.

Organizations such as Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice and Lutheran Services in Iowa have felt the brunt of a state scarce of affordable immigration legal services. Limited funding to deliver those services often lead organizations to turn clients away and refer them to private attorneys such as Farmer, said Ann Naffier, co-legal director at Iowa MMJ, and Nicholas Wuertz, who oversees LSI's immigrant and refugee services.

""People keep asking me, 'oh, you must be really busy?' but the truth is I've always been really busy,"" Naffier said. ""We're just more stressed.

""Is there much more work to do? Yes. But we were already at capacity.""

Iowa MMJ recently expanded its legal clinics to combat the Trump administration's changes to programs, including those that revoked the temporary legal statuses of immigrants already living and working in the U.S. The organization, which provides free or low-cost legal services, began offering legal counsel clinics to help more of those individuals explore options, if any, to remain in the U.S.

Legal clinics are popular among Iowa MMJ clients, but space is limited. Some clinics with 10 appointment slots have seen 200 community members apply, said Elena Casillas-Hoffman, communications specialist.

In August, Iowa MMJ held an emergency clinic in Ottumwa for JBS meatpacking plant workers whose work visas had been revoked and who were at risk of deportation. Many of the 200 workers had temporary legal status through the CHNV parole program. That program ended in May and once protected immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela from deportation and gave them work visas. It hosted other clinics in Clarion and Storm Lake, where communities faced a similar issue and people whose legal statuses were ""ripped out from underneath them"" were laid off in droves, Casillas-Hoffman said.

Those kinds of policies are among the factors driving people to seek assistance from Iowa MMJ's legal team. Heightened fear and anxiety among immigrant and refugee communities are another.

Having a larger legal team also allowed the advocacy organization to see more people. Iowa MMJ has four attorneys — one of whom was added last year and focuses on detained community members — and six representatives accredited by the Department of Justice to provide immigration legal services. Two bilingual administrative assistants and two legal workers also joined the team this year.

Iowa MMJ is one of 10 organizations in the state — and one of three in Des Moines — recognized by the Department of Justice and has accredited representatives authorized to represent clients with immigration cases, including family petitions and work visa renewals.

Two LSI staff members are taking courses to become federally accredited representatives — a start to the nonprofit's longtime goal of having its own immigration legal services branch.

The changes to immigration policies under the Trump administration add fuel to that goal, Wuertz said.

Recent changes to SNAP benefits are affecting LSI refugee clients, who are no longer eligible for the federal program under HR 1, also known as Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act."" People granted asylum, survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking and other noncitizens also are unable to get assistance under the bill, which became law in July.

""With the passage of the bill, it restricts their access to programs until they gain lawful permanent residency or green cards,"" which they can apply for after a year, Wuertz said.

Refugees also can apply for citizenship after five years. Both those steps would require assistance of immigration legal services.

""It just increases the urgency for access to affordable immigration legal services so that refugees and other humanitarian immigrants can timely get their green card and once again be eligible for some of those safety next programs,"" Wuertz said.

'It's a blessing' if detained migrants get out of jail, lawyer says

At Hardin County Jail, Farmer walked past the secured doors and into small white room with a single chair and a glass window and waited for his client to enter.

A detail in the man's case speaks to a new trend Farmer has noticed: Traffic stops turning into immigration arrests are more common as the Trump administration ramps up immigration enforcement. The man was stopped in Wright County for using his cell phone while driving, which consequently led to his arrest by federal immigration authorities.

""Sometimes, people get stopped just for having a headlight out or something like that and then the officer finds out they don't have a license,"" Farmer said. ""Sometimes, they'll even be arrested for driving without a license, which is not normally something that you would be arrested for.

""Some officers will arrest you for driving without a license if they find out the reason you don't have a license is because you're undocumented.""

And if you're an undocumented immigrant, you may not be eligible for bail.

An ICE policy change prevents judges from granting bond to most detained migrants, which Farmer and Des Moines immigration attorney Alexander Cárdenas Cruz said further limits their clients' legal options.

""If you get out of jail, it's a blessing honestly,"" said Cruz, who works at the downtown Des Moines law firm Mueller Schmidt Mulholland & Cooling.

Cruz said voluntary departure, an alternative to deportation, has become more appealing to his clients who have been released from ICE custody or are in detention.

""A lot of people are taking it,"" he said. ""They have been in jail for a couple of weeks, and they're just sick of being in jail — which I don't blame them — because they're not hard criminals.""

Hardin County Jail is one of six Iowa county jails contracted by the U.S. Marshals Service to hold federal inmates. Polk County Jail — the largest of the six that also includes Linn, Muscatine, Pottawattamie and Woodbury counties — has 170 to 200 beds reserved for federal inmates, said Lt. Mark Chance, spokesperson for the Polk County Sheriff's Office.

Sixty-four of those beds are for ICE.

To be granted voluntary departure, individuals must admit to being in the U.S. without immigration documents and withdraw submitted applications or petitions. Those who leave voluntarily could trigger a 10-year ban from reentering the U.S. and pay penalty fees up to about $10,000.

Like Farmer, Cruz said he continues to field more requests for legal services since Trump stepped into the Oval Office in January.

The work has been nonstop.

""We've been talking for 20 minutes, and I have five missed calls from people, either clients or (those) looking for representation,"" Cruz said during a Nov. 6 interview.

""Every time now that somebody on Instagram says that something's happening, I get a call,"" he said. News of ICE arrests across the country, including Iowa, frequent changes to immigration laws or new fees tacked on to immigration applications cause his phone to ring.

""If there’s a news article that comes out that says that somebody got deported at a court hearing, I get a call (from a client asking,) 'Am I going to get deported at my court hearing?'"" he said.

In October, calls poured in as people learned of a new policy that would require them to pay $100 each year their asylum applications are pending. A federal judge temporarily blocked that change that same month after the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project filed a lawsuit against USCIS over the fee.

The uncertainty is hard to face. So are the tears from Cruz's clients.

Families are scared to be separated — to lose loved ones with no possible return date in sight. Cruz said he has the tough job of telling people they may not win their cases.

With clients facing deportations, he speaks with families about their next steps, which could entail plans on what they could do to legally return to the U.S.

""I’ve always, at least, made sure to really enjoy the wins,"" he said. ""Because that’s how I can tell myself I am making a difference.""

""But I can tell you every client that I've lost and their names and how we lost and how their families dealt with it because I’ll never forget that,"" Cruz said. ""Those are the hardest conversations I’ve ever had in my life.""

Moulton said he would continue to press ICE to improve conditions at Burlington, adding ""there's no excuse that they have not had sleeping mats from June until now.""
Before going inside the ICE field office, Moulton told protest leaders that Democrats in Congress needed to do more to counter the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. ""
"" What's happening inside the Burlington field office, and to immigrants in general, is ""not acceptable and must stop,"" she said.","Congressman Seth Moulton visited the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Burlington on Monday and said little has changed there since June — there are still no beds or mattress pads, so people continue to sleep on concrete floors or benches.

The holding rooms are less crowded however, the Salem Democrat said after a 90-minute tour. There were fewer than 10 people being held Monday, down from close to 50 in June.

""It does seem that they are moving people through here more quickly,"" Moulton said. But he said that expediency means immigrants who are arrested and brought to the Burlington office are swiftly ""whisked off"" to detention centers in other states, like Texas and Louisiana, often without their families or lawyers being notified.

""Although the humanitarian standards are inadequate and we don't want people stuck here for a long period of time,"" he said, being quickly moved out of state is also a problem when it comes to protecting people’s rights.

""We want to give people adequate access to lawyers,"" he said.

Moulton, whose district includes Burlington, came for what his office billed as an oversight inspection amid ongoing public scrutiny over conditions at the ICE administrative building, located not far from the Burlington Mall. Former detainees have said they were often held for days at a time in overcrowded rooms and denied access to showers, medical care and sanitary supplies like pads and tampons.

By ICE's own admission, field offices are processing centers and not designed for long-term detention. On rare occasions, people are kept longer, a spokesperson told WBUR in June.

The agency has maintained that detainees are ""given ample food, regular access to phones, showers and legal representation as well as medical care when needed.""

Moulton's June visit coincided with the release of Marcelo Gomes da Silva, an 18-year-old Milford high school student who was detained for six days in a room with dozens of older men. At the time, Moulton and U.S. Rep. Jake Auchincloss showed up to the facility, having given ICE little notice, and asked for a tour, as was their right as congressmen. Not too long after, the Trump administration announced that elected officials must pre-arrange oversight visits. As a result, ICE agents knew Moulton was coming on Monday.

U.S. Sen. Ed Markey made an unplanned appearance there last week and was denied access; he has said he’s made arrangements for a future official visit. Moulton is challenging Markey for his senate seat.

On Monday, Moulton said he witnessed an asylum hearing and had the opportunity to ask federal agents a wide variety of questions, including what typically happens to people who are brought to the facility. He said immigration officials agreed to send him information about the number of people booked into the office and the length of time they were detained.

Earlier this year, the entire Massachusetts delegation asked ICE for this information. The agency did not disclose specifics, but a WBUR examination of data found that hundreds of people were held in the Burlington field office for more than two days during May and June.

Since then, ICE has continued to arrest people across Massachusetts; 1,400 people in September alone, according to the agency.

Moulton said he asked immigration officials if they were transferring people out of Massachusetts to avoid judges who may be sympathetic to immigrants or less inclined to deport them. He said he was told detainees are being moved because of limited in-state detention capacity. Massachusetts has one facility that holds men, the Plymouth County jail, and none that can accommodate women.

Asked if the solution is to build more detention centers in state, Moulton told reporters and dozens of protesters gathered at the site that he’s not pushing to open more facilities.

""But in the case of a female facility in Massachusetts, it actually probably would be smart so that they're not being sent out of state and that they get to go before Massachusetts judges,"" he said.

In at least two recent high-profile cases, immigrant women arrested in Massachusetts have been swiftly transferred to out-of-state detention facilities. In the first, Bruna Ferreira, a Brazilian native who had a child with the brother of White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, was arrested in Revere last month and taken to detention in Louisiana. And over the weekend, Any Lucia López Belloza, a freshman at Babson College was arrested at Logan Airport, transported to Texas and then deported to Honduras, a country she left 12 years ago.

Moulton said he would continue to press ICE to improve conditions at Burlington, adding ""there's no excuse that they have not had sleeping mats from June until now."" He also said he'd visit again soon, and called on local protesters who've been meeting outside the facility weekly to keep up the pressure.

"" Your presence here makes a huge difference,"" he said, gesturing to the crowd from the Essex County Community Organization. ""They know that they're being watched, they know that they're being held accountable, and we're going to continue doing that until this situation improves.""

Before going inside the ICE field office, Moulton told protest leaders that Democrats in Congress needed to do more to counter the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

"" The abuses of ICE need to be prosecuted,"" he said. ""Yes. Not just defunded — prosecuted. They need to be held accountable to the law that they claim to enforce.""

While many in the audience thanked Moulton for his oversight and efforts to help immigrants, not everyone thought he was doing enough to press ICE on the issue.

"" I was quite frankly disappointed,"" Rev. Bernadette Hickman Maynard said. ""I want to hear more than 'we're going to follow up and talk to them.' ""

The immigration fee was contained in a Sept. 19 presidential proclamation.
Only three Indian companies were among the top 25 employers of new H-1B visa holders in FY 2025, and executives at two of those companies, TCS and LTIMindtree, said they do not plan to file for new H-1B visa holders in the coming year.
The proclamation’s assertion that H-1B visa holders have prevented U.S. engineers and computer specialists from obtaining jobs lacks evidence.
DOJ argues the $100,000 fee “is not a fee” that would fall under the relevant parts of immigration law limiting how fees are assessed by U.S.","The Department of Justice has responded to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce’s lawsuit against the president’s $100,000 fee imposed on the entry of new H-1B visa holders. The immigration fee was contained in a Sept. 19 presidential proclamation. In the Defendants’ response and cross motion for summary judgment, the Trump administration rejected arguments made by the Chamber of Commerce and the American Association of Universities, which joined the lawsuit as a plaintiff. DOJ argues the president has “extraordinarily broad discretion to suspend the entry of aliens whenever he finds their admission ‘detrimental to the interest of the United States.’”

H-1B temporary visas are often the only way for high-skilled foreign nationals to work in the United States long term. Employers must pay the higher of the actual or prevailing wage paid to U.S. professionals with similar experience and qualifications. When companies recruit at U.S. universities, they find that international students account for approximately 70% of full-time graduate students in AI-related fields, such as computer and information sciences. The H-1B annual limit is 65,000, with an exemption of 20,000 for individuals with master’s degrees or higher from a U.S. university, or about 0.05% of the U.S. labor force.

In FY 2025, with sizable investments in artificial intelligence at stake, Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Google had the most approved new H-1B petitions, according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. At the same time, Indian-based companies have mostly disappeared from the top rankings, with their numbers plummeting. Only three Indian companies were among the top 25 employers of new H-1B visa holders in FY 2025, and executives at two of those companies, TCS and LTIMindtree, said they do not plan to file for new H-1B visa holders in the coming year.

According to guidance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the $100,000 fee would not apply to “change of status"" cases where people change from one category to another without leaving the country, such as moving from F-1 student status to H-1B status. It would apply to situations when a new H-1B visa holder needs to enter the United States.

The U.S. Chamber Of Commerce And AAU Immigration Lawsuit

On Oct. 16, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a complaint against the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. State Department, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Counsel for the plaintiffs include Daryl L. Joseffer of U.S. Chamber Litigation Center and Paul W. Hughes, Sarah P. Hogarth, Mary H. Schnoor, Alex C. Boota, Grace Wallack and Emmett Witkovsky-Eldred of McDermott Will & Schulte. The legal action followed an earlier lawsuit against the $100,000 fee filed on Oct. 3.

The Chamber of Commerce-AAU complaint argues that Congress, not the president, has the authority over the design of the H-1B visa category and the fees that govern it. The complaint states that the fee would inflict significant harm, forcing businesses to “either dramatically increase their labor costs or hire fewer highly skilled employees for whom domestic replacements are not readily available.” The complaint also argues the proclamation is misguided and unlawful: “The President has significant authority over the entry of noncitizens into the United States, but that authority is bounded by statute and cannot directly contradict laws passed by Congress.”

The complaint states that the proclamation “expressly overrides provisions” of immigration law that govern the H-1B visa category. The plaintiffs note that Congress established specific fees for H-1B visas, such as a fee that funds training and scholarships, and also allows the executive branch to charge fees for visas and services “sufficient to fund its activities related to those services,” but not more.

The plaintiffs also argue that any agency action implementing the proclamation would be unlawful and violate the Administrative Procedure Act. The $100,000 payment was not set by notice-and-comment rulemaking but by “presidential fiat.” According to the complaint, DHS and State cannot implement a fee that is not a valid exercise of the president’s authority, conflicts with other elements of immigration law and is “arbitrary and capricious.”

In one of the complaint’s strongest arguments, the plaintiffs state, “The INA [Immigration and Nationality Act] permits the executive branch to charge immigration fees in two circumstances: (a) where the fee is adopted via notice and comment rulemaking and set at a level necessary to recoup USCIS’s costs . . . or (b) where Congress itself has expressly authorized the fee through statute. The Proclamation’s exorbitant $100,000 application fee falls into neither category.”

The Trump Administration’s Response To The Immigration Lawsuit

In a filing on Dec. 1, the Justice Department rejected the plaintiffs’ arguments, declaring, “The Proclamation is a lawful exercise of the President’s authority to restrict the admission of aliens into the United States. The Court should therefore deny Plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion in its entirety and enter summary judgment for Defendants.”

First, DOJ argues that plaintiffs’ claims are foreclosed by “the longstanding doctrine of nonreviewability, which bars judicial review of the Executive’s discretionary determination under the INA to restrict the entry of aliens into the United States.” Later in the response, DOJ points to the “principles of consular nonreviewability,” writing that “The Supreme Court has long held that ‘[t]he admission and exclusion of foreign nationals is a fundamental sovereign attribute’ that is ‘largely immune from judicial control.’”

Second, DOJ states that plaintiffs do not have a cause of action under the Administrative Procedure Act because “it is well-settled that (1) the President is not subject to suit under the APA and (2) his statutory authority to regulate or restrict the entry of aliens into the United States derives explicitly from 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(f) and 1185(a).” The DOJ response adds, “Moreover, that authority is entirely discretionary, and judicial review to challenge such discretionary actions is unavailable via an ultra vires claim or the APA.”

Third, the response argues that the proclamation “does not conflict with any provision of the INA” and “simply adds an additional restriction on the entry of a class of aliens to further a key national interest: protecting American workers and national security.” The final DOJ argument: “Any claim by Plaintiffs that implementation of the Proclamation is procedurally deficient because it did not go through APA notice-and-comment rulemaking fails because Defendants have merely implemented what the Proclamation requires.”

DOJ states that even if plaintiffs’ claims are “justiciable,” the court’s review of the proclamation “must be exceedingly deferential” due to “the President’s discretion in exercising core Article II responsibilities’ addressing immigration, foreign affairs and national security.” The administration’s legal response several times evokes national security, including by repeating the proclamation’s assertion that “the President found that these abuses threaten national security because it ‘discourage[es] Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology, [thereby] risking American leadership in these fields.’”

An NFAP analysis of the Sept. 19 proclamation found it presented no empirical evidence linking the entry of H-1B visa holders or “abuses” of H-1B visas to discouraging “Americans from pursuing careers in science and technology.” Many H-1B visa holders are former international students. An NFAP study by University of North Florida economics professor Madeline Zavodny found, “Each additional 10 bachelor’s degrees—across all majors—awarded to international students by a college or university leads to an additional 15 bachelor’s degrees in STEM majors awarded to U.S. students.” Colleges devote more resources to STEM in response to international student interest, making these fields more attractive to American students. The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence reported to Congress in 2021 that the U.S. government should liberalize, not restrict, the entry of high-skilled foreign nationals in science and technology fields.

The proclamation’s assertion that H-1B visa holders have prevented U.S. engineers and computer specialists from obtaining jobs lacks evidence. The number of U.S.-born workers employed in computer science and mathematical occupations increased by over 2.7 million, or 141%, between 2003 and 2024, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far higher than the 8% increase in the number of U.S.-born workers in the whole economy.

DOJ did not present a strong response to the plaintiffs’ argument that the president lacks the authority to tax and that any fee must go through notice-and-comment rulemaking or be expressly authorized by law. DOJ argues the $100,000 fee “is not a fee” that would fall under the relevant parts of immigration law limiting how fees are assessed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “The payment is not to cover costs, it performs a completely different function that is not expressly prohibited or otherwise governed by the INA,” according to DOJ. “Rather, the Proclamation payment was set by the President as a restriction on entry that he found ‘would be detrimental to the interests of the United States because such entry would harm American workers, including by undercutting their wages’ and it is paid into a general account for miscellaneous payments.”

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries “of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

Here’s a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:

All asylum decisions suspended

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they’re granted asylum, they’re allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn’t trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump’s January order didn’t affect those cases, Edlow’s social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency’s pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department’s immigration courts.

A focus on countries ‘of concern’

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others.

No visas for Afghans

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

A review of refugees admitted under the Biden administration

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That’s nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.

Noem hints at updated travel ban

Late Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested in a post on X that more changes could be in the offing.

Noting that she had just met with Trump, Noem said she was recommending a “full travel ban” on countries she said were flooding the U.S. “with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Noem did not specifically name any countries and no timeline was given. The Department of Homeland Security said in an email Monday, “We will be announcing the list soon.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/6b4caf3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5213x2932+0+272/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd0%2Fc0%2F77e8677af0beb762fdab0cec1b12%2F2a096c597ab1409e96757cd051805d1a,N,,2025-12-02 12:57:28.993768

New York’s Democratic lawmakers are finding that defying President Donald Trump is easier said than done — even in a deep blue state.

Ideas that would satisfy their left-leaning base — like withholding taxes to the federal government — are proving legally and logistically questionable.

Proposals to curtail federal immigration enforcement efforts have languished in Albany.

And even symbolic measures like erasing Trump’s name from a state park haven’t gotten off the ground amid legal questions.

Democratic Senate Finance Chair Liz Krueger is aware of the limitations. Last year, she raised the possibility of withholding tax payments to the federal government as a form of protest against Trump policies.

She now acknowledges doing so creates a series of legal problems for New York taxpayers.

“There’s lots of people who are very interested, but so far each proposal that I have explored sort of leads back to, well, you’d be putting the individual taxpayer at risk of violating federal law,” Krueger told Playbook. “I have no desire to encourage people to break federal law and end up facing criminal charges by the IRS.”

A bill that would limit local law enforcement officials from working with federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement also faces an unclear path in Albany.

The measure would put Gov. Kathy Hochul in a bind as she runs for a second full term this year — as well as cause heartburn for swing seat House Democrats.

Yet the proposal has traction among left-flank lawmakers who want to throw a wrench in the president’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies.

“There’s going to be a strong anti-Trump agenda to make sure New York is a place that’s affordable, safe and folks can live with dignity,” Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas said.

Republican state lawmakers scoff at the efforts to form a Resistance 2.0 in Albany.

“Democrats are the ones that created the affordability problem,” Assemblymember Chris Tague said. “They’re the ones that created the immigrant problem. Now all of a sudden it’s a crisis. It was a crisis when Biden was president. They screwed it all up and Trump had to come in and fix it.”

New York Democrats have no shortage of complaints with the president, who has been eager to exert power over blue states and cities, including his hometown.

He meddled in New York City’s mayoral election, dangling jobs in front of incumbent Eric Adams so he would quit the race to ease a path to victory for Andrew Cuomo. (Adams did drop out, but democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won anyway.)

The Trump administration and Republican-led Congress approved deep spending reductions for health care and food aid. Trump announced a spending freeze on major infrastructure projects like the Second Avenue subway and Gateway tunnel amid the federal government shutdown — a move meant to squeeze Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries.

Yet Trump has formed surprisingly cordial relationships with the state’s most prominent Democrats, Hochul and Mamdani.

The governor speaks frequently on the phone with the president and met with him twice in the Oval Office.

Mamdani’s lovefest with Trump — in which the two men bonded over addressing affordability and sharing the same voters — astonished the political world.

Many political insiders don’t expect this era of good feelings to last. And Hochul’s team is still prepping for the possibility of Trump further slashing federal aid or deploying the National Guard to the Big Apple’s streets. — Nick Reisman

ABOVE THE FOLD

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: Dozens of business groups spanning tech, health care, retail and other sectors are pressuring Hochul to veto the New York Health Information Privacy Act, one of several consequential health bills she must consider before the year’s end.

The coalition of nearly 50 groups charges in a letter to Hochul that the legislation has expanded beyond its original stated purpose and would increase costs for New Yorkers.

“Although the legislation was originally conceived to prevent the misuse of reproductive and gender-affirming care data, it has evolved into a comprehensive and unprecedented data privacy regime unlike any in the nation,” said Tech:NYC, Partnership for New York City, DoorDash, Warby Parker, several chambers of commerce and other signatories. “As drafted, NY HIPA would reclassify routine transactions, standard consumer interactions, and basic product development practices as regulated health information.”

The New York Health Information Privacy Act, sponsored by Krueger, is intended to protect sensitive data not covered under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. It would regulate companies that collect and sell health info.

Krueger, Assemblymember Linda Rosenthal and Attorney General Letitia James, all Democrats, have cited the bankruptcy of DNA testing company 23andMe — and the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the genetic data the company has gathered from millions of people — as an example of why the legislation is necessary.

“Our health data is being collected, tracked, and sold to third parties by the very companies that are supposed to be taking care of us — including women’s health apps, which tend to have vague or hard-to-find privacy policies,” Krueger said in March, urging Hochul to sign the legislation.

Hochul typically does not telegraph her positions on legislation awaiting her signature. A spokesperson said the governor would review the bill. — Emily Ngo

CITY HALL: THE LATEST

FIVE-BORO BACKING: City Council Member Julie Menin has all but sewn up the race to be speaker of the 51-member chamber but she wants to be sworn in with as broad a coalition as possible. To bolster her strength, she has been reaching out to her colleagues and has talked with Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani.

Today, first reported in Playbook, Menin will announce she also has the support of all five Democratic county party chairs: Rep. Gregory Meeks of Queens, Assemblymember Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn of Brooklyn, Assemblymember Charles Fall of Staten Island, state Sen. Jamaal Bailey of the Bronx and former Assemblymember Keith Wright of Manhattan.

She is endorsed by 37 council members — a supermajority — and several powerful unions including the Hotel and Gaming Trades Council and the Transport Workers Union.

The Manhattan moderate, who formerly led the Department of Consumer Affairs in Bill de Blasio’s administration, is regarded by some allies as a check on Mamdani. But she sought to emphasize in an interview earlier this week with Playbook the areas where she and the democratic socialist can collaborate. — Emily Ngo

NEW FROM PLANET ALBANY

MUM ON THE REFUND: The governor’s campaign is refusing to say how much money she was forced to return after a report found she received thousands in campaign donations that appear to run afoul of her own 2021 executive order.

Hochul’s chief GOP rival Rep. Elise Stefanik moved swiftly to attack her after a Saturday report in Gothamist showed the governor raked in $72,500 in campaign contributions from state appointees.

“The Worst Governor in America violated her own executive order to enrich her campaign in a pay-to-play scheme and is now being forced to return the cash and refund her appointees,” Stefanik said Monday in a statement. “But how deep does Hochul’s corruption run?""

Hochul’s campaign acknowledged to Playbook that the donations in question were being returned, but refused to talk about the matter on the record or share how much money is being refunded.

Her 2021 executive order outlines that “no State agency officer or employee who serves at the pleasure of the Governor or their appointing authority … may make or offer to make any monetary contribution to the campaign of the Governor.” It was first passed by then-Gov. David Paterson in 2008 and reinstated by the governor.

Hochul’s campaign referred Playbook to a statement from American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten.

“Governor Hochul has the highest ethical standards and is working day in and day out to put money back in families’ pockets. I’m proud to stand behind her.”

Democratic primary challenger Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado said the donations are an example of how “for too long, New York has been run in backrooms with deals made behind closed doors.”

In 2022, The New York Times reported Hochul accepted more than $400,000 in campaign contributions from political appointees largely selected by her predecessor, Andrew Cuomo.

The potential return of thousands in apparently improper donations comes as the governor has spent the autumn months doling out a completely different type of refund. Last week, the governor announced that more than 8 million inflation refund checks were mailed to New York taxpayers in time for Thanksgiving. — Jason Beeferman

AND THEN THERE WERE THREE: The Republican field for state attorney general is getting crowded.

Former federal prosecutor Saritha Komatireddy announced Monday she would seek the GOP nomination to take on Democratic incumbent Letitia James, making her the third Republican to enter the race. Her candidacy was first reported by the New York Post.

“I’m running for Attorney General because we need a prosecutor in charge, focused on New York and focused on safety,” she said in a statement.

Komatireddy joins Michael Henry and Khurram Dara on the GOP side. James is seeking a third term next year. — Nick Reisman

KEEPING UP WITH THE DELEGATION

ACA FIGHT INTENSIFIES: House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is accusing Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) of undermining a White House proposal to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years as Congress stares down a fast-approaching deadline to avoid massive premium hikes.

“It even appears that the Trump administration was ready to put forth a plan that would at least have been worthy of consideration, and that Mike Johnson tanked it,” Jeffries said at a news conference Monday.

The New York Democrat was referring to a framework for extending the enhanced ACA tax credits that the White House was planning to release last week before the details were leaked and conservatives revolted, postponing rollout plans indefinitely.

Many congressional Democrats were cool to the blueprint, which would have paired an extension with other health policy changes sought by Republicans. But other Democrats called it a promising sign that Trump was finally getting ready to engage in negotiations over the future of the tax credits, which are due to sunset Dec. 31 without congressional action and around which Republicans are deeply divided.

“Obviously, Mike Johnson has zero interest in protecting the health care of the American people,” said Jeffries, adding that while Republicans “consistently said” they would discuss an extension of the subsidies after the end of the shutdown, “now we get nothing but crickets.”

A Johnson spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. — Mia McCarthy

Case provided the following details on the situation in the email:

What I do know is that our student was left without a home to return to, and that school staff had to scramble to find him a suitable living situation for the unknowable, possibly boundless time during which the person who provided him a home in this country will be detained or deported.

But carwash workers also have a unique asset: an advocacy group called the Clean Carwash Worker Center.
Andrea: I think it’s not just undocumented workers, I think it’s all car wash workers who are at risk.
And then lastly, the continued collaboration, the coalition of workers rights organizations who continue to elevate the crisis that is happening.
Andrea: Our organization has been able to identify at least 346 carwash workers that have been kidnapped from a carwash.","In June, Donald Trump’s administration turned Los Angeles into a testing ground for the tactics that have come to define its sweeping mass deportation agenda across the US – launching large scale, public arrests aimed at netting as many people as possible into a growing immigrant detention system.

Throughout the raids, one of the recurring targets of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents has been carwash workers.

Carwashes make a logical target for federal agents. It’s common knowledge that a significant share of that workforce lacks immigration authorization. The industry is dominated by small businesses with little political clout. They operate out in the open, making it difficult for workers to anticipate or evade arrest.

But carwash workers also have a unique asset: an advocacy group called the Clean Carwash Worker Center. Since 2007, the center has helped combat the industry’s exploitative labor conditions and unionize workers with the support of United Steel Workers Local 675. Clean was the driving force behind the 2014 Carwash Worker Law that established a restitution fund for victims of wage theft.

Since Trump took office in January, Clean’s work has shifted to confront the administration’s mass deportation agenda. At a time when migrants are being whisked away indiscriminately into detention centers, where they often lack access to a lawyer and face pressure to sign their own removal orders, Clean now serves as a unique link in a chain connecting legal aid groups and bond funds with families fighting deportation cases.

Clean has identified more than 101 ICE operations targeting carwashes in southern California since the raids began, resulting in the arrest of at least 346 carwash workers. Many of them were swiftly deported, according to Clean, but the organization’s efforts helped get 20 of them released on bond.

We spoke with Andrea Gonzalez, Clean’s deputy director, and Norma Fajardo, the organizing director, about how the organization is responding to the ongoing immigration raids. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.

It seems like these raids are putting undocumented car wash workers in an impossible position where they either show up to work and risk getting deported, or quit work and don’t get paid.

Andrea: I think it’s not just undocumented workers, I think it’s all car wash workers who are at risk. Our organization has been able to meet workers who are US citizens, who are legal permanent residents or have an ongoing immigration case that have been detained. The risk factor is there for any carwash worker at this point.

What effect are you seeing these raids having on the car-washing business writ large?

Andrea: There’s the financial impact. But since the raids in the beginning of June, many carwashes also decided to not open out of security reasons. Others had no choice but to shut down, because there weren’t any workers showing up.

Meanwhile, some customers have been afraid to go get their cars washed because they have also gotten swept up in raids at carwashes.

Have you seen a major change in the number of businesses targeted during the period from July to early September, when a federal judge’s order barred ICE from making indiscriminate arrests in southern California?

Andrea: Absolutely not. Things have slowed down now, but not because they’re following a judge’s orders. It’s slowed down because it’s been raining – and carwashes don’t open when it rains.

Clean was founded in 2007, which was a time when immigration enforcement was really ramping up – shortly after the creation of Homeland Security and ICE, but before the discretion policies the Obama administration implemented in 2011. How have the raids of the last few months compared with anything your organization has experienced since it was founded?

Andrea: This is a time that many of us, as organizers or as advocates, have never lived through. It’s a moment where you really are having to grapple with terror. It’s a terror that’s being inflicted on our communities.

It’s not just about financially people feeling stressed. It’s more of a psychological warfare. A sense of heightened insecurity, hyper-vigilance that people now have to live with. When we talk to workers after a raid happens, the trauma that is essentially stored in their body – many of them have shared: “I’m constantly looking over my shoulder. Every time I see an SUV or I see a particular vehicle or model, I’m constantly wondering, ‘Is this an agent?’”

That sense of just not feeling safe – not just in your own body, but the only place you feel a sense of safety is your home.

Our role when we started was really just to empower workers in the industry to learn about the rights they have here in California, and most importantly to help them exercise those rights. Right now, it’s beyond workers rights. We’re talking about their rights as human beings and their rights to be seen as a human being, and not to be hunted like animals. How do you restore the faith in someone’s humanity, when they are seriously feeling like: “I am being hunted, like an animal.”

Norma: When we realized that Trump had won the election, we knew that things were probably going to get a little scary. But in our wildest dreams, we would have never imagined that ICE or federal agents were going to be racially profiling and picking up anyone who looks brown or speaks Spanish or that they would target carwash workers.

I’m curious how you respond to all these threats that folks are facing.

Andrea: When we learned about Trump’s election, we took some time to check in with our membership, have conversations about people’s fears and concerns.

As time went on, we focused on preparing our community for attacks, and the ways in which we could continue to empower people to know their constitutional rights.

In retrospect, those things feel like they’re obsolete. Not because they’re not necessary, but it in this time and moment we’ve had to switch to just collaborating with people on the ground, community groups, legal organizations.

We have our mutual aid, which is access to food, but also access to financial assistance through our carwash worker solidarity fund. We also have created a legal fund. And through that legal fund, we’ve been able to help people access legal representation whenever someone is kidnapped from a carwash. And then lastly, the continued collaboration, the coalition of workers rights organizations who continue to elevate the crisis that is happening. We’ve partnered with NDLON, the National Day Labor Organizing Network – continuing to partner with the different organizations that are leading the fight to continue to protect our communities.

The people that are being targeted at carwashes are some of our most vulnerable community members. The carwash industry is comprised of predominately Latino males, but there’s also a lot of women in the industry. And some of them have been in the industry for decades. You’re not just talking about people who just got here last year. You’re talking about people that have been in our community for 30 years or more. There are senior citizens. Many of them have existing illnesses. Some of them are cancer survivors.

A lot of carwash workers have been detained since these operations began. What can you tell us about how their cases are playing out in immigration court so far?

Andrea: Our organization has been able to identify at least 346 carwash workers that have been kidnapped from a carwash. We’ve identified at least over 100 who were forced or coerced into signing a voluntary departure – which essentially means they didn’t even get a chance to fight their case. They were not given access to due process. These people are not the “worst of the worst”, their only crime was being at a carwash and coming to this country to seek a better life.

Norma: We know that there must be other workers we were never able to identify. We have a list of approximately 101 carwashes that have been raided. Some of these carwashes have been raided four or five times. And these federal agents before leaving, will say “we’ll be back”.

Andrea: Through our legal fund, we’ve been able to help some of those families fight against their deportation. We’ve been able to successfully get 20 carwash workers out on bond. All of them except one have been able to get bond through filing a habeas petition.

Others are still in detention. The administration’s changes have meant that the only way in which people are being granted bond at the moment is through the habeas corpus petition, and fighting that requires the help of another attorney. When a lot of our communities can barely afford an immigration attorney to represent their loved one in deportation proceedings, you can imagine just how inaccessible it is for people then to have to hire a separate attorney to have to file a lawsuit in federal court.

I think that has been the reason why so many people get coerced into signing, because they’re told: “You’re going to be in there forever – you’re going to be in there for six months or more.”

We’re really sad when we hear they signed, and if they’re from Mexico, sometimes if they’re detained on a Monday or on Tuesday they’ll already be in Tijuana. In a matter of 12 hours people’s lives can change.

Is it fair to say in the last 11 months Clean has come to almost fill that role of making sure that people don’t disappear into the detention system?

Andrea: That is our role. A lot of workers are here in the US on their own. If they don’t come home, they don’t have somebody waiting for them at home – they don’t even know that they disappeared.

What we’ve also found is that sometimes, because they are churchgoers, so they belong to a church community, their pastor or their church family, will be the ones in communication with Clean fighting for their liberation.

That is essentially what our role has become. But we’re also trying to find people before they disappear. Going out to carwashes, talking to employers, trying to let car washers know there’s a community that exists – that there’s a community that they should become a part of, so that whenever the worst happens, they know who to run to, they know who to call.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925d8205cdd39af3002ae9671fdefeb1a8a3eb77/465_0_4913_3930/master/4913.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f33d3f00034eed4608cc47452fcd61f1",N,,2025-12-02 09:59:20.430014

“For years, we have heard the phrase 'people should come the right way'. Yet, these actions make it clear that this administration does not want to establish legal pathways either,” said Tessa Petit, Executive Director at FLIC, in a statement on Monday.

“By shutting down asylum access, suspending immigration from developing nations, and restricting visas from regions whose populations are overwhelmingly Black and Brown, the administration is signaling that the issue is not process—it is people.”

The Coalition accused the administration of using the ""regrettable and tragic shooting of two National Guard members as a political weapon to justify extreme restrictions that have nothing to do with the facts of that incident.""

Since last week's shooting of two National Guard members in the nation’s capital by a suspect who is an Afghan national, the Trump administration announced a flurry of policies aimed at making it harder for some foreigners to enter or stay in the country.

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries ""of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment.

Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S.

Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5566ec8/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1140x599+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwlrn%2Ffiles%2F201908%2FImmigration_Public_Benefits_36353.jpg,N,,2025-12-02 10:59:52.416675

Most Louisiana agencies and local offices with 287(g) agreements are under the task force model.","As President Donald Trump's administration presses federal agencies to ramp up immigration enforcement across the country, dozens of state and local agencies in Louisiana have entered into agreements pledging to assist with operations in the state.

Immigration enforcement is expected to expand swiftly in Louisiana this week as the Border Patrol mounts an operation dubbed ""Swamp Sweep,"" and recent arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the greater New Orleans area are stoking fears across local immigrant communities.

ICE agents arrested four people on Wednesday outside the Westside South Shopping Center in Gretna, and videos shared to social media showed Gretna Police Department officers assisting agents in detaining people. Deputy Police Chief Jason DiMarco said his agency did not charge anyone involved with state or local laws.

The Gretna Police Department is one of many local agencies that have joined a growing Department of Homeland Security program, known as 287(g) agreements, which partners local law enforcement and ICE. Officers with the Kenner Police Department, who also have a 287(g) agreement, helped federal law enforcement last month with a raid at a Kenner boat launch that led to the arrests of 15 people.

The agreements allow ICE ""to partner with state and local law enforcement agencies to identify and remove criminal aliens who are amenable to removal from the U.S.,"" according to DHS. The program has long faced criticism over concerns about racial profiling and inadequate training for local police.

In May, Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry issued an executive order requiring the Louisiana State Police, the Department of Public Safety & Corrections, the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the State Fire Marshal and the Louisiana National Guard to join the 287(g) program.

The agreements are strictly with ICE and it is not yet clear if local or state agencies will assist the estimated 250 Border Patrol agents when they arrive. But state officials, including Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, have praised the plan and urged locals not to obstruct ICE or Border Patrol operations.

Types of agreements

The 287(g) program's existence dates back to 1996 when Congress approved the Immigration and Nationality Act. It has since been vastly expanded under Trump.

ICE has typically entered two kinds of deals with local law enforcement under 287(g) agreements: ""jail enforcement"" agreements, which allow deputized local officers to interrogate people about their immigration status once they're held in jail, and ""warrant service officer"" agreements, a creation of the first Trump administration under which local cops are trained and certified to execute immigration warrants.

Trump this year reinstated a third particularly controversial version of those agreements, the so-called ""task force model,"" which empowers local officers to conduct immigration enforcement during the course of their normal policing duties.

Most Louisiana agencies and local offices with 287(g) agreements are under the task force model.

“We were hurting, we were abandoned — and instead of help, we got soldiers with rifles,” one speaker told the crowd.
Standing near the edge of the crowd, 12-year-old Harry Masters said he came because many of his friends and community members are immigrants.
“They’re very important to the community, so it’s not good that they’re being forced out of their homes,” he said.
“The immigrants in our community are generally really helpful, good people, caring members of the community,” she said.","Several dozen people marched through downtown New Orleans on Monday evening, braving heavy rain to protest the expected deployment of about 250 Border Patrol agents to the city as part of “Operation Swamp Sweep.”

Chants of “The people united will never be defeated” and “No ICE, no fear — immigrants are welcome here” echoed off the buildings surrounding City Hall, where the crowd gathered after marching several blocks.

The federal immigration enforcement surge reportedly aims to arrest 5,000 people. Some news outlets reported the intended Dec. 1 start date did not come to pass. The protest, however, follows a raid last week in Gretna, where five people were arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers outside a Home Depot in what advocates say is a sign of more aggressive enforcement to come.

Among those addressing the crowd was Mitch Gonzalez, who told protesters that people close to them have already been detained and removed from the United States.

“This is my home,” Gonzalez said. “My trans sister was kidnapped and taken from me. Now she has to fight from Mexico, not even her home country, because they’re snatching people.”

Protesters emphasized that the raids and the presence of federal officers on city streets were instilling widespread fear, including among U.S. citizens and lawful residents. Others invoked the city’s history, drawing parallels to the military presence that followed Hurricane Katrina.

“We were hurting, we were abandoned — and instead of help, we got soldiers with rifles,” one speaker told the crowd. “Now again, they’re telling us the answer is more force, more surveillance. But we need housing, we need health care, we need real jobs — not soldiers.”

While many speakers were seasoned organizers, others were newer to demonstrations. Standing near the edge of the crowd, 12-year-old Harry Masters said he came because many of his friends and community members are immigrants.

“They’re very important to the community, so it’s not good that they’re being forced out of their homes,” he said.

He worried the raids would damage the city: “There’s no possible positive outcome.”

His mother, Diane Masters, said New Orleans doesn’t have an “immigrant crime problem” and described the federal tactics as unnecessary and harmful.

“The immigrants in our community are generally really helpful, good people, caring members of the community,” she said. “It’s not fair to be terrorizing people.”

Other longtime residents echoed that message. Kristen Dugas said she attended because New Orleans “was founded and built by Black and brown hands and immigrants.”

“Don’t come in our city that welcomes immigrants from the get-go and tell us we’re slamming doors in their faces,” she said. “No. Wrong.”

The protest was organized by New Orleans Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, with the support of groups including Freedom Road Socialist Organization, Indivisible NOLA, and Union Migrante, among others.

The White House referred questions on the travel ban to the Department of Homeland Security. A Department of Homeland Security spokesman said that the agency would “be announcing the list soon.” The State Department is the federal agency that typically sets entry requirements for immigrants and foreign travelers, but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

President Trump has ordered a sweeping new crackdown on immigration —

He’s also promising to expel millions of immigrants already here, revoking their legal status.

michael barbaro

— that has left almost no corner of the system untouched.

He claimed he’s ready to expel anyone who is, quote, not a net asset to the United States. And he threatened to end immigration from, quote, all third-world countries.

michael barbaro

Today, my colleague, Hamed Aleaziz, on the shooter’s journey to the United States and the Trump administration’s wide-ranging response.

[THEME MUSIC]

It’s Monday, December 1.

Hamed, we are turning to you because what began as a horrific shooting in downtown Washington last week has now become a set of far-reaching changes to the US immigration system, which you cover for “The Times.” Just how far reaching would you say these changes are?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, even for an administration that has rewritten all the rules on how to handle immigration, what we’ve seen in just the last couple days has been remarkable. They have blocked pathways for people to come to this country, to remain in the country, and at the same time are going back and reviewing the records of people who have already gained status in the United States. And I haven’t seen anything like this during my time covering immigration.

michael barbaro

That fallout, which we will discuss in detail in this conversation because it very much feels like a template for the future of immigration policy in the US, it feels like it very much hinges on the specific of who the shooter in this case was, where he came from, the circumstances of how he came into the US. So let’s talk about that.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, the shooter’s name is Rahmanullah Lakanwal. He grew up in Afghanistan during this time period in which the United States had invaded. In fact, he was only five years old when 9/11 happened. And, of course, we know that the United States came into Afghanistan shortly afterward. During that time, the United States relied heavily on local troops. And one of the key groups that was essential to the United States presence in Afghanistan was this group called Zero Unit.

michael barbaro

Zero Unit. What is that?

hamed aleaziz

They were basically a CIA-backed group that hunted Taliban members, were really highly trained, highly vetted by the US government. Essentially reported to the US government and went after key leaders in the Taliban power structure.

michael barbaro

Kind of the tip of the spear when it comes to the US government and military in Afghanistan.

hamed aleaziz

Exactly. And Mr. Lakanwal was a part of that group. He was recruited by the CIA to join this unit. And his brother was a key leader in the group as well. So as a family, they were really enmeshed in this organization that was essential to the United States’ ability to maintain security in Afghanistan.

But human rights organizations criticized the work of this Zero Unit group. They alleged that Zero Unit went further than was necessary, and they called them death squads. They were conducting extrajudicial killings, killing civilians. These are all allegations that were made during this time about this group.

michael barbaro

And how comfortable were people like Lakanwal, Afghans in carrying out this kind of alleged brutality against other Afghans?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, what we’ve learned is that Mr. Lakanwal specifically really struggled with the actions that his group undertook in Afghanistan. And he expressed this to a friend in Afghanistan who actually spoke with one of our colleagues. And this friend said that Mr. Lakanwal was going through some mental health issues.

And really, in his telling, this was clearly somebody who was traumatized from his experience as a part of Zero Unit. But despite that, he remained in this unit up until the Taliban took over the country in 2021.

michael barbaro

Well, bring us to that very dramatic moment. What happens to Lakanwal when the US announces it’s going to withdraw, which, as we all remember, then brings the Taliban through the country toward Kabul, the Afghan military collapses in days, and the US military flees in what I think we can all agree is a kind of chaotic and somewhat humiliating withdrawal.

hamed aleaziz

For Lakanwal and other Afghans who closely helped the United States government, suddenly, they become targets for the Taliban. And there’s this incredible pressure on the Biden administration to not leave behind those people who risked their lives in protecting the United States government.

michael barbaro

Essentially, they are traitors to the now re-empowered Taliban.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah. And Mr. Lakanwal, along with other members of the Zero Unit, were among the first people to flee Afghanistan and be brought by the United States government to America for protection.

michael barbaro

So he’s brought to the United States by the Biden administration. What are his circumstances like? And what kind of vetting process occurs before he even gets to the US?

hamed aleaziz

So he comes to the United States as part of a program called Operation Allies Welcome. And as part of this program, the Biden administration set up layers of vetting. They collected biometrics from these people, and they ran their information through US databases for any potential terrorism hits, criminal hits, any potentially derogatory information. And then when these individuals came to the United States, the Department of Homeland Security conducted another layer of vetting by Customs and Border Protection officers at the airports.

michael barbaro

So pretty rigorous.

hamed aleaziz

Pretty rigorous. But at the same time, I think it’s important to note that the agency’s inspector general found that the Biden administration had allowed two people who were potential national security threats to enter the country despite that vetting. This was a really hurried process. This wasn’t something that was planned years in the making, months in the making. So there were clear issues with this program.

And Mr. Lakanwal comes really quickly as one of the first groups of people to arrive in the United States as part of this program in September 2021. He settles down in Bellingham, Washington, a town that’s near the Canadian border. And he’s trying to find jobs there. He’s a delivery driver.

He’s staying with his wife and five children in a apartment complex that is a place where people who are down on their luck are trying to rebuild their lives. But despite these kind of challenging circumstances for him, in April, during the Trump administration, he gains asylum.

michael barbaro

So he enters the US under the Biden administration, but he is officially granted asylum under the Trump administration.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, the Biden administration brought these people over from Afghanistan under a power known as parole. This is a temporary status that only lasts a few years. It did not provide these Afghans with a chance to stay in the country permanently. That was on Afghans individually in the country to figure out a way to stay here.

michael barbaro

And in this case, he figured it out.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, this was clearly good news for him to get asylum, to have a chance to remain in the United States, to gain a green card, to gain US citizenship. He was on that pathway. But the next thing we know is that he decides to drive from Bellingham, Washington, all across the country to Washington, DC, where he finds himself in the downtown of the city, about a block or two from the White House.

This is an area that has a lot of people going through it. And there are restaurants and coffee shops. And he is walking on the sidewalk near a bus stop, where he comes across two National Guard members from West Virginia, Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old, and Andrew Wolfe, a 24-year-old. And Mr. Lakanwal decides to pull out his gun and shoot both of them multiple times.

As part of that gunfire, he himself takes on shots, and he is down on the ground. These shots were heard by colleagues here at “The New York Times.” Our bureau is very close to the site of this shooting. And just a day later, we found out that one of the guard members, Ms. Beckstrom, had died from her gunshot wounds.

michael barbaro

And suddenly, all of these dramas are colliding. The war in Afghanistan, which Trump loathed as a forever war, and his use of National Guard across American cities, it’s all colliding. And it’s a very strange moment.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, definitely. And you can see how, for President Trump, this is something that he personally is tied to.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

And for him, I think it really confirms a lot of the claims that he’s made in the past, a lot of his worst fears that an immigrant from a far-flung country would come here and shoot two US military members near the White House. And I think that’s really reason for him, in his mind and his advisors’ mind, to undertake a crackdown on the immigration system that’s unlike anything that we’ve seen this year.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

We’ll be right back.

So, Hamed, describe what happens to the immigration system in the days since this shooting and how the Trump administration has explained those actions.

hamed aleaziz

In the telling of top Trump administration officials —

archived recording (jeanine pirro)

A 29-year-old Afghan who entered the United States under Biden’s Operation Allies Welcome, a program following the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. This is what happens —

hamed aleaziz

— including US Attorney Jeanine Pirro —

archived recording (kash patel)

This individual is in this country for one reason and one reason alone, the failure to vet in any way, shape, or form this individual and countless others.

hamed aleaziz

— the FBI director, Kash Patel —

archived recording (donald trump)

He was flown in by the Biden administration in September 2021 on those infamous flights that everybody was talking about. Nobody knew who was coming in. Nobody knew anything about it. His status was —

hamed aleaziz

— and President Trump himself, this shooting was the result of a series of Biden administration failures, not only in the way that they ended the war, which President Trump has often criticized, but in the way that they let these Afghans, including Mr. Lakanwal, into the country without, in their words, the necessary vetting.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

Does the White House point to anything specific as they’re critiquing the vetting process? Because, of course, as you told us a little bit earlier in this conversation, it’s the Trump administration that grants that final asylum.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, no, there’s nothing specifically that they’re pointing to. And when President Trump was asked about this idea that they granted this man asylum during his administration in April, he wouldn’t engage with that answer. And again, he returned to this idea that Biden brought him. And once people are brought to this country, there’s not much that they can do. That’s essentially what he said.

michael barbaro

Understood. So let’s now turn to the crackdown that Trump has undertaken to the immigration system over the past few days and really understand the details of it.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, basically, in a matter of days, the Trump administration takes a series of actions that have just massive implications. At first, the Department of Homeland Security announces a pause on all immigration applications filed by Afghan immigrants. So for Afghans in the United States, this means a pause on their ability to seek a green card, US citizenship. For them, their ability to stay in this country long term is now on hold.

michael barbaro

All that’s just being shut down. Temporarily, perhaps, but shut down.

hamed aleaziz

Yes, exactly. And they build on that. They say they will review all asylum applications that were granted during the Biden administration. They’re going —

michael barbaro

No matter which country the asylum seeker’s from.

hamed aleaziz

All of it. They’re going to go back and look at those applications and figure out if there were any issues with those grants. And again, building on this idea that the Biden administration, in their words, did not do enough vetting.

michael barbaro

So suddenly, we’re now talking about a pause not just in those seeking asylum from Afghanistan, but potentially thousands or tens of thousands of people seeking asylum from any country in the world.

hamed aleaziz

Exactly. So they’re going back to look at those records. And they take it even a step further. They decide that, actually, we’re going to review all green card holders from countries that President Trump already banned from travel to the United States. These were countries like Iran, Eritrea, Sudan, and others. So people who are already in the United States who’ve gone through a lot of process now have their applications under review.

michael barbaro

In a sense, this is a retrospective look back at those who have, in some cases, already been granted their green cards. They’re basically saying the old system is suspect, so we will reopen your green card.

hamed aleaziz

There is definitely that potential. They’re going to go back and look at potentially hundreds of thousands of records.

michael barbaro

Wow.

hamed aleaziz

A massive review. We don’t how this is going to take shape and how they’re going to do this, but they’ve announced that they will do this. And then on Friday, after they’d already announced that they were going to review all the people that had gotten asylum between 2021 and 2024, but now people already in the United States trying to gain asylum in the process, those applications are now on hold as well, really going after the entire asylum system.

And on that same day, the State Department announces that there will be no more visas for Afghan nationals, cutting off another way for Afghans to enter the United States. And, in fact, a State Department cable that we obtained detailed how Afghan nationals who already had their visas granted and printed and were going to be dispersed to those Afghans, those needed to be destroyed.

michael barbaro

Wow.

So they’re taking every step possible to target Afghans, not only in America, but abroad.

michael barbaro

And not just from what you said, Afghans, but really anyone seeking asylum or a green card. In a very real sense, it feels like the entire system of giving foreigners refuge in the US for political or economic circumstances is on pause.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, what’s really remarkable here is this idea that, yes, we’re going to pause a bunch of people from entering the United States. But we’re also going to go back, and we’re going to review people who’ve already obtained a form of status in the United States. We’re going to go back and look at those records as well. So it’s not only prospective, but it’s retrospective as well.

michael barbaro

Does this administration have the legal power to do everything you’re describing because it is so sweeping and so retrospective?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, these will undoubtedly lead to legal challenges, especially this idea of going back. These are people who have gone through layers of vetting, layers of interviews, extensive interaction with the US government that if they take action on those people, that will lead to, I think, legal action across the United States.

michael barbaro

So we’re going to have to wait and see how this plays out in our legal system. I want to return for just a moment to Afghanistan because as broad as some of these potential changes to our immigration system are, what stands out to me is what these changes will mean for the future of that promise that the US made to Afghans who helped America in the war.

And in the case of Lakanwal, yes, the promise was kept. But it’s clear from Trump’s actions that the promise won’t be kept for anyone else from Afghanistan in the future. And there’s a very revealing exchange about this on social media over the past couple of days that I want to discuss with you. It begins with an editorial from “The Wall Street Journal,” which is a very conservative editorial board. And I’m going to read you what they wrote in this editorial.

hamed aleaziz

OK.

michael barbaro

Quote, “Some will say that the shooting in downtown Washington means that the United States should never admit refugees like Lakanwal. But the alternative is abandoning allies who assist Americans in war.” And the editorial goes on to say, “You can be sure Americans will fight overseas again, and our troops will need allies on the ground to succeed.

How many,” the editorial asks, “will assist the US if they believe that there will be no exit for them?” Basically, this editorial asks, what happens when the US just leaves people behind on the battlefield?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, and one person who reads this editorial and disagrees with it strongly is the chief of President Trump’s immigration crackdown, Stephen Miller. He went online on social media and said, quote, “This is the great lie of mass migration. You are not just importing individuals. You are importing societies. No magic transformation occurs when failed states cross borders. At scale, migrants and their descendants recreate the conditions and terrors of their broken homelands.”

michael barbaro

Will you just translate that?

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, I think what’s remarkable about this tweet is that Miller is not only turning to the immigrants themselves who arrive in the United States, but he’s saying that their children are a threat as well.

michael barbaro

Right. And I think it’s worth saying just how much the “Wall Street Journal” editorial and Stephen Miller’s statements completely talk past each other because the editorial is saying that American credibility and the future of our foreign policy requires us to keep our commitments to those who risk their lives for the US, that it’s foundational to our ability to function in the world.

Miller’s statement completely bypasses that and says broken people from broken societies are just an existential danger to the US. Therefore, we can’t let them in. But what Miller’s argument doesn’t grapple with at all is the reality that America played a part, and a pretty big part, in breaking Afghanistan in the first place.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, for Miller, that’s besides the point. It’s not about what America owes people and countries. It’s about who’s good for the United States and who’s not good. People who are from countries that he has deemed to be failed societies do not deserve the opportunity to come to America.

michael barbaro

Right. It’s kind of an open embrace of collective punishment because, in Lakanwal, we clearly have someone who, and we don’t quite understand the mechanics of it, but becomes, at some point in his life, radicalized. But he’s just one of thousands, if not tens of thousands of Afghans who the US previously made a commitment to to protect and bring to the US. And Trump and Stephen Miller are now saying because one of them did this thing, none of them can come to the US.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, exactly. I think that’s right. But I also just want to point out this idea that you’re mentioning, collective punishment. These Afghans who helped the American military have been supported by veterans. I’ve spoken with veterans who have personally tried to bring those people who helped them translators and others to the United States, bring them to safety.

The plot point of this idea of Afghans helping American military members has been in movies and shows. And for now, this idea of helping Afghans who helped the American military in Afghanistan, that’s over.

michael barbaro

Just to end, Hamed, I don’t want to entirely lose sight of the National Guard and its place in this story. The second guardsman who was shot remains in critical condition in the hospital. And this deployment of the National Guard in Washington remains a source of really profound controversy.

hamed aleaziz

Yeah, this idea of bringing the federal forces to the city was really opposed by a lot of citizens in Washington, DC.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

But in the days since the shooting, President Trump has announced that he was planning to send 500 more National Guard members to Washington, DC. So now this deployment, far from shrinking because of this shooting, is now going to expand because of it.

michael barbaro

Well, Hamed, thank you very much. We appreciate it.

hamed aleaziz

Thank you for having me. [MUSIC PLAYING]

michael barbaro

On Sunday, the Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, told NBC News that the alleged shooter may not have become radicalized until after he immigrated to the United States. That conclusion, if true, could undermine the Trump administration’s claims that the Biden administration had failed to properly vet him before he arrived into the country. We’ll be right back.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Here’s what else you need to know today. Over the past few days, President Trump has carried out a series of profoundly contradictory actions in his war against drug cartels. Trump declared in a post on social media that the airspace above and around Venezuela, which he has accused of flooding the US with drugs, should now be considered closed. It was his latest threat against the regime of Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro.

But at the same time, Trump announced a full pardon of a former president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernandez, who has been convicted in US federal court of conspiring with local drug cartels to bring vast amounts of cocaine into the United States.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, members of Congress from both parties said that the Trump administration may have committed a war crime in its offensive against boats allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean. According to “The Washington Post,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a verbal order to kill everyone aboard such boats, leading a US military commander to carry out a second strike to kill those who had survived an initial airstrike back in September.

Do you believe if there was a second strike to eliminate any survivors that that constitutes a war crime?

archived recording 2

It seems to. If what has been reported is accurate, I’ve got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over. Going after survivors in the water, that is clearly not lawful.

michael barbaro

Both Democratic Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN and Republican Representative Mike Turner of Ohio on CBS said that such a second strike would violate the rules of war.

archived recording (mike turner)

Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious. And I agree that that would be an illegal act.

michael barbaro

Turner said that the post reporting on the second strike would become the focus of an existing congressional investigation into the airstrikes on the boats.

It came after an immigration judge who was fired by the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, alleging she is a victim of unlawful discrimination.
The former Cleveland judge is among the more than 100 immigration judges who have been fired or resigned through the Department of Government Efficiency's ""Fork in the Road"" offer, or transferred out of immigration adjudication, according to the union representing immigration judges.
Immigrant advocates have called out the Trump administration for dismissing immigration judges who have experience in immigration law.
The former immigration judge is asking a court in D.C. for a ""declaration that the government violated her rights; reinstatement; and compensatory damages.""","The Trump administration fired eight immigration judges on Monday, according to an official with the National Association of Immigration Judges.

The judges who were dismissed worked at 26 Federal Plaza.

It came after an immigration judge who was fired by the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against the Department of Justice, alleging she is a victim of unlawful discrimination.

Tania Nemer, a former immigration judge in Ohio, filed a lawsuit Monday claiming she was dismissed based on her gender, her dual citizenship with the country of Lebanon, and her previous run for local office as a Democrat, in violation of civil rights law.

Nemer was ""abruptly fired"" in the middle of her probationary period despite receiving ""the highest possible performance,"" the lawsuit alleges.

Mass exodus of immigration officials could delay millions of deportations

""The lightning-fast, precipitous timing indicates that the incoming Administration's decision was made -- not as part of a careful evaluation of Ms. Nemer's qualifications or fitness for office -- but instead as part of a rushed attempt by the new Administration to target disfavored civil servants,"" the complaint states.

The former Cleveland judge is among the more than 100 immigration judges who have been fired or resigned through the Department of Government Efficiency's ""Fork in the Road"" offer, or transferred out of immigration adjudication, according to the union representing immigration judges.

The latest firings also come as the Department of Homeland Security is actively hiring ""deportation judges.""

In a post on X last week, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the jobs offer potential full-time remote work with salaries ranging from $159,951 to $207,500.

Immigrant advocates have called out the Trump administration for dismissing immigration judges who have experience in immigration law. There is also a backlog of more than 3.7 million immigration cases.

Nemer's attorneys said in the filing that she was escorted out of court at the time of her dismissal, and that Nemer's supervisor and the acting chief immigration judge both said they did not know why she was being fired.

""And to this day, the government has failed to offer any coherent and legitimate nondiscriminatory rationale for her termination,"" the lawyers wrote.

Shortly after she was fired, Nemer filed a formal discrimination complaint with an Equal Employment Opportunity office, which dismissed the case.

""The EEO office issued a final agency decision that dismissed Ms. Nemer's complaint and asserted that Title VII does not constrain discriminatory dismissal against immigration judges because the statute purportedly conflicts with the Article II removal power,"" according to the complaint.

""That is simply not true,"" her attorneys said in the complaint. ""Nothing in the Constitution gives the executive branch the right to discriminate.""

The lawyers called the DOJ's position that it can fire federal employees without a reason -- despite civil rights statutes -- a ""breathtaking assault on a landmark federal statute.""

According to the complaint, a DOJ official submitted an affidavit that detailed driving infractions involving Nemer, as well as two local tax cases from 2010 and 2011, which the former immigration judge alleged in the complaint that she had disclosed as part of a background check to become an immigration judge.

Nemer's attorneys said in the complaint that the DOJ official ""created the misleading impression that the prior infractions were somehow connected to Nemer's termination.""

The former immigration judge is asking a court in D.C. for a ""declaration that the government violated her rights; reinstatement; and compensatory damages.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oXj9Ch_ShtwwRX26xXusPg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/us.abcnews.go.com/4c19f1ef27cca818cd1132cd6a55ef88,N,,2025-12-02 09:59:09.645153

But it ends one of two lawsuits accusing Tarrant County of illegal racial gerrymandering.

It’s not clear from court filings why the group that filed the case, titled Jackson et. al. v. Tarrant County, decided to drop it. But it ends one of two lawsuits accusing Tarrant County of illegal racial gerrymandering.

KERA News has reached out to attorneys on both sides for comment.

In an emailed statement, Republican County Judge Tim O’Hare welcomed the news.

“The Commissioners Court’s action to redistrict was constitutional from the outset and remains so,” he said. “With today’s legal development, Tarrant County will continue to stand as the best place to live and run a business in America.”

Earlier this year, O’Hare and Tarrant County’s Republican commissioners pushed ahead with an unusual mid-decade redistricting effort, redrawing the precinct lines in their own favor. Opponents countered with two lawsuits, accusing the Republicans of creating a new right-leaning seat by shoving a disproportionate amount of Black and brown residents into one precinct.

In both cases, judges allowed the map to go into effect.

In October, federal appeals court judges evaluating the Jackson case acknowledged the new map disproportionately affects Black and Latino voters. But they decided the complainants failed to prove commissioners had anything but partisan intentions.

“An obvious explanation for the disparity exists: race and partisanship are highly correlated in Tarrant County, and districting decisions driven by partisanship will often have disparate racial effects,” their ruling read.

The second lawsuit over the county’s redistricting, brought by the League of Women Voters of Tarrant County and the League of United Latin American Citizens of Fort Worth, is still pending in a county district court, online records show.

The Jackson case’s withdrawal was “highly predictable,” Republican County Commissioner Matt Krause wrote in a Facebook post.

“This Democrat law firm wasted taxpayer funds by filing such an obviously meritless lawsuit. Maybe they should refund the taxpayers for having to defend it?” he wrote, adding a smiley face emoji.

A court battle over Texas’ new congressional maps, also redrawn to favor Republicans, is underway.

The U.S. Supreme Court temporarily restored the new map after a lower court ruled it was racially gerrymandered. It remains unclear which map will be in effect for next year’s midterm elections.

I'm Native American.
They can also use people speaking Spanish, accented English, and working certain physical labor jobs to guess if someone is in the country without legal status.
Gabe Galanda, a Native American civil rights attorney, refers to what Miles experienced as “racialized profiling.” “They are being profiled based upon their skin color and their phenotype,” he said.
“This is reality,” said Miles, now worried about her in-laws and her extended family who come from Mexico and have mixed immigration status.","Amid the increase of reports of ICE arrests in the cities surrounding Seattle over the past weeks, a member of a federally recognized tribe says she was also stopped and interrogated by apparent immigration officials.

Elaine Miles is an actress best known for her role in the TV series “Northern Exposure” and, more recently, in an episode of HBO's “The Last of Us.” Miles is a member of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation near Pendleton, Oregon.

She was waiting for a bus in Redmond on Nov. 3, on the same day ICE arrested three people at a nearby shopping mall. Miles said she was also briefly stopped and questioned about her legal status.

Miles says a man ran up to her and started talking to her. She then noticed he had a hand on his gun.

“And I was looking at him, like, ‘What? What did I do?’” Miles said. “And then he's like, are you Mexican? And I go, ‘No, I'm not. I'm Native American. You want to see my tribal ID?’”

Redmond police did confirm ICE made the arrests at that location, including smashing a man's window to pull him out of a car.

Earlier this year, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation posted a statement on its social media, urging its members to keep their tribal membership cards on them “at all times, especially in PUBLIC,” for circumstances just like this. She said the officer who stopped her initially didn’t believe her tribal membership.

“Then these other men come up,” she said. “And it's scary when they run up on you. It's like, 'what did I do?'”

ICE did not respond to questions about why Miles was stopped, but U.S. immigration law gives agents authority to stop and question people in cases where they have ""reasonable suspicion"" about an individual’s legal status.

The factors ICE can use to make that determination have recently become the subject of ongoing lawsuits.

In Los Angeles, a U.S. Supreme Court ruling has temporarily allowed immigration enforcement agents operating in that city to use race as one of the reasons for a stop. They can also use people speaking Spanish, accented English, and working certain physical labor jobs to guess if someone is in the country without legal status.

While the legal challenges continue, the ruling in L.A. raises questions about how broadly federal immigration enforcement will be able to use this approach.

Gabe Galanda, a Native American civil rights attorney, refers to what Miles experienced as “racialized profiling.”

“They are being profiled based upon their skin color and their phenotype,” he said. “It's hard to make sense of any of it, but it's particularly hard to make sense of the federal government going after the original peoples of these lands under [the] guise of immigration enforcement.”

Earlier this month, a woman from Arizona’s Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community had an ICE detainer placed on her after serving a monthlong jail sentence in Iowa for driving without a license. It was only when her family brought her birth certificate to the jail that she was let go. The local county sheriff's office in Iowa said it was a human error and she was confused for another detainee with a similar name.

Miles has worked in the film and entertainment industry for decades.

Sponsored

At the beginning of this year, Miles and other co-workers were in New Mexico working on the set of a film where members of the nearby Mescalero Apache Tribe were questioned by ICE. It was a cause for concern, and all tribal members were urged to carry their membership cards.

Days after she was stopped, Miles said her son was also questioned by immigration enforcement at a higher education institution in Bellevue, but they didn’t question his tribal membership like they did for her.

To legal expert Galanda, it’s alarming.

“You should not have the original peoples of this country … for a second feeling uncomfortable about their own sense [of belonging] in this country,” he said. “They belong here more than anybody else in this country.”

The recent mass roundups of immigrant populations reminds Miles of when the U.S. government forcibly removed Japanese Americans from their homes and into internment camps. Miles’ grandmother had Japanese American friends who were taken to the prison camps back then.

Sponsored

“Sometimes they come back,” Miles recalls her grandma saying, “sometimes they didn't come back.”

Miles also remembers her grandma warning her it would happen again. “You can't trust these people,” Miles’ grandmother said. “They're too busy wanting only their country when we were here to begin with.”

Miles points to reports of the federal government planning to use bounty hunters and says it echoes a history of when Native Americans also had bounties placed on them.

Much of the recent messaging from the Department of Homeland Security’s social media appeals to nostalgia, sometimes centralized around white characters. One post titled “A Heritage to be Proud of A Homeland Worth Defending,” shows the painting of American Progress by John Ghast, an allegory to Manifest Destiny. That’s the belief that European American settlers were entitled to expand and control what is now the United States, while pushing others — in the painting's case, Native Americans — out. It and other propaganda shared by the Department of Homeland Security have been repurposed to reinvigorate support for mass immigrant deportation efforts.

The administration said it was pausing asylum decisions, reexamining green card applications for people from countries ""of concern” and halting visas for Afghans who assisted the U.S. war effort.

Days before the shooting, a memo obtained by The Associated Press said the administration would review the cases of all refugees who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration.

The stepped up effort to restrict immigration has been harshly criticized by refugee advocates and those who work with Afghans, saying it amounts to collective punishment. Critics are also saying it is a waste of government resources to reopen cases that have already been processed.

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

Here's a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week:

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they're granted asylum, they're allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Justice Department.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn't trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump's January order didn't affect those cases, Edlow's social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency's pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. USCIS said there are currently 1.4 million pending asylum cases at the agency. Just a few years ago, in 2022, it was 241,280, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics. Separately there are about 2.4 million pending asylum applications in front of the Justice Department's immigration courts.

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others.

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That's nearly 200,000 refugees.

Advocates say refugees already undergo rigorous vetting.

Late Monday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem suggested in a post on X that more changes could be in the offing.

Noting that she had just met with Trump, Noem said she was recommending a “full travel ban” on countries she said were flooding the U.S. “with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”

Noem did not specifically name any countries and no timeline was given. The Department of Homeland Security said in an email Monday, “We will be announcing the list soon.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/14682690-15b5-4903-8293-804cec218adc/wirestory_710973fb9bce4a83a9d979852865cdab_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-12-02 05:57:29.618394

They were confirmed by an official at the National Association of Immigration Judges, a union representing immigration judges, and a Justice Department official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
The eight judges included Amiena A. Khan, the assistant chief immigration judge at 26 Federal Plaza, who supervises other judges there.
Before Monday, about 90 immigration judges had been fired this year across the United States, including six in New York City.
But immigration judges who were fired earlier this year suggested that the administration was targeting judges who were considered too lenient and was also trying to create a feeling of fear.","The Trump administration fired eight immigration judges in New York City on Monday, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

The firings followed an earlier round of job cuts in New York immigration courts and are part of a broader disruption across the country, which is taking place as the president seeks to accelerate deportations.

They were confirmed by an official at the National Association of Immigration Judges, a union representing immigration judges, and a Justice Department official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. The immigration courts are under the control of the Justice Department.

All the judges were dismissed from the immigration court’s offices at 26 Federal Plaza, a building that houses the New York City headquarters for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and has become the epicenter of migrant arrests in the city. The eight judges included Amiena A. Khan, the assistant chief immigration judge at 26 Federal Plaza, who supervises other judges there.

Before Monday, about 90 immigration judges had been fired this year across the United States, including six in New York City. There are about 600 immigration judges nationwide, according to federal officials. Union officials said that 36 of the fired judges had been replaced nationwide, including two in New York.

Monday’s firings represented a significant downsizing of staff at 26 Federal Plaza, which employs 34 immigration justices. It is one of three federal immigration courts in the city.

“The court has been basically eviscerated,” said Olivia Cassin, who was fired from her job as an immigration judge at another New York City courthouse in November. Ms. Cassin said that she had the job for more than a decade. “It feels like a Monday afternoon massacre.”

A spokeswoman for the Executive Office for Immigration Review, a division of the Justice Department that oversees immigration judges, declined to answer questions about the dismissals, including their cause.

But immigration judges who were fired earlier this year suggested that the administration was targeting judges who were considered too lenient and was also trying to create a feeling of fear.

“All of the judges are now sitting speculating about whether they’re next, and the impact that that may have in their ability to remain impartial and do their jobs fairly,” said Carmen Maria Rey Caldas, who was fired from her job as an immigration judge in August after receiving an email from the Justice Department.

Ms. Rey Caldas is a Spanish immigrant who arrived in the country at age 11 and later became a naturalized citizen. Before becoming an immigration judge in 2022, she had worked as an advocate, drawing criticism from Republicans in 2022 for criticizing ICE during President Trump’s first term.

Monday’s firings occurred two days after nearly 200 protesters gathered in Lower Manhattan to thwart a possible ICE raid, drawing the ire of federal officials. The Trump administration has vowed to ramp up deportation efforts in New York, and officials have frequently criticized its so-called sanctuary policies, which prevent local law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration authorities on most matters.

Mr. Trump’s threats against immigrants have intensified since two National Guard members were shot near the White House by a gunman who was identified by the authorities as an Afghan national. In two Truth Social posts, the president wrote that he would stop migration from “all Third World Countries” to enable “the U.S. system to fully recover.”

The courtrooms and holding cells at 26 Federal Plaza have emerged as a symbol of Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown in New York City. For months, scenes of chaos have unfolded as masked federal agents have arrested people showing up for routine check-ins, often drawing protests from onlookers and loved ones. In September, a video journalist was injured during a tumultuous moment involving federal agents outside a courtroom, less than a week after another officer was captured on video shoving a woman in a confrontation.

“The judges who were fired acted as judges — upheld the rule of law, gave equal time to each side, considered the cases carefully and did their jobs as independent adjudicators — for a very long time,” Ms. Cassin said. “It doesn’t make sense.”

Thai authorities extradited Bdap, 33, on November 28, 2025, two days after Thailand’s Court of Appeal upheld a criminal court’s 2024 ruling that he could be sent back to Vietnam. Thai immigration police initially arrested Bdap on immigration charges in Bangkok in 2024, after Vietnamese authorities requested his extradition. Bdap had been living in Thailand since 2018 and had been recognized as a refugee by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees; his deportation violates the principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning people to places where they are likely to face persecution.

“The Thai government has blatantly violated the country’s anti-torture law and its international legal obligations by returning Y Quynh Bdap to Vietnam, where he faces a prison sentence after an unfair trial and the risk of torture,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Thai government’s willingness to assist Vietnam in repressing human rights activists is appalling.”

The Vietnamese government persecuted Bdap for years, Human Rights Watch said. Vietnamese state media have accused him of being from a family with “a tradition” of opposing the Vietnamese Communist Party and accused his grandfather of being “a henchman” for the United States during the Vietnam War. His father was imprisoned for three years for “inciting” a public protest.

In 2016, Bdap traveled to Thailand for a conference on religious freedom. When he returned to Vietnam, the Vietnamese police detained him for seven days and interrogated him about his trip. He was subsequently placed under intrusive surveillance, leading him to flee to Bangkok in 2018.

While in Thailand, Bdap founded the Montagnards Stand for Justice, which sought to protect and promote the right to freedom of religion and other rights of Montagnards in Vietnam’s Central Highlands. An Indigenous minority, Montagnards have faced political persecution, forced repudiation of their religious beliefs, shuttering of Christian house churches, and constant monitoring and surveillance by Vietnam security forces.

In June 2023, after an outbreak of violence in Dak Lak province in the Central Highlands, authorities arrested scores of Montagnards and criminally charged them and several others in exile, including Bdap, with “terrorism” and other crimes. During a short mass trial by a “mobile court” in January 2024 involving about 100 defendants, Bdap was convicted in absentia and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

In early March 2024, the Vietnamese government, without providing tangible evidence, labeled the Montagnards Stand for Justice and the Montagnard Support Group as “terrorist” organizations linked to the Dak Lak violence and other anti-state criminal activity.

Days later, Vietnamese police traveled to Thailand and visited two neighborhoods near Bangkok with populations of Montagnard asylum seekers and refugees, questioning dozens about Bdap’s whereabouts, intimidating several with accusations of illegally departing Vietnam, and urging them to return to Vietnam or face criminal charges and extradition.

Thai police then arrested Bdap in June on the basis of an extradition request by Vietnamese authorities. He had been in prison during his extradition trial and appeal, up until his forced return to Vietnam on November 28.

In a November 2025 report, Human Rights Watch documented how Vietnam has increasingly engaged in transnational repression in Thailand, targeting especially exiled ethnic minorities with harassment and intimidation. Thai authorities have increasingly participated in these abuses by cooperating with Vietnamese authorities and allowing Vietnamese police to interrogate asylum seekers and refugees. Exiles and immigration lawyers believe the Vietnam government presses Thailand to keep some exiles in immigration detention indefinitely, by denying them bail, to pressure them to cooperate with Vietnamese police.

UN human rights experts have criticized the misuse of terrorism charges in the 2023 mass trial of Montagnards in Vietnam and the reported use of evidence obtained by torture, and have said that targeting Bdap for his association with the Montagnards Stand For Justice is part of the intensifying discrimination and repression against the Montagnard population. Human Rights Watch has no information about Bdap’s involvement in the 2023 violence in Dak Lak but considers his trial in Vietnam unfair and is gravely concerned about his safety following his extradition to Vietnam.

Vietnamese authorities have not yet confirmed that they have Bdap in their custody.

Concerned foreign governments should strongly press the Vietnamese government to disclose his whereabouts and request access to him given the high risk of torture and other ill-treatment.

Bdap’s extradition violates Thailand’s Prevention and Suppression of Torture and Enforced Disappearance Act, which prohibits extradition when there is a substantial risk of torture or ill-treatment upon return.

Thailand is also obligated to respect the international law principle of nonrefoulement, which prohibits countries from returning anyone to a place where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other serious ill-treatment, or a threat to their life. This principle is codified in the Convention Against Torture, to which Thailand is a party, and customary international law.

“The Bdap case demonstrates the Thai government’s unwillingness to respect international law and protect foreign human rights advocates who live in Thailand,” Pearson said. “Concerned governments should expedite resettlement of Vietnamese and other nationals at risk in Thailand to places where they will be safe.”",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2024/06/202406asia_thailand_Y-Quynh-Bdap.jpg?h=6189ac6c&itok=tkNuIxBD,N,,2025-12-01 20:57:59.353318

For months, Mr. Duffy has been threatening consequences for centers that enable drivers without proper qualifications and authorization to get commercial licenses.
Since then, the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted the arrests of dozens of cases of undocumented immigrants working as truck drivers.
“If you are unwilling to follow the rules, you have no place training America’s commercial drivers,” F.M.C.S.A.
He added that the Trump administration had “sent the right message” and that centers who were “issuing certificates to anyone who can fog a mirror” were “on notice.”","The Trump administration has revoked the accreditation of thousands of training centers that helped people obtain commercial driver’s licenses and threatened thousands more, senior administration officials announced on Monday, amid a widening campaign against noncitizen truck drivers.

According to an announcement from the Department of Transportation, nearly 3,000 of the estimated 16,000 training providers listed in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration’s Training Provider Registry have been removed “for failing to equip trainees with the Trump Administration’s standards of readiness.” The announcement said that another 4,000 had been warned that they would be removed for “noncompliance” with the standards within 30 days, unless they could prove otherwise. That could mean that more than 40 percent of U.S. training facilities would no longer be able to credential drivers.

“Under President Trump, we are reigning in illegal and reckless practices that let poorly trained drivers get behind the wheel of semi-trucks and school buses,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a statement accompanying the announcement.

For months, Mr. Duffy has been threatening consequences for centers that enable drivers without proper qualifications and authorization to get commercial licenses. To date, his warnings have focused largely on immigrant drivers and states that allow those without authorization to be in the United States to legally get behind the wheel of a truck.

The Trump administration began to raise alarms about illegal immigration in trucking after an August crash in Florida, in which an immigrant accused of being in the country without authorization made an illegal U-turn, causing a crash that killed three people.

Since then, the Department of Homeland Security has highlighted the arrests of dozens of cases of undocumented immigrants working as truck drivers. The Transportation Department in September issued emergency orders to make it more difficult for many noncitizens to obtain commercial driver’s licenses and threatened to withhold federal funding from states that failed to enforce new English-language proficiency standards for truckers or failed to revoke the licenses of drivers working in the United States without authorization.

According to a recent report by the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, an advocacy group headquartered in Arlington, Va., the changes could result in nearly 200,000 people losing their commercial driver’s licenses — among them “refugees, asylees, humanitarian parolees and DACA recipients” — worsening what some report is an already severe shortage of truckers.

Mr. Duffy and some industry experts have pushed back on the idea that there is any lack of willing American truckers. Mr. Duffy has insisted that the national shortage of truck drivers, which was widely noted during the pandemic, stemmed from falling wages due to competition from drivers without proper credentials.

Monday’s announcement made no direct references to immigration status for drivers, legal or otherwise. The training facilities facing removal had been targeted, according to the Transportation Department, because they had either falsified or manipulated training data, neglected to meet curriculum standards or instructor qualifications or failed to maintain and provide complete documentation during audits.

“If you are unwilling to follow the rules, you have no place training America’s commercial drivers,” F.M.C.S.A. Administrator Derek D. Barrs said in the announcement. “We will not tolerate negligence.”

It was not immediately clear how many would-be truckers the move would affect, though the impact could be significant if so many of the country’s training institutes were to lose their accreditation by the end of the year. People seeking a commercial driver’s license are required to complete an entry-level training course, and graduates of entities that lose their accreditation will no longer be recognized as having completed the required course of study

But the move came as welcome news to the trucking industry. In a recent letter to lawmakers, the American Trucking Associations, a trade group, called on Congress to make reforms, including steps to “expedite the removal of noncompliant training providers” from the federal government’s registry.

Late on Monday, the head of the group praised Mr. Duffy’s move.

“Training someone to operate an 80,000-pound vehicle is not a weekend hobby,” said Chris Spear, the president and chief executive of the group. He added that the Trump administration had “sent the right message” and that centers who were “issuing certificates to anyone who can fog a mirror” were “on notice.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/12/01/multimedia/01trump-news-trucking1-qwzb/01trump-news-trucking1-qwzb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 21:56:32.171918

At the time, the Bush administration created a program known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System that asked for new registration requirements for immigrants from mostly Middle Eastern countries.
Concern over the new measures announced by the Trump administration are now reverberating in Afghan immigrant communities and beyond.
“We are feeling so nervous, hearing that they are reprocessing and reinvestigating those who were issued green cards,” Mr. Bahramuddin said.
With their asylum petition now on hold, she said she worried the obstacles to gaining legal status were becoming only harder, particularly for Black immigrants.","The sweeping crackdown President Trump declared last week after an Afghan national was accused of shooting two National Guard members is poised to radically curtail immigrants from legally entering and living in the United States, putting up roadblocks unparalleled in recent history.

Within a matter of days, the administration rolled out a series of far-reaching policy changes: pausing all asylum decisions for migrants currently in the United States; reviewing the green cards that allow people from 19 countries, mostly from the Middle East or Africa, to live and work permanently in the United States; reassessing the asylum approvals issued during the Biden administration; indefinitely halting immigration applications filed by Afghan nationals; and barring Afghans from entering the country.

The new rules are poised to potentially upend the status of as many as 1.5 million migrants with pending asylum cases in the country, the more than 50,000 who gained asylum from the Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration and untold more who had been hoping to seek refuge in the United States.

And Mr. Trump has hinted that further action could come as a result of the attack, floating the possibility of denaturalization, or stripping people of citizenship.

Taken together, the moves represent some of the most significant changes to immigration policy since he regained office on a platform of substantially curbing the number of people entering the United States and deporting record numbers of migrants.

It remains to be seen how the administration will conduct such large-scale reviews of people already living legally in the country, and the federal government cannot easily strip people of their status. But the threat that people could see their cases reopened provoked alarm in a wide array of migrant communities now grappling with the fallout.

“The U.S. government has never halted such a broad slice of the immigration system or devoted this level of resources to rechecking its own work,” said Sarah Pierce, a former Department of Homeland Security official who is now director of social policy at the center-left think tank Third Way.

While security reviews are responsible, Ms. Pierce said, “this isn’t a calibrated security response — it’s a sweeping disruption of the legal immigration system at a moment when the administration is looking for someone to blame.”

Amanda Baran, a former senior official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Biden administration, said she had never heard of the agency pausing asylum requests wholesale in the way the president had ordered.

“The protection of this country and of the American people remains paramount, and the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration’s reckless resettlement policies,” said Joe Edlow, the head of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in a message posted on social media. “American safety is non negotiable.”

Hundreds of thousands of immigrants from the Middle East and Africa, the Caribbean and Latin America had already been on alert for months as federal officials slashed refugee numbers, rolled back temporary humanitarian programs and narrowed the path to asylum in immigration courts, immigration advocates and lawyers said.

Even before the National Guard shooting, migrants from the 19 countries subject to the president’s travel ban had been preparing for more stringent reviews of their green card applications after the Trump administration announced it planned to make it harder for them to get that form of approval and other kinds of immigration relief.

In Southern California, Ara Torosian, an evangelical pastor and Iranian refugee with U.S. citizenship, said he was worried about members of his congregation, including some who had already been detained after reporting to their asylum case check-ins in recent months.

“We don’t know what we should do, especially now,” said Mr. Torosian, who preaches at the Cornerstone Church in West Los Angeles. “So many people have become threats because of the actions of one person.”

Mr. Trump has said the pause on asylum requests will continue for a long period of time.

“We don’t want those people,” he told reporters on Sunday about those seeking asylum.

In a social media post last week, the president also threatened to strip citizenship from naturalized U.S. citizens “who undermine domestic tranquillity.”

Some immigration lawyers and advocates have cautioned against panic over the potential for sizable rollbacks for those who already have legal status, noting that green card holders, asylum grantees and other long-term legal residents have already had to undergo heavy vetting and meet high legal burdens to obtain forms of relief.

“Fortunately, this is a nation of laws, and the more status people have, the more rights people have,” said Ryan Costello, the policy director at the National Iranian American Council, which lobbies on behalf of Iranian Americans. “But it is certainly a time of a lot of uncertainty and concern in the community.”

Ahilan T. Arulanantham, a law professor with the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the U.C.L.A. School of Law, said the administration would have to meet significant legal burdens for the review to result in people losing their green cards or citizenship, including winning rulings for each individual case in court hearings.

The pause on asylum requests filed inside the country, known as affirmative asylum applications, could affect as many of 1.5 million people who had pending applications with U.S.C.I.S. as of June, according to government data.

It’s unclear how U.S.C.I.S. will conduct a review of so many cases. In recent years, the agency has struggled to lower its backlog of cases, according to the D.H.S. inspector general. Agency employees have already been tasked with carrying out other mandates issued by the administration, including processing in refugees from South Africa and considering new factors, like purported anti-Americanism, when considering people’s immigration requests.

The last major government crackdown on a specific group of migrants in the wake of a violent incident came after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

At the time, the Bush administration created a program known as the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System that asked for new registration requirements for immigrants from mostly Middle Eastern countries. The program, which was widely criticized by immigrant advocacy and civil rights groups for being ineffective and unfairly targeting Muslims, was later disbanded during the Obama administration.

Concern over the new measures announced by the Trump administration are now reverberating in Afghan immigrant communities and beyond.

Nooristani Bahramuddin, 35, who previously worked as a security guard and interpreter at the U.S. embassy in Kabul, said he was finally approved last year for a special visa program for Afghans that worked with the U.S. government. He and his family arrived in Chicago last August and were issued green cards a few months later. His son has severe autism, and they’ve since relocated and found a school in Richmond, Va., that can support him. Now they fear that the little stability they’ve created will be upended.

“We are feeling so nervous, hearing that they are reprocessing and reinvestigating those who were issued green cards,” Mr. Bahramuddin said. “I am just trying to be a good person here, and to teach my children the same.”

| Watch Boston 25 News NOW ©2025 Cox Media Group","DEDHAM, Mass. — A Dedham church is causing controversy over another political statement in their Nativity scene this holiday season.

A sign reading “ICE WAS HERE” sits in the middle of the nativity scene outside their front doors. Underneath, a sign reads “The Holy Family is safe in our Church... If you see ICE please call LUCE at 617-370-5023.”

Over the past decade, Father Stephen Jasoma has used the nativity scene to “hold a mirror to the world” for self-reflection, he told Boston 25 Monday.

In years past, he and his parish peace and justice group have decided to make statements surrounding mass shootings, global warming, and immigration issues across the country. In 2018, he displayed Jesus in a cage, another statement on immigration.

“We thought this was a good way to show the dynamic of what’s happening in the world today,” said Jasoma Monday. “This is a stance I’d hope all churches would take. We should be a welcoming community.”

Meanwhile, local Catholics and community leaders like CJ Doyle, the executive director of the state’s Catholic Action League of Massachusetts, spoke against Father Jasoma’s decision.

“We have a case of a dissident priest who has a long history of these crackpot, publicity stunts,” said Doyle outside the nativity scene Monday. “He’s politicizing Christmas. He’s exploiting the Holy Family. He’s using his position as the pastor of a Catholic parish to promote his left-wing political ideology.”

Doyle called on local Catholics to reach out to the archdiocese, which he claimed has allowed these “political stunts.”

He asked, “Is this not obstruction of justice they’re really pushing here?... If he doesnt really believe in the Catholic religion or thinks the Catholic church is a vehicle for political activism, perhaps he should find new employment.”

Father Jasoma, in response to criticism he recieved, told Boston 25, “I’ve some push back from total strangers, was called a murderer yesterday... What we celebrate at Christmas is the peace Christ brought into the world. It’s right here, it’s right now. We are to embrace it.”

Boston reached out to the Archdiocese of Boston and is still waiting for comment.

The “underlying facts” of his asylum claim have not changed and he was in possession of a valid document proving his status, the court order states.","A federal judge Monday ordered immigration officials to immediately release an Afghan immigrant who helped U.S. troops fight the Taliban before moving to Boulder County.

Mohammad Ali Dadfar, who lived in Louisville with his wife and four children after fleeing Afghanistan, was picked up in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement sting while working as a long-haul truck driver. He has been held in a detention center in Missouri for nearly two months following his arrest at a weigh station along an interstate highway in Indiana.

“Ali’s family is overwhelmed and excited to see him,” said Marissa Seuc-Hester, who leads a volunteer ministry for immigrants at Christ the Servant Lutheran Church in Louisville and had helped the family with housing and other support. “Our community is celebrating this just order and cannot wait to welcome him home.”

Within hours of the judge’s order, by late Monday afternoon, Dadfar walked out of the detention center in Missouri. Friends in Louisville made arrangements to pick him up, and others, including his wife, were driving east to meet him, Seuc-Hester said.

U.S. District Judge M. Douglas Harpool, in the Western District of Missouri, ruled that Dadfar’s constitutional right to due process was violated and that he is entitled to immediate release.

Dadfar’s attorney in Colorado, Tiago Guevara of Longmont, said the ruling was “one more step toward a just result in this case.”

“Mr. Dadfar is a hardworking family man who has followed the law at every turn,” he said. “ICE broke its own laws and regulations to arrest him and take him away from his family.”

Dadfar and his family escaped Afghanistan “in fear for their lives,” the court order says. He followed the path toward legal asylum, first by presenting himself and his family to border patrol authorities in San Ysidro, California, in June 2024. They were admitted into the United States and given a date for immigration court.

Dadfar was granted humanitarian parole, which does not expire until June 2026. He had applied for asylum in August 2024 and was scheduled to appear in immigration court in Colorado in February. He also has a work permit that is valid until June, according to court records, and had obtained a commercial driver’s license to work as a truck driver.

Dadfar was driving through Michigan City, Indiana, and had stopped at a weigh station along Interstate 94. “Then, without a warrant or any warning, Mr. Dadfar was detained and arrested,” the order states.

He was held for five hours at the weigh station, then taken into ICE custody by Chicago immigration agents. He was later sent to a detention center in Missouri.

Dadfar had worked in the Afghan Army for 14 years and provided security for U.S. soldiers. He and his wife, three daughters and one son fled Afghanistan in 2021, after U.S. troops had withdrawn and the Taliban returned to power.

They traveled first to Iran, and then to Brazil when the Brazilian government offered visas to Afghan refugees. After about a year in South America, the family made a treacherous journey through the jungle of the Darien Gap to reach the U.S. border.

They settled in Louisville, where Dadfar’s brother already lived.

The judge determined that there were no grounds for the federal government to terminate Dadfar’s humanitarian parole “because he has not departed from the U.S., and his parole has not expired.” He was also not given any written notice explaining the basis for revoking his immigration status, as required by law.

The federal government violated Dadfar’s rights to “freedom from imprisonment” and to have a hearing in court, the judge ruled. The “underlying facts” of his asylum claim have not changed and he was in possession of a valid document proving his status, the court order states.

“There was no evidence from his conduct that he was a flight risk,” the judge wrote. “He was simply performing his duties as a truck driver in Indiana (far from any border).”

The habeas corpus case was filed against Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the acting assistant field officer for ICE in Chicago, and the sheriff of Greene County, Missouri, where Dadfar was detained.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/190327newyork1a.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 22:57:28.828718

We are campaigning for a world where human rights are enjoyed by all – and we can only do it with your support.","Experts across the refugee sector urge the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to use its visit to Australia, starting today, to investigate harmful immigration detention policies that breach human rights.

A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia’s immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group has previously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government’s failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said: ‘After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.’

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre, said: ‘Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people’s liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.’

Fr. Brett O’Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said: ‘JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.’

“We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.”

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said: ‘Australia’s mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government’s obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.’

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said: ‘This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia’s immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.’

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said: ‘Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.’

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said: ‘Australia’s system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people – some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people.’

WATCH: Investigations of National Guard shooting reveal suspect worked for CIA in Afghanistan

The Trump administration says the new policies are necessary to ensure that those entering the country — or are already here — do not pose a security threat.

Here’s a look at the major changes announced over roughly a week.

All asylum decisions suspended

The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, said on the social platform X last week that asylum decisions will be paused “until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible.”

Besides the post, no formal guidance has been put forward, so details remain scarce about the planned pause.

READ MORE: Refugee groups worry about backlash after National Guard shooting

People seeking asylum must show to U.S. officials a threat of persecution if they were sent back to their home country, whether because of race, nationality or other grounds. If they’re granted asylum, they’re allowed to stay in the U.S. and eventually apply for a green card and then citizenship.

The Afghan suspect in the National Guard shooting was granted asylum earlier this year, according to advocate group #AfghanEvac.

The right to apply for asylum was already restricted by the Trump administration. In January, Trump issued an executive order essentially halting asylum for people who have come into the country through the southern border. Those cases generally go through immigration courts which are overseen by the Department of Justice.

USCIS oversees the asylum process for foreigners the government isn’t trying to remove via immigration courts. While Trump’s January order didn’t affect those cases, Edlow’s social media post suggests they will now come under additional scrutiny. Edlow did not say how long the agency’s pause on asylum decisions would last or what happens to people while those decisions are paused.

Caseloads have been rising for all types of asylum applications. The number of asylum cases at USCIS rose from 241,280 in 2022 to a record 456,750 in 2023, according to the Office of Homeland Security Statistics.

A focus on countries ‘of concern’

On Nov. 27, Edlow said his agency was conducting a “full scale, rigorous reexamination” of every green card for people he said come from “every country of concern.”

“American safety is non negotiable,” Edlow said.

The agency said in a press release that same day that it was issuing new guidance that could make it tougher for people from 19 countries the administration considers “high-risk,” including Afghanistan, when they apply for immigration benefits such as applying for green cards or to stay in the U.S. longer.

The administration had already banned travel to the U.S. for citizens from 12 of those countries and restricted access for people from seven others.

No visas for Afghans

Other stricter stricter measures are also directed at Afghans.

On Nov. 26, USCIS said it would be suspending all “immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals.” That would affect Afghans already living in the U.S. who are applying for green cards or work permits or permission to bring family members to the U.S.

WATCH: Questions emerge about National Guard shooter’s motives and the impact on immigrants

Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced late Friday on X that the State Department has temporarily stopped issuing visas for all people traveling on Afghan passports.

The Trump administration had already severely limited travel and immigration from Afghanistan. The one avenue that had remained open was the Special Immigrant Visa program. Created by Congress, it allowed Afghans who closely supported the U.S. war effort in Afghanistan and faced retribution because of their work to emigrate to America.

But the State Department’s announcement means even that avenue is now closed.

According to #AfghanEvac, a group that advocates for Afghans coming to the U.S., about 180,000 Afghans were in the process of applying for the SIV program.

A review of refugees admitted under the Biden administration

Even before the shooting of two National Guard members, the Trump administration was planning a sweeping review of tens of thousands of immigrants who entered the U.S. during the Biden administration as part of the U.S. Refugee Assistance Program.

That program, first launched in 1980, oversees the process by which people fleeing persecution can come to the U.S. Refugees are distinct from people seeking asylum, although they meet the same criteria. Refugees have to apply and wait outside the U.S. to be admitted while asylum-seekers do so once they reach the U.S.

Trump suspended the refugee program the day he took office and only a trickle of refugees have been admitted since then, either white South Africans or people admitted as part of a lawsuit seeking to restart the refugee program.

Then on Nov. 21, Edlow said in a memo obtained by The Associated Press that the administration was going to review all refugees admitted to the U.S. during the Biden administration. That’s nearly 200,000 refugees.

He's facing disbarment,"Jordan Rynning, laist.com, jordan-rynning",,,,,https://laist.com/news/criminal-justice/la-attorney-fake-ice-investigation,"According to findings from the California State Bar, Zargarof charged Lui for a number of “fictitious services.” Zargarof’s license is currently suspended, according to State Bar records.
In October, more than three years after the email about the fake ICE investigation, the State Bar Court recommended Zargarof be disbarred.
“I was really rushing it and I really believed in what he said,” Lui told LAist.
“ Of the cases we file, a fair number involve misappropriations of funds or misrepresentations,” Cardona told LAist.
Zargarof told Lui he was using the card to hire private investigators for her case, she told LAist.","The email was urgent and alarming.

The message appeared to come from the L.A. Field Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It said Patty Lui’s toy business in downtown L.A. was under federal investigation, and she had 24 hours to contact the agency — “whether individually or by legal representative on your behalf.”

By the time Lui suspected something was wrong, she said she’d paid her attorney, Ronen Zargarof, tens of thousands of dollars. According to findings from the California State Bar, Zargarof charged Lui for a number of “fictitious services.”

Zargarof’s license is currently suspended, according to State Bar records. In October, more than three years after the email about the fake ICE investigation, the State Bar Court recommended Zargarof be disbarred. They found that Zargarof, who was already working for Lui on another matter, knew the purported ICE email was fake. There was no urgent ICE investigation.

Lui told LAist that when she ended up sending Zargarof about $90,000.

“I was really rushing it and I really believed in what he said,” Lui told LAist.

Zargarof did not cooperate with the State Bar’s investigation into his dealings with Lui, who ultimately complained to the bar, or contest the charges set forth in the accusation filed by the bar against him, court documents show. The California Supreme Court still has to rule on whether Zargarof will be disbarred.

Zargarof has not responded to LAist's requests for comment on this story. According to civil court filings, he also ignored multiple orders to provide discovery materials in his case.

The documents show that Zargarof’s defense lawyers argued in February 2021 that he was unable to attend a deposition because he was out of state with no estimated return date. The lawyers then filed to leave the case in April, shortly after Zargarof was ordered by the court to attend a deposition the following month. Zargarof did not attend the deposition, court records state, and the court ruled against him in a default judgement.

How to protect yourself

George Cardona, chief trial counsel of the State Bar of California, said people navigating immigration law are especially vulnerable to misconduct and misrepresentation.

The State Bar files charges against 100 to 200 attorneys each year, Cardona said. Those charges can lead to disciplinary actions like suspension, disbarment or fines.

“ Of the cases we file, a fair number involve misappropriations of funds or misrepresentations,” Cardona told LAist. “We have had other cases, particularly in immigration context, involving fabricated documents.”

As federal immigration cases have ramped up this year with the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation policies, there may be even more risk.

Cardona recommends anyone needing a lawyer to look into the attorney you plan to hire before trusting them to represent you in court.

A search of court records in late 2021, when Lui first hired Zargarof, could have turned up a judgment against him for more than $170,000. According to court filings, Zagarof was ordered to pay damages of $76,500 for breach of contract and $48,500 for “tort causes,” including battery, assault, domestic violence, negligence and infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff is listed as a “Jane Doe.”

“The Court finds Defendant's conduct was willful, wanton, oppressive and malicious,” the order states.

When it comes to keeping yourself safe from fraud, Cardona said, the first thing you should do is search for a lawyer on the State Bar of California's webpage before deciding whether to hire them.

“ First, it can confirm that they're a lawyer, and second, it will show if they have any disciplinary history,” he said.

Cardona said people posing as lawyers is especially prevalent in immigration cases.

After checking whether a lawyer is licensed or has a history of disciplinary actions, he said you should look online for reviews or check with friends who may have an attorney they know first-hand.

The lawyer will be acting on your behalf, Cardona said, “ so it's important to have someone you can trust.”

A cautionary tale

Lui initially hired Zargarof to handle a separate, civil employment case in November 2021.

She told LAist that she never met Zargarof in person. November is a particularly busy time for her business making and selling teddy bears, Lui said, and for a few weeks it seemed Zargarof was on top of the case.

“ He was always telling me that he just came out from the court and this is what I need,” Lui said, “I need to pay and pay and pay.”

Zargarof began asking for more money to cover various fees, she said, pushing her to quickly send him money.

“ I’d have to rush to send him a wire,” Lui told LAist. “I was so nervous.”

According to the State Bar’s findings, some of Zargarof’s fees were for “fictitious services,” including $2,500 to have her daughter dismissed from the civil case against Lui, and $6,000 for proceedings before the “Labor Board of Los Angeles County.”

The State Bar noted in court documents that Lui’s daughter was never accused of any wrongdoing in the case, and that the “Labor Board of Los Angeles County” does not exist.

The bar described in court filings how Zargarof made up these scenarios to charge Lui fees for services he never provided.

Zargarof sent text messages to Lui, which were quoted in court filings and provided more information on the investigation.

“There were two search warrant[s] . . . for your computers and files. We are dismissing those today,” Zargarof messaged Lui.

Zargarof said that he knew an “immigration experts partner,” named Tracey Pierantoni, and directed Lui to pay $10,000 into Pierantoni’s bank account.

“They are going to charge a flat rate of 5 [thousand] per file = 10k so I think it will be cheaper for you to wire them before 130 today instead of putting it on card,” said one message included in court documents.

There was no ICE investigation, according to the court documents, and Tracey Pierantoni Zargarof is not a licensed attorney in the state of California.

Court documents allege that Pierantoni Zargarof is one of several family members Zargarof used to accept payments from Lui.

Pierantoni Zargarof denies any involvement in the payments, and told LAist she intends to file charges against Zargarof for identity fraud.

“I have nothing to do with his criminal activity,"" Pierantoni Zargarof said when asked for comment. She added that she hasn't seen him in two or three years and doesn't know where he is or how to reach him.

Details from the State Bar Complaint

While Lui was trying to keep up with her business and pay Zargarof’s fees, court records document that Zargarof ran up a $25,000 bill on Lui’s credit card to pay for a hotel stay at the Rosewood Miramar Beach in Santa Barbara.

Zargarof told Lui he was using the card to hire private investigators for her case, she told LAist. Once she learned that wasn’t true she went to her bank with a fraud claim.

She also made a complaint to the State Bar of California in August 2022, which led to disciplinary charges against Zargarof in April 2025.

Lui said her bank was able to return the money that was charged to her card, but she hasn't been able to recover tens of thousands of additional payments that the State Bar found were for ""fictitious services.”",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a22aeea/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F9f%2F6a%2Fefcea83a4d51ba610e0628770337%2F010720-ca-supreme-court-ap-cm-01.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 18:58:48.664315

Meanwhile, President Trump said the U.S. is poised to launch attacks inside Venezuela itself. This comes as Republican-led committees in the House and Senate say they’ll hold oversight hearings to investigate the Pentagon’s attacks on boats in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, following a Washington Post report alleging Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the killing of all crew members on an alleged drug vessel, including the survivors of an initial strike. According to the Post, Secretary Hegseth ordered the killing of two people as they clung to the smoldering wreckage of their boat after the first attack, off the coast of Trinidad, on September 2. A source told the Post, “The order was to kill everybody.” Under international law, it’s a war crime to refuse to spare the lives of people who are attempting to surrender or otherwise unable to fight. Human rights groups, meanwhile, have condemned all of the Pentagon’s attacks on boats as war crimes. On Sunday, President Trump denied Hegseth gave an order to kill everyone aboard the vessel, but later in the evening, Hegseth contradicted Trump’s denial, posting a meme on social media depicting the children’s cartoon character Franklin the Turtle opening fire from a helicopter on boats below. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Vice President Delcy Rodríguez called on other oil-producing states in OPEC to oppose any U.S. attack on Venezuela.

Vice President Delcy Rodríguez: “Venezuela formally denounces, before this body, that the government of the United States of America intends to take control of Venezuela’s vast oil reserves, the largest on the planet, through the use of lethal military force against the territory, the people and the institutions of the country.”

President Trump says he will pardon Honduras’s former president, who was sentenced by a U.S. court last year to 45 years in prison for directing a massive cocaine trafficking operation. Prosecutors showed how Juan Orlando Hernández, who was president from 2014 to 2022, ran Honduras as a “narco-state,” accepting millions of dollars in bribes from cocaine traffickers in exchange for protection, including deploying the Honduran National Police to safeguard cocaine loads as they were transported through Honduras. News of Trump’s looming pardon came just days ahead of Sunday’s presidential elections in Honduras, where a right-wing candidate from Juan Orlando Hernández’s party had taken a narrow lead with just under half the votes counted. Nasry Asfura is the former mayor of Tegucigalpa. He received a boost when Trump endorsed him and threatened to cut off aid to Honduras if voters elected one of his rivals, whom Trump assailed as “communists.”

The death toll from Israel’s more than two-year assault on Gaza surpassed 70,000 Palestinians over the weekend, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry. Al Jazeera is reporting that Israeli drones dropped a bomb near al-Farabi School Saturday morning, killing two brothers, Juma and Fadi Tamer Abu Assi. On Sunday, three more Palestinians were killed and two others injured in Israeli attacks, raising the death toll to 356 since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire went into effect on October 10. Meanwhile, Israel returned 15 more Palestinian bodies to Gaza as part of the first phase of the ceasefire deal. This comes as Israeli forces claim to have killed 40 Hamas fighters in southern Gaza over the past 40 days.

In the occupied West Bank, Israeli forces on Thursday fatally shot two Palestinian men at point-blank range after they appeared to surrender to troops. The killings were captured on video showing the two men coming out of a garage holding their hands up and lifting their shirts to show they are not carrying explosives. The troops later shot the men dead. This comes as the Wafa news agency is reporting that Israeli forces have arrested a 16-year-old child at a military checkpoint in the occupied West Bank, as Israel intensifies drone operations over the Jenin refugee camp.

Israeli authorities have freed a Palestinian American boy after holding him for over nine months without trial in an Israeli military prison, where he says he was physically and psychologically tortured. Mohammed Ibrahim of Palm Bay, Florida, was just 15 years old when Israeli forces arrested him in the occupied West Bank for allegedly throwing stones at Israeli settlers’ vehicles. If convicted, he faced up to 20 years in prison. Ibrahim was released on Thanksgiving Day following a pressure campaign from more than 100 U.S. civil rights groups, as well as 27 members of Congress. He was hospitalized after his release, treated for severe weight loss and scabies that left him with a serious skin infection. His family said they had almost no direct contact with Ibrahim throughout his detention. In October, the boy told a human rights group he and other Palestinian prisoners suffered beatings, severe cold, starvation, social isolation and medical neglect.

The Trump administration has stopped issuing visas for Afghan nationals and has halted decisions on all asylum applications, after a 29-year-old Afghan opened fire near the White House last Wednesday, killing a soldier with the West Virginia National Guard and leaving another in critical condition. Rahmanullah Lakanwal has been charged with first-degree murder and will likely face terrorism charges. Lakanwal previously worked in a CIA-backed Afghan Army unit known as a Zero Unit. He entered the United States in 2021 through Operation Allies Welcome, a program that saw the U.S. evacuate thousands of Afghans who faced reprisals from the Taliban over their support of the U.S. occupation. He applied for asylum in 2024 and was granted refugee status last April, under the second Trump administration. President Trump called the attack an “act of hatred” committed by an “animal” and pledged that his administration would re-vet every Afghan granted asylum in the U.S. Meanwhile, the United Nations’ special rapporteur on Afghanistan has spoken out against collective punishment. Richard Bennett said in a statement, “The perpetrator should face accountability, but the entire Afghan community must not be punished due to the actions of one individual.”

President Trump announced that he was canceling all executive orders signed by former President Joe Biden using an autopen, which is a device that reproduces signatures. President Trump has also used autopen to sign official documents. Back in September, the White House hung a photo of Biden’s autopen signature instead of his portrait in the walkway featuring portraits of former presidents. Biden signed 162 executive orders during his presidency, though it’s unclear how many were signed using autopen. President Trump rescinded nearly 70 of Biden’s executive orders shortly after taking office, and another 19 in March.

President Trump on Wednesday blasted New York Times reporter Katie Rogers, calling her “ugly,” after she published a story raising questions about President Trump’s health, writing that he was “showing signs of fatigue.” The article also detailed an Oval Office event last month where President Trump appeared drowsy with drooping eyelids, dozing on and off for several seconds. President Trump also insulted CBS News White House correspondent Nancy Cordes on Thursday after she asked him about the suspect in Wednesday’s attack on two National Guard members in Washington, D.C. Trump snapped back at her, “Are you stupid? Are you a stupid person?” Last month, President Trump called Bloomberg’s White House correspondent Catherine Lucey “piggy” after she questioned him about releasing the Epstein files.

In Hong Kong, officials say at least 151 people died in a fire that engulfed a high-rise apartment complex last Wednesday. The blaze is Hong Kong’s deadliest in more than 70 years, and the exact cause has yet to be determined. Eight people have been arrested on corruption charges after an investigation revealed that the netting that covered scaffolding used in renovations was not up to fire safety codes. This is Joey Yeung, whose grandmother’s home was consumed by the fire.

Joey Yeung: “All the memories have all gone, and it’s all because of those people who caused the fire. I can’t accept it. So, today I came with my father and my family to lay flowers. … I’m not asking to get anything back, but at least give some justice to the families of the deceased, to those who are still alive.”

A Babson College student was deported to Honduras while she was trying to fly from Boston to Texas to surprise her family for Thanksgiving. Nineteen-year-old Any Lucia López Belloza was told there was an issue with her boarding pass before she was detained by immigration officials and sent to Texas, and later Honduras. The day after she was arrested, a federal judge issued an emergency order prohibiting the government from removing her from the United States for 72 hours. López Belloza told The Boston Globe that she is currently staying with her grandparents in Honduras.

More than 1,000 people have died in devastating floods and landslides in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Thailand, leaving hundreds of thousands of people stranded without shelter. In Indonesia, 600 people have died and over 500,000 people are displaced on the island of Sumatra as authorities frantically search for survivors. In Thailand, at least 170 people were killed in one of the worst floods in a decade. Meanwhile, in Sri Lanka, 334 people died as a result of Cyclone Ditwah, the worst natural disaster to hit the island in two decades since the devastating 2004 tsunami. On Sunday, low-lying areas of Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo were flooded after heavy rains triggered mudslides across the island. Nearly 148,000 people have been displaced.

Malika Kumari: “It rained nonstop for three days. We heard about the warnings of flooding, but we didn’t expect water levels would get this high. As usual, we moved our belongings that could be moved to a higher level. But that didn’t help. Everything is under water.”

In the Philippines, tens of thousands of protesters marched in the capital Manila calling for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to resign, after a corruption scandal revealed that his government took billions in kickbacks from faulty flood control projects. Heavy losses from two recent typhoons, which killed more than 250 people, spurred public outrage. Marcos has vowed that at least 37 government officials implicated in the corruption scandal will be in jail by December, but protesters say many more officials should be in jail sooner.

David San Juan: “It’s been five months since the flood control scam erupted, and no high official has been jailed yet. After what Ombudsman Remulla said, that at least 10% of Congress is involved in the anomalies in flood control projects, a case has been filed and a warrant issued for only one person. The senators and congressmen involved have still not been jailed.”

Bright, who has served in HR roles in government for nearly 30 years, had no performance or prior disciplinary issues, Owen said.
Trump administration officials had reportedly grown angry in recent months with the rate of hiring at ICE.
Bright received no indication that CBP was displeased with hiring efforts at her agency, said Owen, her lawyer.
Both CBP and ICE declined to comment for this story.","As two agencies at the center of President Trump’s efforts to clamp down on immigration and conduct mass deportations look to spend a windfall of new funding to bring on swaths of new employees, they will do so without the officials who have overseen those efforts since he took office.

Customs and Border Protection, which received $4 billion in Trump’s signature One Big Beautiful Bill Act to hire 8,500 employees, recently fired Andrea Bright, a long-time career civil servant who has served since 2019 as the agency’s assistant secretary for human resources management. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, meanwhile, which received $8 billion to triple its workforce by hiring 10,000 officers and agents, recently saw its chief human capital officer, Tyshawn Thomas, take a similar role at another agency.

Bright received no indication of why she was fired, her attorney, Kevin Owen, told Government Executive, and the dismissal came as a surprise. Her termination notice stated she was fired pursuant to the president’s powers under Article II of the Constitution, a novel argument the administration has made repeatedly when firing employees since January. Bright, who has served in HR roles in government for nearly 30 years, had no performance or prior disciplinary issues, Owen said.

“There’s nothing about her that we believe this administration would find objectionable, so this really is an absolute mystery,” Owen added. “She’s a competent civil servant who does her job.”

In an August interview with Government Executive, Bright expressed confidence CBP would meet its lofty hiring goals and said years of built up capacity would help it do so. She called the hiring surge realistic, though she conceded it would depend on conditions in the job market and said CBP was entering “the unknown.”

Bright had overseen a dramatic uptick in those seeking CBP law enforcement roles—taking in 50,000 applications in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, a 40% jump from the previous year—though Border Patrol and the rest of the agency had struggled to build its actual hiring rate above that of attrition. Trump administration officials had reportedly grown angry in recent months with the rate of hiring at ICE.

Thomas left ICE within the last few weeks on his own volition, according to multiple officials familiar with his move, to return to the Office of Personnel Management—where he had worked for seven years before leaving for ICE in 2024—as its top HR official. Carmen Garcia served as OPM’s chief human capital officer until she left for the private sector last week.

The push to rapidly recruit and onboard 10,000 new officers and agents had created a “chaotic” situation within ICE HR, a source familiar with the matter said, which incentivized Thomas to return to OPM. ICE has offered $50,000 signing bonuses to employees, expanded student loan repayment, removed age caps and nearly taken over the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center as part of its effort to rapidly transform the agency’s workforce. Thomas' departure follows widespread reports in late October of significant shakeups within ICE's top ranks.

Bright received no indication that CBP was displeased with hiring efforts at her agency, said Owen, her lawyer.

He added it would be “terrible management if they’re not meeting hiring goals to fire their head of HR who’s got decades of experience in federal hiring.”

Bright has appealed her firing to the Merit Systems Protection Board and is currently awaiting a hearing. Both CBP and ICE declined to comment for this story.

""If I have the power to do it — I'm not sure that I do, but if I do — I would denaturalize, absolutely.""

Trump also repeated previous anti-immigrant comments, criticizing people from Somalia who have been living in the U.S. and threatening to pause new asylum claims for ""a long time.""

""We don't want those people. Does that make sense? You know why we don't want them? Because many have been no good and they shouldn't be in our country.""

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Flashback: The U.S. Department of Justice is now prioritizing stripping naturalized Americans of their citizenship when charged with certain crimes, according to a June memo.

Yes, but: For revocation of naturalization, the U.S. Attorney's Office needs to file charges in federal court.

""The government holds a high burden of proof when attempting to revoke a person's naturalization,"" per U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Here's what to know about the Trump administration's threats to naturalized citizens:

What naturalized citizenship is

Naturalization ""is the process by which U.S. citizenship is granted to a lawful permanent resident after meeting the requirements established by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),"" per USCIS.

What Trump has said about naturalized citizens following the National Guard shooting

Trump's comments following the shooting have involved renewed threats to naturalized U.S. citizens.

In his lengthy Thanksgiving Truth Social post, Trump said that he would ""end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.""

Reality check: A wealth of research shows that immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S.-born people.

A 2023 study led by Stanford University economist Ran Abramitzky found that immigrants are 60% less likely to be incarcerated than their U.S.-born counterparts.

Relative to the U.S.-born, the researchers found, immigrants' incarceration rates have declined since 1960.

The Justice Department's targeting of naturalized citizens

The Justice Department directed attorneys this summer to prioritize denaturalization in cases where naturalized citizens commit specific crimes.

At the time, a department spokesperson told Axios that ""denaturalization proceedings will only be pursued as permitted by law and supported by evidence against individuals who illegally procured or misrepresented facts in the naturalization process.""

""Those who gain citizenship through unlawful means and endanger our national security will not maintain the benefits of being an American citizen,"" the statement said.

Zoom in: The Justice Department is targeting those charged with war crimes, gang activity, extrajudicial killings, and ""other serious human rights abuses,"" the department said in June.

It also directs Civil Division attorneys to investigate ""any individuals convicted of crimes who pose an ongoing threat to the United States.""

How many immigrants are naturalized citizens

By the numbers: Out of the 46.2 million immigrants living in the U.S. in 2022, 24.5 million – 53% – are naturalized citizens, according to a Migration Policy Institute analysis of government data.

Who is eligible to become a naturalized citizen

Zoom out: In the past decade, the U.S. naturalized more than 7.9 million citizens, according to the USCIS.

Naturalized citizens undergo an involved application process, but eligibility criteria include being a lawful permanent resident for at least five years, with exceptions for spouses of citizens and members of the U.S. military.

The median years spent as a permanent resident for all naturalized citizens in 2024 was 7.5 years.

The Immigration and Nationality Act requires that naturalization applicants pass tests proving their English language abilities and knowledge of U.S. history.

How many citizens have been denaturalized

By the numbers: From 1990 to 2017, the DOJ filed 305 denaturalization cases, about 11 per year, according to The Miami Herald.

The number has surged since Trump's first term.

Irina Manta, a Hofstra University law professor who compiles denaturalization cases, found 168 denaturalization cases filed in federal courts during Trump's first term in office and 64 during Biden's.

That's an average of 42 per year under Trump and 16 under Biden.

Since January 2017, the USCIS has selected some 2,500 cases for possible denaturalization and referred at least 110 denaturalization cases to the Justice Department for prosecution by the end of August 2018.

At least one person was denaturalized following a conviction this year.",https://images.axios.com/57WSoFWgwti6wkdOZYmxgbmYB8w=/363x271:3241x1890/1366x768/2025/12/01/1764613371066.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 17:56:40.262491

Yet multiple religious groups have filed lawsuits similar to this one seeking to bar ICE and other agencies from such actions.
In their action filed in January, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship along with Sikh and Quaker groups were granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE raids on member properties.
An SBC spokesperson said neither Pressley nor the executive committee have been briefed about planned ICE raids, according to the report.
The presence of immigration agents during the holiday season would be harmful to faith communities even if the reported raids do not occur, according to the filing.","A coalition of religious groups has asked a federal court to prevent federal immigration agents from raiding houses of worship during the holiday season.

The plaintiffs in New England Synod, Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, et al., v. Department of Homeland Security, et al. filed the petition amid swirling rumors and news reports that the US Department of Homeland Security has plans to apprehend worshipers in Spanish-speaking and other congregations during Thanksgiving, Christmas, and other holiday services in the coming weeks.

“If these reports are true, it is outrageous that the administration would so blatantly seek to undermine the freedom to worship freely as we enter an important time for many faiths,” said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward, which serves as co-counsel in the action.

The possibility that raids could be carried out on church campuses and in sanctuaries creates even more urgency for the lawsuit on behalf of the Alliance of Baptists, American Baptist Churches in the USA, Metropolitan Community Churches, and numerous Quaker and Evangelical Lutheran Church in America regions, Perryman said.

“The reports circulating this week are alarming and incompatible with our Constitution. We are taking swift action to ensure that the protections already recognized by the court are upheld and that faith communities can gather and worship, free from government coercion.”

The concern stems from the Trump administration’s January termination of longstanding federal prohibitions against immigration raids in sensitive locations such as churches, hospitals, and schools. Since then, federal agents have arrested undocumented immigrants on or near church properties, but incursions into sanctuaries and other buildings have not been reported.

Yet multiple religious groups have filed lawsuits similar to this one seeking to bar ICE and other agencies from such actions.

In their action filed in January, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship along with Sikh and Quaker groups were granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE raids on member properties. Fellowship Southwest, now known as FaithWorks, the Hispanic Baptist Convention, and other groups were denied a restraining order in their separate lawsuit filed earlier this year.

Both social media and news accounts have been stoking fears that DHS plans to sweep through houses of worship during the holiday season. A WhatsAPP message warning of impending church raids in Atlanta sparked apprehension in that city, while reports of federal officials briefing Baptist, Catholic, Pentecostal, and Jewish leaders of impending actions has raised concerns throughout New England.

“Two Hispanic pastors who lead Southern Baptist churches in New England say that SBC President Clint Pressley and its Executive Board received briefings on the plan and discussed it with Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller and White House Border Czar Tom Homan,” This Week in Worcester reported.

An SBC spokesperson said neither Pressley nor the executive committee have been briefed about planned ICE raids, according to the report.

A Hispanic Pentecostal pastor said his church had been visited several times by ICE and FBI agents, according to the publication, which cited unnamed DHS sources. “In all three conversations, agents asked questions about the names of specific congregation members, their home addresses and the frequency they attended church services.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the agency is targeting churches, according to the National Catholic Reporter: “ICE does not raid churches—regardless of if it is holiday season or not. This is just another false narrative to try and demonize our brave ICE law enforcement who are facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them and a 8000% increase in death threats.”

However, the department vowed that no house of worship will be off limits thanks to President Donald Trump’s January directive opening health care, education, and sacred spaces to enforcement actions: “Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest. The Trump administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense.”

But plaintiffs in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America lawsuit are taking no chances.

by Katie Johnston, The Boston Globe: “People who rely on government assistance are often subject to the same three-word admonishment: Get a job.","ICED OUT — An official visit to the ICE detention facility in Burlington this morning is creating some frostiness between Senate competitors.

Rep. Seth Moulton is visiting the federal immigration field office in his district at 10 a.m. to check out conditions at the site where some immigrants have been detained for days after being arrested.

He invited both Sen. Ed Markey — who he’s looking to oust from the Senate — and Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join the tour and “stand united in getting the facts, supporting our communities, and ensuring that this facility is operating responsibly, humanely and within the law,” Moulton said in announcing the visit.

Neither will be there today with the Salem Democrat. Instead, Markey has his own tour of the facility set in the coming weeks — and he got a little bit of a jump on Moulton last week, stopping by the Burlington facility the day before Thanksgiving to meet with protestors who regularly demonstrate near the building.

“I have been demanding answers about the conditions at that facility and will be returning soon to continue my oversight there,” he said in a vdeo posted on social media.

Moulton plans to monitor agents’ conduct and conditions in the facility, according to his office. “We have seen the excessive use of force and inhumane treatment by ICE personnel in Massachusetts and around the country and want to ensure that it does not happen moving forward,” he said in the statement announcing this morning’s visit.

Members of Congress have to plan these visits ahead as a result of a new Trump administration policy that bars them from making unannounced visits to ICE field offices, like the one in Burlington. Members can still conduct site visits at detention facilities unannounced.

Burlington town officials have warned of “inhuman treatment of detainees” in the facility that serves as a temporary holding place for immigrants after they’ve been arrested. Marcelo Gomes Da Silva, the 18-year-old Milford high school student who was detained there earlier this year, described the conditions as “not good,” after he said he went six days without showering while sleeping on a cement floor. Federal immigration officials disputed that portrayal at the time.

IN MEMORIAM

‘NO ONE MORE LOYAL — State Rep. Ann-Margaret Ferrante died Thursday after a years-long battle with pancreatic cancer. She was 53. Tributes poured out for the longtime lawmaker, who served as vice chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.

“Ann-Margaret Ferrante lived a life full of purpose, joy, and service,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement. “For nearly 17 years, Ann-Margaret served the people of Cape Ann as their state representative with a relentless commitment to helping those in need.”

She was “not only a trusted legislative partner, but also a cherished friend — someone my family and I considered part of our own,” said Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr, whose district overlapped with Ferrante’s.

Gov. Maura Healey described Ferrante as “a fierce champion for the people of Cape Ann for more than 15 years.”

“She was one of the most selfless people I know, and there was no one more loyal to her friends, family and the constituents she served,” Healey added.

WHAT YOU MISSED

— Babson College freshman speaks out about her deportation to Honduras ahead of Thanksgiving by Giulia McDonnell Nieto del Rio, The Boston Globe: “The college freshman was thrilled to board her flight to surprise her family for Thanksgiving. Any Lucia Lopez Belloza thought about the embraces she would share with her little sisters, ages 2 and 5, and about everything she would tell her mother and father about her first semester at Babson College studying business. She would share how happy she was, about how all of her hard work — and her family’s hard work — was finally paying off. Instead, shortly after showing her ticket to a gate agent at Logan airport last Thursday morning, she was suddenly whisked away by immigration officials to an unmarked car. By Saturday, the federal government had already deported her to Honduras, a country she had not been to since she was seven years old.

Specialist Sarah Beckstrom died on Thanksgiving at age 20. Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, is “fighting for his life,” President Donald Trump said on a Thanksgiving call with U.S. troops. He announced that Beckstrom had died of her injuries.”

— Hegseth order on first Caribbean boat strike, officials say: Kill them all by Alex Horton and Ellen Nakashima, The Washington Post: “The longer the U.S. surveillance aircraft followed the boat, the more confident intelligence analysts watching from command centers became that the 11 people on board were ferrying drugs. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth gave a spoken directive, according to two people with direct knowledge of the operation. ‘The order was to kill everybody,’ one of them said. A missile screamed off the Trinidad coast, striking the vessel and igniting a blaze from bow to stern. For minutes, commanders watched the boat burning on a live drone feed. As the smoke cleared, they got a jolt: Two survivors were clinging to the smoldering wreck. The Special Operations commander overseeing the Sept. 2 attack — the opening salvo in the Trump administration’s war on suspected drug traffickers in the Western Hemisphere — ordered a second strike to comply with Hegseth’s instructions, two people familiar with the matter said.”

— Years in, panel tasked with offering new Massachusetts flag says it needs another extension amid ‘public misunderstanding’ by Matt Stout, The Boston Globe: “Just ahead of a December deadline, members of a state panel tasked with identifying replacements for Massachusetts’ state seal and flag say they’ll seek another extension, warning there remains a fundamental “public misunderstanding” about why the flag’s controversial imagery needs to go. The Massachusetts Seal, Flag, and Motto Advisory Commission is itself the second iteration of a group the Legislature created in 2021 amid a groundswell to replace a seal and flag long criticized as offensive to Native Americans. … the full 10-person panel has not gathered in a meeting since, nor has the commission held a series of legally mandated hearings to gather public input ahead of a Dec. 15 deadline to produce its recommendations.”

— For Wu, growing Boston’s economy starts with people, not cranes by Shirley Leung, The Boston Globe: “For decades, one way that Boston mayors measured success was by the number of construction cranes in the sky. Michelle Wu has been trumpeting another metric: The number of residents with good-paying jobs. Wu’s approach to growing the economy has been a departure from her predecessors. It’s one that has alienated real estate developers accustomed to having the mayor’s ear and can come across as anti-business with policies that drive up the cost of development. Yet as unpopular as she has been in parts of the real estate community, Wu has endeared herself with another crucial segment of Boston’s business world: companies hungry for skilled employees.”— In-office Fridays?

“In the wake of last week's atrocity, it is more important than ever to finish carrying out the president's mass deportation operation,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during Monday’s press briefing. “They must go back to their home countries.”

The Trump administration at the beginning of the president’s second term launched an unprecedented crackdown on all forms of immigration. The deadly shooting on the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, in a commercial area of the District of Columbia just blocks from the White House, has intensified the push.

The Department of Homeland Security in a social media post after the Wednesday attack called for immigrants to “remigrate,” which is a far-right concept in Europe that calls for the ethnic removal of non-white minority populations through mass migration.

“There is more work to be done,” Leavitt said, “because President Trump believes that he has a sacred obligation to reverse the calamity of mass unchecked migration into our country.”

The suspect in the guard shooting is a 29-year-old Afghan national who entered the country during the Biden administration through a special immigrant visa program for Afghan allies after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from the country in 2021.

Authorities identified him as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who worked for a CIA counterterrorism operation in Afghanistan, according to the New York Times. He was granted asylum under the Trump administration earlier this year.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia plans to charge Lakanwal with first-degree murder after one of the National Guard soldiers, U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died as a result of her injuries.

Still hospitalized is U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24. Trump has indicated he intends to honor both Beckstrom and Wolfe at the White House.

District officials said the shooting of guard members was “targeted,” but the motive remains under investigation.

Pauses on asylum

Leavitt said the Trump administration will continue “to limit migration, both illegal and legal,” after the shooting.

Separately on Wednesday, the administration ended Temporary Protected Status for more than 330,000 nationals from Haiti, opening them up for deportations by February.

Within hours of Wednesday's shooting, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services halted all immigration requests from Afghanistan nationals. On Thursday, USCIS head Joseph Edlow announced that by direction of Trump the agency would reexamine every green card application from “every country of concern,” which are the 19 countries on the president’s travel ban list.

And by Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio directed all U.S. embassies to suspend all visa approvals for individuals with passports from Afghanistan.

Over the weekend, Trump told reporters that those pauses on asylum could last “a long time,” although it’s unclear what authority the executive branch has to suspend a law created by Congress through the 1980 Refugee Act.

This is not the first time Trump has tried to end asylum this year, as there is a legal challenge to the president barring asylum seekers from making asylum claims at U.S. ports of entry.

Venezuelan boat strikes

During Monday’s press conference, Leavitt also defended the Trump administration’s continued deadly strikes on boats off the coast of Venezuela allegedly containing drugs. The attacks have been occurring since September.

The president and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have stated, without evidence, that the boats’ operators are narco-terrorists and that the strikes are legal, since they have taken place in international waters. Roughly 80 people have been killed in nearly two dozen attacks since September.

Leavitt disputed any questions of wrongdoing by the administration during a Sept. 2 strike, when two survivors clinging to boat wreckage were allegedly killed by a follow-on strike, as first reported by The Washington Post Friday.

“President Trump and Secretary Hegseth have made it clear that presidentially designated narco-terrorist groups are subject to lethal targeting in accordance with the laws of war,” Leavitt said, adding that Hegseth authorized a military commander to conduct the operation.

However, the attacks have raised concern among members of Congress, and following the Post story, the U.S. Senate and House Armed Services committees moved to open bipartisan inquiries into the military strikes, with a focus on the alleged follow-on attack that killed two survivors.

How the National Guard wound up in the district

Trump initially mobilized 800 National Guard troops to the nation’s capital in August after claiming a “crime emergency” in the district, despite a documented three-decade low in crime.

Many were instructed they would be carrying service weapons, The Wall Street Journal reported on Aug. 17. The White House effort was accompanied by a heightened U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presence in the district.

The mobilization then became tied up in court for months.

A federal district judge in the District of Columbia found the administration’s deployment of more than 2,000 guard troops in the city illegal but stayed her Nov. 20 decision for three weeks to give the administration time to appeal and remove the guard members from the district’s streets.

The guard troops had been expected to remain in the district through the end of February.

The administration filed an emergency motion in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for a stay to be issued on the order by Thursday. The administration filed the emergency motion the same day as the attack on the two National Guard members.

Trump ordered an additional 500 guard members to the district following the shooting.

The Joint Task Force District of Columbia has been overseeing guard operations in the district, including units from the district, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee and West Virginia.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-12/beckstrommemorial.jpg?h=a52b4261&itok=scyAXr-1,N,,2025-12-01 17:56:45.579504

25-5289 (DC Circuit).","FAIR shows President may send mass parolees home

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a brief in the DC Circuit Court of Appeals supporting the President’s authority to roll back Biden mass parole programs, which have let millions of aliens who are not immigrants pour into the United States.

In one parole program alone, the Biden administration let 532,000 aliens from four countries—Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela—sign up on an app and come to ports of entry, where they were given automatic parole and sent into the interior of the country. The Trump administration has acted to terminate these grants of parole, but anti-borders groups won an order blocking that termination from the DC federal district court.

In its brief on appeal of that order, FAIR shows that President Trump has authority directly from the Constitution to send these parolees home. The Supreme Court has long recognized that those given parole—which by statute must only be given case-by-case for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit, requirements Biden ignored—have not even entered the country in a legal sense. As far as the law is concerned, they are still at the border, wherever they are physically located. And the Court has also long recognized that the President has inherent constitutional authority to block aliens from entering the country.

“Because no President has the power to let in a vast influx of aliens Congress has excluded, Biden’s en masse parole programs were unlawful to begin with,” said Dale L. Wilcox, executive director and general counsel of FAIR. “At the same time, the Supreme Court could not have been clearer that the President has inherent power to block the entry of aliens, including these parolees. We hope the court sees how much the legal and constitutional landscape favors the President’s authority here, and reverses the lower court’s order.”

Detainers increase the safety of all parties involved because it allows ICE to arrest these individuals in a secure and controlled custodial setting as opposed to at-large where a criminal alien can continue harming the community in which they would have otherwise been released. Additionally, detainers conserve scarce government resources by allowing ICE to take criminal aliens into custody directly rather than expending resources locating these aliens at large.

DHS continues to focus its enforcement efforts on the most serious criminal offenders—including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, terrorists, and other dangerous individuals. Nationally, 70% of the illegal aliens arrested by ICE have criminal convictions or pending charges in the United States. This figure does not include those wanted for violent crimes in other countries, individuals with INTERPOL notices, human rights violators, gang members, terrorists, and others who pose significant threats to public safety.

Matt Grossmann: Who now directs spending? Congress or the President? This week on The Science of Politics. For the Niskanen Center, I’m Matt Grossmann. Donald Trump has taken extraordinary actions to redirect or ignore congressional appropriations, from dismantling foreign aid to making the education department a ghost town, to offering employee buyouts across government. But how unique are Trump’s efforts to redirect spending toward his priorities and avoid spending when he does not favor it?

This week, I talked to Kevin Angell of the University of Chicago about his new paper Who Has the Power of the Purse? He compares what Congress appropriated to what agencies actually spend, finding that presidents have long moved spending toward their preferences. Even after impoundment controls, presidents have found ways of not spending money they never requested from Congress. Trump is more blatant and could be more extreme, but administrations have long used their tools to obtain some power of the purse from Congress. I think you’ll enjoy our conversation. So tell us about the findings and takeaways from your new paper Who Has the Power of the Purse?

Kevin Angell: The main finding from my new paper is that presidents are able to influence government spending in a rather substantial way after they have agreed to a budget with Congress. So after they’ve done their negotiations with Congress, after Congress has passed the budget and the president signed it, presidents are still able to shift government spending so that it more closely reflects their priorities than is reflected in the original budget.

Matt Grossmann: And give us a sense of the size of these effects and how much they matter in terms of the actual policy outputs of government or potential outcomes from policy differences.

Kevin Angell: We see that the power is really concentrated in presidents trying to spend less than what Congress has passed and that these effects are pretty substantial. So for every about a dollar change in the President’s budget, we see about 40 cents less in spending that’s occurring in that year by that government subunit, which you can think of as a subset of an agency.

Matt Grossmann: Just to clarify, the president proposed $4 of spending, Congress proposed $5 of spending, and the president is able to move the final spending about 40% less than the difference between those two, that dollar, is that right?

Kevin Angell: Correct. We can think about this as, suppose we have two budgets, both of which Congress has passed $5 of spending. In one case, the president had wanted to spend $4 and the other case the President had wanted to spend say, $3. We’d expect that the president and his administration is going to spend about 40 cents less in the case where they asked for $3 than when they had asked for $4.

Matt Grossmann: Great. Give us some, I guess, more direct examples here. Where are these agencies differences between the president and Congress most common? Are there quintessential cases that come to mind where we can say there was a fight between Congress and the president, Congress won, but in the end, the president was able to get more by a couple of years later?

Kevin Angell: I think that one of the quintessential cases of this is actually slightly before the time period that I study, and we actually have really good evidence from our qualitative history about this happening. And that’s with the Truman administration. In aftermath of World War II, Truman and the House and Senate were in a dispute over how big the Air Force should be. The House, in particular, wanted a substantially larger Air Force than President Truman did.

And the way that Truman and the Congress resolved this is that Truman basically goes to the Senate, which shared his priority to have a smaller Air Force, and said, “Look, let’s just agree to the House number where we’ll accept the extra money that they’re going to appropriate for us, and then I’ll have a handshake deal with you, the Senate, that I’m just not going to spend it.” So what happened is that Congress passed the higher budget, President Truman signs the budget and then immediately places all of the extra funds into what he called reserves so that he didn’t ultimately have to spend it on the Air Force.

Matt Grossmann: And what about the contemporary mechanisms for this? Presidents maybe. Maybe we’re back to being that abrupt, but for a long while, I imagine that this was a little more hidden, or at least in the weeds in terms of hiring or contracting or materials cost. So what do we know about the actual mechanisms for this and how much is from the agency versus directed from the Office of Management and Budget of the White House?

Kevin Angell: First, what I’ll say is I’m going to bracket the last, call it, six years or so. This paper’s data ends in 2018 so I can’t speak to the current moment about exactly how it’s happening. And in many ways, I think as we’ll talk about later, things have definitely shifted in terms of the opaqueness and blatantness that this is occurring. But since the Impoundment Control Act in the 1970s, things have really shifted, so they are more opaque. Presidents haven’t been able to clearly and publicly give these direct orders to not spend funds. And that’s kind of been considered, based off of my interviews and my data analysis, to be the red line where presidents can come up with all sorts of other ways to justify not spending funds, whether that be program timing, whether it be changing paperwork, but they couldn’t say, “I’m doing this to not spend this money,” even if that might be the ultimate end result of that action.

So until the present moment, you’re right, presidents haven’t been able to say the goal is to impound funds. They look for other reasons to justify those changes. In terms of how this is happening, this relates to some work that I’m currently doing trying to disentangle whether this is changing in awarding the contracts or changing in the number of personnel that are employed. Those are very disparate data sets, and I don’t have final results to share there. But based off of some interviews with practitioners, this seems to be a product of, one, there’s a lot that has to do with administrative burden and administering these programs where presidents and their agencies can strategically change how much burden there is. But then also in terms of whether this is coming from the president or not, I’ve chatted with some folks, including some folks at independent agencies that say ultimately while they’re in control of it, they might and do definitely take into account the preferences of those who may have appointed them or otherwise influencing the budget when they’re making decisions about how much to spend their budget.

Matt Grossmann: So you can, of course, imagine innocent explanations for this underspending. “We were trying to hire someone, they didn’t accept our job, we contracted, but the contractor didn’t finish the work within the year,” those kinds of things. How much is there assigned that these kinds of explanations are partially responsible versus their excuses?

Kevin Angell: You’re totally correct that they’re all, like you said, innocent explanations for this. However, in my approach, what I’m doing is I’m trying to take account for those and look at changes that are clearly correlated with changes in how much presidents propose. Yes, there might be cases where the bridge goes over budget or maybe you get a great deal on your bridge contract and you come in under budget, but we shouldn’t see those only happening when presidents want them to happen.

If presidents don’t want to spend funds in a particular area, say public assistance, and what do you know that year there aren’t mysteriously the number of people who apply for public assistance drastically falls, that starts to look a lot less like random chance and more so like active implementation changes. I’m fairly confident, especially given the size of these effects, that this isn’t just due to one-off innocent impacts.

Matt Grossmann: But we might imagine that the president’s going to appoint people to the agencies where he wants to see cuts that also don’t think the money needs to be spent or that the budget could signal the kinds of priorities of the people in these agencies. I don’t know, how much evidence do we have that it really requires intervention rather than anticipation or the personnel at those agencies?

Kevin Angell: I think this is a really good point, Matt, and this is something that my paper doesn’t disentangle between, whether this is anticipation of a presidential directive or whether this is because of behind-the-scenes directed from the president. If anything, I perhaps myself would lean more towards this is due to anticipation or because presidents have appointed those who share their ideology. But if you think about the classic principal agent framework in which presidents are trying to exercise influence in an agency, whether or not the president is directly telling the head of an agency, “Don’t spend this money,” or is going and finding someone who is just going to not spend that money on their own, that might shape our understanding of exactly what we should expect and where we should look as we’re trying to investigate this, but it doesn’t change the overall effect that this money isn’t getting spent when Congress has instructed that it be spent.

Matt Grossmann: Regardless of the mechanisms or even the president as the cause here, it seems like this should really change our theories of how the president and Congress come to consensus on appropriations about bargaining, about the role of presidential power. How much should this change our theories of how the president and Congress interact, and does it explain any anomalies in budget deals that we’ve seen, maybe similar to that example that you mentioned about the Air Force?

Kevin Angell: Sure. I think one of the big ways that this should shape our understanding of congressional bargaining and presidential power is that the bargaining process doesn’t simply end with the adoption of legislation. And this is something we’ve seen pieces of in previous research about how policy decisions, whether that be where grants are made or who gets grants, that after the legislation has passed in Congress, all of a sudden the lobbying all shifts to the executive branch. So it goes from the halls of Congress to maybe the halls of the EEOB, the Eisenhower Executive Building, where a lot of the OMB staff sit. So I see this paper as really reinforcing the fact that as we’re considering who wins in the legislative bargain, we also need to take account who is able to win in executive implementation because the person that might look like a winner upfront might end up losing when it comes to the White House and the person who lost in Congress may be able to get their second chance by lobbying the president and the staff.

In terms of how this shapes our other understandings, one of the things that I really want to focus on is why this is occurring. You can think of three main reasons why Congress would allow this to happen. The first is that Congress just doesn’t have the information it needs at the time that it’s making its decisions to know about this. So this could be Congress doesn’t really know that this is happening, this is happening behind the scenes, and that’s why it’s continuing. The second idea might be that Congress does know about it and that they’re fine with it. You might imagine that Congress knows that they’re going to have to pass some things that they don’t particularly like, maybe some pork that they think is wasteful or whatnot, but they’re relying on the president to really exercise his management authority and cut those out so congressmen can go home to their congressional district and say, “Look, I got this pork for you. Go blame the President, he’s the one who cut it.”

And then the third one would be that Congress does know about it, but they’re unable to solve the collective action challenges that are necessary to enforcing their own budget legislation. This is the area that I think is probably perhaps most likely is that Congress faces this big issue, it’s got its committee system, it’s got all sorts of other areas where Congress is splitting its oversight. The people who might be most interested in the funds aren’t the ones with the best access to information about whether it’s spent or maybe they are, but they have different preferences in the rest of the chamber. So I really think that all those accounts can be really informed by this. And this opens up a lot of new lines for inquiry.

Matt Grossmann: It seems to explain some regularities that maybe seem odd without knowing yet. One is that the president submits a budget and Congress completely ignores it. We also have this idea that the appropriations committees are extremely powerful and usually get what they want. And yet we have the anomaly that people in the administration certainly spend a lot of time preparing the budgets for the president’s budget proposal. So maybe this does connect those together to say everybody is sort of acting in line with the findings. The presidential budget process is maybe not as much for winning in Congress, but for preparing afterwards. What do you think of that story?

Kevin Angell: When we talk about the government budget, I do want to be a little bit precise here. The president submits, at the start of every year, a budget that’s in compliance with the 1921 General Accounting Act, what we usually call the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. And then after they deliver that to Congress, Congress takes it and has a whole bunch of different appropriation bills and the usual process. Sometimes you get a nominal bust like we’ve had in recent years.

But what I think is important here is that, yes, in theory, Congress takes the president’s budget and throws it away. It’s actually not what we necessarily see in the data. There’s lots of cases where the number that comes out of Congress is the number that came in the president’s budget. So now whether that’s on important issues or not, I’ll leave individual readers to think, everyone has something they think is important. But empirically, we don’t see the budget being in Congress starting from scratch from the budget that the president submitted. That’s one of the reasons why the president is required to submit the budget.

… president submitted. That’s one of the reasons why the president is required to submit the budget, because this is an enormous task that Congress at the time didn’t have the resources and now probably doesn’t want to use its resources on producing that document from scratch.

In terms of the irregularities, I think what this really can highlight is the fact that the people who have the expert knowledge in this are going to be in the classical setting your committees and your committee members, and so those are going to be the people that are best empowered to cut those side deals with Congress because they’re the ones that are going to be exercising oversight of this moving forward. And so one area that I’m working on right now is looking at, are the people who have better access to resources in Congress, namely that committees, better able to see their priorities continue to be reflected in presidential implementation of the budget?

Matt Grossmann: So I know we don’t want to get too far into the weeds of your adventure collecting all of this data, but it sort of helps to explain why journalists and members of Congress maybe haven’t been as on this as you might expect. So how did you go about doing this? Why does it take two years to wait to get a final number? And how many people do you think have seen these discrepancies before and know about this process, at least within their agency or domain?

Kevin Angell: Yeah, so in terms of the process, what I did is I went back to those budget documents that presidents propose every year. We have them going back for decades. So I went and I found those scans, and for every subunit, so these are units inside of agencies, I went and I found how much the president asked for in that year’s document. I did that for all the agencies, and then I would go two years later when the president is required to submit, how much the budget actually ended up being and then how much the budget was actually spent. For each of those agencies, I gathered that itself and then I linked them up. And so all this data is coming from the budget. So in theory, anyone could have gone out and gathered this and could still do it, but especially when you’re trying to do it over multiple years, it just takes a long time. Like you said, presidents only submit the actuals about a year and a half later, so for the, say, 2022 budget, we’ll get the actuals in the 2024 budget.

And so at that point, may have had an election cycle, the people who were in Congress, when the budget was passed may be different, they might have different priorities. And so that lag I think is an important factor in explaining why we don’t have as much policing on this because Congress doesn’t have its own ability to do all its own accounting. It’s relying on, in many ways, OMB and other agencies inside the executive branch to do that accounting.

Matt Grossmann: And what about the second part? Is this kind of a known thing within these agencies when they’ve underspent and they know it before those final numbers are submitted, or is this kind of opaque to everyone until later?

Kevin Angell: I think the agencies would have the ability to know it themselves. Whether they know the exact number is going to depend on some of the timing of contracts at the end of the year. But I think it’s pretty fair to say that the agencies will have an understanding that they are under budget, especially in cases when… I will say agencies are much more worried about going over budget than they are under budget. Going over budget has much more severe penalties laid out in statute than underspending. And so my understanding from interviewing agency staff is that going over is their focus. They don’t mind going under, especially if they’re not going to face congressional repercussions, but that essentially do or die on making sure not to go over.

Matt Grossmann: So we know that the basic pattern is that these cuts happen most when presidents proposed underspending and that underspending is way more common than overspending. What are the other big variations? Were there some presidents that moved this a lot more than others? Are there certain kinds of budget accounts or agencies where this is easy?

Kevin Angell: The primary difference that I really see is between discretionary and mandatory spending, and I think this is something that isn’t necessarily obvious that it should fall in one or the other. So on one hand, discretionary spending, with its usually annual appropriations process, might have greater congressional oversight. It’s the Appropriations committee fighting for what the budget is each year, and they know what was spent last year; they’re reviewing the receipts as they’re moving forward. And so we might think that discretionary spending, this would happen less. On the other hand, we could make the same case for mandatory spending where Congress sets the eligibility formula for a particular program, and then the president goes off and implements it and is able to make all sorts of adjustments on exactly how to implement that without the same sort of annual oversight process. So conceptually, it’s not quite clear which one we should expect the most in.

What I see from the data is that very strong, I’d say… We see strong evidence that it’s predominantly focused on discretionary spending, so it’s inside of discretionary spending that presidents are able to exert this influence, whereas we don’t see that in our mandatory spending programs.

Matt Grossmann: You explained a bit that it is much more common to see underspending than overspending. Give us a little bit of the reasons for that. Are these political constraints? Are they just kind of administrative patterns? And why doesn’t this give an inherent advantage to conservative presidents? Why don’t we see the big changes being Republican presidents facing Democratic congresses? Is it because they don’t really have the differences in priorities that we expect, or is there some other explanation?

Kevin Angell: Yeah. So in terms of why we see differences in overspending and underspending, the first thing we want to highlight is that the two operate under very different legal regimes. Overspending is governed by what’s known as the Anti-Deficiency Act, which actually carries both criminal and administrative penalties for violating it. So if you’re involved in spending money without congressional authorization, spending money that shouldn’t be spent, you can actually be prosecuted for that. Whereas if you don’t spend money that has been authorized, you might get an Impoundment Control Act investigation initiated against you by GAO, but there’s no clear penalties for that.

And so one thing that I can highlight is at the heart of the first Trump impeachment, which we cannot classically hear about it being the Ukraine scandal, at the heart of that was an Impoundment Control Act violation. Money was supposed to be spent that wasn’t. Ultimately President Trump was impeached for it, though he wasn’t convicted. So if you’re a civil servant, that might be a much more remote penalty to you than if you authorize an overspending and you potentially get criminally charged for that. So that’s kind of one reason why I think that this predominates and can be reflected of this.

In my conversations with staff, OMB systems, agency systems are all set up to be very, very strict about overspending, so if you try to go in and spend money that your agency doesn’t have, in some cases it’s quite literally hard-coded you can’t do that. In other cases, it sends up all sorts of alarm bells. Whereas there’s not the equivalent on the underspending side. It’s not like there’s an alarm bell that goes off if you spend 95%, not 100% of your budget. And if there are controls, it’s very much weaker than preventing you from putting in that payment that is going over your budget.

In terms of how this plays out partisan-wise, I do want to make a distinction between the ability to influence and how much the presidents actually use that influence. So seeing the data is that when presidents tried to underspend, presidents are equally successful regardless of their party. So Democrats have the same ability to underspend as Republicans do, but sure, we see Republicans do this more frequently. They want to spend less money in general, at least that’s what classical understanding says, and so they in fact do propose more spending cuts and implement more spending cuts.

But I think the one reason why we don’t see this massive focus on it’s only Republicans is that everyone can find some government spending that they don’t like. It might be in different areas. Using the contemporary situation, perhaps Democrats want to spend more on public assistance, but they want to spend a whole lot less on, say, ICE. Whereas Republicans might be the reverse. So everyone likes their own pot of government spending, but that means they equally don’t like other areas. You can see this in the Department of Agriculture, this huge department, and I look at some pieces of it, but it encompasses everything from food assistance for needy Americans to crop subsidies to farmers. And so you might think that even inside what we look as, oh, agriculture spending, you still have parts of it that you like and parts of it that you don’t.

Matt Grossmann: So just to clarify, Republican presidents overall do request bigger cuts compared to congressional appropriations; they just move it about as much in the same direction as Democrats. Is that right?

Kevin Angell: That’s correct. And so one other thing to add here is that, why don’t we see Republican presidents maybe taking this to the limit? The classic understanding is that not giving people funds is likely going to perhaps be more painful than if everyone gets extra. If you think about your administering a grant program and you spend over, an extra organization gets a grant, you’re not necessarily going to have as many people calling and yelling at you than if you were to tell a bunch of organizations, “Actually, this year, you don’t get your funding.” And so there are these natural factors that influence underspending and overspending. Underspending might get more angry phone calls, overspending, harsher penalties, and at some point there’s just not money left in the bank.

Matt Grossmann: So the folk history of this is that it was kind of going on a little bit for a while, but that Nixon really took it to an extreme, and then Congress responded to that with a policy change that had more teeth. How much does that really show up in your data? And if this wasn’t a solution, why wasn’t it? And is this just a story of the continuity is there and just the legal justifications and routes change, or are there real breaks when we notice?

Kevin Angell: So the first piece of that that I’ll tackle is, what is different about Nixon? So if we look at the different breakdowns by president, Nixon doesn’t really stand out as particularly an outlier in how much funding he’s influenced. But what you do see if you read some of the more qualitative accounts is that, one, that the type of program that he goes after is different than what happened in the immediate past. So prior to that, a lot more had been in your defense or national security areas, whereas Nixon really drives it home with domestic assistance programs, most notably, say, urban renewal or urban development. So you’re right that Congress does come out and they pass the Impoundment Control Act, but I really want to highlight, it’s actually a cluster of three reforms and cases that really could be doing the work. And so in my paper, I don’t highlight on any specific one. I just do, “Look, we have these three reforms that happen over these two years, and what we can see is before and after that.”

So we have the Impoundment Control Act, which tries to create this categories for how presidents can propose deferrals or rescissions. We have a case called Train v. New York, which is a litigation about what existing statutes allowed the president to do. And Train v. New York, it said that presidents were exceeding their authority under existing statutes to impound funds. And then the third one is there’s a revision to the Anti-Deficiency Act, which Congress intended to pass to prevent presidents from overspending, while also allowing them to set aside funds to account for things like inflation or changing circumstances. But that gets really tightened in the 1970s because previously presidents had said, “Look, we know you passed this law to keep people from spending too much, but one way we can keep from spending too much is we can decide that we don’t want to spend any of this,” and Congress was reacting to that misuse in their view of the Anti-Deficiency Act.

In terms of how this changes before and after, you’re right, it introduces a whole new regime where now presidents are required to follow these set procedures when they want to not spend funds, but I want to highlight, the Impoundment Control Act isn’t that clear of a law, and there’s not clear enforcement mechanisms. Like I mentioned earlier in the interview, there’s no criminal penalties for violating it. It’s also not clear what in fact an ICA violation is. I’ll defer to the lawyers on this; there’s a whole history there. But some basic facts that we think we know. Does the Comptroller General have the ability to sue in federal court to enforce spending? The statute gives them that power, but that ability and the constitutionality of that has never been tested. The Comptroller General has only ever filed suit once and dropped that suit because the administration released the funds before it carried forward.

And so there’s a lot of uncertainty with how this is going to come out if this is litigated. There’s categories like programmatic delays or deferrals that kind of are created by GAO to classify things that are these innocuous reasons why money isn’t spent, but those don’t have a clear definition in statute; it’s not in the Impoundment Control Act. And so what you’re seeing now and what you see after the ICA is passed is that presidents are looking and poking around and trying to find the holes, and I would say my paper is-

… holes and I would say my paper is evidence that they have been successful in finding holes.

Matt Grossmann: And just to clarify, did it take them a while or do we not really see any difference in terms of Ford and Carter and Reagan? They were all able to kind of influence appropriations right away?

Kevin Angell: Yeah. So if I make a little bit more assumptions in the data analysis process, I am able to plot a yearly estimate of how much influence presidents have. And so what you do see there is it looks like there’s a pretty sharp drop right around the Impoundment Control Act, the ADA revision and Train vs. New York, although it rebounds afterwards. So I want to be cautious about not over interpreting that, but I think it’s suggestive evidence that it at least did take the presidents a little bit of time to figure out how to operate under the new regime.

I will say one of the surprising things and that I’m currently investigating right now, is why does Nixon sign the Impoundment Control Act? There’s actually a famous political cartoon where Nixon has three henchmen that he’s using to control Congress. One is the veto power, one is executive privilege and one is impoundment, yet Nixon rolls over quickly and signs the ICA. So it makes you wonder what was going through Nixon’s head about why he allowed this. Did he just think, well, I can survive the formal restriction by coming up with all sorts of new means or what was happening?

Matt Grossmann: A lot of people think we’re at another big break in our time series with the second Trump administration. I know that you have no data from the new administration and you have only a couple of years of data from the first Trump administration. But I want to talk a little bit about it, at least let’s just start, theoretically.

One story is that this is just an administration with very different preferences. So these budgets, and particularly Russ Vought’s vision of government is just very different. So even if Trump was only able to influence spending as much as previous presidents, he just starts with a very different preference. So 30% or 40% of his moves would just be huge moves. How should we think about that, sort of the breadth of the vision here versus the abilities and tools?

Kevin Angell: I think that there’s kind of two areas to focus on here. The first one is the openness with which it’s being done. And the second one, and I’ll bracket that for now, is the scale at which it’s being done on. The first thing with openness, the previous rule of thumb that had existed prior to the first Trump administration that actually some things happened related to it in the Biden administration, was that if you were trying to not spend funds, you didn’t come out and say it, because if you came out and say it, that would be a clear trigger for a GAO investigation. Now all of a sudden you have the president on record, or agency staff member on record saying, the reason why we’re doing this is because we don’t want to spend funds.

That makes it very hard to claim that actually no, this is about some program decision that has incidental impacts on not spending funds, but is actually because of some program priority. And so what we see here is even prior to the Trump administration taking office for their second term, President Trump was pretty clear that he believed the Impoundment Control Act to be unconstitutional, that he wanted it to be challenged in court. And as we can see in Roosevelt’s confirmation hearings, he’s pretty clear that he supports the position of administration. In the administration’s opinion, the ICA is unconstitutional and they seem to be eager for a challenge to it. And so I think part of this is trying to push the limit because they want that lawsuit. They want that Supreme Court decision that strikes down the Impoundment Control Act, and this is their way of triggering that.

In terms of the scale, I think one of the pieces that really you see openly here that you didn’t see before is in personnel, which opens a whole nother can of worms because personnel politics are very complicated, you have all sorts of regulations for how and when you can fire people, under what reasons. And so that’s something that we’re seeing openly happen in the Trump administration that at least wasn’t on the surface happening prior to it, although I am doing more research to see how much was this adjustments. Although I think it’s fair to say that to the scale that we know DOGE, where the focus is on the riffing of thousands of people, I haven’t seen any instances of that in previous impoundment discussions.

Matt Grossmann: And then just did you want to address this kind of theoretical issue of how should we think about it, if it ends up being the case that Trump is no better at moving things towards his priorities, but just that they’re just so different than Congress says, that the spending reductions are going to look bigger because the proposed reductions are bigger?

Kevin Angell: Yeah, I think theoretically the question to ask here is normally, do we want this to occur and do we want presidents to be able to shift by a percentage rather than give them a subset flexibility? I think it’s conceivable that a reform might be, look, presidents have X percent on either side that they can spend as kind of discretionary funds, but that outside of that there’s stricter guardrails. And so as we’re considering what does it mean for the Trump administration to try to cut spending and should we restrict it, we have to ask ourselves normally what do we want and why? And if we want flexibility, why do we want flexibility? I don’t think in many people’s mind flexibility in itself is the goal, it’s to have some sort of better government outcome.

Matt Grossmann: So you said that there wasn’t much precedent or you couldn’t find much precedent for the DOGE or reduction in forces. I know that they also kind of canceled a bunch of contracts for future spending in DOGE. And then we have these examples like USAID where a whole agency has kind of been moved within the State Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau where they tried to kind of zero out the accounts. Are there proto versions of those kinds of moves in your data or anything that we could look on as precedent for that?

Kevin Angell: Yes. I mean, there’s lots of examples of government trying to modernize and reorganization. And Congress has gone through various iterations where they’ve delegated different authority to the president to reorganize executive departments. And there’s mechanisms inside of various budget bills where you can reprogram funds that are meant for one purpose to another related purpose.

But I do think that, we haven’t seen this example where government departments have become this key focus of a DOGE-like instrument. Republicans for a long time talked about getting rid of the Department of Education, and there were lots of plans for doing so. Legislation got proposed, et cetera, but we didn’t have this DOGE equivalent that just went in and sent everyone home until the current moment. So again, normally it’s up to listeners to know whether they want presidents to have this flexibility, but it’s not clear what the limit is on that.

Matt Grossmann: So one of the reasons that they’ve been able to do more is that they’re not maybe as constrained by the courts as people expected. It takes the contractors or the people who would lose money to have standing, they’re often told to go to specific government courts to adjudicate their own contracts rather than bring a broader one. They have been winning a lot of lower level rulings but then are overruled by Supreme Court rulings. How did previous presidents think about this? Did they think there was really a court block on going too far or has this just sort of always been available and Trump is kind of the first to push the envelope?

Kevin Angell: I think that before we focus on the court enforcement of the spending, one of the things I want to highlight is one of the natural ways that Congress, or I shouldn’t say natural, one of the frequent ways that Congress has required an enforced presence to spend funds has been through a tool known as committee reports. These are essentially specific requests or directions or suggestions, depending on what language is used, made by the committee to the agency for how money should be spent. And so the classical understanding is the way that Congress would oversee if presidents didn’t spend the money in a particular area, is that if an agency wasn’t spending funds, there’d be some sort of oversight hearing or communication from the chair ranking member about, “Hey, Mr. Secretary, please, you’d better spend these funds.” And then there’d be threatened retribution against next year’s budget for that agency if those funds weren’t spent.

And so this is prior to the year even ending. You have this, and it is not really happening in the courts, it’s happening via this congressional oversight. That’s something that has changed over the years as we’ve moved away from all these separate appropriations bills towards omnibuses, exactly what committee reports are doing. What if that is adopted in, who’s conducting that oversight, has started to get a little bit murky. And so that’s the classical way this is addressed rather than through a court case. Although we’ve had our share of those, Train vs. New York, like I mentioned before, was an example of New York City not receiving the funds that it believed it was entitled to. And they did litigate that. But I think in previous years we just saw this addressed through congressional oversight rather than judicial oversight.

Matt Grossmann: And we do have a curious case here where the president, or at least DOGE wanted to tout the amount of spending that they saved, and it turned out that the numbers didn’t seem to bear that out. We also have people trying to verify the daily government spending amounts overall, and saying that not as much is changing as it might look. I know that you have to wait a year and a half to see what actually happened here, but do you think there’s a case that actually not as much is happening as people think, or do you think we are really going to see real shifts this year?

Kevin Angell: I’m not sure, Matt, and a couple of reasons why is one, we had these banner changes in how much was spent and canceling of contracts. At the same time, we did see at the end, a few different agencies rush to get money out the door towards their preferred grant recipients or their preferred programs. And so I am not quite sure how much has gone out the door, because especially if they go out the door at the end, there’s a lag for when those actually show up in the various government recording systems.

So I’ll be very interested to see, and I’ll be tracking it closely as we start to get the data, but I don’t know that we know right now at a macro level how much change we’ll see. In general, I’m a little bit skeptical that you can really turn around a government and slash spending all this quickly, especially without legislation. I mean, we did have a rescissions package that went through, but relative to the scale that the DOGE team was trying to cut, I think that rescissions package was quite small, although it was large in absolute terms. And we’ll have to see what happens as, like I said, as the data comes in.

Matt Grossmann: So yeah, we did actually pass one rescissions package and then we had one pocket rescission officially kind of move forward. And that does seem to be at least one kind of acknowledged error in the Impoundment Control Act, is that it does enable these very late requests that Congress doesn’t have time to respond to.

So let’s say that at least maybe under the next Democratic president, we do start to get some, at least behind the scenes, work on an update to the Impoundment Control Act and some effort to kind of rein in the president here. What would those kinds of tools look like or reforms look like? And does the history here suggest that this is not something that’s going to work for very long because presidents are going to find a way around it?

Kevin Angell: Yeah, I think in terms of what a reform would look like, one that I could see happening is just clearer definitions for what all the terms mean in the Impoundment Control Act. So I think there’s a broad recognition that Congress can’t say you have to spend exactly $1 billion, and if there’s one over, one under, this is some sort of major crisis. It’s hard for me to go to the grocery store and spend exactly 20 bucks, much less trying to spend $20 billion on a complicated government program. So because of that, I would expect that there’d be some sort of definition for how much leeway is okay. And then inside of that band, you’re going to have congressional oversight for, are those justifications valid? And then outside of those bands, you’re going to have much stronger judicial oversight for, okay, this isn’t just a question of does Congress buy your declaration that this is necessary, now it’s a legal consequence if it hasn’t met certain requirements.

So I would expect that to be one. I would imagine there’d be a discussion about how many votes does it take to pass a rescissions request? In some ways, when things go through budget reconciliation, the threshold is the same as it is with a rescission. It’s a bare majority, but that doesn’t reflect what’s needed in a traditional bill to overcome the filibuster. So I imagine there’ll be just some discussion over there. The reason why the ICA does privilege that bill is because there’s a recognition that Congress should vote on this before the end of the fiscal year, or at least quickly, so that the president has his instruction-

… at least quickly so that the president has his instructions on what to spend. So there could be tweaks about maybe not just they have 45 days to do it, but a vote must be held and on other forms on that front.

In terms of the effectiveness, I’m not really sure. We’d have to assess any bill that came out to really understand what effects it would have. I would say presidents are pretty protective of this. Presidents don’t want to give up this discretion and have in the past fought to avoid it.

One thing that is a possibility and that I do want to raise is that in previous instances of this, going back to as far as FDR is when I have evidence of it, when there has been concern about presidents impounding funds, presidents have been very skillful at mollifying or assuaging the concerns of the key senators to prevent them from going after discretion overall.

So there’s a famous case under FDR. FDR impounds funds for a dam during World War II. Congress starts to put the fit about this, particularly the Senator who’s concerned with this dam being built. A writer gets floated to limit on the president’s ability to impound funds generally. What do you know that the senator gets his dam and the writer disappears? So that’s a whole lot of politics there and going beyond my expertise in forecasting how the political aspect is going to turn out. But I wouldn’t be surprised if we had some sort of deal being cut to assuage concerns on a particular set of areas in exchange for there not being a wholesale reform of the ICA.

Matt Grossmann: So we had on another episode, we covered the history of war powers, and the timeline is sort of remarkably similar in that the president gains powers that were previously thought to reside in Congress. There’s attempted reforms, but they don’t really change the underlying facts on the ground. And you did title your paper about the power of the purse and kind of point to these sort of fundamental constitutional issues, so is it fair to say that this is kind of another example that the executive is kind of going to gain power over time and that kind of regardless of where the Constitution vests power, that the system has centralizing of power in the Executive Branch built in?

Kevin Angell: I think in many ways you’re right that this is reflective of a broader trend towards centralization of power in the Executive Branch. I won’t go so far as to say that’s inherent to the system that we’ve built and that in the sense that it’s unstoppable. I mean, I think one of the reasons why we’ve had a centralization of powering of the president is one, Congress has all these collective action problems that might naturally push power towards the president, but also a lot of these functions have been things that Congress has gone along with and in many cases has willingly delegated.

So take a requirement that the president be the one to do all the accounting and to present the annual budget. That goes back to 1921. That isn’t necessarily a presidential function. Congress could have established an agency that takes on that function and reports to it. We could imagine some supersized CBO that just wasn’t about legislative scoring but was actually about drafting a comprehensive budget in advance of the president doing it, or maybe the president doesn’t do it at all. And so this centralization I think is both a function of national forces, but also Congress and in many cases, the American people, or at least people point to the American people as wanting this power to shift to the president.

So everyone lines up differently. I’m a big fan of Congress when it’s writing its budget legislation to be specific what it wants, because it is constitutionally the first branch and has the ability to exercise power over the purse. But if it’s vague about what it wants or its instructions, I think we’re going to see presidents try to exploit that vagueness if Congress hasn’t been as specific as possible and doesn’t have the oversight that it needs.

Matt Grossmann: Yeah. So if you’re willing, just help us think through a little bit of this normative implications here, at least a couple of, I guess, more of the sort of straightforward arguments why this might be acceptable. First of all is that agencies just might know best, and if the alternative is we’re going to buy a bunch of computers on the last day of the fiscal year because we have to spend this amount, then maybe this is better than that. And then second, I guess, is the issue that the system doesn’t have a whole lot of built-in mechanisms for spending less. We do have out of control deficit spending relative to the amount we’re willing to tax. So is this a reasonable overall check on that?

Kevin Angell: I mean, I think one of the big concerns that I have about this process is the fact that it’s not transparent. You can go look up and see what did Congress pass for this budget and who voted against it, who voted for it, what’s the legislative history of that? But if this is happening kind of behind closed doors, it’s not subject to the FOIA process because it’s all deliberative decisions and things of that nature, or at least one could make an argument. There’s real questions about, yes, the agency might say this is best, but what went into that? Was there opportunity for comment by individuals? Is this consistent with what the legislatures intended? So I think that is a major normative concern, regardless of where you fall on whether or not we want presidential discretion.

In terms of, do agencies just know best on what to spend on? I think political science tells us that agencies likely are going to have perhaps different preferences than those who are providing their budget. You might imagine that the military is going to want to spend more money on the military and the EPA is going to want to spend more money in environmental regulation, and that might not be shared by either the president or Congress or the American public. And so yes, we can point to cases where an agency bought a bunch of very nice office chairs, I could use a new office chair myself, on the last day and say, “Okay, this is waste.” But as you try to scale up, just differentiating waste or what adequate spending is gets pretty hard.

And because let’s take an example of even something on a bridge, right? So Congress gets specific and says, “You must build this one bridge, here’s the budget to do so.” Congress is likely not legislating exact dimensions of the bridge or how good the concrete is or what color it should be painted and all these sorts of things that do have implications for how much it costs.

And so I’m in favor of Congress providing a more clear criteria to agencies for what it considers best and how it should weigh, all these different decisions. But at the end, if that decision making process is opaque, it’s hard for the American public to assess whether they think it’s done right and is a normative challenge.

Matt Grossmann: So on the other side, I want to give you a chance to address the argument that there’s a big shift in the second Trump administration. We’re descending into authoritarianism and you’re papering it over here, Kevin, by saying this is a long-term trend and that presidents have kind of always been able to do that and that there aren’t kind of real lines being crossed here. So what would you say to that?

Kevin Angell: I guess the first thing that I would say is I started this project before the second Trump administration and so this isn’t a paper that’s in reaction to it. This was long going before it. I’m going to keep studying this during this administration, during the next administration, whoever it might be. And so this is in no way, shape, or form trying to weigh in on the merits or the normative implications of this discretion.

And in my view, in order for us to make a decision about how much discretion there should occur, we need to understand how much is happening right now. And previously to, I think, the current moment in political science, a lot of political scientists just assumed that there was none or at least not ones that were big enough for us to pick up. And so I see this paper as really showing that actually no, even with the current situation, even with the Impoundment Control Act prior to the Trump administration, there were holes in it the presidents were able to exploit.

And so like I mentioned before, there are differences with the current moment or at least looks to be both in terms of size and blatantness. And we didn’t even tackle all the sorts of things about in all the DOGE rifts and the firings and the layoffs, were proper procedures being followed, et cetera. So like I said, this is in no means meant to defend any current practices. I don’t have data on them even if I wanted to, and it’s just meant to inform both the public, political scientists, and policymakers about what’s happened in the past. We can make better decisions about as we look towards reforming the process, what worked in the past. You can’t stamp something out if you don’t know if your past efforts worked.

Matt Grossmann: And is there anything we didn’t get to that you wanted to include or anything you want to tell about what is next?

Kevin Angell: Yeah. So first off, I want to say thank you to a couple of funders, the National Science Foundation, the Levin Center for Oversight Democracy, as well as the Bach Fellowship for Congressional Studies for the generous financial support. That also comes with a disclaimer that all the views that I express in this podcast are my own and don’t reflect that of any of those funders. So the information you got today is my own opinion and exactly that and doesn’t necessarily reflect the NSF, the Bach Foundation, or the Levin Center.

In terms of what’s coming next, I’m working on follow-up papers to explore a lot of the dynamics I alluded to here, whether that be if the adjustments to spending are due to personnel changes or due to contracting, how presidents are able to exercise or take advantage of this influence, whether that be through appointments or direct decisions or politicized agencies. I think there’s a lot of conflicting theories for where we should see this. On one hand, in politicized agencies, presidents might have the most ability to exercise this discretion. On the other hand, in those politicized agencies, presidents might not have any need to because if people are controlling the spending that agree with you, they can go spend it on areas that you like rather than you needing to just halt the spending altogether.

So lots in store. I’ll keep doing my interviews with practitioners and Congress and the agencies. Those got put on pause a little bit with the government shutdown, so that definitely road blocked my research for a bit, but much more of that to come.",https://www.niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/iStock-621905776-1200x630.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 16:58:02.388590

Their rap sheets cumulatively include attempted murder, thousands of assaults, and hundreds of burglaries, robberies, drug offenses, weapons offenses and sexual predatory offenses.
Also caught and released by New York authorities was career criminal migrant Alexander Moreno Montoya, who has charges including assaulting a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon and cocaine possession.
“We are calling on Letitia James to stop this dangerous derangement and commit to honoring the ICE arrest detainers of the more than 7,000 criminal illegal aliens in New York’s custody.
Criminal illegal aliens should not be released back onto our streets to terrorize more innocent Americans.”","New York state has released nearly 7,000 known illegal migrant criminals without notifying ICE since President Trump took over, and has more than 7,000 others locked up in jails and prisons, the Department of Homeland Security revealed.

All of them are being protected by sanctuary laws, DHS says, and the feds are now demanding that New York Attorney General Letitia James hand them over so they can be deported, according to a letter DHS sent to the state’s embattled top lawyer Monday.

The feds laid out how many of the migrants have been involved in thousands of crimes — including violent offenses — but have been released back into the community or on bail or parole — all without notifying ICE.

“These are people who are not only in the country illegally, but who have committed additional crimes, including heinous crimes like murder, rape, possession of child pornography, armed robbery, and many others,” a demand letter penned by acting ICE Director Todd Lyons sent to the AG’s office Monday.

The letter obtained by The Post points to a staggering 6,947 illegal aliens with active ICE detainers who were released back onto New York streets since Jan. 20.

Their rap sheets cumulatively include attempted murder, thousands of assaults, and hundreds of burglaries, robberies, drug offenses, weapons offenses and sexual predatory offenses.

New York’s sanctuary laws tie the hands of law enforcement when cooperating with immigration agents, which means instead of being deported to their countries of origin, they were simply turned loose.

“Virtually all Americans agree that people like this should be swiftly removed from the United States when they leave New York’s custody and not be returned to our streets to wreak havoc on law abiding citizens,” Lyons wrote.

Currently, ICE says, another 7,113 aliens are locked up in New York with active detainers, who are responsible for a combined 148 homicides, 717 assaults, 134 burglaries, 106 robberies, 235 dangerous drug offenses, 152 weapons offenses and 260 sexual predatory offenses.

The letter follows a similar missive sent to James on Sept. 15, which DHS says she ignored.

James’ office referred The Post to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office.

The agency included a supplemental with its letter highlighting a dozen migrants with heinous criminal histories who were released from custody in New York in recent months rather than being turned over to immigration authorities.

Among them was Anderson Smith Satuye Martinez, a Crips gang member with a prior assault conviction who was busted Aug. 19 for criminal possession of a weapon and possession of a controlled substance. Despite an ICE detainer lodged against him, he was released by local authorities before ICE picked him up again on Sept. 11 in the Bronx.

ICE also locked up Jose David Hernandez Hernandez, who was arrested for rape, strangulation and assault before being released. After immigration agents’ intervention, he’s now in ICE custody awaiting the outcome of deportation proceedings.

Also caught and released by New York authorities was career criminal migrant Alexander Moreno Montoya, who has charges including assaulting a police officer, criminal possession of a weapon and cocaine possession.

Although he was under an ICE detainer, he was released from Rikers Island on March 17, only to be caught by ICE ERO NYC on July 7 and removed from the US.

“Please confirm whether the State of New York plans to honor detainers on these aliens or whether each of these barbarians will someday walk the streets of New York again,” the letter to James pointedly concludes.

“Attorney General James and her fellow New York Sanctuary politicians are releasing murderers, terrorists, and sexual predators back into our neighborhoods and putting American lives at risk,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement to The Post.

“We are calling on Letitia James to stop this dangerous derangement and commit to honoring the ICE arrest detainers of the more than 7,000 criminal illegal aliens in New York’s custody. It is common sense. Criminal illegal aliens should not be released back onto our streets to terrorize more innocent Americans.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116515245.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200,N,,2025-12-01 16:58:21.310587

The states may each provide the federal government with 1,000 random driver’s license records for verification to help improve the database.
The settlement involves several states that have left the Electronic Registration Information Center, a nonprofit that helps roughly two dozen states update their voter rolls.
Becker said that the DHS data has gotten mixed reviews for accuracy, and states that have tried to make a big splash investigating immigrant voting have come up nearly empty handed.
“If I were a resident of one of those states, I’d be very concerned about my information security,” he said.","Officials from four Republican-led states reached an agreement with the Department of Homeland Security making it easier for states to access immigration data used to investigate potential migrant voting.

The settlement between DHS and officials from Florida, Indiana, Iowa, and Ohio—filed Friday in federal court, ahead of the case’s dismissal on Monday—resolves a quartet of federal lawsuits pursued since 2024 as part of broader efforts by conservatives to combat illegal voting by immigrants, which studies have shown is exceedingly rare.

The states will negotiate with the federal government within three months to enter new information sharing agreements to help improve and modernize DHS’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements database. The states may each provide the federal government with 1,000 random driver’s license records for verification to help improve the database.

“In 2024, Florida sued the Biden admin over its refusal to follow federal law and provide immigration information to ensure only U.S. citizens were voting in our elections,” Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (R) posted Monday on X. “Thanks to the Trump admin, we’ve reached an historic agreement that will provide the states with an invaluable amount of immigration information so we can protect our elections for years to come.”

DHS has two months to ensure the database has certain capabilities, according to the agreement. They include free service for state and local agencies, the ability to use Social Security Administration data for certain searches, the capacity for states to bulk upload verification requests, and the ability to obtain immigration-status information either within two days or within a reasonable period.

Certain other outstanding verification requests made with the federal government must also be fulfilled within a month.

The settlement involves several states that have left the Electronic Registration Information Center, a nonprofit that helps roughly two dozen states update their voter rolls. Instead of using that secure process, these states appear to be giving the “crown jewels” of personal identifiable information to the Trump administration which has already uploaded such things to vulnerable servers, said David Becker, the executive director of the nonpartisan nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research.

“If you can find people that for whatever reason are ineligible, states should remove them. The question is at what cost?” he said.

Consolidated Suit

The states filed their lawsuits separately but joined together on Friday in the US District Court for the Northern District of Florida for a new combined complaint before filing the settlement agreement. A similar lawsuit filed in Texas remains pending.

The agreement could supercharge enforcement by Uthmeier, who’s made prosecuting migrants a focus in his first year in office. Uthmeier has supported local efforts to prosecute migrants using Florida’s criminal code and has touted work by his branch’s Office of Statewide Prosecution, which received permission to prosecute migrant voting crimes by a Florida appeals court.

Similar efforts are underway in Ohio, where Secretary of State Frank LaRose (R) has made criminal referrals to the state attorney general’s office and the Justice Department for what he said were suspected election-related crimes.

“Ohio has a duty to ensure that only US citizens are registered to vote, and this agreement gives us the tools to do that job right,” LaRose said in a news release Monday.

Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird (R) said in a news release Monday that the agreement “will help Iowa safeguard the integrity of our elections for years to come by preventing an illegal vote to cancel out the vote of Iowa citizens.”

A DHS spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Becker said that the DHS data has gotten mixed reviews for accuracy, and states that have tried to make a big splash investigating immigrant voting have come up nearly empty handed. Texas has claimed that thousands of noncitizens were registered but has prosecuted only a few dozen, while LaRose claimed there were hundreds of examples but only a handful of cases were pursued.

States have to weigh these cases against potentially supplying residents’ dates of birth, drivers’ license numbers, and Social Security numbers to an administration that uploaded Social Security numbers to an unsecured cloud server and inadvertently released the governor-elect of New Jersey’s full number this year.

“If I were a resident of one of those states, I’d be very concerned about my information security,” he said. “What happens if the federal government accidentally releases this information—if someone applies for a fraudulent mortgage using data they never should have had, where does a person go to receive compensation?”

The settlement represents a seismic shift in election administration that moves the country closer toward a centralized voter information system controlled by federal agencies and accessible for statewide purges.","In a sweeping settlement with four Republican-led states, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has agreed to redesign its federal immigration database to serve voter “verification” purposes — a dramatic expansion of federal data that voting rights advocates have long warned could supercharge wrongful purges and threaten voter privacy.

The agreement, filed in federal court last week, compels DHS to retrofit the decades-old Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) program — a system built to determine eligibility for federal public benefits, not citizenship status or voting eligibility.

Under pressure from Florida, Indiana, Iowa and Ohio, DHS will now make SAVE capable of mass, automated citizenship checks using Social Security numbers and state driver’s license data, despite long-standing warnings that the system is structurally ill-suited for voter verification and prone to flagging U.S. citizens as potential noncitizens.

“Within 90 days of the execution of this Settlement Agreement, and consistent with any new ISA, representatives from each State Plaintiff (i.e., Florida, Ohio, Iowa, and Indiana) may provide Defendants with 1,000 randomly selected driver’s license records from their state (including First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Driver’s License Number or State Identification Number, and State of issuance), for which verification is requested, and for assistance in developing and improving functionality for SAVE by making state-level data available to SAVE,” the settlement reads.

That means state DMVs — where most voters register and where some of the most sensitive personal information is stored — may become sources feeding a federal system never considered for election administration.

The terms of the agreement are set to remain in force for at least two decades, allowing the states to demand continued federal cooperation regardless of who occupies the White House.

The settlement also compels DHS to fundamentally restructure the SAVE system’s internal machinery. The agency must incorporate Social Security data, expand the system’s search options and allow states to submit massive batches of voter information at once.

The agreement requires, among other upgrades, “Free service for state, territorial, tribal, and local government agencies,” as well as “The capacity to process bulk upload verification requests so that users of the system will not need to input verification requests one-by-one.”

While the lawsuit involved only four states, the settlement’s impact is national.

Because DHS agreed to rewrite the underlying SAVE system itself — not just its agreements with Florida, Ohio, Indiana and Iowa — every state that uses SAVE will gain access to these new bulk-search tools, Social Security–based matching and expanded data checks once the upgrades are implemented.

States could run entire voter lists through a system that has repeatedly been shown to misidentify naturalized citizens, married voters who changed their names and anyone whose records contain minor inconsistencies.

And the system’s reach may grow even further.

DHS explicitly reserved the option to explore enhancements that would allow citizenship checks with even less information.

“Defendants may, in their discretion, undertake a feasibility study to determine whether the SAVE system could be enhanced or another system developed that would allow Plaintiffs to obtain U.S. citizenship or immigration-status information when providing only first name and last name and date of birth,” the settlement adds.

The consequences are likely to land hardest on the communities that have already faced historical barriers to voting — including minority voters, naturalized citizens and married women who changed their names.

The settlement represents a seismic shift in election administration that moves the country closer toward a centralized voter information system controlled by federal agencies and accessible for statewide purges.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_0325-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 17:57:09.193462

In October, dozens of federal agents swarmed through Chinatown and arrested nine people DHS said were in the US illegally.
That raid attracted another spontaneous protest by residents and sparked criticism by leading New York Democrats, including Zohran Mamdani, who was elected mayor of the city in November.
A spokesperson for Mamdani, who will take office on 1 January, condemned Saturday’s federal action as “cruel and inhumane” in a statement to Time.
“It’s really despicable,” Christopher Marte, the Democratic city commissioner, told the New York Times.","A raid by federal immigration authorities on Saturday in New York City was thwarted by about 200 protesters, several of whom were arrested after scuffles with police officers.

The episode was the latest in which citizen activists have stood up to agents enforcing Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda through targeted raids in various cities across the country after his second presidency began in January.

Similar recent actions by federal authorities elsewhere, including in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Chicago, Illinois, have been met with resistance by citizens opposed to the administration’s escalating program of detentions and deportations.

According to the New York Times, Saturday’s confrontation took place on the edge of Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood, where US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents were assembling with counterparts from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The newspaper reported that scuffles with police took place at a parking garage in lower Manhattan beginning in the late morning, with some protesters blocking the government vehicles from leaving with makeshift barricades including garbage bags and metal barriers.

By early afternoon, the Times said, about 200 protesters had gathered, chanting and shouting at the agents, and the confrontation turned violent when some of the vehicles emerged from the garage and were chased along Canal Street. A number of the protesters were “hurling planters and trash cans after them”, the newspaper said, and a masked occupant in one of the vehicles sprayed several people with what appeared to be a chemical irritant.

Time magazine reported government agents abandoned their raid, which would have been their second large-scale operation in six weeks in lower Manhattan. In October, dozens of federal agents swarmed through Chinatown and arrested nine people DHS said were in the US illegally. That raid attracted another spontaneous protest by residents and sparked criticism by leading New York Democrats, including Zohran Mamdani, who was elected mayor of the city in November.

A spokesperson for Mamdani, who will take office on 1 January, condemned Saturday’s federal action as “cruel and inhumane” in a statement to Time.

“New York City’s more than three million immigrants are central to our city’s strength, vitality, and success, and the mayor-elect remains steadfast in his commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of every single New Yorker, upholding our sanctuary laws, and de-escalation rather than use of unnecessary force,” said Monica Klein, of Mamdani’s transition team.

A statement sent to Time by DHS blamed the violence on the protesters and said arrests were made by the New York police department (NYPD) assisting with crowd control.

“Following social media posts calling agitators to ICE’s location in New York City, individuals dressed in black clothing with backpacks, face masks, and goggles showed up and began to obstruct federal law enforcement officers including by blocking the parking garage,” it said.

“NYPD was called and responded to hundreds of violent rioters, which resulted in the arrest of multiple agitators.”

The involvement of the NYPD and its strategic response group (SRG) in Saturday’s action drew criticism from local politicians, who noted it was barred by city law from assisting the federal government in immigration arrests.

“It’s really despicable,” Christopher Marte, the Democratic city commissioner, told the New York Times.

“It seems like the NYPD, specifically the SRG, is working to clear the way for ICE agents to go out in our city to do arrests and put people in the process of deportation.”

Mamdani announced after his election that he would retain Jennifer Tisch as NYPD commissioner a year after she was appointed by outgoing mayor Eric Adams.

The Times said Tisch had a phone conversation Saturday with Ricky Patel, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations, the law enforcement arm of DHS. During the call, a source said, Tisch called Saturday’s government action “unacceptable” and said it put New Yorkers, federal agents and NYPD officers in harm’s way.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c40f333cc097ef57e86b82e7c9b689a831b0225a/182_0_3333_2667/master/3333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bdf0087b001b2c739d6074f7a5a9317a",N,,2025-12-01 15:58:13.325568

“If I get out, I’m going back to my house, and then I have to appear in county court,” Miguel said.
The Fond du Lac County Jail has transferred 10 people into ICE custody in 2025, Sheriff Ryan Waldschmidt said.
Fond du Lac County received nearly $25,000 through the program in fiscal year 2024, according to Waldschmidt.
He was scheduled to appear by video in Fond du Lac County court on the morning of Nov. 20.","This story was produced and originally published by Wisconsin Watch, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom.

Stacey Murillo Martinez arrived at the Fond du Lac County courthouse in June to pay a $1,500 cash bond for her husband, Miguel Murillo Martinez, as he sat in jail facing drunken driving, bail jumping and firearms charges.

Scraping the funds together was no small feat. Stacey lives on a fixed income, so Miguel’s boss chipped in. She expected the court to eventually return the $1,500. Bond is meant to serve as collateral to incentivize defendants to show up for their court dates, as she believed Miguel would.

She did not know U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers would wait inside the Fond du Lac County Jail later that day to take Miguel, an immigrant from Honduras, into their custody.

Months later, Miguel still sits in an ICE facility near Terre Haute, Indiana. His detention caused him to miss a court date in September, prompting the Fond du Lac County judge to issue a bench warrant for his arrest.

“They didn’t tell me, ‘You’re guilty’ or ‘You’re not guilty,’ ” he said, his voice muffled and distorted by the facility’s phone system.

“I don’t know what’s going to happen,” Stacey said in early November, referring to the fate of her husband and the bail money – three times the monthly rent for the couple’s double-wide in a Fond du Lac manufactured home park.

ICE records list more than 130 arrests at county jails in Wisconsin between January and July 2025. Nearly 40% were awaiting a ruling in their first criminal case.

While defendants sit in ICE custody, their criminal cases generally continue without them — sometimes with no explanation of their absence to the court. As ICE ramps up its enforcement efforts nationwide, Wisconsin courts are increasingly left with loose ends: defendants without their day in court, victims without a chance to testify and thousands of dollars in forfeited bail paid by family, friends and employers.

“If I get out, I’m going back to my house, and then I have to appear in county court,” Miguel said.

Miguel is not the only recent example: ICE picked up his nephew, Junior Murillo, at the Fond du Lac County Jail in October as he faced charges for disorderly conduct and domestic abuse.

The Fond du Lac County Jail has transferred 10 people into ICE custody in 2025, Sheriff Ryan Waldschmidt said. His county is among 15 Wisconsin local governments to have signed agreements with ICE to assist in identifying and apprehending unauthorized immigrants. These are often called 287(g) agreements, referencing the section of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act authorizing the program.

Fond du Lac is also among the more than two dozen Wisconsin counties participating in the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, through which the Department of Justice partially reimburses incarceration costs for agencies that share data on unauthorized immigrants in their custody. Fond du Lac County received nearly $25,000 through the program in fiscal year 2024, according to Waldschmidt.

Fond du Lac County District Attorney Eric Toney said ICE has been “very easy for us to communicate and work with,” and his prosecutors inform judges if a defendant is arrested in the courthouse. Waldschmidt noted that while his office communicates with prosecutors about inmates in county custody with ICE holds, it lacks a written policy requiring them to notify prosecutors of handoffs to ICE.

Criminal and immigration courts collide

Wisconsin courts do not consistently track whether a defendant has entered ICE custody, but multiple Wisconsin defense attorneys told Wisconsin Watch that immigration authorities frequently arrest defendants shortly after they post bail.

“The judge will issue a $500 cash bond, somebody in the family will post it before I’m able to tell them, ‘please don’t,’ and the client will get transferred into immigration custody, where they’re really not able to make the appearance in circuit court,” said Kate Drury, a Waupaca-based criminal defense and immigration attorney.

In rare cases, prosecutors work with ICE to extradite defendants from detention centers in other states – or, even rarer, from other countries. Doing so is complicated and expensive, especially for smaller counties.

Toney said his office can’t justify expenses for bringing any out-of-state defendant back to prosecute lower-level cases, such as driving without a license.

Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne is similarly reluctant to spend thousands to extradite defendants from faraway detention facilities. “If it’s a misdemeanor retail theft (charge), let’s say, and the person is in California, that extradition cost may be $5,000,” he said. “We’re probably not going to spend $5,000 or bring that person back.”

Ozanne’s office did, however, successfully fight for custody of a Honduran woman accused of killing two teenagers while driving drunk on Highway I-90 north of Madison in July. ICE detained Noelia Saray Martinez Avila, 30, after her attorney posted a $250,000 bond to release her from the Dane County jail in August. Martinez Avila is scheduled to appear in Dane County court in December.

Defendants in ICE custody can sometimes appear for Wisconsin court hearings via video call, though some attorneys report struggling to schedule those from immigration detention centers.

“Jails and private prisons that operate immigration detention facilities aren’t super focused or motivated in helping defendants make their scheduled court appearances,” Drury said.

When a defendant misses a court date, Toney’s office typically requests a bench warrant and moves to schedule a bail forfeiture hearing — regardless of whether ICE detention caused the absence, he said.

Making exceptions for ICE detainees would mean “treating somebody differently because of their immigration status,” Toney said. Still, attorneys in his office can exercise their own discretion when deciding whether to seek a warrant or bail forfeiture, he added. The prosecutor responsible for Junior Murillo’s case, for instance, did not request that the court forfeit his bail after his ICE arrest.

Ozanne argued against forfeiting defendants’ bail if they miss a court date while in ICE custody.

“It wasn’t their unwillingness to show up” that prevented them from appearing in court, he said, adding that his office would be willing to return bail money to whomever posted it on the defendant’s behalf.

“The problem is that we don’t necessarily know” whether a person is in custody, Ozanne added. While he, like Toney, has reported no difficulties communicating with ICE, the agency doesn’t proactively inform his office when it arrests immigrants with active cases in Dane County.

ICE did not respond to emailed questions from Wisconsin Watch.

Mindy Nolan, a Milwaukee-based attorney who specializes in the interaction between criminal cases and immigration status, said judges generally issue warrants for defendants in ICE custody to keep their criminal cases alive if ICE releases them or they return to the country after deportation.

“Over the years, what I’ve heard from judges is (that) if the person is present in the United States in the future, they could be picked up on the state court warrant,” she said.

Hearings without defendants

Wisconsin law gives courts at least 30 days to decide whether to forfeit a defendant’s bail.

“The default assumption seems to be that the immigrant could appear and the statute places the burden on the defendant to prove that it was impossible for them to appear,” Drury said. “But how does the defendant meet that burden when they’re being held in immigration custody, transferred all over the country, potentially transferred outside the United States?”

Wisconsin courts have held more than 2,700 bail forfeiture hearings thus far in 2025, though the state’s count does not provide details on the reasons for defendants’ absence. If the defendant misses the hearing, the defendant’s attorney or those who paid the bail can challenge the forfeiture by demonstrating that the absence was unavoidable.

On a Friday morning in late October, a Racine County judge issued a half-dozen bail forfeiture orders in just minutes. The court had scheduled a translator for most of the cases, and she sat alone at the defense table, occasionally scanning the room in case any defendants slipped in at the last minute.

“The problem is getting someone at the bond forfeiture hearings to assert those arguments on behalf of clients,” Drury said. Public defenders are often stretched thin, and family members may be unaware of upcoming hearings. Court records indicate Miguel Murillo lacks a defense attorney assigned to his case in Fond du Lac, leaving only Stacey to argue against bail forfeiture.

Such hearings tend to be more substantial when attorneys are present, boosting the likelihood of bail money being returned.

Miguel Murillo’s case does not involve an alleged victim, meaning forfeited bail would go to Fond du Lac County. Court costs typically exceed the value of forfeited bail, Toney said.

When cases involve alleged victims, Wisconsin law requires that courts use forfeited bail for victim restitution – even without a conviction.

What’s missing are judicial findings that the defendant is responsible for the alleged actions and caused suffering to the victim, Drury said.

“Without a conviction, I don’t understand how you maintain that policy and the presumption of innocence, which is such an important constitutional cornerstone of this country.”

Immigration arrests often throw a wrench in the gears of the criminal justice system, Ozanne said.

“It’s most problematic for us when the person hasn’t gone through their due process,” he said. “We have victims… who don’t really get the benefit of the process or have the ability to communicate with the courts about what they think should happen.”

“In a sense,” he added, “that person has a get-out-of-jail-free card.”

Months in ICE detention

Miguel Murillo left Honduras a decade ago, initially settling in Houston. While in Texas, he says he survived a shooting and sought, but never obtained, a U-visa, which provides temporary legal status to victims of certain crimes.

The shooting prompted him to head north to Wisconsin, where he found construction work and married Stacey, a lifelong Wisconsinite. Court records mark occasional run-ins with law enforcement and misdemeanors over the last five years, culminating in the April 2025 charges that preceded his ICE arrest.

Stacey, who is receiving treatment for breast cancer, relied on her husband to keep their household afloat. In his absence, she said, “I have to beg, plead, and borrow to get any assistance.”

“Right now, as I go through this situation… there’s no one to take care of her,” Miguel told Wisconsin Watch. The couple hope that argument will sway a Chicago immigration court judge to release him from ICE custody. The court held its final hearing on his order of removal case in late October, Stacey said, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Junior’s case progressed far more quickly. After his arrest in October, he spent just over a week in ICE custody before immigration authorities put him on a plane to Honduras.

Miguel, on the other hand, has spent roughly five months in various ICE detention facilities. He was scheduled to appear by video in Fond du Lac County court on the morning of Nov. 20. He never joined the call.

“I don’t know what happened,” he wrote to Wisconsin Watch afterwards. “I was waiting and (facility staff) didn’t call me.”

Stacey couldn’t attend the hearing for health reasons, and Miguel has yet to secure an attorney for his Fond du Lac case.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Monday said the second strike was carried out “in self-defense” and “in accordance” with laws governing armed conflict.

President Donald Trump was expected to meet with his national security team Monday as bipartisan scrutiny has mounted over a report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order in September to strike the vessel.

Democrats have said that the allegations first reported by The Washington Post last week could amount to a war crime, and Republicans have also voiced their concerns about the legality of the Sept. 2 attack in the Caribbean. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have opened investigations into the recent U.S. military strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.

The Latest:

Outlets that reach millions denied access to rare Pentagon news briefings this week

The briefings are instead being held for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s hand-picked media organizations.

It’s not as if there’s little to talk about, with both the Senate and House Armed Services committees opening investigations into U.S. military strikes against alleged drug couriers in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.

Hegseth’s team says the briefings are part of special orientation events for a newly credentialed Pentagon press corps, consisting primarily of conservative outlets that agreed to his new rules for operation.

Most mainstream outlets exited the Pentagon this fall rather than agree to the new rules. The Defense Department says they are “common sense” regulations designed to prevent the spread of classified information. But many news outlets worried they would effectively be agreeing only to report news approved by Hegseth.

US air travelers without REAL IDs will be charged a $45 fee

Air travelers in the U.S. without a REAL ID will be charged a $45 fee beginning in February, the Transportation Security Administration announced Monday.

The updated ID has been required since May, but passengers without it have so far been allowed to clear security with additional screening and a warning. The Department of Homeland Security says 94% of passengers are already compliant.

REAL ID is a federally compliant state-issued license or identification card that meets enhanced requirements mandated in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

Obtaining the ID — indicated by a white star in a yellow circle in most states — means taking more documents to the motor vehicle agency than most states require for regular IDs.

Beginning Feb. 1, travelers 18 and older flying domestically without a REAL ID and who don’t have another accepted form of ID on them, such as a passport, will pay the non-refundable fee to verify their identity through TSA’s alternative “Confirm.ID” system.

Admiral who ordered follow-up strike on drug boat to brief lawmakers this week

U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Frank Bradley will provide a classified briefing to key lawmakers overseeing the military on Thursday as they investigate a U.S. military attack on a boat allegedly carrying drugs that included a second strike that killed survivors.

Bradley, who was commander of Joint Special Operations Command at the time of the Sept. 2 attack, ordered the follow-up strike, the White House said Monday as it defended Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s conduct following a report from The Washington Post.

Rep. Mike Rogers, the Republican chair of the House Armed Services Committee, said he was “satisfied” following a conversation with Hegseth on the attack, but that he also wanted to hear from Bradley.

“We’ll all have clarity on Thursday afternoon,” Rogers said.

GOP senator says if an official ordered strike on survivors, they should ‘get the hell out of Washington’

North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis said he wants more information on a report that top military officials ordered an attack on survivors of a boat strike, calling the claim potentially “rage bait.” Still, he said “we need to get to the bottom of it,” and that, if true, it would amount to “a violation of an ethical, moral or legal code.”

“If it’s substantiated, whoever made that order needs to get the hell out of Washington,” Tillis said.

Tillis, who announced earlier this year he won’t seek reelection, was a deciding vote in confirming Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth.

Chair of Senate Armed Services Committee pledges boat strike investigation will be ‘by the numbers’

Republican Sen. Roger Wicker says he wants vigorous oversight following a report that top military officials ordered an attack on survivors of a boat strike.

“We’ll find out the ground truth,” he said, adding that the ramifications of the report were “serious charges.”

Wicker added that he expected a briefing from U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Frank Bradley, who was overseeing the operation, but avoided saying whether Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth will be called to testify.

Experts explain what the law says about killing survivors of a boat strike

The U.S. military would have committed a crime if it killed the survivors of an alleged drug boat after it was first attacked, legal experts say.

It doesn’t matter whether the U.S. is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels as the Trump administration asserts. Such a fatal strike would have violated peacetime laws and those governing armed conflict, the experts say.

“I can’t imagine anyone, no matter what the circumstance, believing it is appropriate to kill people who are clinging to a boat in the water,” said Michael Schmitt, a professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College.

The White House confirmed Monday that a second strike was conducted in September against a vessel accused of trafficking drugs off Venezuela and insisted it was legal.

Bill Cassidy celebrates Trump signing law on health care

The Louisiana senator, who is emphasizing his ties to Trump ahead of a tough primary, posted a video touting the president’s signature on a Senate bill.

“It’s all about making America healthy again,” Cassidy says in the video, taken from a car. The SUPPORT Act is meant to boost programs that treat substance use disorders, overdoses, and mental health.

Cassidy posted earlier today that he was invited to the White House for the bill signing. Trump has not made an endorsement in the 2026 Senate race in Louisiana, where Cassidy is up for reelection. Cassidy — highlighting what he’s previously called a “great working relationship” with Trump — drew multiple challengers from his own party after voting to convict Trump on an article of impeachment.

Schumer calls Hegseth a ‘national embarrassment’ and demands release of boat strike video

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called the Defense secretary childish and insecure, and said Hegseth’s social media post of a cartoon turtle firing on suspected drug traffickers is “something no serious leader would ever think of doing.”

Schumer said the Armed Services committees conducting oversight should demand that Hegseth release the video of the strike and testify under oath about what happened.

Senate GOP Leader wants ‘all the particulars’ on Venezuelan boat strike

Sen. John Thune says he’s glad the Armed Services committees in Congress will be conducting oversight of the boat strikes on alleged drug traffickers that critics have described as war crimes.

“I don’t have, at this point, an evaluation of the secretary,” Thune told reporters. “Others can make those evaluations.”

He said he expects the committee to look into “what happened when and what orders were given.”

“I don’t think you want to draw any conclusions or deductions until you have all the facts,” Thune told reporters. “We’ll see where they lead.”

Trump honors National Guard troops at White House Christmas party

In a video of the party posted online by White House aide Margo Martin, Trump noted that he spoke to the parents of U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, who was killed in last week’s shooting in Washington.

“Her parents couldn’t believe it, what happened to their baby, what happened to their daughter,” Trump said Monday. “She’s gone.” He said another National Guard member — U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, whom Trump called “a fabulous young man” — was “fighting for his life.”

“Maybe he’ll be OK, he’s going through a lot,” Trump said. “Maybe he’ll be OK.”

The press was not invited into the Christmas gathering, which an aide said was the first one at the White House this year.

“We have a little more than three years left, and three years for Trump is an eternity,” Trump said to applause and laughter, according to the video posted by Martin.

Sen. Kelly says Trump is trying to bully him: ‘I won’t let it happen’

Facing a Pentagon investigation after President Donald Trump accused him of sedition “punishable by DEATH,” Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona is showing little interest in backing down.

“For most of Donald Trump’s career, bullying people has worked out for him. But not now, because I won’t let it happen,” Kelly told reporters Monday.

The Pentagon launched its inquiry last week after Kelly appeared in a video with other Democratic lawmakers urging U.S. troops to defy “illegal orders.” Kelly, viewed as a potential 2028 presidential contender, has stayed in the spotlight since by directly challenging the president.

“President Trump has crossed the line, and this time it’s not going to work. I will not be intimidated by this president,” Kelly said.

Top military officer talks with congressional leaders

Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, held the weekend call following reports that the military conducted a second strike in September on the survivors of an attack on an alleged drug boat.

Caine spoke with the four bipartisan lawmakers leading the Senate and House Armed Services Committees “to share perspectives on ongoing operations” and reiterate “his trust and confidence in the experienced commanders at every echelon,” Caine’s office said.

The committees have opened reviews following the report.

The call focused on “addressing the intent and legality of missions to disrupt illicit trafficking networks which threaten the security and stability of the Western Hemisphere,” the statement said.

Three of Schumer’s offices targeted with bomb threats

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said three of his New York offices received emailed bomb threats from an email address alleging the “2020 election was rigged.”

Schumer said in a statement that local law enforcement received bomb threats referencing his offices in Rochester, Binghamton and Long Island with the email subject line “MAGA.”

“Local and federal law enforcement responded immediately and are conducting full security sweeps,” Schumer said. “Everyone is safe, and I am grateful for their quick and professional response to ensure these offices remain safe and secure for all New Yorkers.”

Trump and France’s Macron hold call to discuss Ukraine

The French president spoke with Trump by phone after he hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Paris on Monday.

Trump and Macron “discussed the conditions for a robust and lasting peace in Ukraine and the next steps in the mediation efforts undertaken by the United States,” according to a French government statement. “The President of the Republic notably underscored the central importance of the security guarantees required for Ukraine and our determination to work on them together with the United States.”

Ukraine’s president spoke optimistically Monday about the progress of revising the Trump administration’s peace plan, saying “it looks better” and the work will continue during talks on how to end Russia’s nearly four-year war.

U.S. and Ukrainian officials held talks in Florida about the U.S. proposal.

White House physician says Trump is in ‘excellent overall health’

Trump to meet with his national security team to discuss strikes off of Venezuela

Leavitt said the meeting will take place Monday afternoon, and that strikes against suspected drug vessels off Venezuela — as well as other topics — will be discussed.

White House says second strike on suspected drug vessel followed armed conflict laws

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said a second strike was conducted against an alleged drug vessel off Venezuela on Sept. 2 “in self-defense and “in accordance” with laws governing armed conflict.

“The president has the right to take them out,” Leavitt said of alleged drug vessels, if they are “threatening the United States of America.”

Leavitt’s comments came after reports that defense officials gave a verbal order to leave no survivors after a first U.S. strike on a suspected drug smuggling boat in the Caribbean on Sept. 2 left survivors.

White House say

s Biden ‘recklessly released’ nearly 100,000 Afghans into the U.S.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pre-Thanksgiving shooting of two National Guard members in Washington shows it is “more important than ever to finish carrying out the president’s mass deportation operation.”

She said the Trump administration is “ensuring the monster responsible for this atrocity” is held accountable, and reckoning with what made the attack possible — including scrutinizing past immigration decisions involving Afghans and other migrants.

Leavitt blamed what she called Biden’s “historic failure in Afghanistan” and said it “continues to haunt this country and our men and women in uniform.”

South Carolina to send 300 National Guard troops to Washington this month

The troops were already set to go to the nation’s capital before last week’s shooting that killed one National Guard member and wounded another from West Virginia, Gov. Henry McMaster said.

The Republican governor said there are no plans to increase the number of soldiers after President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard troops following last week’s shooting.

The governor noted South Carolina has also sent National Guard troops to the Mexican border and other places in the world.

“We’ll keep sending them, and they are willing to go and capable of going,” McMaster told reporters Monday.

The South Carolina troops will replace soldiers from Georgia. They were the replacements for the first round of South Carolina soldiers in Washington who returned home in September.

Melania Trump and Usha Vance write holiday cards for deployed service members

The wives of the president and vice president spoke briefly to the roughly 100 military spouses, American Red Cross volunteers and others gathered inside a hangar at Joint Base Andrews near the nation’s capital for the event.

The first lady praised the spouses for carrying “the weight of family life” while their husbands or wives are away from home serving the country.

Usha Vance, whose husband, Vice President JD Vance, is a former Marine, said the holiday season is a time to “lift up” those who serve.

After speaking, both women took up positions at tables to help stuff “comfort kits” as they were being filled with Rice Krispies treats, peanuts, granola bars and handwritten notes. They also joined others who were writing holiday cards for deployed service members.

The first lady wrote in one of her cards: “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! Thank you for your service. Our nation is proud of you!” and signed it, “With warm wishes, Melania Trump.”

Trump holds call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

“The two leaders stressed the importance and obligation of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding the peace agreements,” according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The call comes a day after Netanyahu asked his country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, a move that would end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Trump has publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament during an October visit. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Trump urges Israel to maintain dialogue with Syria amid growing tensions

The president in a social media posting said his administration is “very satisfied” with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s efforts to stabilize Syria as the Mideast nation nears the one-year anniversary of the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.

But Trump also underscored that it’s “very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State.”

Trump’s comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago.

A Border Patrol-led immigration crackdown is coming to greater New Orleans

Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday’s expected launch of what they’re calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment centered in liberal New Orleans is the latest to target a Democratic-run city as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

What to expect in Tennessee’s special congressional election

After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee.

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump’s endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville.

Aiming for a 9-0 sweep, Republicans would split Indianapolis among 4 districts

Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state’s two Democratic U.S. House members.

The city of Indianapolis would be split among four congressional districts, a major change to the current map where the city makes up the entirety of the 7th District that reliably backs Democrats.

Indiana’s other current Democratic district is in the state’s northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District.

Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. To offset the GOP gains, Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to do the same.

Indiana legislators to convene state House session with redistricting top of mind

Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state’s congressional districts in the Republicans’ favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump’s demands.

Republicans who control the House have said there’s no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. The proposal’s fate remains uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted pressure to redistrict for months. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue.

Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington.

Former Trump lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified as New Jersey prosecutor

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep the president’s former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified.

The panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration’s push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government’s moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Habba said after the Oct. 20 hearing that she was fighting on behalf of other candidates to be federal prosecutors who have been denied Senate hearings.

Venezuelan leader Maduro and his allies resist US pressure

Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party’s leadership continues to hold, despite the buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast.

The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

So what does it mean? The upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise. The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

The term helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and unemployment has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth slows, making affordability much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households.

Since April 8, Mohan Karki, a Bhutanese Nepali refugee and resident of Blacklick, Ohio, has been detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the bulk of his time spent in a Michigan jail under threat of deportation.

These months have been particularly tumultuous for Karki’s wife, Tika Basnet, who in June delayed giving birth to the couple’s daughter by two weeks in order to contend with developments in Karki’s case that then included his being shuffled from Butler County Jail outside of Cincinnati to Michigan’s St. Clair County Jail with plans for immediate deportation to Bhutan – a tiny Himalayan country in which he has never set foot. (Karki, who has not yet met or held his now 5-month-old daughter, was born in a refugee camp in Nepal.)

On June 10, a judge granted a stay against Karki’s removal, and in the months since multiple attorneys have waged a supportive battle on multiple legal fronts. Attorney Brian Hoffman has led the work to stay Karki’s deportation – a case that Hoffman said currently rests with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals – and attorney Diana Marin has focused her efforts on the habeas corpus case challenging Karki’s extended detention by the government, for which Karki was set to appear in federal court on Wednesday, Dec. 3. (Marin said the habeas case is based on the manner in which ICE revoked Karki’s order of supervision, as well the length of time he has been detained, both of which she described as violations of due process.)

“Then on Wednesday [Nov. 26], I received a message and I spoke to the attorney for the government in the habeas case, who said, ‘I want to file a motion to vacate the judge’s order for Mohan to appear in person [on Dec. 3] because his deportation is imminent,’” said Marin, who joined Hoffman, Aisa Villarosa of the Asian Law Caucus, and Robin Gurung, co-executive director of Asian Refugees United, for a late November interview. “And when I called him to ask what this was about, he said, ‘There’s a final order of removal in place, they have a travel document for Mohan, and they have scheduled a commercial flight for him to leave the country on December 2. And that’s how we learned of [the deportation], which obviously set other things in motion.”

With time limited by the pending Thanksgiving holiday, Hoffman filed an immediate emergency motion for a stay with the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, while Villarosa and Gurung communicated these developments to Basnet, who was in the midst of preparations to host the couple’s extended families for the holiday ahead of a planned trip to Michigan to be in court with Karki for his early December habeas hearing.

“It’s just so fatiguing [for Basnet], and it’s been marathon after marathon,” Villarosa said. “Even something so basic as, ‘Can my husband hold his baby?’ becomes a battle.”

Hoffman said the legal team only learned about the order of removal because the habeas case was in motion, describing instances with other refugee clients in which he received an email from the jail an hour or less ahead of a planned virtual visit informing him that the person he was scheduled to speak with was no longer being held at the facility. “And that’s how we learn that person has been removed,” he said. “And it’s chilling.”

With the information surrounding these new developments in hand, the team supporting Karki and Basnet began to engage on multiple fronts, with Hoffman filing for an emergency stay and Gurung martialing community members to begin contacting the ICE Field Office and politicians who might advocate on the family’s behalf. Others also petitioned ICE to follow its posted directives pertaining to parental rights, trying to ensure that if the worst-case scenario comes to pass and Karki is deported to Bhutan, that he’ll first be able to meet and hold his infant daughter – something he has been unable to do while held within St. Clair County Jail, which Villarosa said doesn’t allow in-person visitation, even for parents.

“In some ways, the immigrant community has even fewer rights than a criminal defendant who is incarcerated, even though they’re supposed to have more, because it’s a civil matter and not a criminal offense,” said Marin, who noted there might be a point at which Karki’s team is forced to shift from fighting his removal to helping the family prepare as best it can for his deportation. “I don’t know at what point the team will decide we need to pivot, but that would mean helping Mohan and his wife and family prepare for the inevitable. And most people don’t even get that opportunity. And they aren’t able to plan. … and get even the most basic things in order, like, do I have a cell phone that’s going to work in this new country? Do I have access to my bank accounts? Do I have access to my family, my relatives, my children?”

Karki’s case is further complicated by his standing as a stateless person, having been born 30 years ago in a refugee camp in Nepal, which denied him legal status. (Karki is one of more than 100,000 Bhutanese Nepalis whose families fled ethnic cleansing in Bhutan, the majority of whom eventually settled legally in the United States.)

“And immigration courts are not really set up to deal with the issue of statelessness,” Hoffman said. “The very first sentence denying our motion and dismissing our appeal said, ‘The respondent, a citizen and native of Nepal,’ which is not true. And over and over again that has been an issue in the litigation.”

The detainment and potential deportation of Karki have served as both a galvanizing point and cause for alarm within the U.S. Bhutanese Nepali community, said Gurung, who shared a video by the Asian Refugees United storytelling group in which artist Nawal Rai tells of how Karki was detained by ICE after appearing for a routine check-in. “The community is in a state of shock and fear and confusion,” he said. “We came to this country through the formal refugee resettlement program, and there was a perception that they were not going to come after us. So, when our community members all of a sudden started to disappear, we were not prepared. And now our work has had to shift toward virtual and in-person rights training, so people are aware of how to respond and how to protect their family members.”

Members of the Bhutanese Nepali community have long existed in legal limbo, having previously been made stateless by the Bhutanese government, which began to strip them of their citizenship rights in the 1980s. In May,the Guardian reported on two dozen Bhutanese Nepali refugees who had been deported to Bhutan a month prior by ICE, at least four of whom were rejected by Bhutanese authorities and expelled to India, where several are now believed to be missing. In July, Basnet expressed the fears she felt in knowing her husband could similarly be deported to a country “where he might be tortured, imprisoned, persecuted, or even killed.”

“And those conditions have not changed,” said Villarosa, who noted that upon landing in Bhutan, Karki would be immediately expelled from the country, with Nepal existing as one potential destination. “At this point, Nepal has said, ‘You can stay here, kind of. We’ll not recognize you as citizens. We’ll charge you for each day you stay in Nepal. And ultimately, we want you to leave.’”

Even if Karki were to make it safely to Nepal, Marin said that his lack of legal documentation (as a stateless individual, Karki doesn’t have a passport or a birth certificate) would severely restrict his ability to work or travel. “So, everything that has been documented about what happens to Bhutanese Nepali refugees when they are deported,” the attorney said, “that’s exactly what awaits him.”

The unknowable situation attorneys and advocates anticipate for Karki upon his arrival in Bhutan continues to drive their work, which is partially rooted in an understanding that if the young father is forced to board a commercial flight for a country that will immediately expel him, the prospects of him ever reuniting with his wife and infant daughter dim significantly.",https://d30oozggxy9369.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/01091551/signal-2025-06-30-130443-1536x1183-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 15:58:17.495363

The House and Senate Armed Services Committees have opened investigations supported by lawmakers from both parties into U.S. military strikes against vessels suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean. They cited a published report that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a verbal order for surviving crew members to be killed as part of a Sept. 2 attack.

The lawmakers said that if true, the allegations first reported by The Washington Post last week pose serious legal concerns. “This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va.

Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, when asked about a follow-up strike aimed at people no longer able to fight, said Congress does not have information on what happened. “Obviously, if that occurred, that would be very serious and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” Turner said.

President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

White House says Biden ‘recklessly released’ nearly 100,000 Afghans into the U.S.

Press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the pre-Thanksgiving shooting of two National Guard members in Washington shows it is “more important than ever to finish carrying out the president’s mass deportation operation.”

She said the Trump administration is “ensuring the monster responsible for this atrocity” is held accountable, and reckoning with what made the attack possible — including scrutinizing past immigration decisions involving Afghans and other migrants.

Leavitt blamed what she called Biden’s “historic failure in Afghanistan” and said it “continues to haunt this country and our men and women in uniform.”

South Carolina to send 300 National Guard troops to Washington this month

The troops were already set to go to the nation’s capital before last week’s shooting that killed one National Guard member and wounded another from West Virginia, Gov. Henry McMaster said.

The Republican governor said there are no plans to increase the number of soldiers after President Donald Trump requested 500 more National Guard troops following last week’s shooting.

The governor noted South Carolina has also sent National Guard troops to the Mexican border and other places in the world.

“We’ll keep sending them, and they are willing to go and capable of going,” McMaster told reporters Monday.

The South Carolina troops will replace soldiers from Georgia. They were the replacements for the first round of South Carolina soldiers in Washington who returned home in September.

The first lady praised the spouses for carrying “the weight of family life” while their husbands or wives are away from home serving the country.

Usha Vance, whose husband, Vice President JD Vance, is a former Marine, said the holiday season is a time to “lift up” those who serve.

After speaking, both women took up positions at tables to help stuff “comfort kits” as they were being filled with Rice Krispies treats, peanuts, granola bars and handwritten notes. They also joined others who were writing holiday cards for deployed service members.

The first lady wrote in one of her cards: “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! Thank you for your service. Our nation is proud of you!” and signed it, “With warm wishes, Melania Trump.”

The government put an immediate pause on all asylum decisions, halted visas for individuals traveling from Afghanistan and said it would reexamine green card holders from 19 “high-risk countries of concern.”

The shooting also prompted President Donald Trump and the Department of Homeland Security to float broader but less specific actions to restrict immigration and remove immigrants from the United States, including a stop to migration from “third-world countries,” the denaturalization of immigrants and a vision for “remigration.”

Trump administration officials announced the policy changes on social media after the Nov. 26 shooting. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died from her injuries and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, has been in critical condition with no updates as of Monday morning.

The shooter was among the 76,000 individuals from Afghanistan the Biden administration admitted in 2021 after the U.S withdrawal from the country, according to multiple media reports.

Joseph Edlow, director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, posted on Nov. 28 that all asylum decisions would be put on hold, with no time given for when those processes would resume.

“USCIS has halted all asylum decisions until we can ensure that every alien is vetted and screened to the maximum degree possible,” Edlow said. “The safety of the American people always comes first.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio had a similar message on protecting Americans in his announcement Nov. 28 that he would halt visas for people seeking to travel into the country from Afghanistan.

“President Trump’s State Department has paused visa issuance for ALL individuals traveling on Afghan passports,” Rubio said. “The United States has no higher priority than protecting our nation and our people.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem echoed the announcement asylum decisions would be put on hold, and announced DHS would engage in “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from all 19 high-risk countries of concern.”

“Under President Trump, we are putting the American people, our safety and national security FIRST,” Noem wrote Sunday on social media. “We are putting an end to idiotic policies that allowed millions of illegal aliens and hundreds of thousands of foreigners into our country unvetted.”

A DHS spokesperson confirmed on Monday that those countries are Afghanistan, Burma, Burundi, Chad, Republic of Congo, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Laos, Libya, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Venezuela, and Yemen.

Those are the same countries listed in a travel ban Trump issued in a presidential proclamation in June. A DHS memo dated Nov. 27 points to that proclamation and states the administration “will consider relevant country-specific facts and circumstances” when determining “discretionary benefit requests” from individuals from these countries.

These benefits, the memo states, include “certain adjustment of status applications, extension of nonimmigrant stay, and change of nonimmigrant status.”

Trump, speaking with reporters Sunday on Air Force One, said he would make sweeping changes such as a permanent pause on migration from all “third-world countries” and an effort to “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”

Trump said he would “absolutely” revoke the U.S. citizenship of certain immigrants if he had the authority to make the call.

“We have criminals that came into our country, and they were naturalized,” Trump said. “If I have the power to do it — I’m not sure that I do, but if I do — I would denaturalize. Absolutely.”

And Trump posted on social media Thursday he would “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.”

“Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,” Trump posted.

The DHS social media account on Friday posted about “remigration,” something it had also posted about in October along with a link to a mobile app the Trump administration has repurposed as a way for migrants to voluntarily self-deport.

The term has been used in connection with far-right groups in Europe as a concept for deporting the influx of non-white immigrants, some critics have pointed out.

“The stakes have never been higher, and the goal has never been more clear: Remigration now,” the DHS account posted.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2248122650.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 14:56:59.062251

Press Club v. Kristi Noem at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Drawing on nearly four decades of PHR research about the potential health harms of crowd-control weapons, PHR medical and legal experts reviewed court declarations and news reports on Trump administration immigration agents’ excessive and reckless force against peaceful demonstrators as well as journalists, medics, and bystanders at the L.A. protests. PHR finds that the court record and reporting indicate that federal agents used crowd-control weapons in a manner inconsistent with international standards such as the United Nations Guidance on Less-Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement.

“Crowd control weapons like rubber bullets, pepper balls, and tear gas may be labeled ‘less lethal,’ but medical research shows they can cause serious injury or even death. The risk of grave harms is even greater when law enforcement misuses these weapons as the court record indicates was the case in Los Angeles this summer,” said Michele Heisler, MD, MPA, medical director at PHR and professor of internal medicine and public health at University of Michigan.

“The court record shows that federal law enforcement in Los Angeles targeted the heads and faces of journalists and protestors with rubber bullets. They fired even at the backs of journalists and protestors,” said Dr. Heisler. “Federal agents also deployed vast quantities of tear gas and shot pepper balls and tear gas cannisters into groups of protestors when there was no evidence agents were being threatened. Officials fired dangerous disorientation devices like flashbangs into large crowds. The examples that the court highlighted show how federal law enforcement repeatedly misused crowd control weapons in a manner that risked serious injury to non-violent protestors, journalists, and bystanders.”

PHR’s analysis draws on a wide range of medico-legal documentation of the health and human rights harms of crowd-control weapons around the world. This includes Lethal in Disguise, a seminal report that offers the best available evidence of the deaths and severe injuries caused by kinetic impact projectiles (such as rubber bullets), chemical irritants (such as tear gas), and other crowd-control weapons in the United States and around the world.

PHR’s amicus brief highlights some of the severe injuries documented in the court record and news accounts as resulting from federal agents’ misuse of crowd-control weapons. For example, Ryanne Mena, a journalist who was covering protests in Paramount, was hit just an inch above her right ear with what is believed to have been a rubber bullet, resulting in a concussion. Alexander Nadolishny, a 55-year-old engineer attending the protests in Camarillo, was hit in the ear with a pepper ball as he was running away from the protest. Agents fired tear gas on a group of protestors in Paramount, including the 52-year-old Diya Cruz, which triggered an asthma attack for Cruz.

Following the summer 2025 protests in Los Angeles, a coalition of journalists, legal observers, protestors, and journalist associations sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Their complaint alleged that in June, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) launched an operation to arrest immigrants in and around Los Angeles, “setting new sky-high targets for daily immigration arrests and expanding the scope of its operations far beyond immigrants with criminal histories.” Plaintiffs alleged that DHS responded to protests over these immigration raids with excessive force by using tear gas, pepper balls, chemical spray, and rubber bullets.

The court granted the preliminary injunction on September 10, finding that federal agents’ use of force has been and would continue to be disruptive to both peaceful protest and media coverage.

In its new amicus brief, PHR urges the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to uphold the district court’s granting of the preliminary injunction in order to prevent the further dangerous and harmful misuse of crowd control weapons that has been visited upon protestors and journalists in Los Angeles.

This article features Government Accountability Project and was originally published here.

The federal watchdog system at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that oversees complaints about civil rights violations, including in immigration detention, has been gutted so thoroughly that it could be laying the groundwork for the Trump administration to “abuse people with impunity”, experts warn.

Former federal oversight officials have sounded the alarm at the rapid dismantling of guardrails against human rights failures – at the same time as the government pushes aggressive immigration enforcement operations.

A group of fired watchdogs has filed a whistleblower complaint to Congress through the Government Accountability Project (GAP), and a coalition of human rights organizations sued the administration, demanding the employees be reinstated. There is deepening concern that a system of oversight that was already weak is now hanging by a thread, even as criticism surges over treatment of detainees in the ballooning immigration jail network.

“They want to be able to abuse people with impunity,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice-president of US advocacy and litigation at the Robert F Kennedy Human Rights advocacy group based in Washington, which is representing the group suing the government.

He added: “They want to be able to operate a system that doesn’t have any rules and that can be used to maximize brutality against people, in order to accomplish a mass deportation agenda.”

The DHS has repeatedly, through assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin, insisted when asked about reports and complaints of abuses that there are “no sub-prime” conditions in immigration custody in the US.

But Dana Gold, a senior director of the GAP, which is working with those behind the whistleblower complaint, echoed Enriquez’s warning.

Without a robust oversight system “there’s just a blank check for impunity”, she said.

The second Trump administration early on fired hundreds of officials in federal oversight offices, typically known as watchdogs.

This included at the DHS. The main watchdog team there overseeing civil rights, the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) – one of three DHS oversight offices – has been cut from a staff of 150 to just nine. This despite there being about 550 investigations that were active and alleging serious civil rights violations by DHS officials and contractors, including inside immigration detention centers.

Cases that were active when Trump returned to office include civil rights officials then in post investigating allegations of civil and human rights abuses, according to CRCL documents that were previously public, original complaint records submitted to the CRCL and the whistleblower disclosure, reviewed by the Guardian. Among the cases, were the following allegations:

Border Patrol agents in Arizona forcibly removed a detained man from a cell, handcuffed him and then injected him with ketamine to sedate him in 2023, according to a CRCL document confirming the watchdog’s investigation into the allegation. A Guardian reporter had saved that document just weeks before it was scrubbed from the DHS’s website.

Guards at a privately owned Louisiana detention center systematically mistreated detained immigrants, according to a CRCL document. This included an investigation into a 2024 incident during which correctional staff pepper sprayed around 200 detained immigrants who were staging a hunger strike in protest of detention conditions. Guards then allegedly locked the men in the unit and cut the power and water for hours. A majority of the men were allegedly denied medical care, the original complaint, submitted to the CRCL by RFK Human Rights, said.

In a Florida jail, a 33-year-old immigrant woman with mental health problems was forcibly stripped naked, strapped to a restraint chair and mocked by male guards, according to a CRCL complaint submitted by the ACLU of Florida and RFK Human Rights. The woman was allegedly left with “contusions and marks on her body” after hours in the restraint chair. The whistleblower declaration said the CRCL had launched an investigation into the case.

Agents violated due process during the arrest and detention of Palestinian student and Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil, according to the whistleblower complaint.

This last one, into Khalil, who was arrested by ICE agents for his pro-Palestinian activism, was one of the final investigations launched before the mass firing of civil rights watchdog officials in March.

The status of these investigations, and hundreds more, is unknown. Enquiries by the Guardian to the DHS last week about the above specific cases and the many others previously understood to be active elicited no response.

However, in response to requests for comment by the Guardian, also submitted to DHS last week, McLaughlin issued a statement, saying: “These claims are ridiculous. All of legally required functions of the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties (CRCL) continue to be performed, but in an efficient and cost-effective manner and without hindering the department’s mission of securing the homeland.”

It went on to say: “As it existed in the past, the CRCL obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining DHS’s mission. Rather than supporting law enforcement efforts, they often function as internal adversaries that slow down operations.

“CRCL and OIDO, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, regularly inspect detention facilities, document conditions in accord with facility standards, investigate detainee complaints, and issue recommendations to ICE and CBP [Customs and Border Protection] when appropriate.”

An investigation by the Guardian based on interviews with five recently dismissed DHS civil rights officials, hundreds of pages of documents, and interviews with immigration attorneys, has found that the already limited oversight practiced within the DHS prior to January 2025 now appears almost nonexistent.

Of the nine people now working at the CRCL, one is its acting officer, installed in May, Troup Hemenway, a former adviser to the rightwing Project 2025 blueprint for conservative government.

Congress originally tasked the three offices, including CRCL, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman (OIDO) and the Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman (CIS), with oversight at DHS. The watchdog bodies process complaints, initiate investigations and provide guidance to DHS agencies in various areas of interest.

Now, those operations have seemingly been halted, or at least significantly slowed.

In recent months, the former DHS officials who have filed the whistleblower complaint have watched as the Trump administration has targeted political adversaries, expelled immigrants to a foreign prison, allowed officials to arrest immigrants at court appearances, encouraged officers to wear face coverings during arrests and targeted people who have lived in the US for years and have no criminal record.

Few know much about what is happening behind closed doors inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers and at secretive holding facilities.

Former DHS employees the Guardian spoke with, who were dismissed from their positions at CRCL, spoke with the Guardian on condition of anonymity to discuss matters more freely and avoid retaliation.

“They don’t care about civil rights concerns,” one former watchdog said about the Trump administration. “That’s why they fired us all. They just don’t care about the civil rights of immigrants. Even when we were there, they didn’t want to hear what we had to say – they didn’t want to let us do our jobs.”

One morning in late March, top DHS officials emailed employees at the three oversight offices, ordering them to stop working. Trump administration officials said the offices undermined DHS’s immigration enforcement operations, calling them “internal adversaries”.

A coalition of immigrant rights organizations sued the administration in Washington, declaring the cuts illegal and demanding all oversight employees be reinstated. According to a declaration filed by a top DHS official, , [sic.] nearly every single employee from the offices was fired, including 147 employees at the CRCL, 118 at the OIDO and 46 at CIS.

The Trump administration wants “no oversight into what they are doing,” said Enriquez from RFK Human Rights.

Following the lawsuit, the DHS walked back its claims that the offices were being abolished. Instead they told the federal judge they reduced the number of staff in order to “refocus” the offices and “create more efficient processes.” The internal oversight work was continuing, the DHS said, arguing the lawsuit should be tossed.

Throughout litigation, the administration has put out various staffing figures, most recently that only nine people total, including Hemenway, now worked at CRCL. Five of them are “contract” investigators, meaning that as of August, there were only two full-time CRCL investigators. Fifteen additional contractors are also reportedly at CRCL, according to the DHS court declaration, exclusively focusing on internal Equal Employment Opportunity cases for DHS employees.

“When there was a fully-staffed, robust CRCL, there were regular inspections of ICE facilities. There were contracted experts who went on those on-site oversight visits to the facilities, who provided detailed recommendations and corrective action that had to be taken when conditions were poor or when staff was mistreating the detained individuals,” the former official explained in a telephone interview with the Guardian.

“By doing the regular oversight, I don’t think it’s an understatement to say that that really saved lives.”

But now, “ I don’t think they’re happening – it certainly doesn’t seem CRCL has the staff to be doing those inspections”, the former official added.

Gold, at the GAP, said of the whistleblowers she is working with: “The idea that getting rid of basically every employee with institutional knowledge and replacing them with just a few – in the wake of daily multiple examples of the kinds of things that CRCL would have dealt with – is just deeply disturbing to them.”

Oversight at the DHS “is a guardrail that has been deliberately decimated to make sure that sand is not put in the gears of executive branch priorities”, Gold added.

Many CRCL investigations focused on complaints inside ICE detention centers, including allegations of medical neglect, sexual abuse and deaths in custody, the whistleblower complaint said. Now, the Trump administration is further expanding its immigration detention network.

“ I don’t think they care about the conditions of these facilities. I think they’re just trying to round up as many people as they can and get rid of them without any due process and without any regard for conditions,” said the former official, who worked on CRCL investigations into allegations of abuse at several facilities.

A third former official, speaking to the Guardian, warned of dangers for immigrants targeted by ICE.

“If there isn’t oversight that keeps pace, the potential for real danger is great,” that former official said, adding: “You are left to ICE policing itself.”

In 2023, the CRCL’s compliance branch received 3,104 complaints and investigated 25% of them, according to a report to congress.

“I don’t know if they’re actually reading and investigating those complaints or doing anything with the complaints,” said the former CRCL official quoted first in this report.

Sophia Genovese, an immigration attorney and faculty member at Georgetown University Law Center, has submitted over 100 complaints to CRCL.

“Nine people can’t cover a detention center, much less an entire country – especially with so many new detention centers popping up left and right,” she said. “It’s laughable that they think that they can do anything with so few staff.”

As the Trump administration ramps up its enforcement operations, Genovese is seeing an increase of cases of ICE threatening physical violence on immigrants, pressuring them to self-deport – an allegation CRCL would have likely investigated.

“I’m getting referrals every day from people who have family members who are picked up, detained and are being coerced into signing deportation orders,” said Genovese.

Immigrant advocates for years were already frustrated with CRCL’s limited powers. Typically after an investigation, CRCL officials make recommendations to DHS agencies to improve their civil rights practices but can rarely mandate changes.

“Structurally speaking, the way congress set up the agency, there were some real weaknesses,” said Enriquez from RFK. But he argues that any oversight, no matter how limited, is significantly better than no oversight. “A true solution to this problem is going to look like a massive reduction in the use of immigration detention,” he added.

That appears highly unlikely in the current climate.

Gold said of CRCL: “Even with its weaknesses at some level, it did investigations, it could mitigate problems and it provided a really important oversight function – also in terms of just getting information to Congress to do [additional] oversight. And without that, there’s just a blank check for impunity.”

CRCL always used to publish memos about completed investigations and those they were initiating, which, Genovese said, journalists and attorneys found valuable in helping reveal conditions inside ICE detention centers and other problems within the DHS.

But the Trump administration in February removed all of the CRCL’s public records from its website. (The Project on Government Oversight, an independent watchdog, later published the majority of the CRCL public records after they were scrubbed by the DHS).

“It’s a real breakdown in the rule of law. It’s really concerning,” said one former CRCL official. “It’s very upsetting.”

The main avenue of resort now is public protest and legal action, Genovese said.

“We’re seeing really incredible acts of bravery by members of the public,” she said. “That’s been helpful at preventing detention in some ways, but also educating the public about the horrors of detention.”",https://whistleblower.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/shutterstock_71874889-2.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 13:57:31.730771

Immigrant-rights group Siembra NC says ICE plans to deploy roughly 50 agents this week.

Know and assert rights: remain silent, request a lawyer, refuse consented searches.

Prepare documents and emergency plans; learn about local legal aid and support groups.

Just weeks after large-scale Border Patrol operations rattled communities in Charlotte and Raleigh, immigrant-rights advocates say another wave of federal agents is headed for the Triangle.

Immigrant-rights group Siembra NC says it learned that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to deploy 50 agents to the Triangle region this week, The News & Observer previously reported.

The news comes after Border Patrol agents were deployed to Charlotte during “Operation Charlotte’s Web” and to the Triangle last month, where hundreds of people were detained.

Here’s what you need to know.

What to do if law enforcement asks about your immigration status

According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), if law enforcement asks about your immigration status, you should stay calm and keep your hands visible. Don’t run, argue or resist, and never lie or show false documents.

It’s also important to know your rights:

You have the right to stay silent and don’t have to discuss your immigration status.

If asked by immigration agents, show your papers only if you have them.

You can refuse a search, since agents need your consent or probable cause.

If you’re over 18, carry your papers. If you don’t have them, say you want to remain silent or speak to a lawyer.

If you get pulled over, you must show your license, registration and proof of insurance, but you don’t have to discuss your immigration status.

What to do if ICE agents show up at your home

If immigration agents show up at your home, the ACLU says you should:

Ask if they’re immigration agents and what they’re there for.

Request to see their badge or ID through a window or peephole.

Ask if they have a judge-signed warrant and have them show it under the door or against the window.

Don’t open the door unless they show a judicial warrant with your name or address. Say: “I don’t consent to your entry.”

If they force entry, don’t resist. Say you’re exercising your right to remain silent and want to speak to a lawyer.

Don’t lie, show false documents, or sign anything before talking to a lawyer.

If you’re on probation with a search condition, officers may legally enter your home.

What to do if you are arrested or detained by ICE

If you are detained by ICE or Border Patrol, you can hire a lawyer, but one won’t be provided, according to the ACLU. However, you can ask for a list of free or low-cost options.

You also have the right to call family or a lawyer, meet with your lawyer in detention and have them with you at immigration hearings.

What to do if a loved one is arrested or detained

If a loved one is arrested or detained by ICE, you can try looking for them on the ICE Detainee Locator page, according to Carolina Migrant Network.

You also have the right to call family or a lawyer, meet with your lawyer in detention and have them with you at immigration hearings.

To search, you need:

The detained person’s Alien Registration Number (A-Number).

Their first and last name.

Country of origin.

Date of birth.

If your loved one is not listed in the system, you can try calling nearby detention centers. You can find a list of nearby detention centers at ice.gov/detention-facilities.

How to prepare for ICE ahead of time

Here are some ways you can prepare ahead of time if ICE arrives in the Triangle, according to the Legal Aid Justice Center:

Keep emergency contact numbers for family handy.

Make a plan for who can take care of children, pets, or property if someone is detained. You should also keep this document handy and never share it with law enforcement.

You can also try reaching out to local support groups that provide free services, such as legal clinics and rapid response help.

But a new lawsuit filed in Washington, D.C., suggests what happened to Nemer — and why — has the potential to scramble the federal workforce and upend foundational civil rights laws.

Nemer alleges that despite top performance reviews, she was dismissed from her job because of her gender, her status as a dual citizen of Lebanon and the fact that she once ran for municipal office in Ohio as a Democrat. Those reasons, she says, are all in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the First Amendment.

The government has responded by arguing that the president's power to oversee the executive branch under Article II of the U.S. Constitution essentially overrides that core civil rights law, Nemer's attorney said.

""This is a case in which the President of the United States has asserted a constitutional right to discriminate against federal employees,"" wrote her lawyer, Nathaniel Zelinsky, of the Washington Litigation Group. ""If the government prevails in transforming the law, it will eviscerate the professional, non-partisan civil service as we know it.""

The administration abruptly fired Nemer in early February, summoning her from the bench and escorting her out of a federal building in Cleveland. Both her supervisor and the chief immigration judge there told her they didn't know why she was being dismissed in the middle of her probationary period, the lawsuit said.

Federal workers on probationary status have fewer rights to contest their firing than other civil servants do, but they are still covered by constitutional protections barring retaliation for their political speech; and by civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, sex and national origin.

Nemer filed a formal discrimination complaint with an Equal Employment Opportunity office a month after she was fired. That office dismissed her claims in September, asserting in its decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act conflicts with the president's power to remove federal workers within the executive branch.

The implications sweep far beyond a single immigration judge, the new lawsuit said.

""According to the final agency decision, the President may now fire female federal workers like Ms. Nemer — because of their sex — and the law would have nothing to say about it,"" according to the new lawsuit. ""According to the final agency decision, the President can now fire federal workers born to immigrant parents with dual citizenship like Ms. Nemer — because of their national origin — and they would have no recourse. And under the same logic, the President can fire federal workers like Ms. Nemer — because of their political activities and affiliations — and the courts would be powerless to act.""

Nemer is seeking reinstatement, back pay and an order erasing her termination.

Immigrant-rights group Siembra NC says ICE plans to deploy roughly 50 agents this week.

Know and assert rights: remain silent, request a lawyer, refuse consented searches.

Prepare documents and emergency plans; learn about local legal aid and support groups.

Just weeks after large-scale Border Patrol operations rattled communities in Charlotte and Raleigh, immigrant-rights advocates say another wave of federal agents is headed for the Triangle.

Immigrant-rights group Siembra NC says it learned that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) plans to deploy 50 agents to the Triangle region this week, The News & Observer previously reported.

The news comes after Border Patrol agents were deployed to Charlotte during “Operation Charlotte’s Web” and to the Triangle last month, where hundreds of people were detained.

Here’s what you need to know.

What to do if law enforcement asks about your immigration status

According to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), if law enforcement asks about your immigration status, you should stay calm and keep your hands visible. Don’t run, argue or resist, and never lie or show false documents.

It’s also important to know your rights:

You have the right to stay silent and don’t have to discuss your immigration status.

If asked by immigration agents, show your papers only if you have them.

You can refuse a search, since agents need your consent or probable cause.

If you’re over 18, carry your papers. If you don’t have them, say you want to remain silent or speak to a lawyer.

If you get pulled over, you must show your license, registration and proof of insurance, but you don’t have to discuss your immigration status.

What to do if ICE agents show up at your home

If immigration agents show up at your home, the ACLU says you should:

Ask if they’re immigration agents and what they’re there for.

Request to see their badge or ID through a window or peephole.

Ask if they have a judge-signed warrant and have them show it under the door or against the window.

Don’t open the door unless they show a judicial warrant with your name or address. Say: “I don’t consent to your entry.”

If they force entry, don’t resist. Say you’re exercising your right to remain silent and want to speak to a lawyer.

Don’t lie, show false documents, or sign anything before talking to a lawyer.

If you’re on probation with a search condition, officers may legally enter your home.

What to do if you are arrested or detained by ICE

If you are detained by ICE or Border Patrol, you can hire a lawyer, but one won’t be provided, according to the ACLU. However, you can ask for a list of free or low-cost options.

You also have the right to call family or a lawyer, meet with your lawyer in detention and have them with you at immigration hearings.

What to do if a loved one is arrested or detained

If a loved one is arrested or detained by ICE, you can try looking for them on the ICE Detainee Locator page, according to Carolina Migrant Network.

You also have the right to call family or a lawyer, meet with your lawyer in detention and have them with you at immigration hearings.

To search, you need:

The detained person’s Alien Registration Number (A-Number).

Their first and last name.

Country of origin.

Date of birth.

If your loved one is not listed in the system, you can try calling nearby detention centers. You can find a list of nearby detention centers at ice.gov/detention-facilities.

How to prepare for ICE ahead of time

Here are some ways you can prepare ahead of time if ICE arrives in the Triangle, according to the Legal Aid Justice Center:

Keep emergency contact numbers for family handy.

Make a plan for who can take care of children, pets, or property if someone is detained. You should also keep this document handy and never share it with law enforcement.

You can also try reaching out to local support groups that provide free services, such as legal clinics and rapid response help.

Triangle immigration support groups

President Donald Trump confirmed on Sunday that he had recently spoken with Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. The U.S. administration says the strikes in the Caribbean are aimed at cartels, some of which it claims are controlled by Maduro. Trump is also weighing whether to carry out strikes on the Venezuelan mainland.

Trump holds call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu

“The two leaders stressed the importance and obligation of disarming Hamas and demilitarizing the Gaza Strip, and discussed expanding the peace agreements,” according to a statement from the Office of the Prime Minister of Israel.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The call comes a day after Netanyahu asked his country’s president to grant him a pardon from corruption charges, a move that would end a long-running trial that has bitterly divided the nation.

Trump has publicly urged Israel to pardon Netanyahu, turning to President Isaac Herzog during his speech to Israel’s parliament during an October visit. Trump also recently sent a letter to Herzog calling the corruption case “political, unjustified prosecution.”

Trump urges Israel to maintain dialogue with Syria amid growing tensions

The president in a social media posting said his administration is “very satisfied” with Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa’s efforts to stabilize Syria as the Mideast nation nears the one-year anniversary of the ouster of Bashar al-Assad.

But Trump also underscored that it’s “very important that Israel maintain a strong and true dialogue with Syria, and that nothing takes place that will interfere with Syria’s evolution into a prosperous State.”

Trump’s comments come as Israel moves to secure its northern borders. Israeli military forces raided a Syrian village on Friday and opened fire when confronted by residents, killing at least 13 people in the deadliest Israeli attack since its troops seized a swath of southern Syria a year ago.

A Border Patrol-led immigration crackdown is coming to greater New Orleans

Around 250 federal border agents are aiming to arrest 5,000 people after Monday’s expected launch of what they’re calling “Swamp Sweep,” a monthslong immigration crackdown in southeast Louisiana and into Mississippi.

The deployment centered in liberal New Orleans is the latest to target a Democratic-run city as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation agenda.

Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, who has led aggressive operations in Chicago, Los Angeles and Charlotte, North Carolina, is expected to helm the campaign. Many people in the greater New Orleans area have been on edge since the planned operations were reported this month. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said he welcomes the federal agents.

What to expect in Tennessee’s special congressional election

After a string of Democratic victories last month, the next test comes Tuesday in a special congressional election in Tennessee.

Republican Matt Van Epps and Democrat Aftyn Behn are the nominees to replace former GOP Rep. Mark Green, who resigned in July. Van Epps is a West Point graduate and former Army helicopter pilot who led the Tennessee Department of General Services and has Trump’s endorsement. Behn is a progressive state representative who has drawn comparisons to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.

The GOP is looking to pad its narrow six-vote House advantage. Most of the 7th District has elected only Republicans to Congress for more than a dozen years, but it has more Democratic voters since Republicans redrew the lines in 2022 to include parts of Davidson County, which is home to Nashville.

Aiming for a 9-0 sweep, Republicans would split Indianapolis among 4 districts

Indiana House Republicans published a draft of a map on Monday morning with new boundaries designed to oust the state’s two Democratic U.S. House members.

The city of Indianapolis would be split among four congressional districts, a major change to the current map where the city makes up the entirety of the 7th District that reliably backs Democrats.

Indiana’s other current Democratic district is in the state’s northwest corner near Chicago. The new map would instead group a large portion of Republican counties in northern Indiana with the cities of East Chicago and Gary to make a new 1st Congressional District.

Indiana lawmakers have been under mounting pressure from the White House to redistrict like Republicans in Texas, Ohio and North Carolina have. To offset the GOP gains, Democrats in California and Virginia have moved to do the same.

Indiana legislators to convene state House session with redistricting top of mind

Indiana House members are expected to convene Monday to push for redrawing the state’s congressional districts in the Republicans’ favor, increasing pressure on their defiant counterparts in the GOP-led state Senate to meet Trump’s demands.

Republicans who control the House have said there’s no doubt redistricting will pass that chamber. The proposal’s fate remains uncertain in the Senate, where Republicans have resisted pressure to redistrict for months. Senators have now agreed to meet Dec. 8 and resolve the issue.

Republicans hold seven of Indiana’s existing nine U.S. House seats. Trump and other Republicans want a map that could enable a 9-0 GOP sweep and make it harder for Democrats to flip the Republican majority in Washington.

First lady Melania Trump reveals White House Christmas decorations

“Home is Where the Heart is” is the theme she chose for her family’s first Christmas back at the White House.

The decorations also nod to next year’s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the founding of the United States of America.

The gingerbread White House, an annual highlight dating to the Nixon administration, showcases the South Portico and provides a glimpse into the Yellow Oval room as decorated by the Trumps.

The Yellow Oval is a sitting room in the president’s private living quarters on the second floor of the White House.

Former Trump lawyer Alina Habba is disqualified as New Jersey prosecutor

A federal appeals court ruled Monday that the Trump administration’s maneuvers to keep the president’s former lawyer Alina Habba in place as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor were illegal and she is disqualified.

The panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals comes amid the administration’s push to keep Habba as the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey. The judges questioned the government’s moves to keep Habba in place after her interim appointment expired and without her getting Senate confirmation.

Venezuelan leader Maduro and his allies resist US pressure

Venezuelan opposition leaders hoped U.S. military threats would weaken President Nicolás Maduro’s support. But the strategy of loyalty or punishment among the ruling party’s leadership continues to hold, despite the buildup off Venezuela’s Caribbean coast.

The Trump administration says the military operation aims to counter narcotics. But experts say these actions only strengthen Maduro and his allies and unites them against external threats.

Everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

So what does it mean? The upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise. The bottom points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices.

The term helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and unemployment has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth slows, making affordability much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households.

Rubio calls US-Ukraine talks on Russia war productive

U.S. and Ukrainian officials completed roughly four hours of talks Sunday aimed at finding an endgame to the war just days before a U.S. envoy is due in Moscow for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“It’s not just about the terms that ends fighting,” Rubio said. “It’s about also the terms that set up Ukraine for long-term prosperity. ... I think we built on that today, but there’s more work to be done.”

The Republican administration is promising to pause entry to the United States from some poor nations and review Afghans and other legal migrants already in the country.

Trump says he’ll release MRI scans

“If you want to have it released, I’ll release it,” the president said during an exchange with reporters as he traveled back to Washington from Florida.

He called the results of the October tests “perfect,” but said he could not recall which part of his body was scanned.

The Justice Department and a spokeswoman for Ms. Habba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Ms. Habba, 41, had represented Mr. Trump in several civil cases and played a public role in his 2024 presidential campaign.
When Ms. Grace was fired, the Trump administration designated Ms. Habba to fill her role as first assistant — the highest-ranking position in the office given that there was no U.S. attorney — and argued that doing so meant that Ms. Habba was effectively acting U.S. attorney.
For good measure, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, also appointed Ms. Habba a “special attorney” with jurisdiction over New Jersey.","A federal appeals court said on Monday that Alina Habba had been serving unlawfully as the U.S. attorney in New Jersey, dealing a blow to the Trump administration and most likely setting up a showdown at the Supreme Court.

Ms. Habba is one of a number of U.S. attorneys whom the Trump administration has sought to keep in power through a series of unusual maneuvers even though she was neither confirmed by the Senate nor appointed by district trial court judges — the two traditional pathways. Defendants in New Jersey had challenged her authority as U.S. attorney, leading to Monday’s decision.

In its ruling, the three-judge panel, based in Philadelphia, affirmed an earlier ruling by a Federal District Court judge. The court said that the government’s tactics had violated the law as written and concluded that, overall, the Trump administration appeared to have become frustrated by legal and political barriers to placing its favored U.S. attorneys in charge.

It was not immediately clear how the ruling would affect legal proceedings in the New Jersey federal courts or whether Ms. Habba will continue to lead the office in the near future. The courts had already been operating in a kind of limbo, given her uncertain status. Certain types of criminal cases were slowed, and some grand jury proceedings were halted.

The Justice Department and a spokeswoman for Ms. Habba did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The lawyers who challenged Ms. Habba’s authority, Abbe D. Lowell, Gerald Krovatin and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the ruling showed that “President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions.”

They vowed to continue their challenges to “President Trump’s unlawful appointments of purported U.S. attorneys.”

The case involving Ms. Habba may be the first of its kind to reach the Supreme Court, though it is possible that a similar case involving the U.S. attorney in Virginia, Lindsey Halligan, could be expedited by virtue of being entangled with criminal cases against President Trump’s enemies.

Last week, a federal judge found that Ms. Halligan, too, had been unlawfully appointed by the Trump administration. The Justice Department has vowed to appeal.

Ms. Habba, 41, had represented Mr. Trump in several civil cases and played a public role in his 2024 presidential campaign. But she had no experience in criminal law before the president named her in March to a 120-day interim term as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor. Mr. Trump nominated her to take on the role permanently, but her appointment was doomed by opposition from the state’s two Democratic senators, Cory Booker and Andy Kim.

In July, judges in the District of New Jersey declined to extend Ms. Habba’s term and instead tapped a veteran prosecutor, Desiree Leigh Grace, to lead the office. That led Attorney General Pam Bondi to disparage the judges, fire Ms. Grace and elevate Ms. Habba to the role of acting U.S. attorney through a complicated series of maneuvers that were at the heart of the appeal.

But on Monday, the three judges — L. Felipe Restrepo, D. Brooks Smith and D. Michael Fisher — said that each of those maneuvers had violated the complex set of laws that governs vacancies at the top of federal agencies.

When Ms. Grace was fired, the Trump administration designated Ms. Habba to fill her role as first assistant — the highest-ranking position in the office given that there was no U.S. attorney — and argued that doing so meant that Ms. Habba was effectively acting U.S. attorney.

For good measure, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, also appointed Ms. Habba a “special attorney” with jurisdiction over New Jersey.

But the judges wrote that the automatic elevation of the first assistant occurred only at the actual time of the vacancy, and that neither the president nor anyone else could jury-rig that process. As for the special attorney appointment, they said, it was “plainly prohibited” by law.

The Monday decision affirms a ruling by Matthew W. Brann, the chief judge for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, who concluded in August that Ms. Habba had been serving as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney without legal authority since July 1.

Lawyers with the Department of Justice, which had appealed Judge Brann’s decision to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, had argued that the president’s power was broad and gave the executive branch “substantial authority to decide who is executing the criminal laws of the United States.”

Lawyers for Cesar Humberto Pina, a defendant indicted in New Jersey on fraud charges on July 10, had countered that Ms. Habba’s installation as the state’s top prosecutor violated a law known as the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.

The lawyers, Mr. Lowell and Mr. Krovatin, said in court papers that Mr. Trump had “pursued a shell game to keep her in power.”

“Relying on a chimera of at least seven different statutes, the government has, at various times, described Ms. Habba as ‘interim U.S. attorney,’ ‘acting U.S. attorney,’ ‘first assistant U.S. attorney’ and ‘special attorney,’” they wrote. “But she does not have the authority to lead the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of New Jersey under any of those titles.”

Monday’s ruling was the second time in a week that a federal appeals court panel has dealt a heavy blow to Mr. Trump and Ms. Habba.

On Wednesday, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals based in Atlanta upheld nearly $1 million in penalties meted out by a lower court judge against the president and Ms. Habba for filing “frivolous” lawsuits against more than two dozen of his enemies, including Hillary Clinton, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, and the Democratic National Committee.

A doorbell video of law enforcement and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents visiting a home in Burlington Township on Nov. 8 has gone viral on social media.

The seven-minute video, posted to Facebook by U.S. Rep. Herb Conaway, D-New Jersey, shows masked officers speaking with the homeowner through the Ring doorbell. The homeowner's identity was redacted for their privacy and safety, a representative of Conaway's office said.

According to the congressman, the officers were on private property and ""harassing"" the homeowner without a warrant.

In a statement provided to this publication, Conaway said the video was ""another instance of ICE and federal agents acting lawlessly toward American citizens.""

""I am appalled by what is happening, and I will continue to work with my colleagues in D.C. to do everything we can to hold those responsible accountable,"" he added.

The post has received more than 52,000 reactions and nearly 19,000 comments.

Immigration concerns, and scrutiny over ICE operations, have been a rising topic of conversation over the last year in South Jersey and across the U.S., spurred by new ICE policies, talks of building a potential detainee center in Burlington County and arrests of community leaders pending immigration hearings.

According to the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Statistics dashboard, there were 1,649 arrests out of the Newark and Philadelphia offices during the 2025 fiscal year.

The video, which was sent to Conaway's office by a constituent, showed at least four masked officers identifying themselves as federal agents on the homeowner's lawn and front porch area.

When told that the homeowner was out of town, one agent questioned the cars parked outside. When asked why they were wearing masks, an agent said, ""It's cold out here, ma'am.""

The agents continued to knock on the homeowner's door, questioning her through the camera about the individual they were looking for, whose name was redacted for privacy.

The agents continued to knock on the door and peer through windows after the homeowner told them that nobody was home and that they were out of town for a death in the family.

""For people in the community who are concerned, or who have neighbors worried that this could potentially happen to them, I encourage you all to learn your rights if you encounter such a situation,"" Conaway said.

Multidistrict litigation now makes up well over half of all federal civil cases, with lawsuits that address product liability and other topics consolidated before one judge to avoid them being filed in different courts and resulting in potentially different pretrial rulings. The new rule, 16.1 under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is meant to give judges and parties a framework to get those cases off the ground, while still giving them the chance to modify them as needed for each case.

Those opening steps include an initial management conference to figure out pretrial proceedings. The rule also says parties should provide a report ahead of that conference to lay out their views on whether leadership counsel should be appointed in the case, and if so, what their roles should be.

Parties should also tell the court their initial views on discovery in the litigation, how parties will share information about the factual bases behind their arguments, and the main factual and legal issues that are likely to come up, the rule says.

Some lawyers told Bloomberg Law they had concerns about earlier drafts of the rule, saying too much rigidity would hurt the MDL process by forcing courts to follow steps that don’t fit all cases. The Judicial Conference’s Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure unanimously approved a version that its authors said was meant to be adaptable.

“Not all MDL proceedings present the management challenges this rule addresses, and, thus, it is important to maintain flexibility in managing MDL proceedings,” reads the committee note attached to the rule, which gives additional guidance to judges interpreting it.

The judiciary’s policymaking body—the Judicial Conference—and later the Supreme Court approved the rule. It was among a slate of rule changes sent to Congress, which permitted the measures to go into effect.

A draft of the rule was presented for public comment in 2023, but got pushback from plaintiffs’ attorneys over a provision that said judges could appoint “coordinating counsel” to deal with logistics in the case. Drafters dropped the language after that testimony.

Some plaintiffs’ lawyers also testified that they thought too many topics were included in the list of items that could be addressed at the initial hearing. The advisory committee drafting the rule said it’s not meant to serve as a mandatory agenda that requires a view on each listed issue.

Class action lawyers also told Bloomberg Law the rule seemed focused more on mass tort MDLs rather than their cases, which commonly involve data breaches, privacy, and antitrust issues.

The rule has its supporters. Implementing initial steps in the cases gives a pathway for finding and dismissing claims that don’t belong in the litigation, said Alex Dahl, general counsel for the advocacy group Lawyers for Civil Justice, which has pushed for the new MDL rule.

“This rule should strongly discourage the filing of meritless claims and give courts and parties an effective mechanism for identifying and dismissing them at the early stages of a new MDL,” Dahl said in a statement.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/eb1ce7e/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fe3%2F4b%2F52a782f344e585a6f94e286ac0f4%2Fgettyimages-634444702.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:30.721654

Good Monday morning, and welcome to December. This is Jack Blanchard, excitedly peeling back the corner of the political advent calendar to see what the month has in store. Get in touch.

Spoiler: We’ve got peace talks in Ukraine and possible war moves in Venezuela, an angry row over interest rates next week and an angry row over ACA credits the week after. We’ve got a glitzy FIFA World Cup draw complete with foreign guests, major Supreme Court action and at least one more immigration clampdown to squeeze in before the year is out.

In today’s Playbook …

— Pete Hegseth under pressure over “illegal” boat strike order.

— GOP rallies in Tennessee ahead of showdown election.

— New Orleans next in line for the Greg Bovino roadshow.

DRIVING THE DAY

HAPPY MONDAY: It’s only 6 a.m. on Monday morning, and it’s already a difficult week to be Pete Hegseth. The Defense secretary is now facing multiple inquiries into a lethal attack he ordered on a Venezuelan ship in September, following reporting in the Washington Post that a second deadly missile strike was ordered by U.S. forces specifically to kill off two shipwrecked survivors.

Questions, questions: President Donald Trump last night told reporters he will “find out” what happened in the Sept. 2 attack, adding a presidential line of inquiry to the two congressional oversight investigations launched at the end of last week. Venezuela’s national assembly last night also set up a special commission to investigate the attack, per Reuters.

Recap: You’ve presumably already read WaPo’s original story from last Friday, but in case not, here’s the link. Hegseth is reported to have issued a verbal order to “kill everybody” to U.S. commanders who were monitoring an alleged drug-smuggling vessel in the Caribbean. WaPo reports they took him at his word — and struck the ship with a second deadly missile, after two survivors of the first attack were spotted clinging to the wreckage.

Right of reply: Hegseth has dismissed the story as “fabricated,” and was last night merrily posting AI-generated images making light of Caribbean missile strikes that have now killed close to 100 people.

But this story looks like it has legs. Here’s why:

First: Congress is taking these allegations extremely seriously. Democrats like Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) are using the phrase “war crime.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has called for full, unedited video of the attack to be released. Republicans including Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio and Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said the reported actions, if true, would be illegal. Most significantly, the Senate Armed Services Committee announced it will be “conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts.” The House Armed Services Committee will do the same.

Second: Trump sounded intriguingly lukewarm last night when asked about the story on Air Force One. The president’s typical reaction to this type of reporting is either to aggressively dismiss it as “fake news” or a “Democrat hoax,” or to lean in and embrace the supposed offense as a positive. (An example: When it was put to Trump his immigration enforcers were going too far in Chicago, he shot back: “I think they haven’t gone far enough.”)

But Trump didn’t say any of that last night. “I don’t know anything about it,” the president told reporters on Air Force One when asked about the story, thus carefully distancing himself from his government’s actions. “[Hegseth] said he did not say that, and I believe him, 100 percent.”

So would Trump have supported a second strike? “We’ll look into it,” Trump said. “But no, I wouldn’t have wanted that. Not a second strike. Uh, the first strike was very lethal, it was fine. And if there were two people around …” He trailed off. “But Pete said that didn’t happen.”

Pressed again if there had been a second strike, Trump said: “I don’t know. I’ve gotta find out about it. But, uh, Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”

So in short: More than two days after WaPo broke the story, the president can offer no assurances about what actually happened, says he would not have supported a second strike on the ship and will now be figuring out what happened himself. It’s hardly a ringing endorsement of the Pentagon leadership.

But Hegseth is typically unruffled. On Friday he dismissed the story as “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory,” before leaning into the approach taken by U.S. forces. “As we’ve said from the beginning … these highly effective strikes are specifically intended to be ‘lethal, kinetic strikes,’” Hegseth wrote on X. “Every trafficker we kill is affiliated with a Designated Terrorist Organization.”

More noise: Hegseth’s Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell has since said the “entire narrative” was “false.” White House comms director Steven Cheung added yesterday: “The Washington Compost provided NO FACTS and NO SUBSTANTIATION. They literally just printed what some unnamed random person said and reported it as fact.”

The important context here is that plenty of Republicans and supporters were already deeply unnerved by U.S. activity in the Caribbean — both the legality of the boat strikes, and the risk America is about to be sucked into a broader conflict. Trump made the case for military action again last night, claiming each destroyed boat would have cost “25,000 American lives” due to the quantities of illegal drugs on board. The president is well aware that getting tough with drug traffickers plays well with both Hill Republicans and core MAGA voters.

But there’s a problem here too: At the weekend Trump just happened to pardon a convicted drug trafficker in Juan Orlando Hernández, a former Honduran leader who a U.S. jury found to be facilitating mass shipments of cocaine into America. (The NYT has a great piece on the jaw-dropping nature of Trump’s decision.) Even in an age of truly bonkers use of the pardon power, this is causing huge consternation to Hill Republicans who have been out there trying to defend Trump’s Caribbean policy to a skeptical public.

Heard this one before: Trump last night blamed Hernández’ conviction on Joe Biden, and said a pardon was the correct decision. Let’s see how many GOP senators agree when they start returning back to the Hill later today.

All of which means: This is definitely a good day for the Pentagon to welcome some less independent-minded media types in for a chat. The new-look Pentagon press corps — the fringe, largely conservative outlets who were willing to sign up to Hegseth’s subservient reporting rules, in exchange for access — have their first on-site briefings starting today. “Press secretary Kingsley Wilson is scheduled to conduct a briefing for the new media crew, which is then set to have a meet-and-greet and press gaggle” with Hegseth, WaPo reports.

MEANWHILE IN MOSCOW: Venezuela is hardly the only overseas issue dominating the president’s time this week. Special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner head to Moscow today ahead of their expected summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin tomorrow, with all Ukraine holding its breath. Witkoff is expected to take with him the latest contours of a Kyiv-approved peace plan to elicit a response from Putin.

Latest from the Ukraine side: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is meeting French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris today. Three of Zelenskyy’s top officials met with Witkoff, Kushner and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Miami yesterday. The WSJ reports the meeting was hailed as “productive” and “included talks on possible elections, land swaps and security guarantees.”

TRAIL MIX

FEELING SPECIAL: It’s the final day of campaigning before the special election in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, and Republicans are sprinting to ensure that what should be an easy victory does not turn into another disaster. Trump will hold a tele-rally this evening with Speaker Mike Johnson to bolster Republican Matt Van Epps, as Axios reported last week. Before that, Johnson will rally with Van Epps in Franklin at 9 a.m. Eastern and in Clarksville at 6 p.m., where RNC Chair Joe Gruters will join. The national intervention follows multiple Trump Truth Social posts over the weekend urging Tennesseans to pick Van Epps over Democratic state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who he claimed “openly disdains Country music” — a reference to resurfaced comments Behn made in 2020 — among other things.

The stakes: In this Trump +22 district, which stretches from Nashville’s Music Row through wealthy suburbs to rural areas, Van Epps is still the favorite, despite some polling showing a tight race, USA Today’s Joey Garrison and Zac Anderson preview. Though the predictive ability of special elections can be limited, a slim Van Epps win — let alone a Behn shocker, which would narrow the GOP’s House majority — would make Democrats feel good about the midterms. But Republicans have lately projected optimism that they’ve sufficiently galvanized national attention to turn out the base. They’re highlighting Behn’s progressive activism and social media comments, while she focuses intently on affordability, as CNN has reported.

Also happening tomorrow: Jersey City, New Jersey, heads to a mayoral runoff that pits former Gov. Jim McGreevey against Councilmember James Solomon, POLITICO’s Matt Friedman and Ry Rivard preview. Both are Democrats, and the race is nonpartisan. But the election offers voters another high-profile clash between younger progressives and older establishment figures, in a city once synonymous with the Garden State’s political machine — and in the shadow of Zohran Mamdani’s NYC.

RED-LIGHT REDISTRICT: Indiana state Sen. Jean Leising, one of the holdouts who has helped prevent Republicans from pushing through a new congressional gerrymander, was targeted by a pipe bomb threat at her home this weekend, she announced. Leising blamed the “D.C. political pundits” pushing mid-decade redistricting and said she “will not cave.”

PRIMARY COLORS: Even as Democrats increasingly feel upbeat about the midterms, they’re also staring down a number of high-profile, hard-fought House primaries in both safe seats and swing seats that could rend the party ideologically and generationally. POLITICO’s Nick Wu and colleagues run down the contests to watch, from California to Maine. Republicans by comparison foresee smoother sailing in the primaries.

IMMIGRATION FILES

THE CRACKDOWN CONTINUES: Trump’s series of targeted immigration enforcement operations turns to its next big city today as “Swamp Sweep” kicks off in and around New Orleans, AP’s Jack Brook and colleagues preview. Some 250 border agents will begin a push — led by Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, just as in LA, Chicago and Charlotte — that intends to secure 5,000 arrests in Louisiana and Mississippi. Similarly aggressive tactics are expected. Most unauthorized immigrants in Louisiana are Honduran.

Preparations underway: Like in those other places that have seen the Border Patrol sweep in, immigrant communities around New Orleans are hunkering down, planning to stay home or get out of the area. Taqueria Guerrero, a prominent Mexican restaurant, is closing temporarily out of concern for staff and customers, Nola.com’s Ian McNulty reports.

The national impact: Other cities are still sorting through the effects of Border Patrol bursts that rounded up thousands of people. Though DHS has emphasized the arrests of “the worst” violent criminals, WaPo’s Arelis Hernández and colleagues report that just a fraction of the more than 4,000 arrested in Chicago have been publicly identified as having serious criminal records. Meanwhile, people who oppose the mass deportation campaign around the country have trained in rapid-response tactics to monitor immigration agents, NBC’s Nicole Acevedo reports. Many Japanese Americans whose families recall internment camps are especially motivated and involved in and around the LA area, NYT’s Jill Cowan reports.

D.C. SHOOTING FALLOUT: At the same time, the Trump administration is growing more determined to limit immigration after an Afghan refugee was charged with shooting two National Guard troops in D.C, killing one. Trump said yesterday that he’s invited the parents of both the late Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom and Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe to the White House at some point to honor their children, per the AP. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said this weekend that Wolfe is still “fighting for his life.” AG Pam Bondi said on Fox News that she’ll meet with his family.

Knowing Rahmanullah Lakanwal: The suspected shooter worked in secretive “Zero Units” in Afghanistan in coordination with the CIA, Afghan groups that had intense and dangerous combat assignments to go after the Taliban, NBC’s Dan De Luce and Rich Schapiro report. These were “among the most extensively vetted of any Afghans who worked with American forces.” Many have struggled with unresolved legal work status since coming to the U.S.

BEST OF THE REST

FIRST IN POLITICO — The ACA debate: As Congress returns today, the debate over expiring enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies will take center stage — particularly as the cost of living and fears of premium spikes dominate the campaign trail. While some Republicans talk about an extension of the tax credits that makes changes, like further abortion restrictions, Planned Parenthood and Reproductive Freedom for All are warning Democrats not to fold on a clean extension. “Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Freedom for All will score any vote that adds additional abortion restrictions to the Affordable Care Act tax credits,” the organizations are announcing to members in a new letter today. Read it here

The big question: What about Trump? With just a few weeks left to figure out a solution, both parties on the Hill say a decision by the president — who has sent mixed signals so far — will be pivotal to determining what comes of this sprint, POLITICO’s Jordain Carney reports. A Senate vote on something will take place next week. It’s not clear what. Republicans have multiple competing proposals in the ether, from an extension with reforms to a comprehensive Obamacare overhaul. And Democrats aren’t unified on how much to budge either. More from POLITICO’s Inside Congress

Ailing America: In West Virginia, many ACA recipients are steeling themselves for a financial crisis if premiums explode — as in 150 percent increases or more — without the same subsidies, FT’s Guy Chazan reports from Charleston. The cliff looms just as some of the sweeping health care cuts in Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act start to hit. SNAP recipients who just got food stamps back after the shutdown-triggered lapse could start to lose them in March due to new work requirements, CNN’s Tami Luhby reports. And CNN’s Eva McKend has the story of Churchville, Virginia, where a health clinic cited the Medicaid cuts when it closed.

SCOTUS WATCH: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments beginning at 10 a.m. in two cases, including a landmark internet piracy case that examines whether Cox Communications has to pay out $1 billion in damages to dozens of record labels for not stopping copyright infringement. It’s “a case both sides say could have huge consequences for both the industry and internet users,” USA Today’s Maureen Groppe previews.

WHAT LARRY ELLISON IS READING: “White House officials have raised antitrust concerns over Netflix’s bid for Warner Bros. Discovery: sources,” by the N.Y. Post’s Charles Gasparino: “Senior White House officials recently discussed antitrust concerns surrounding Netflix’s interest in acquiring the Warner Bros. studio and the HBO Max streaming service … Several White House officials also suggested during the sitdown that a broader investigation is necessary focusing on Netflix’s market power … The meeting comes as the Warner Bros. Discovery board has scheduled a Monday afternoon deadline to receive a second round of offers.”

FED UP: Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at a Stanford University event at 8 p.m. Eastern, with nine days to go until the central bank’s fraught upcoming decision on interest rates. Trump told reporters yesterday that he’s already decided on his pick to succeed Powell, though he didn’t reveal the name yet, per Bloomberg.

SIGNS OF WITHDRAWAL: “Record-setting personnel issues are marring Trump’s second term,” by POLITICO’s Jordain Carney and colleagues: “Trump has withdrawn 57 nominations, according to Senate data … The pace of withdrawals, the highest since at least the Ronald Reagan presidency, has flown below the radar in the day-to-day churn.”

BEHIND THE DOCUMENT DUMP: “Robert Garcia leads Democrats’ strategy on Epstein probe, to GOP’s dismay,” by the LA Times’ Ana Ceballos: “Rep. Robert Garcia and his team faced a monumental task on Nov. 5: Sift through more than 20,000 documents obtained from the estate of Jeffrey Epstein … After six tedious days combing through the records, Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and four staff members identified three emails that would go on to ignite a political firestorm. In the emails, Epstein wrote that Trump had ‘spent hours’ at the late financier’s house with one of his victims and that he ‘knew about the girls.’”

Trump has denied any wrongdoing here, and there’s no evidence that he participated in Epstein’s trafficking operation.

TALK OF THE TOWN

OPEN THE DOORS — After months of closure while the East Wing was being demolished, White House tours will begin again tomorrow — just in time to see the new holiday decorations, which volunteers erected over the Thanksgiving long weekend. Journos are being invited in this morning for a sneak peak, but Fox News has already been given an early look.

The scoop they all wanted: Per Fox News, this year’s decorations include LEGO portraits of Donald Trump and George Washington, plus a gingerbread house made from “120 pounds of gingerbread dough, 100 pounds of pastillage dough, more than 10 pounds of chocolate, nearly 80 pounds of royal icing and five pounds of isomalt sugar.” Nobody tell RFK Jr.

BILL OF HEALTH — Trump told reporters he will release his October MRI, which the White House hasn’t yet provided details about. He said he had “no idea” what body part the MRI scan was focused on, but insisted it wasn’t his brain.

SPOTTED on Friday night on the patio at the president’s table at Mar-a-Lago: President Donald Trump, U.S. Ambassador to India Sergio Gor, U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro, Christopher Ruddy and Anthony and Lynda Lomangino.

Lawyers say thousands could benefit from the order, but it’s expected to be appealed.

U.S. District Judge Sunshine S. Sykes on Tuesday expanded an order from last week granting detained immigrants with no criminal history the opportunity to request a bond hearing. Now, instead of only impacting a few named in the California lawsuit, the decision will apply to immigrants held in detention nationwide.

It’s part of an ongoing lawsuit challenging changes the Trump administration made over the summer when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it was revisiting its authority to detain people and would make noncitizens ineligible for bond hearings before an immigration judge.

Prior to the policy change, most noncitizens with no criminal record who were arrested away from the border had an opportunity to request such a hearing and if bond was granted remain free while their cases wound through immigration court.

Sykes issued an order on Thursday that found the new policy unlawful.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, Tricia McLaughlin, released a statement Wednesday that pointed to a September decision from the Justice Department’s Board of Immigration Appeals allowing the new policy.

She said the previous policy “dangerously unleashed millions of unvetted illegal aliens into American communities—and they used many loopholes to do so.”

Her statement did not say whether Sykes’ decision would be appealed and the department did not respond to questions on the matter.

Tuesday’s decision could impact thousands of immigrants but not all. Those with criminal convictions or who have an expedited removal order would still not be allowed a bond hearing.

Matt Adams, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said he has heard of immigration judges already advising some immigrants of their right to a bond hearing since Sykes’ orders were filed.

“These are people who’ve been living here in the United States, many for years, many for decades, who have U.S. citizen family members, who have no criminal history, who do not present any danger or threat of a flight risk, and yet they were being locked up without any possibility of being released during these lengthy proceedings,” Adams said.",https://nydailyrecord.com/files/2024/02/Depositphotos_643534474_L.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:36.378800

An immigration judge recently denied Ngựa asylum but granted him protection under the anti-torture convention.
In an order granting F.B.’s release last month, U.S. district court judge Tanya Walton Pratt in Indiana said the government’s claim that F.B.","R.V. had already spent six months detained at a facility in California when he won his case in immigration court in June.

He testified that he had fled his native Cuba in 2024 after protesting against the government, for which he was jailed, surveilled and persecuted. So, after being kidnapped in Mexico, he entered the U.S. illegally and told border agents he was afraid for his life.

An immigration court judge granted him protection against deportation to Cuba, and R.V., 21, was looking forward to reuniting with family in Florida.

But R.V., who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation from the government, hasn’t been released. At the detention center, he said, agents have told him they’ll still find a way to deport him — if not to Cuba, then maybe Panama or Costa Rica.

“The wait is so hard,” he said in an interview. “It’s as if they don’t want to accept that I won.”

R.V. is among what immigration attorneys describe as an escalating trend: some immigrants who win protection from deportation to their home countries are being detained indefinitely.

Often, the person has been held while the federal government appealed their win or sought another country willing to take them in.

The government has long had the ability to make such appeals or to seek another country where it could deport someone; the Department of Homeland Security generally has 90 days to find somewhere else to send them.

But, in practice, such third-country removals were rare, so the person was typically released and allowed to remain in the U.S.

That practice has changed under the Trump administration. Recent instructions to Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel favor keeping people detained. A June 24 memo, for instance, states that “field offices no longer have the option to discretionarily release aliens.”

At issue are cases involving immigrants who, rather than winning asylum, are granted one of two kinds of immigration relief, known as orders of “withholding of removal” and protection under the international Convention Against Torture. Both have higher burdens of proof than asylum but don’t provide a pathway to citizenship.

These forms of relief differ from asylum in a key way: while asylum protects against deportation anywhere, the others only protect against deportation to a country where the person risks harm or torture.

Jennifer Norris, an attorney at the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said the government’s actions now effectively render withholding of removal and protection under the anti-torture convention meaningless.

“We have entered a dangerous era,” Norris, said. “These are clients who did everything right. They won their cases before an immigration judge and now they’re treated like criminals and remain in detention even after an immigration judge rules in their favor.”

Laura Lunn, advocacy and litigation director with the Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network in Colorado, noted that rules against double jeopardy do not apply in these cases, so the government has the ability to appeal when it loses.

“Here, they have so much control over whether someone remains detained because, if they just file an appeal, that person can just sit in detention for at least six months or what could be years,” Lunn said.

Homeland Security did not respond to specific questions and declined to comment.

Lawyers representing immigrants in prolonged detention say the government is keeping people locked up in hopes of wearing down their clients so they abandon their fight to remain in the U.S.

Ngựa, a Vietnamese man who asked to be identified by his family nickname, meaning horse, has been detained in California since he crossed the southern border illegally in March.

Ngựa fled Vietnam last year after being tortured by police officers who tried to extort him for a “protection tax,” according to his asylum application. When he refused, the officers beat and jailed him, and threatened to kill him and his family.

An immigration judge recently denied Ngựa asylum but granted him protection under the anti-torture convention. His pro bono lawyers have appealed the asylum denial.

In an interview through an interpreter, he said he chose to seek safety in the U.S. because he believed that the government of any other country would deport him back to Vietnam. He said he didn’t anticipate that U.S. officials would try to get rid of him.

Ngựa said ICE officers told him they know they can’t send him back to Vietnam, but will find another country willing to take him in. Every morning, he said, an officer goes from dormitory to dormitory asking whether anyone wants to self-deport.

The thought of being sent away keeps him up at night, but the alternative is nearly just as bad: “I’m afraid that I will be detained here for years,” he said.

DHS regulations allow continued detention when “there is a significant likelihood of removing a detained alien in the reasonably foreseeable future.”

Such scenarios are increasingly possible since a Supreme Court ruling in June broadened the ability for immigration authorities to quickly deport people to countries where they have no personal connection.

After the ruling, ICE released guidance directing agents to generally give migrants slated for removal to a third country “at least 24 hours” notice, but as little as six hours in “exigent circumstances.”

The guidance also said the U.S. needs to receive credible diplomatic assurances that the deported people will not be persecuted or tortured.

This year, the Trump administration has brokered deals with several countries, including Ghana, El Salvador, and South Sudan — which is on the brink of civil war — to accept deportees.

“It has just become more of a regular practice for the government to hold onto people who win protection because they are actively looking, in most cases, for a third country to accept them,” said Trina Realmuto, executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.

Realmuto is one of the lead attorneys in the case challenging Homeland Security’s practice of third-country removals.

Federal law states that Homeland Security should first seek out alternative countries to which the person being deported has some personal connection, and then, if that’s “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible,” find a country whose government is willing to accept them.

Realmuto said the Trump administration is skipping straight to that last resort. As a result, she said, several people who were deported to a third country have been sent by officials there back to the country they originally fled.

Among them is Rabbiatu Kuyateh, a 58-year-old woman who fled Sierra Leone’s civil war 30 years ago and settled in Maryland until ICE agents detained her this summer during her annual check-in.

NBC News reported that because a judge had banned ICE from sending her back to Sierra Leone, where she had been tortured, the agency deported her to Ghana. But Ghanaian officials forcibly put her on a bus to Sierra Leone.

In fiscal year 2024, 2,506 people were granted withholding of removal or protection under the anti-torture convention, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Realmuto said that, like Kuyateh, tens of thousands of immigrants have been granted withholding or deferral relief over the course of several decades. Such people could now be at risk of being detained again while the government works to remove them to another country, she said.

The case of F.B., a 27-year-old Colombian woman who entered the U.S. at the San Ysidro port of entry in 2024, further illustrates the government’s approach toward the anti-torture convention. F.B. asked to be identified by her initials out of fear of retaliation by the U.S. government.

In February, F.B. won protection under the anti-torture convention. But instead of releasing her, Homeland Security said it was attempting to remove her to Honduras, Guatemala or Brazil.

In September, lawyers for F.B. filed a petition in federal court for her release.

“It’s kind of hard to argue somebody’s removal is imminent when they’ve been detained for eight months,” said her attorney, Kristen Coffey.

Court records show the judge initially denied the petition after ICE officials claimed they had booked a flight for her to Bolivia that would leave three days later.

But a month after that, she was still in U.S. custody.

In an order granting F.B.’s release last month, U.S. district court judge Tanya Walton Pratt in Indiana said the government’s claim that F.B. would be imminently deported had “proven false,” and that keeping her detained was “contrary to the Constitution and laws of the United States.”

She was released the same day.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1d1d3de/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3309x1737+0+234/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F37%2Fa4%2F1369ebdf41b1ae71b5e52946ead7%2F1440415-me-0425-asylum-app-rcg-1765.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:39.592631
,Agencies,2025-12-01 15:30:33+00:00,Los Angeles Times,L.A. County supervisors are set to ban masks worn by ICE agents. Can they win a battle with Trump?,"Melissa Gomez, www.latimes.com, melissa-gomez",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-12-01/la-county-supervisors-ordinance-banning-masked-ice-agents-trump,"On Tuesday, L.A. County supervisors Janice Hahn and Lindsey P. Horvath will introduce the ordinance for a vote.
The ordinance would also require law enforcement officers, including local, state and federal, to wear identification and make clear their agency affiliation.
The masks and lack of identification have sowed fears the armed men could be people posing as law enforcement officers.
“This is how an authoritarian’s secret police operate — not legitimate law enforcement in a democracy,” she said.
“Sanctuary politicians attempting to ban our federal law enforcement from wearing masks is despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers,” she said in a statement.","Los Angeles County supervisors plan to vote soon on an ordinance that would prohibit law enforcement, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, from wearing masks or disguising their identities while conducting operations in unincorporated L.A. County, probably setting up a legal battle with the Trump administration.

On Tuesday, L.A. County supervisors Janice Hahn and Lindsey P. Horvath will introduce the ordinance for a vote. The ordinance would also require law enforcement officers, including local, state and federal, to wear identification and make clear their agency affiliation.

Since immigration agents began raiding Los Angeles neighborhoods and worksites in June, many local leaders have pushed for action on the issue. Residents are concerned about the masked agents, often disguised with face coverings and masks. The masks and lack of identification have sowed fears the armed men could be people posing as law enforcement officers. Residents have called on sheriff’s deputies and police for help, only to be told that local agencies do not interfere with federal operations.

If the ordinance is approved, it will — per county policy — go again before supervisors for a second vote, scheduled for Dec. 9. It would then go into effect 30 days later. But legal experts have cast doubt that federal agents would be required to follow the ordinance, and federal officials have already issued a legal challenge to similar state-level legislation.

L.A. County counsel Dawyn R. Harrison told the supervisors the ordinance “would most likely be challenged on the supremacy clause,” which holds that federal law supersedes state and local law.

Hahn has acknowledged that the federal government will probably take action against the ordinance. Still, she said in a statement, she never thought she would see the day when a “masked, anonymous federal police force” would target people based on their skin color and spoken language and force people into unmarked vans at gunpoint.

Just last week, her office said, nine people were picked up by masked ICE agents at worksites across Long Beach. According to the Long Beach Post, ICE agents chased a gardener into a restaurant in front of Long Beach police officers. Hahn said that the ordinance is driven by repeated instances of L.A. County residents encountering plainclothes or masked agents who refuse to identify themselves or show ID.

“This is how an authoritarian’s secret police operate — not legitimate law enforcement in a democracy,” she said. “This is about our residents’ constitutional rights — and this ordinance is designed to protect them. So, if this means a fight with the federal government in the courts, I think it is a fight worth having.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin has defended the tactic of agents wearing masks in order to protect their identities and keep them safe amid reported increased violence against federal officers. Previously, she stated that officers do verbally identify themselves, wear vests identifying their agency and use vehicles that include the name of the department, although agents are also often seen detaining people while wearing street clothing, without visible badges and driving unmarked cars.

McLaughlin said the administration will not abide by any attempt to ban masks.

“Sanctuary politicians attempting to ban our federal law enforcement from wearing masks is despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers,” she said in a statement.

Hahn, when asked if the board is considering alternatives if the ordinance fails to stand legal muster, said supervisors would “cross that bridge if we come to it.”

Since the immigration raids began on June 6 in Los Angeles through Aug. 26, the Department of Homeland Security has arrested at least 5,000 undocumented people in the county, the board’s Tuesday motion states, a number that has only gone up with the raids continuing. The motion states the ordinance would make exceptions for law enforcement officers wearing face coverings during undercover operations, as part of SWAT duties or for protection reasons.

“In an unprecedented moment when Los Angeles County’s immigrant communities are under attack, it is essential that the Board implement policies that cement its support for immigrants’ rights, and the rights of all people who may interact with law enforcement,” Hahn wrote in a motion for the ordinance. “It is reasonable to expect all officers — local, state, and federal — to comply with an ordinance that simply requires them to clearly show the public that they actually are law enforcement officers who are acting within the course of their duties.”

The California Legislature passed a similar bill that would require agents to identify themselves and prohibit on-duty officers from covering their faces.

After Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill, the federal government sued to stop it from taking effect.

Atty Gen. Pam Bondi made it clear the government would challenge any and all similar legislation, which she said is unconstitutional.

“California’s anti-law enforcement policies discriminate against the federal government and are designed to create risk for our agents,” Bondi said in a statement. “These laws cannot stand.”

During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals.
The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns.","A national coalition of legal, academic and advocacy organisations has today called for an urgent reform of Australia's immigration and detention system, releasing a joint submission to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention.

The Working Group begins an official 12-day visit to Australia today. Its investigations will include immigration detention policies that cause harm to people seeking safety and risk breaching international human rights law. The Working Group haspreviously expressed apprehension about the rising number of Australian immigration detention cases it receives, and alarm at the Government’s failure to ensure the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people.

The joint civil society submission raises 17 areas of concern to be discussed with the Australian Government. Crucially, the submission urges the Working Group to reaffirm that immigration detention is meant to be an exceptional measure used only as a last resort, and to recommend that Australia introduce procedural safeguards to ensure that detention is lawful and subject to effective, periodic and independent review. The submission also urges the Working Group to recommend that Australia introduce a legally enforceable obligation not to detain children for immigration purposes under any circumstances.

Other areas of concern raised by the submission include:

offshore detention in the context of offshore processing and third-country transfers to Nauru;

the conditions and lack of effective oversight of immigration detention in Australia;

the increased securitisation and use of force and restraints, and lack of adequate healthcare for people in immigration detention;

the lack of post-release support for people who have spent protracted periods of time in detention, in order to reduce the risks of re-detention; and

specific issues relating to the detention of women and other vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities, transgender people and children.

The civil society submission sets out clear steps the Australian Government can take to bring its policies into line with international law and ensure people seeking safety are treated with dignity.

The Working Group is a body of independent experts with a mandate to investigate cases of deprivation of liberty imposed arbitrarily or inconsistently with international human rights standards. Country visits occur at the invitation of national governments. During its visit to Australia, the Working Group will meet with national and local authorities, civil society and affected individuals. It will present its preliminary findings and recommendations at the conclusion of its visit, on 12 December 2025, and report to the UN Human Rights Council in September 2026.

Madeline Gleeson, Senior Research Fellow, Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law, UNSW Sydney, said: ‘After years of growing concern about arbitrary and unlawful detention practices in Australia, this visit provides an important opportunity for the Working Group to discuss urgent reforms with the Australian government. We call on the government to reaffirm the presumption of liberty, and to ensure that people are only ever deprived of their liberty when it is absolutely necessary to do so.’

Laura John, Associate Legal Director, Human Rights Law Centre,said: ‘Australia is in the midst of an incarceration crisis, with migrants and refugees facing extended periods in immigration detention and the extension of detention into the community through punitive surveillance measures. We welcome this opportunity for the Working Group to hold our government accountable for its systemic and arbitrary deprivation of people’s liberty here in Australia and offshore in Nauru.’

Fr. Brett O’Neill, S.J., Country Director, Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) Australia, said: ‘JRS Australia has accompanied refugees and people seeking asylum for more than 40 years, many in or in the wake of immigration detention. We have seen the harsh effects of detention without due process. The Working Group’s visit is an opportunity for Australia to reset; to recognise the profound harm caused by arbitrary detention, and move towards a humane, transparent system that upholds the dignity of every person seeking safety.’

Zaki Haidari, Refugee Rights Strategic Campaigner, Amnesty International Australia, said: ‘Australia’s mandatory detention and offshore processing policies are harsh, cruel and inconsistent with Government’s obligations under the international conventions it has signed. The conditions faced by the most vulnerable individuals in detention in Australia and offshore, and the length of time people are held in detention, raise many serious human rights concerns. We urge the Working Group to recommend that the Australian Government immediately end its mandatory detention policy and offshore processing regime.’

Paul Power, CEO, Refugee Council of Australia, said: ‘This civil society report delivers a damning assessment of ongoing human rights violations in Australia’s immigration detention system. It exposes the punitive, highly securitised nature of onshore facilities which, far from functioning as administrative centres, inflict serious harm on people lawfully seeking protection. As Australia enters a new phase of contracted security and health services in detention centres, the Refugee Council of Australia calls for urgent reform, better care and independent oversight to ensure detention is a last resort, and that Australia upholds its international obligations.’

Sarah Dale, Centre Director & Principal Solicitor, RACS said: ‘Immigration detention has been a source of shame for this country for far too long. With the UN visit, I hope the Australian Government will take seriously the chorus of voices at all levels, nationally and internationally, calling for people seeking safety to be treated with justice and dignity. Australia should be leading in human rights rather than continuing to treat flagrantly the human rights of refugees.’

Ogy Simic, Head of Advocacy, Asylum Seeker Resource Centre said: ‘Australia's system of mandatory detention is shameful, and the abuses it has inflicted have caused immense pain and suffering to so many people - some of whom may never recover. This visit from the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention is an opportunity for Australia to reassess this policy and the cruelty with which it is inflicted on innocent people

When Thera asked how many companies were being targeted, the agent replied, “We are auditing all companies in Northern California.” Thera said the agent admitted it was his first such audit, suggesting the campaign is still ramping up.

The audits come amid wider federal pressure on California’s trucking sector:

FMCSA revoked 17,000 non-domiciled CDLs issued to foreign nationals earlier this month after finding the state failed to verify legal residency. Another 44,000 remain under review.

A reinstated English-language proficiency requirement for CDL holders has already pulled 7,248 drivers off the road since June.

ICE workplace enforcement actions in California rose sharply in 2025, with 77 Northern California trucking firms hit in the first half of the year alone.

Industry sources say many smaller Punjabi carriers still operate with 1099 independent contractors, a model that keeps costs competitive but leaves them exposed to both AB5 labor claims and now federal immigration audits.

Scale of the Punjabi Trucking Community in California

California is home to an estimated 50,000–74,000 Punjabi/Sikh truck drivers and owner-operators – roughly 40% of the state’s total long-haul driver pool.

Nationwide, the Punjabi/Sikh trucking community is estimated at 150,000–200,000 drivers and owners, controlling up to 20% of U.S. trucking companies despite representing only about 4–5% of the overall driver workforce.

The North American Punjabi Trucking Association (NAPTA) lists more than 1,400 member companies operating over 9,000 trucks, though this represents only a fraction of the total community.

ICE is currently working out of a building on Milwaukee School of Engineering’s campus, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.
There has been tremendous solidarity and outrage from the community over the construction of the 36,000 square foot facility in Milwaukee, according to Neumann-Ortiz.
Neumann-Ortiz said that by calling the ICE facility a processing center, it whitewashes and scales down the abuses that often occur in these facilities.
“It is about building a larger facility for processing,” Neumann-Ortiz said.","Construction of a new U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing facility began on the north side of Milwaukee, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee. ICE is currently working out of a building on Milwaukee School of Engineering’s campus, according to Fox 6 Milwaukee.

Community members, including organizations such as VOCES de la Frontera and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities, protested outside the new building Nov. 15, according to Wisconsin Examiner. There has been concern about the lack of transparency and communication with local leaders by ICE, according to VOCES de la Frontera executive director Christine Neumann-Ortiz.

“The position of the federal government has been that the local government doesn’t really have a voice in whether to move forward with this,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “In the current context, we’re witnessing an ICE and Customs and Border Patrol that has been profiling people, physically assaulting them for no reason and violating people’s due process in a myriad of ways.”

Neumann-Ortiz said the Trump administration’s “campaign of terror” is unwanted by communities as it is based on white supremacist ideas and is a misuse of tax dollars. She said the federal government is spending billions of dollars on this, while people go hungry and cannot access affordable housing and healthcare.

There has been tremendous solidarity and outrage from the community over the construction of the 36,000 square foot facility in Milwaukee, according to Neumann-Ortiz. ICE has been explicit that the facility is going to be expanded to hold more people for longer periods of time, she said.

“It’s been called the deadliest year in terms of ICE custody because they’re going after everybody, [including] seniors and people in our community who have health conditions,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “The conditions in which they’re [ICE] holding people are not good, and they’ve been notoriously not good, and we’ve seen an increase in death because of lack of medical care and suicide.”

Neumann-Ortiz said organizations and community members need to make sure this facility expansion does not take place through nonviolent activity and lobbying. VOCES de la Frontera is seeking policies that actually make the community better and support good immigration reform at the federal and state level, Neumann-Ortiz said.

Milwaukee is home to the largest population of immigrants in Wisconsin, and many are a part of mixed-status households, according to UW professor in the School for Workers Armando Ibarra. The expansion of this facility is perpetuating uncertainty for immigrants and individuals who come from immigrant households, Ibarra said.

“This idea that there was a facility that was going to be expanded in Milwaukee was announced in January of 2025, and even back then, there were elected officials and some organizations that were speaking up against this,” Ibarra said. “ICE used a federal exemption to avoid the city approval process, and they modified this building into this processing slash detaining center.”

There are many individuals on campus in precarious situations because the Trump administration has designated certain immigration statuses as less stable than in the past, according to Ibarra.

Ibarra said that there is increased uncertainty for international students, international professors on H-1B visas and individuals under DACA. Immigrants and individuals from mixed-status families are also at a heightened risk and experiencing a lot of fear, according to Ibarra.

Ibarra said many people are pushing back against what is happening with ICE expansion nationwide, namely in cities such as Chicago, Charlotte and Los Angeles. Some people who were not politically active in the past are now participating in these movements, according to Ibarra.

“They’re [protesters] protecting their neighbors, they’re protecting the community, they’re protecting their loved ones or [they have] just a sense of patriotism that is inclusive of their neighbors, loved ones and people that are positive members of their communities,” Ibarra said.

VOCES de la Frontera considers the Keeping Families Together and State Driver’s License bills as important areas of advocacy in Wisconsin, according to Neumann-Ortiz. Both of these are important pieces of legislation for holding ICE accountable, she said.

Neumann-Ortiz said that by calling the ICE facility a processing center, it whitewashes and scales down the abuses that often occur in these facilities. She said these facilities are essentially jail since they do not allow freedom of movement, and often lead to people being moved to other facilities and then deported.

“It is about building a larger facility for processing,” Neumann-Ortiz said. “It could mean we’re going to move you to another detention facility in another state, which is happening right now, where people are not able to access their attorneys or connect with family.”",https://badgerherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMGL4385-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:22.097085

Michael Vastine is a faculty member of the Stetson University College of Law and also serves as an Academic Advisory Board Member for the Acacia Center for Justice. A nationally recognized expert, leading litigator, and academic in the fields of immigration law and immigrant defense, he has also held numerous elected and appointed leadership at the national level of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and the AILA South Florida Chapter, including a term as Chair. Professor Vastine has litigated extensively before the U.S. Courts of Appeals, in cases arising from his clinical practice and primarily construing the “categorical approach” for determining the immigration consequences of crimes, including foundational cases on questions of mens rea elements, definitions of controlled substances, trafficking, firearms, and crimes involving moral turpitude. He also argued the Florida Supreme Court case establishing the post-Padilla v. Kentucky standard for effective criminal defense of immigrants. He has separately authored numerous amicus curiae briefs for AILA and other organizations in litigation of similar issues at the Courts of Appeals and, occasionally, before the U.S. Supreme Court, in addition to work challenging the constitutionality of the prolonged detention of immigrants.

This blog post is a crosspost with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, you can find their version of the post.

Following a recent court order, the U.S. government has resumed fully funding the “National Qualified Representative Program” (NQRP), a formal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Department of Justice (DOJ) program which provides legal counsel to “certain detained immigrants deemed incompetent to represent themselves by an immigration judge.” Since 2013, the NQRP has improved due process for detained people with debilitating mental health conditions and has also, as a consequence, help to make the immigration courts run more efficiently. Despite these efficiencies, the program became one of the many ironic casualties of DOGE government cuts. A federal judge found the cessation of counsel to be “arbitrary and capricious,” further noting that the executive branch had conceded the point. With NQRP funding restored for only the next year, it is critical to understand the purpose and impact of the program, so it can be recognized and protected. This moment of reprieve also underscores the need for a more secure foundation for the program. At present, the program is only protected by court order and is reliant, entirely, on the opinions of the judiciary of the California District Courts to keep it alive. For the sake of its long-term sustainability, NQRP should also be written into legislation, enacted by state or federal-level Congressional representatives.

Fifteen years ago, for the first time, a judge ordered the federal government to provide representation for two detained immigrants in their removal cases before the immigration court. This step was unprecedented, because while immigrants have a right to be represented, unlike in the criminal court system, they don’t have a right to be provided an attorney at government expense. The two immigrants at issue presented such profound mental health conditions that it was impossible for them to represent themselves. I agreed to co-represent pro bono one of the two, a homeless refugee client whom the judge noted to present “very active and pronounced psychotic disorder, schizophrenia of the paranoid type ... frequent auditory hallucinations .... [and] psychosis … that prevented him from expressing himself”, a condition so serious that he had years earlier been voluntarily committed to a treatment facility. In this test case, we lost our client’s case for bond, with the immigration judge setting a bond amount that was prohibitively high, given his life circumstances.

These cases affirmed that attorneys’ management of these cases and advocacy for their vulnerable clients – presenting evidence, expert materials, testimony, and argument - is helpful for delivering justice. It is also very helpful for the cost management of these cases. Why?: 1) Detaining people is expensive (at least $152 daily, per detainee), but detaining mentally ill immigrants is very expensive; and 2) court cases (which sometimes can languish for years, even in the detained setting) move much faster in the hands of a defense attorney than when a mentally ill immigrant attempts to represent themself. I took the case because I thought it was valuable to see if a system of appointed attorneys might help, even if the pro bono model was unsustainable over the long term. Through our advocacy, the client did not immediately win his freedom, but his case was part of an important moment.

Soon thereafter, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued the first in a line of rulings explaining standards and safeguards for immigration court cases of immigrants with severe mental health conditions. The BIA rulings were limited victories for immigrants and largely procedural. The factual basis for a non-citizen’s removal often is simple to prove (e.g. they lack a visa, overstayed their authorized time in the U.S., or committed a removable offense), but the court had to first affirm the noncitizen’s understanding of the purpose of the proceedings, and take steps to facilitate the case, often in the form of permitting a “friend of the court” (a non-attorney relative, friend, caretaker) to actively participate and engage with the judge. Cases for “relief” from removal were much more complicated, as incompetent non-citizens faced inevitable challenges in proving that they merited favorable discretion or faced likely future persecution in their country of origin if removed. Without assistance of defense counsel, immigrants’ legal outcomes were daunting. As well, judges, already faced with crushing case backlogs, can’t shoulder the responsibility of facilitating fair hearings without investing an inordinate amount of time, themselves, in exploring the cases of immigrants who cannot effectively communicate these case details to the court.

Thus, the government, during the Obama administration, realized that investing in due process provided tangible returns and made the NQRP part of formal DHS and DOJ policy. The caseload of the NQRP is modest in real numbers amounting to just over two thousand cases over the last twelve years. Less than 900 of these cases were open at the time funding was cut in early 2025. Nevertheless, each represented case was a realization of the American promise of a system of laws and due process.

Year one of the second Trump administration is a remarkable time for the United States which, until recently, proudly proclaimed itself a nation of immigrants. By the narrowest of margins, Congress recently authorized a spending increase for immigration detention and enforcement that would add up to more than 1 trillion dollars over a period of ten years. This massive increase in spending has been justified under the pretext of countering criminality, despite the bevy of academic research showing that there’s no connection between immigration and crime rates. Moreover, immigrants who do commit crimes are already subject to removal and most are subject to mandatory detention under existing laws. The Supreme Court is permitting this enforcement to include removal of immigrants to harsh, dangerous foreign prisons or war-torn places to which they have no ties.

Against this factual backdrop, the accompanying rhetoric, and military on the city streets of our heretofore free society, it is perhaps quaint to invoke principles, even those enshrined in the constitution, but due process matters, even – especially – for unpopular groups and even more so for vulnerable ones such as the mentally disabled. Due process ensures that the awesome power of justice is meted out appropriately, including the power of a country to remove a person from its territory. In this context, principle converges with practicality, as investment in representation produces efficiency.

The recent court order rejected the arbitrary way in which NQRP met its demise. The administration has, thus far, complied with the court’s order to continue fully funding NQRP, through its major stakeholders, who have an established track record of implementing services for the target recipients nationwide. There was no financial reason not to pursue the principled path. Now that it is restored, funding for the National Qualified Representative Program must be permanently protected, and Congress should move to enact legislation on its behalf.",https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/meta_open_graph/public/2025-12/tingey-injury-law-firm-ycdpu73kgsc-unsplash.jpg?itok=PQcXf16B,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:44.534844

Trump 'wouldn't have wanted' second strike on Caribbean boat

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One yesterday, the president defended Hegseth, saying he believed his statement “100%” that he hadn’t ordered the second strike.

“I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”

When asked if he would have wanted a second attempt to kill the survivors, the president said:

We’ll look into it, but no, I wouldn’t have wanted that – not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal.”

The Washington Post reported that Hegseth “gave a spoken directive” to “kill everybody” on board in September. When there were still two men left after the first strike, a Special Operations commander ordered the follow-up to comply with Hegseth’s direction, the newspaper reported.

Hegseth has strongly denied the report, calling it “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory”.

He also said the US’s strikes on boats so far in the Caribbean had been “lawful under both US and international law”.

As Pete Hegseth continues to face scrutiny following a Washington Post report that he “gave a spoken directive” on 2 September to “kill everybody” on board in a second strike on an alleged drug-trafficking vessel, the defense secretary appeared glib on social media.

He posted a picture on Sunday evening, which shows a parody cover of a Franklin the Turtle book, where the beloved character is shooting small boats below him filled with men transporting drugs. “For your Christmas wish list,” Hegseth captioned the illustration.

The defense secretary continues to deny the Post’s claims. “As usual, the fake news is delivering more fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory reporting to discredit our incredible warriors fighting to protect the homeland,” he wrote in a statement on Friday.

Trump backs GOP candidate in Tennessee special election as race tightens

Over the weekend, the president threw his weight behind Matt Van Epps, the Republican candidate in the special election in Tennessee’s seventh congressional district. Van Epps is running against Aftyn Behn – a Democratic state representative – to replace former GOP congressman Mark Green. A reminder, that Trump carried the district by 22 points in 2024, but after the success of November’s elections for Democrats across the country, the party is hoping to flip the Maga stronghold.

“HE WILL BE A GREAT CONGRESSMAN,” Trump said of Van Epps on Truth Social, adding that while he “cherishes Christianity and Country Music”, his opponent “hates them both”. This comes after Republicans have criticized Behn for resurfaced comments on a 2020 podcast. “I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music,” she said of Nashville, which is part of the district she’s running to represent.

My colleague, Chris Stein, reports that a survey from Emerson College Polling and the Hill found Van Epps up by just two percentage points over Behn, leading with 48% support to her 46%. He adds that the district is mostly made up of the sort of rural territory in which Democrats have struggled to compete, but also includes part of blue-leaning Nashville, as well as the city of Clarksville, a swing area whose residents may well decide the race.

Trump continues to lambast Democratic lawmakers over troops video

The president has picked up where he left off before Thanksgiving, when it comes to his anger at the six Democratic lawmakers who took part in a video urging service members to “refuse illegal orders”.

A reminder, that Trump initially went on a Truth Social tirade, accusing the members of Congress (all of whom are veterans or former intelligence officials) of sedition, adding that their actions are “punishable by death”.

In the early hours of Monday morning (12:45am ET to be precise) Trump recounted the US Code, including a section which calls for the fine or imprisonment, for up to 10 years, for those who “interfere, impair, influence the loyalty, moral or discipline of the military and naval forces”.

“DO WHAT HAS TO BE DONE!!!,” Trump concluded on social media today.

Trump's envoys Witkoff and Kushner to meet with Putin in Moscow

Donald Trump’s top envoy, Steve Witkoff, is set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Tuesday. He’ll be joined by the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has been integral in the ongoing negotiations with Russia.

Trump invites families of national guard members shot in DC to the White House

After two members of the West Virginia national guard were shot in DC last week, the president has invited their families to the White House.

One soldier, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, was killed in the attack –which took place the day before Thanksgiving. Her fellow service member, US air force staff Sgt Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains hospitalized in critical condition. Vigils across West Virginia have taken place in their memory.

“I said: ‘When you’re ready, because that’s a tough thing, come to the White House. We’re going to honor Sarah,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. “And likewise with Andrew, recover or not.”

My colleague, Marina Dunbar, reports that mourners came together over the weekend at Webster County high school in West Virginia to honor Beckstrom. Both she and Wolfe had been serving with the West Virginia national guard as part of Trump’s federal initiative to support policing efforts in DC.

Venezuela called the strikes 'murder'

Venezuela’s National Assembly has accused the US of committing “murder” with the strikes. It is one of the first acknowledgements by Venezuelan officials that their citizens have been targeted.

“There’s no declared war [between the US and Venezuela)] therefore this cannot be classified as anything but murder,” Jorge Rodriguez, the National Assembly president, told a press conference on Sunday.

“Every human being has the right to due process; no human being can be killed in a brutal manner.”

Democrats respond to reported Venezuela strike

Senator Mark Kelly: “We’re going to have a public hearing. We’re going to put these folks under oath. And we’re going to find out what happened. And then, there needs to be accountability.”

He also told CNN: “If what has been reported is accurate, I have got serious concerns about anybody in that chain of command stepping over a line that they should never step over.”

Senator Chris Van Hollen: “I think it’s very possible there was a war crime committed.”

And a quick reminder of the background to US strikes in these waters:

Since September, the US has expanded its naval presence in the region, carrying out strikes on what it says are drug-smuggling boats in waters off Venezuela and Colombia.

More than 80 people have been killed according to the US Defence Department.

The US has said it is destroying boats bringing in harmful drugs, and thus its attacks are launched out of self-defence – a legal justification for military attacks under international laws of armed conflict.

But it has provided scant evidence of the alleged criminality of the boats, and has also declined to provide identification details of the people it has killed on board the boats.

Venezuela’s National Assembly has accused the US of committing “murder” with the strikes.

The UN’s human rights chief Volker Turk has said there’s “strong evidence” such strikes constitute extrajudicial killings. He’s been calling for Congress investigate.

The reports then from the weekend add another layer of suspected illegality. The Washington Post reports that the US navy on 2 September struck a drug-running vessel, killing some of the 11 on board in the first strike. After commanders saw on the live drone feed that there were still two survivors clinging to the wreck, they executed an order to strike again, to kill all those on board.

Follow-up strikes are forbidden under the rules of war and engagement, i.e. what is legal fighting between parties in a conflict.

Clauses in the the Geneva Conventions also forbid the targeting of wounded participants, saying that those participants should instead be shielded, rescued and if applicable, treated as prisoners of war with relevant rights.

Republican-led committees launching investigations

There’s been a swift response from lawmakers following the reports. Republican-led committees overseeing the Pentagon have vowed to conduct “vigorous oversight” into the boat strikes.

Senate Armed Services Committee:“Has directed inquiries to the Department, and we will be conducting vigorous oversight to determine the facts related to these circumstances”.

House Armed Services Committee: “Is taking bipartisan action to gather a full accounting of the operation in question”.

And lawmakers on both sides, speaking on talk shows on Sunday, called for congressional review.

“This rises to the level of a war crime if it’s true,” said Democrat Senator Tim Kaine on CBS’s Face the Nation programme.

Republican lawmaker Mike Turner said Congress did not know yet if the report of the follow-up strike was true.

“Obviously if that occurred, that would be very serious, and I agree that that would be an illegal act,” said Turner, a former chairman of the Intelligence Committee.

Trump 'wouldn't have wanted' second strike on Caribbean boat

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One yesterday, the president defended Hegseth, saying he believed his statement “100%” that he hadn’t ordered the second strike.

“I’m going to find out about it, but Pete said he did not order the death of those two men.”

When asked if he would have wanted a second attempt to kill the survivors, the president said:

We’ll look into it, but no, I wouldn’t have wanted that – not a second strike. The first strike was very lethal.”

The Washington Post reported that Hegseth “gave a spoken directive” to “kill everybody” on board in September. When there were still two men left after the first strike, a Special Operations commander ordered the follow-up to comply with Hegseth’s direction, the newspaper reported.

Hegseth has strongly denied the report, calling it “fabricated, inflammatory, and derogatory”.

He also said the US’s strikes on boats so far in the Caribbean had been “lawful under both US and international law”.

What Padilla v. Kentucky eventually mandated was already taking shape inside LA County’s public defender’s office.","A few weeks ago, Giselle said, her friend had been driving an intoxicated friend home late at night.

“That person left an open can in her back seat, and she didn’t realize it,” she said. “Police pulled her over for no reason and called it a DUI without even doing the tests.”

Charges were dropped and her friend was released from jail, Giselle said, but she didn’t get to go home.

“ICE was waiting,” said Giselle, who asked that her last name not be used for fear of reprisal from federal authorities. “Now she’s in Mexico, and her husband and kids are all here.”

For immigrants who get caught up in the criminal justice system, the conclusion of their case doesn’t necessarily mean their ordeal is over. Instead, in LA County, as with many other places in the country, some have been subject to continued detention and a trip to immigration court, where the Public Defender office can no longer help them with their case.

That last part, however, is about to change.

For the first time in its 111-year history, the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office will be able to represent people in immigration court. A new unit will screen individuals for immigration representation, offer guidance and referrals and, for those who qualify, provide direct legal defense in immigration proceedings through in-house immigration attorneys.

Between 2010 and 2014, more than 18,500 people — many of whom had already completed their sentences — were held past their release dates because they had immigration detainers. These detainers are requests from ICE asking local jails to keep someone in custody longer than the law allows so federal agents can take them into immigration custody.

In 2012, that system was challenged in a lawsuit known as Roy v. County of Los Angeles, arguing that the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department (LASD), which oversees the county jails, violated both state law and the Fourth Amendment by detaining people solely on the basis of an ICE request, without a warrant or probable cause of a crime.

The county eventually settled the case. As part of the agreement, LASD officials were forced to rewrite their policies so that immigration detainers could no longer justify extended detentions. The county also agreed to pay $14 million to those who had been unlawfully held.

Roy v. County of Los Angeles ultimately defined three groups of people harmed by the policy: immigrants who were held past their lawful release dates solely because of an ICE detainer, those who would have been released on bail but were kept in custody because of an immigration hold and immigrants who were denied bail altogether.

But many of the victims entitled to compensation could not be found. The unclaimed funds, called cy pres funds, cannot be returned to the agency responsible for the harm; instead, they must support work that benefits similarly affected communities.

Now, according to Los Angeles County Assistant Public Defender Graciela Martinez, those funds are financing the new removal defense unit within the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office — one that operates outside the office’s traditional criminal practice. The unit will take on federal deportation cases, a space public defenders normally do not enter under current law. The distinction matters: the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to counsel only in criminal proceedings, leaving immigrants in civil immigration court without a government-appointed attorney.

While representation is a significant part of the new effort, according to Martinez, the unit’s responsibilities extend beyond it. Community members will be screened to determine whether they qualify for full legal defense, and even those who do not will receive guidance, referrals, and information about their options. The office is also still navigating whether any portion of the cy pres funds can be used to pay immigration bonds for people detained in ICE facilities.

“The public defender’s office is a crucial backstop. If there were more funding, more fellows could be out there doing this work,” said Ingrid Eagly, co-director of UCLA Law School’s Criminal Law and Policy Consortium.

LA Public Press requested an interview with the inaugural fellow, Niki Nguyễn, through both UCLA Law and the Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office. UCLA Law directed questions to the Public Defender’s Office, which confirmed that Nguyễn would not be available for an interview before publication.

For Martinez — a 31-year veteran attorney who helped drive the Roy litigation — the unit marks a kind of institutional reckoning. “The leftover cy pres funds allow us to serve people like them — people who were impacted but cannot be identified,” she said. “This is about looking at people as individuals — not as criminals, not as monsters.”

The path to this moment began well before the landmark 2010 Supreme Court ruling in Padilla v. Kentucky, which required defense attorneys nationwide to warn clients when a criminal case could affect their immigration status. “We didn’t even call ourselves ‘crimmigration’ people back then, but now we do,” said Martinez, who is also the first Latina and first foreign-born individual to lead the California Public Defender’s Association (CPDA).

The term crimmigration refers to the increasingly inseparable intersection of criminal law and immigration law. In this space, a single arrest, charge, or conviction can trigger life-altering immigration consequences far beyond the criminal courtroom.

What Padilla v. Kentucky eventually mandated was already taking shape inside LA County’s public defender’s office. Martinez said she had already been warning clients that a plea could trigger deportation or other immigration consequences since 2002, eight years before Padilla. She said she was mentored by Katherine Brady, an attorney widely regarded as a pioneer of “crimmigration.” Together, they helped create some of the earliest training materials still used by public defenders nationwide.

Despite that groundwork, enforcement often advanced more rapidly than safeguards. At one point, Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the nation, was holding more immigrants on ICE detainers than any other county in the nation — more than most states, according to the ACLU. Whether that volume reflects the county’s sheer size remains unclear. Martinez recalls that during the years covered by Roy v. County of Los Angeles (2010-2014), she repeatedly called jail staff to insist that clients be released, reminding them there was no legal basis to keep anyone in custody. “And still,” she said, “they would hold people until ICE arrived.”

An uneven landscape

As the new removal-defense team takes shape, its arrival also exposes the uneven terrain of public defense across California. The state’s 58 counties operate independently, with varying levels of funding, political will and willingness to address immigration consequences. “There are counties that are very anti-immigrant, and they’re not going to fight for this,” said Christopher Punongbayan, the executive director of California ChangeLawyers, a statewide foundation that funds early-career lawyers and advocates, with a focus on expanding access to justice for marginalized communities. “We look at where the need is.”

In Ventura County, more than 100,000 people commute to and from Los Angeles each day, moving between jurisdictions with vastly different levels of immigrant legal protection — differences that became especially visible this summer. In August, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors declined to expand its immigrant legal defense program, leaving a gap that city leaders in Oxnard chose to fill themselves. In response, the Oxnard City Council approved up to $600,000 in matching funds over three years to support an additional Ventura County public defender — a commitment that will take effect only if the county agrees to participate.

Ken Rozell, the city’s chief assistant attorney, said the proposal is intended to bolster support for the immigrant community, though the specifics are still being worked out. “We don’t dictate how the Public Defender’s Office would use that position,” Rozell said. “But it’s really to provide funding so they can assist in the way that the public defender can assist with those immigration issues.” LA Public Press has reached out to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors for comment and to ask about a timeline for a decision but had not received a response by publication.

“This is about due process,” Oxnard City Manager Alexander Nguyen said in a recorded livestream. For local organizers and families, the decision underscored their argument that cities can act even when counties refuse.

That local momentum reflects a broader shift across California. At the state level, data from the California Immigrant Policy Center shows that it was largely during the first Trump administration—amid an escalation in federal immigration enforcement—that California significantly strengthened its immigrant legal-defense infrastructure. That effort deepened with the 2019 Budget Act, which created the state’s first immigration legal fellowship to expand the pipeline of removal-defense attorneys in regions that need them most.

Even with new state funding, the gap between enforcement and representation remains stark. Los Angeles County’s removal-defense unit is a meaningful step, but it enters a system where demand far exceeds capacity. According to the Vera Institute, of the more than 450,000 people ordered removed in immigration court over the past 12 months, roughly 75 percent had no legal representation.

The reality behind those numbers is visible in daily life. Immigration arrests continue in homes, parking lots and near schools, fueling constant demand for legal help and straining volunteer-run hotlines. And across California — including its most progressive regions — many immigrants still appear in court without a lawyer. The State Bar of California reports that even with recent investments, including an additional $25 million in the 2025 budget, available resources fall well short of rising need.

For Giselle, those systemic failures were etched into her daily life.

“Our biggest crime is being brown,” Giselle said. Beside her, her friend Jessica nodded in agreement. For both women, their immigration status compounds the risks they already face.

Jessica said the strain of daily life had become its own barometer of inequity. Because she and her family are all vulnerable to immigration enforcement, she often feels pressure to shoulder more — a calculation shaped, she said, by her lighter skin and the belief that she is less likely to be singled out in a system where racial profiling by ICE has been repeatedly reported. “I’m working two jobs right now because I have to provide for my family,” she said. “I’m light-skinned, and even though I don’t look Mexican, I am.”

The removal-defense unit is unlikely to mend every fracture in the system. But it signals a turning point: for the first time Los Angeles County has embedded immigration attorneys within its own public defender’s office to defend clients in immigration court, reshaping a system that once funneled people directly from local jails into deportation proceedings.

“This is a critical moment — immigrants are being arrested every day by federal agents who show up in masks, without warrants, and engaging in profiling based on race,” said Eagly.","https://cdn.lapublicpress.org/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC03525-2.jpg",N,,2025-12-01 11:58:48.305282

Shooting of US National Guard

The move comes at a time of heightened tension in the US following a deadly shooting of two National Guard members, one of whom has succumbed to their injuries and died. In response, US President Donald Trump vowed to freeze migration from what he referred to as ""third-world countries"".

In a post on X, US Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Joseph Edlow confirmed the suspension.

Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national who is the main suspect in the shooting, was wounded during the encounter with security forces. Lakanwal was reported to have worked with the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for over a decade while living in Afghanistan.

After the Taliban takeover in 2021 and the withdrawal of US troops, Lakanwal came to the US with his family. According to media reports, Lakanwal had a hard time integrating into the US societal fabric and may have been dealing with PTSD.

Rejection of outside interference

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz publicly rejected what he described as US pressure on European migration policy, saying, ""Migration policy is our business, and we decide it as we see fit… We don't need any admonitions from outside.""

Germany, under a federal admissions program, offers Afghan nationals who had served in German offices or missions before the takeover of the Taliban settlement in Germany, along with their families. After suspension and much debate, the government resumed admissions for some Afghans with legally binding entry approvals.

The Chancellor added that Germany, together with the other EU countries, is in the process of forging a common European asylum and immigration policy, and insisted that these decisions should be made internally, without outside interference.

Merz’s response points to a broader concern among some EU leaders that foreign pressure, especially from the US, could complicate efforts to manage migration in a way that balances security, legal obligations, and humanitarian commitments.

Migrants implicated in crime

The public perception of migrants involved in crime, especially violent and sexual crimes, remains controversial and often misleading.

High-profile cases, such as a case that involved an asylum seeker in the UK embroiled in sexual assault, sparked riots in different parts of the country while fueling debate over whether migrants have a greater propensity to commit sexual or violent crimes.

Media coverage also tends to overrepresent crimes committed by foreigners relative to their actual share of offenders in police data.

Research shows that although foreigners may appear disproportionately in some crime statistics, once factors such as urban concentration, younger age profile, and socioeconomic conditions are accounted for, there is no clear causal relationship between migrants’ presence and higher crime rates.

Official statistics from the general population show rising sexual-offence figures overall, but not a conclusively disproportionate share can be attributed directly to migrant groups.",https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_small/6b2f41b0ae60dfe4a1ec2e5b652103554174708e.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 11:58:18.577037

She is sore. She is tired. And she is alone.

Oscarina and her husband escaped violence in Venezuela and moved 2,000 miles north to Missouri in 2023, seeking more stable housing and a better future for their daughter. Neither have permanent legal status in the United States, and when she learned she had a second child on the way, Oscarina wondered how they could afford to raise another baby.

Eight weeks into the pregnancy, her husband was detained while delivering a DoorDash order. He was deported back to Venezuela a short time later.

“All my pregnancy, I cried every single day,” Oscarina, who lives in Kansas City and asked not to use her name out of fear of deportation, told The Independent through an interpreter.

When she went into labor prematurely earlier this month, her husband cried as he called in over video from Venezuela.

When their daughter was born, he helped with night feedings. This time, there is no help. And what little money her family had saved up quickly disappeared during the deportation process.

Now she lives in constant fear about what would happen if she gets detained.

There are days her oldest child doesn’t attend school because Oscarina worries she could be taken while walking her to the bus stop.

She wonders what the point of the “American Dream” is. Her family suffered under Venezuela’s dictatorship, and in America she suffers, too.

“I would like to go back to my country,” Oscarina said. “But my husband is saying that things are very bad there right now, and I don’t think it’s a good idea to bring both of the kids right now.”

So they will remain separated.

“I live in fear every day,” Oscarina said. “ … It’s too heavy to carry being by myself with my daughter and my little boy and not having my husband because he will always care for us. The fact that he doesn’t get to be with us, everything changed for us.”

Oscarina’s story is one of many shared with The Independent over the past month as women who are undocumented in Missouri navigate pregnancy, birth and postpartum without legal paperwork.

Several community health care workers, doulas and nonprofits that work with immigrants and expectant mothers shared the struggles the families face. Few were willing to speak on the record, fearful that federal agents could target their offices or the federal government could restrict funding if they spoke out about their work with undocumented immigrants.

The organizations located across Missouri shared stories of pregnant and postpartum women who’ve shuttered themselves in their homes. Many are facing labor or postpartum in isolation, their husbands deported and the fear of the same fate keeping them housebound, at times too afraid to seek medical care.

Since President Donald Trump returned to office in January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been increasingly visible on America’s streets, including in Missouri, sparking protests across the state and nation. Arrests have made headlines as videos circulate of ICE agents detaining parents at school drop-offs and arresting teachers, including inside a preschool.

In rare cases, ICE has reportedly posted up outside maternity wards.

Under previous administrations, schools, hospitals and churches were considered sanctuary spaces where ICE was not allowed under almost any circumstances. That changed this year, raising new fears for families with young children like Oscarina.

“This is the worst that I’ve seen in many, many years,” said Eunice Cho, senior counsel at the ACLU National Prison Project.

Under former President Joe Biden’s administration, pregnant women were protected from ICE detention. While that policy remains in place, the ACLU earlier this year uncovered several examples of women who were either pregnant or miscarried while in federal detention centers.

“The trauma it has on children and parents and families is heartbreaking,” Cho said. “And it’s completely unnecessary. These are families that have been living and working and contributing to our communities, often for years or decades.”

ICE threats send mothers, children into hiding in Missouri

Neysha Reyes Cruz is one of a handful of bilingual doulas in Missouri.

Through her company, Olas de Amor Doula Services, she has advocated for almost 90 women through pregnancy, birth and postpartum over the past three years. Of those 90, about 70 were undocumented, she said. This year, she estimates she’s stood in as the support person for about half a dozen women who gave birth after a close family member was deported.

Reyes Cruz, who is from Puerto Rico and moved to Missouri in 2016, often serves as an interpreter as well as a doula for her clients, the majority of whom give birth in hospitals. But in recent months, as the threat of ICE raids permeates her Kansas City community, she said her job has increasingly expanded into helping families with more than birth.

The messages she gets from moms are often desperate. One recently asked Reyes Cruz if she could get her formula from the store after the mother said she saw ICE agents out on her street that day.

Many of her clients skip non-crucial doctor’s appointments. Others miss WIC appointments or have been cut off from food stamps. She has a donation closet to help with clothing and baby supplies.

Instead of going to the pediatrician, many new moms instead call Reyes Cruz to ask if their baby is sick enough to warrant risking leaving the house. The child birth class she used to host in-person is now virtual because too many families feared driving to her.

“I have had moms that have withdrawn their kids from school and have just left the country so those kids never ended their school year. Mamas that were in situations where their partners became so depressed and anxious they started becoming abusive, and from there, having to find refuge for them,” she said. “This is the hardest thing, finding a refuge for a mama that is single, is pregnant or with maybe older kids, does not speak English and doesn’t have a prior family here.”

She encourages her clients to designate someone who is a citizen to get custody of their baby if they’re deported. One mom requested that Reyes Cruz be that person for her baby girl.

“As a doula, I’m being pushed to support this community because they don’t feel safe with anyone else,” she said.

She fears the elevated stress thrust on these families is affecting their babies. Of the past 10 births she’s attended, five were babies born prematurely.

Missouri still among worst states for infant, maternal health as new Medicaid cuts loom

Reyes Cruz’s experiences aren’t unique.

A health care provider in the Ozarks who was too afraid to speak on the record said she has Hispanic patients who fear coming into the clinic amid increasingly visible ICE raids around the country.

Other nonprofit workers shared the difficulties of helping parents obtain birth certificates for their newborn children so they could self-deport back to their home country. Legal aid groups help parents establish custody plans in case they are detained and their children are left alone.

Community health workers in urban centers of the state said they are doing more home health visits for pregnant and postpartum women who fear leaving the house, or who are waiting until later in pregnancy to see their doctors. Others help arrange Uber rides to get the women to their appointments.

“I’m heartbroken for any woman who feels fearful to leave her home, especially to try to receive prenatal care,” said Laura Brandt, director of Pregnancy Help Center of South County in St. Louis.

She said her nonprofit serves anyone who walks through the door and doesn’t question their status.

“This is such a polarizing topic and people have a lot of really strong opinions going either way on the matter,” Brandt said. “Regardless of what your opinions are on a policy level, on a personal level, every human being is deserving of dignity and compassion and care.”

Some families turn to self-deportation

In just a couple days, Monica is self-deporting. She purchased a one-way flight from Kansas City back to Chile, where she is from. Her 6-month-old son will be on her lap.

Monica, who asked not to use her name because she is undocumented, moved to the United States on Mother’s Day last year, seeking better education opportunities for her son, who is 8.

She learned she was pregnant a couple months later. She was sad to be experiencing a new life without her friends and family by her side.

When she was less than two weeks postpartum, Monica said her husband became violent during an argument. She called her therapist, who reported the abuse to the police. He was arrested and deported back to his home country of Venezuela.

Now alone, Monica can no longer afford to care for her two children on her own. She delivers for DoorDash, and on each trip she fears being caught by immigration agents. Her fear is amplified now that she has a second child. What happens to them if she’s detained?

“Life got more difficult for me,” she said through an interpreter as her son babbled from his perch on her hip.

Tim Rudolph, a St. Louis-based immigration attorney for Hacking Immigration Law, said it’s not uncommon for people to self-deport in today’s political climate.

He encouraged anyone considering self-deportation to talk with a lawyer first, noting that if someone has a child who is a U.S. citizen, they may have some legal paths to staying in the country if they want to stay.

“Even though the government is saying ‘if you leave you can come back the right way, we’ll let you do it,’ that’s not often the case,” Rudolph said. “That tends to be what they say to get people out of the country, and a lot of times you’ll be barred from returning.”

While Monica doesn’t yet know if she’ll ever try returning to the U.S., her current vision of her children’s future has been shattered. While she still believes the move to America was worthwhile to attempt to give her children a more promising future, she feels some relief to return home to her parents and to leave the constant fear of deportation behind.

“People need to be strong emotionally to come over to the United States,” Monica said. “Because even though the United States is a very great country full of opportunities, it can be very emotionally draining to be here with this situation.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2193563646-2048x1368.jpg,N,,2025-12-01 10:59:03.689184

A rapidly shifting landscape of humanitarian protections presents ongoing compliance challenges for employers. As the latest example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nationals of Haiti, Burma (Myanmar), and South Sudan while a federal court has temporarily blocked the termination of TPS for Syria.

TPS Terminations: Haiti, Burma (Myanmar), South Sudan

Haiti

Back in July, we covered litigation developments from a US District Court decision that extended TPS for Haiti until February 2026.

On November 26, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for Haiti. At the time of writing, the official Federal Register has not been published yet, but the termination is set to take effect on February 3, 2026. The termination will affect around 330,000 nationals from Haiti.

Burma (Myanmar)

On November 25, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for Burma. The termination will take effect on January 26, 2026, and will affect nearly 4,000 nationals from Burma who were granted TPS after the military coup in 2021.

South Sudan

On November 5, 2025, DHS published a notice ending TPS for South Sudan. The termination will take effect on January 5, 2026.

Possible Termination of Somalia

On November 21, 2025, President Trump announced that he intends to end TPS for Somalia. At the time of writing, no official notice from DHS has been released. We will continue to monitor for official updates from DHS.

Please reference the table below to track the upcoming work authorization expiration dates for each TPS-designated country:

Country Date Work Authorization Expires South Sudan January 5, 2026 Burma (Myanmar) January 26, 2026 Haiti February 3, 2026

Litigation Halts Termination: Syria

Back in October, we covered the announcement of the termination of TPS for nationals from Syria. The Federal Register notice scheduled the termination to take effect on November 21, 2025, citing national security concerns as the basis for the decision. The decision would have affected nearly 4,000 Syrian nationals. However, on November 19, 2025, a judge in the Southern District of New York issued an order staying the termination of Syria TPS. We will update as the litigation develops.

Employer Considerations

Employers should be aware that affected TPS holders will lose both protected status and their work authorization unless they have transitioned to another lawful immigration status. This could result in the loss of employees who rely on TPS-based work authorization.

Employer Next Steps

Continued Form I-9 Compliance: Employees with TPS may have Employment Authorization Documents (EADs) that expire when their TPS ends. Employers should review and track card expiration dates for the TPS (A12 or C19) designations, follow reverification procedures, and closely monitor updates from DHS.

ICE I-9 Inspections: Employers may face increased scrutiny from Immigration and Customs Enforcement during I-9 inspections if their records are not updated timely, or if individuals without valid work authorization maintain employment.

Ongoing Communication: Employers should be prepared to address questions from affected employees and provide resources for legal counsel.

Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“On the Docket”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“The One First ‘Long Read’”); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, I hope you’ll consider becoming one—and upgrading to a paid subscription if your circumstances permit:

I wanted to use today’s “Long Read” to write about an issue that, at least in my universe, hasn’t gotten a lot of public attention—but that may well be one of the more quietly important legal stories of the year: The role federal district courts are playing in pushing back against a massively significant change to immigration detention policy that the Trump administration quietly attempted to implement back in July.

In a nutshell, the executive branch has radically expanded its interpretation of which non-citizens can be arrested and detained without bond pending their removal proceedings—a move that has exposed hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of individuals already living inside the United States to immigration arrest and detention to which they would not realistically have been subject prior to this summer, and with no right to seek release once they’ve been arrested. Many of those arrests have taken place at ICE facilities or courthouses when these same individuals have appeared for regular check-ins or for the next steps in their asylum applications. But regardless of where these arrests are taking place, it’s safe to say that this quiet attempt to expand what’s often shorthanded, however inaccurately, as “mandatory detention” is directly connected to many of the arrests we’re seeing during ICE raids in U.S. cities.

The Trump administration’s new interpretation of a 29-year-old statute, in turn, has been rejected by a truly staggering array of federal district courts across the country. According to Politico’s Kyle Cheney, since July,

At least 225 judges have ruled in more than 700 cases that the administration’s new policy, which also deprives people of an opportunity to seek release from an immigration court, is a likely violation of law and the right to due process. Those judges were appointed by all modern presidents—including 23 by Trump himself—and hail from at least 35 states . . . . In contrast, only eight judges nationwide, including six appointed by Trump, have sided with the administration’s new mass detention policy.

What is striking about this pattern is not just its volume or the scorecard; it’s that the judges in many of these cases are writing thorough, persuasive opinions explaining why the Trump administration is utterly wrong on the law—including an especially strident ruling from Judge Lewis Kaplan in the Southern District of New York just last Wednesday. Kaplan appended to his 33-page decision a list of more than 350 of additional rulings by his district court colleagues. And although the litigation has proceeded at a retail, case-by-case level to date (hence the high number of cases), last Tuesday, Judge Sunshine Sykes in the Central District of California certified a nationwide class action at least for purposes of declaratory relief against the policy—which may accelerate how quickly this issue moves to the courts of appeals and, inevitably it seems, to the Supreme Court.

I’ve written before about the role federal district courts have played in issuing coercive relief against Trump administration policies over the past 10 months. These cases have not been part of the dataset my research assistants and I have maintained because they have been, to date, individual requests for release from detention rather than lawsuits seeking coercive relief against the policies themselves. But excepting changes to federal criminal sentencing laws, I can’t recall any other example of a federal policy that provoked quite so much litigation in such a short period of time—or litigation in which so many judges from across the geographical and ideological spectrum so overwhelmingly rejected the executive branch’s new interpretation of the relevant statutes. It’s a striking story not just about the Trump administration’s zealotry when it comes to immigration policy, but about the critical role hundreds of federal judges have played in steadfastly holding the executive branch to the law.

But first, the (SCOTUS-related) news.

On the Docket

The Merits Docket

Last week’s regular Order List brought with it the Court’s first two opinions of the term—both of which were “summary reversals” in which the justices reversed a court of appeals at the certiorari stage in an unsigned (“per curiam”) opinion, without hearing oral argument or otherwise conducting plenary review:

In Pitts v. Mississippi, the Court reversed the Supreme Court of Mississippi—which had rejected a Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause challenge to a Mississippi statute mandating the physical screening of all child abuse victims from criminal defendants during their testimony. As the Court reaffirmed in a five-page opinion, the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause requires trial courts in those circumstances to make case-specific determinations of whether such screening truly is necessary, regardless of any categorical state law rule to the contrary. There were no public dissents.

And in Clark v. Sweeney, the Court reversed the Fourth Circuit—holding that it had wrongly granted post-conviction habeas relief to a Maryland prisoner based upon an argument that the prisoner had failed to fully and fairly present himself (in a case in which one of the jurors had visited the crime scene without authorization and had subsequently been dismissed). The only issue the prisoner had preserved, the Court held in a four-page opinion, was whether his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by agreeing to allow the case to proceed to a verdict once the juror was dismissed.

When Will Baude coined the term “shadow docket” in 2015, he was specifically responding to a significant uptick at that moment in these kinds of certiorari-stage “summary” rulings. They had rather petered out over the ensuing decade, so it will be interesting to see if the two rulings last Monday end up as outliers, or as a sign that more of these rulings are incoming. Time will tell.

The only other especially noteworthy developments in last Monday’s Order List were the separate opinions respecting the denial of certiorari in Beck v. United States. The issue in Beck is the so-called “Feres doctrine,” an (entirely atextual) interpretation of the Federal Tort Claims Act adopted by the Supreme Court in 1950 that bars any and all lawsuits by military servicemembers against the federal government for torts “arising out of, or incident to” their military service. Justice Thomas has long been (quite rightly, in my view) a staunch critic of Feres, and has been calling, for years, for the justices to revisit that precedent. Alas, he seems to once again have come up short. Although Justice Gorsuch also noted that he would have voted to take up this case, Justice Sotomayor penned a separate “statement” suggesting that it should be up to Congress to fix the mess the Court created—“out of respect for the Court’s rules of stare decisis, and in recognition of the reliance interests that Feres has generated.” Of course, it’s hard to imagine any Congress, let alone the current one, making it easier for servicemembers to sue the federal government. That’s why Feres, handed down just four years after the FTCA was enacted, was so problematic in the first place.

The Emergency Docket

It was a surprisingly quiet week with respect to emergency applications. The only action of note from the full Court came Wednesday—when the Court issued an order … declining to act … on the Trump administration’s request to freeze a lower court ruling that had blocked the attempted removal of Shira Perlmutter as the Register of Copyrights. The Court’s order, from which only Justice Thomas publicly dissented, noted that the application is being deferred pending the Court’s consideration of Trump v. Slaughter (set to be argued next Monday) and Trump v. Cook (set to be argued in January). Frankly, I don’t get it. The underlying question in Perlmutter is a very specific, statutory question (is the Library of Congress an “executive agency” for purposes of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act) the answer to which won’t be implicated at all in those two other cases. And although the second question the justices asked the parties to address in Slaughter (what’s the remedy for federal officers who are unlawfully removed) could obviously affect other cases, Perlmutter is still … in her job, and doesn’t need to be reinstated by a court. This last point, of course, means that the ruling is effectively a loss for the Trump administration. But it’s not clear to me why there wouldn’t (and shouldn’t) have been five votes to just say that now.

The Week Ahead

This morning kicks off a busy week at the Court—with the beginning of the December argument session starting at 10. We also continue to wait for the Court to rule on the two especially high-profile emergency applications that remain pending—Texas’s application in the Texas redistricting case; and the Trump administration’s application in the Illinois National Guard case.

As has so often been true with the Supreme Court this year, there’s a lot going on.

The One First “Long Read”:

Mandatory Detention and the Lyons Memo

To understand the flood of immigration detention cases currently inundating the federal courts, it may be helpful to start with a brief background on immigration detention. I’ll also refer folks who’d like even more detail to this helpful 2019 Congressional Research Service report.

Background

In particular, three points seem especially foundational here.

First, the general immigration detention statute, section 236(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)), provides rules for the arrest and detention of any non-citizen “pending a decision on whether [they are] to be removed from the United States.” But detention under section 236(a) comes, among other things, with a right to a bond hearing (based upon a showing that the individual poses no danger to others; security threat; or flight risk) and eligibility for parole—denials of both of which are subject to judicial review. What’s more, detention under section 236(a) has always been understood to be discretionary—meaning there is no requirement that individuals subject to detention under that provision actually be detained.

Thus, as Judge Kaplan put it last week, “Section 236, since a 1996 amendment, has given immigration authorities essentially two options at the outset of removal proceedings. One option is to keep the noncitizen in custody throughout the proceedings. The other option is to release the noncitizen on bond or parole.” For a host of reasons, the norm, historically, has been to choose the latter—especially for those individuals who have committed no crimes, and who are subject to removal only because they are present in the United States without legal authorization. Those individuals will usually be entitled to release on bond—which, for obvious reasons, has led the executive branch to not prioritize arresting and detaining them in the first place.

Second, and in contrast, there are a handful of more specific “mandatory” detention statutes, which, at least in theory, require the detention of individuals who meet the more specific statutory criteria. The one that is especially relevant here is section 235(b), codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b). That provision actually includes two separate authorities. Section 235(b)(1) is for non-citizens stopped at (or near) the border who are “inadmissible”—and who are subject to “expedited” removal “without further hearing or review unless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum . . . or a fear of persecution.” (The grounds on which someone can be “inadmissible” are a lot more specific than the grounds on which they can be removable.)

Section 235(b)(2), in contrast, mandates detention for the duration of “regular” removal proceedings “in the case of an alien who is an applicant for admission, if the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted.” Historically, both parts of section 235(b) have been understood to refer, as the section heading reflects, to “applicants for admission” to the United States, i.e., those stopped either (1) at the border; or (2) within some temporal and geographic proximity to having entered the country without inspection. Those who are inadmissible [section 235(b)(1)] can be placed in expedited removal; those who are not [section 235(b)(2)] must go through ordinary removal proceedings during which they can be detained without bond.

Indeed, when section 235(b)(2) applies, not only is there no statutory right to a bond hearing, but the only mechanism for internal review by ICE (a narrow form of humanitarian parole) is not subject to judicial review, either. Thus, there are massively significant differences between detention under section 235(b)(2) and detention under section 236(a)—including not just the likelihood of detention but also the ability of someone detained under these provisions to challenge the factual or legal basis for that detention, or even to seek release on bond while those proceedings continue.

Third, during both the first and second Trump administrations, the executive branch has separately tried to expand the category of individuals subject to expedited removal (and mandatory detention under section 235(b)(1)) based upon when they entered into the United States without inspection. In other words, it’s tried to move the line for who counts as an “arriving alien” to include at least some individuals who have been in the United States for some time. For context, in 2004, the Bush administration had (controversially) interpreted that category to include those stopped at the border or those apprehended (1) within 100 miles of the border and (2) within 14 days of entering the country without inspection. That was a big enough move, but that was the understood (and judicially sustained) limit on who could be subjected to “expedited removal” for decades.

The Trump administration has since sought to expand that category dramatically—to include anyone found anywhere in the United States who cannot prove their continuous presence in the United States for more than two years (the statutory maximum Congress authorized in 1996). But that attempted policy shift was blocked by a D.C. federal district judge on August 29—primarily on the ground that it likely violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment by depriving those with significant connections to the United States of a meaningful opportunity to challenge the basis for their expedited removal. Just last Monday, the D.C. Circuit, by a 2-1 vote, denied in relevant part the federal government’s application for a stay of that ruling pending appeal.

***

There’s a lot of complicated immigration law here, and I’m already giving short shrift to some of the nuances. (The American Immigration Council has published a fantastic practice advisory that goes into much more detail for those who are so inclined.) The key for present purposes is that, prior to the July 8 detention policy shift, even the Trump administration’s view had been that, once an individual had been continuously present in the United States for at least two years, they were no longer subject to expedited removal as if they were an “arriving alien” under section 235(b)(1)—and the “ordinary” immigration process [section 236(a)] would otherwise apply barring special circumstances. Those individuals could still be subject to mandatory detention if they fell into one of the specific categories of such detention (e.g., certain individuals convicted of crimes or for the 90 days preceding the effectuation of a removal order). But absent those special circumstances, individuals who had been continuously present in the United States for at least two years (under the Trump administration’s contested view) or even just two weeks (under the Bush administration’s view) were subject to arrest and detention only under the more generous, bond-eligible, discretionary authority of section 236(a).

I’m not aware of any specific data on what percentage of the total population of non-citizens living today in the United States without inspection has been continuously present in the United States for at least two years. But a 2024 DHS report found that 79% of undocumented immigrants had been present in the United States since before 2010. It stands to reason that the percentage of that population who have been in the United States since at least November 2023 is … much higher. In other words, there are a lot more undocumented immigrants who have been continuously present in the United States for more than two years than who have not been.

The July 8 Memo and Subsequent Developments

On July 8, Todd Lyons, then the Acting Director of ICE, issued a memorandum titled “Interim Guidance Regarding Detention Authority for Applicants for Admission.” In it, Lyons wrote that “It is the position of DHS that [any non-citizens who entered the United States without being admitted] are subject to detention under INA § 235(b) and may not be released from ICE custody except by INA § 212(d)(5) parole.” To make the point clear, the memo continued, “For custody purposes, these aliens are now treated in the same manner that ‘arriving aliens’ have historically been treated.” The only non-citizens who would still be covered by the “ordinary” detention provision would be those who had been lawfully admitted to the United States upon entry or received some lawful status thereafter, only to have committed some immigration or criminal offense that subjects them to removal.

Just to underscore the point, the Lyons memo effectively subjected to immediate arrest and to mandatory detention pending removal every single non-citizen physically present in the United States who had never been lawfully admitted, no matter how long they have been here or how carefully they’ve followed the law since their arrival. And although initial headlines (e.g., in the Washington Post) highlighted that the memo revoked those individuals’ right to a bond hearing, no less important is the extent to which it subjected them to arrest and detention in the first place—arrest and detention that would not have been a realistic possibility, even if it was formally available, under section 236(a). A non-citizen, for instance, who came to the United States with their parents when they were a child, and who has lived in the country for decades without committing any crimes, is now subject to mandatory detention with no possibility of bond under the July 8 memo; before that, even if the law might have allowed for their arrest and detention, they would almost certainly have been released on bond for the duration of their removal proceedings—assuming the government wanted to remove them in the first place.

Almost overnight, as ICE started implementing the July 8 policy, individuals who, all of a sudden, were subject to arrest and detention under the new interpretation of these 29-year-old statutes brought habeas petitions challenging their detention in the federal district court in which they were held. This led to a remarkable flurry of rulings by federal district judges across the country—as reflected in a public database maintained by the American Immigration Council in conjunction with the University of Iowa immigration law clinic. And the judges in the overwhelming majority of those rulings have concluded that the July 8 policy is unlawful—because section 235(b), by its terms, does not apply to individuals who are not “seeking admission into the country” (because they have already been here for some time). As one district court succinctly put it in August, “someone who enters a movie theater without purchasing a ticket and then proceeds to sit through the first few minutes of a film would not ordinarily then be described as ‘seeking admission’ to the theater.”

Although I could link to any of dozens of these rulings, two especially illustrative examples are last Wednesday’s decision by Judge Kaplan in Manhattan; and a ruling from the previous week by Judge Lynn Winmill in Idaho. As Judge Kaplan concluded, “Requiring the detention of noncitizens like [the petitioner in that case] would be inconsistent with how immigration law in this country long has worked, not to mention the rule of law and basic notions of due process.” And in Judge Winmill’s words,

Since the United States began restricting immigration into this country in the late 19th century, it has distinguished between those noncitizens seeking entry into the country and those already residing within it. Noncitizens “stopped at the boundary line” who have “gained no foothold in the United States,” do not enjoy the same constitutional protections afforded to persons inside the United States. But once a noncitizen enters the United States, “the legal circumstance changes,” for the constitutional right to due process applies to all “persons” within our nation’s borders, “whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” This distinction between noncitizens who have entered and reside in the United States and those who have not yet entered “runs throughout immigration law.”

It’s not just that this distinction “runs throughout immigration law”; it’s that it also reflects the more humane reality that, however they entered the United States, those who have lived in the country for years (if not decades), and who have pose no risk to their communities or the country, may lawfully be subject to removal—but they do not pose the same risk justifying aggressive (and expensive) uses of law enforcement resources along the way.

To be sure, there have been a handful of rulings in the other direction—most notably a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals (which is in the Department of Justice) in September—which, among other things, effectively bars any of the Department’s internal immigration judges from ruling otherwise. Indeed, that’s a big part of why so many of these cases have ended up in federal district court. But the arguments the district courts keep embracing seem pretty straightforward to me, regardless of one’s preferred approach to statutory interpretation. Even the Supreme Court, as recently as 2018, was clear on the core distinction here: “U.S. immigration law authorizes the Government to detain certain aliens seeking admission into the country under §§ 1225(b)(1) and (b)(2). It also authorizes the Government to detain certain aliens already in the country pending the outcome of removal proceedings under §§ 1226(a) and (c).” Indeed.

***

It’s hard to predict exactly what’s going to happen next in these fast-moving cases. As Kyle Cheney noted in his Politico piece last week, “The Trump administration has asked appeals courts in the Texas-based 5th Circuit and the Missouri-based 8th Circuit for expedited rulings on the matter. But it has also asked appeals courts in other parts of the country to slow-walk their consideration.” And the class certification order in the Central District of California case can also be immediately appealed—at least with the permission of the Ninth Circuit.

One way or the other, it stands to reason that the legality of the Lyons memo will make its way to the Supreme Court sooner, rather than later. And when it does, it will necessarily be one of the most important immigration disputes to arise out of this administration’s efforts to date—not just because of the number of people who are directly affected by the policy (and how it affects them), but because of how fundamentally it attempts to rewrite a distinction that U.S. immigration law (and the Supreme Court’s own case law) has maintained since at least the 1950s: Between those stopped at the border, and those who, through whatever means, are living their lives on U.S. soil—to whom the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment unquestionably applies. To borrow a line from Adam Serwer, the cruelty may well be the point of the Lyons memo. But the law demands—and ought to demand—a heck of a lot more.

SCOTUS Trivia: The First Monday in … December?

This isn’t Supreme Court trivia, per se. But I’ve been spending a lot of time recently with old congressional records, and wanted to flag a quirk that’s in the text of the original Constitution and that says quite a lot about how the Founders originally envisioned the job of being a member of Congress. Specifically, as Article I, Section 4, Clause 2 of the Constitution provided, “The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.”

Thus, congressional sessions typically began on the first Monday in December, even for a Congress that entered into office that March—from the Founding all the way through the entrance into force of the Twentieth Amendment in 1933. Section 2 of that latter proviso specifies that “The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the 3d day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day.” And although Congress has, at various points, appointed a different day for the beginning of the next session, the strong norm has been to follow the constitutional formulation (as amended) throughout our history.

Among other things, the First Monday in December Clause meant not only that Congress was often out of session for months even after newly being elected, but that the second session of each Congress typically post-dated the intervening elections—during which many of the members would often be “lame ducks.”

There’s broad consensus on why the Founders initially opted for December. As one historical note on the Senate’s website explains, “The 18th-century framers of the United States Constitution, accustomed to an agriculturally based economy with its cycles of planting, growing, and harvesting, considered the mostly dormant month of December to be a particularly good time for senators and representatives to begin their legislative sessions.” The Supreme Court, too, eventually followed the same pattern—with its term beginning on the first Monday in January as of 1827; and the first Monday in December as of 1844 (where it remained until 1873). In other words, the First Monday in December used to mark the beginning of the work year for official Washington—with the business at hand usually (albeit not always) wrapped up by the end of June, if not sooner. Even back then, it seems, no one wanted to spend their summers in the District of Columbia.

Former Select Board member Terri Ackerman says Immigration and Customs Enforcement flights raise key questions for Hanscom Field administrators.

She hopes authorities embrace a possible legal answer.

“Don’t they want to protect against human trafficking?” she asked in a recent Concord Bridge interview, flagging fears about due process violations and unsafe conditions. “Don’t they want to have safety protocols so nobody dies on the plane?”

An ICE spokesperson confirmed the agency resumed using Hanscom in September to shuttle detainees around the country.

As human rights advocates ramp up pressure, New Hampshire-based lawyer Megan Chapman has offered to discuss options under the constitutional “Anti-Commandeering Doctrine” to at least extract detainee protections.

“It has to be carefully crafted, but there are ways states, state agencies, [and] state subdivisions can stand up and assert their independent sovereignty,” she told the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission.

Massport spokesperson Jennifer Mehigan told The Bridge in a statement that the agency “is open to any and all suggestions,” but “our understanding is” that a federal court rejected this argument under similar circumstances.

Facing related transparency demands, one leader recently doubled down on claims that Massport wasn’t being notified when ICE used its runways. Newly released emails show that wasn’t entirely true.

Email disclosures

ICE staff won’t share specifics about their Hanscom presence.

Airport advisors asked Massport for ICE flight data. Hanscom Director Christopher Willenborg responded with a letter saying, in part, that officials “do not receive advance notification.”

An advocate tested this with a public records request and received a September 5 exchange between Willenborg and a representative for Signature Aviation, an airfield service provider.

Signature’s Hanscom general manager, Tony Caruso, told Willenborg that “ICE charter flights” were set for “this afternoon and tomorrow afternoon,” according to a copy of the emails that was shared with The Bridge.

Willenborg asked Caruso to call him.

The advocate who obtained Caruso’s emails asked to remain anonymous. The Lexington Observer first reported the content of the conversation.

Ackerman, who represents Concord on the Hanscom advisory panel, said the contradiction between the emails and Willenborg’s letter to the group “speaks for itself.”

Mehigan said this was the only email chain related to ICE flights at Hanscom in the two years covered under the advocate’s request.

Signature is one of three Hanscom “fixed base operators.” FBOs provide services such as hangar space and, in some cases, refueling.

Mehigan said Massport “has no direct involvement in the scheduling or operations of these flights” and they’re “managed exclusively by the fixed base operators.”

Refueling-hazard questions

Willenborg referred the advisory commission to ICE for flight data. On November 18, members peppered an ICE representative with additional questions.

HFAC Chair Margaret Coppe asked whether agents leave shackled detainees in their seats while crews refuel planes.

“What if, God forbid, there were some sort of accident during the refueling?” she said.

Chris Celozzi, an ICE Boston public affairs representative, said he couldn’t answer questions himself but would report back to his bosses. The Bridge contacted an ICE spokesperson after the meeting, but didn’t hear back.

Demonstrators have rallied against detainee flights and singled out Signature for allegedly supporting detainee flights.

In an unsigned statement this summer, a corporate spokesperson said Signature doesn’t release client information.

The spokesperson said Signature must “indiscriminately support flight operations” that meet applicable requirements and said the firm is focused on providing “safe, consistent, and comprehensive” support.

Not everyone opposes current federal policy or calls to bounce ICE from Hanscom.

“They’re following the federal law,” Concordian Chris Reynolds said during an early-October demonstration in Monument Square. “If the law needs to be changed, then we should change the law — not decide not to obey it.”

On the advisory commission, most panelists have condemned immigration enforcement tactics under President Donald Trump.

HFAC pressured Massport, and members now hope the Anti-Commandeering Doctrine — rooted in the 10th Amendment — will spur the quasi-public agency to stiffen its spine.

Rules and guardrails

Chapman said she and others on a pro bono legal team have been in touch with New Hampshire authorities about previous flights at Pease International Airport. She’s presented at several meetings in recent months and told the Hanscom advisory commission that she’d be “more than happy” to help Massport draft requirements for ICE.

Ackerman suggested these could include guardrails around refueling and a requirement to share information.

Chapman said rules could also include screening of each passenger to make sure ICE isn’t denying anyone due process or moving someone in violation of a court order.

These kinds of requirements have precedent, Chapman said, adding, “When those kinds of restrictions are put in place, oftentimes it means that ICE decides to stop operating through that airport.”

Chapman suggested meeting with Massport’s legal team. Hanscom Manager of Administration Amber Goodspeed said she would relay the invitation. Ackerman volunteered to be part of a meeting.

“I’m very interested to see if Massport will hear us out,” Ackerman told The Bridge. “We’re hoping that they will see the light.”",https://concordbridge.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HANSCOM-ICE-1-1024x683.jpeg,N,,2025-12-01 08:57:31.440498
