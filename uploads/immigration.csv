Men in khaki shirts and wide-brimmed hats approached cars, while murky figures in tactical vests lurked over their shoulders in the distance.

The pattern soon became clear: Tennessee Highway Patrol (THP) were pulling people over, then Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents were detaining them. The 150 stops they made that night were part of a “public safety operation,” the THP said, targeting “areas with a history of serious traffic crashes and suspected gang activity.”

The sweep was part of a national effort to deliver on the campaign promise of President Donald Trump to launch “the largest deportation campaign in history.” That campaign, Trump claimed, would prioritize violent criminals and organized crime: drug traffickers, sex traffickers, and gangs with roots in Latin America.

The administration has called it the “worst first” strategy. And among their leading targets were the legendary Los Angeles-born Mara Salvatrucha, or MS13, and Tren de Aragua, the Venezuelan prison gang that has spread throughout the Americas by preying on the exodus of people fleeing poverty, insecurity, and political oppression in Venezuela.

“All of these criminals, these murderers, these drug dealers — we’re getting them out. I will put these vicious, bloodthirsty criminals in jail, or I will get them out of the country,” Trump had said.

But if these operations were meant to dismantle criminal groups, there was little in the public record to show for it. During the Nashville sweeps, authorities detained just one alleged member of the MS13 and one from the Tren de Aragua. The operation also stirred up political controversy, sparked a community backlash, and has left many in the city’s migrant community living in constant fear.

The Tennessee operation was a microcosm of the conflicts caused by a national immigration crackdown that has been justified with the threat of Latin American organized crime. With two of the most prominent criminal groups in the Americas at the center of it, InSight Crime sought to determine the nature of these networks and the threat level they pose in Tennessee and measure it against the response by the government — as well as the impact of that response on local communities.

This is the first of three articles resulting from that effort. It chronicles the crackdown and the reverberations from it. The other articles profile the Tennessee operations of the criminal groups in question: the MS13 and Tren de Aragua, two of the most violent gangs in the Americas. The reports are based on dozens of interviews with law enforcement and judicial officials, community workers and activists, family members of the detained, immigration lawyers, political leaders, and experts on all sides of the debate. We also read through dozens of court filings and public statements by officials across the country and analyzed crime and immigration data stretching back decades.

The effects of these crackdowns are still being felt. While the government claims it has deported record numbers of gang members, and supporters of these policies say these operations are a critical tool for combating transnational criminal networks, authorities refuse to share the crucial details needed to corroborate these efforts.

Instead, the information released suggests the scope of the operations has widened considerably beyond the “worst first” mission, undermining trust between some of the communities most affected by organized crime and the law enforcement agencies tasked with stopping it. But more than that, the operations are the most visible manifestation of tectonic shifts in the US government’s approach not only to immigration but also to combatting organized crime that could have a lasting impact on US security policy.

Immigration and Gangs in Tennessee

ICE’s sweeping new national approach began in early February with a series of “enhanced immigration enforcement operations” in multiple cities across the country. The statement announcing the raids included few details, but a series of photos showed arrests of alleged MS13 and Tren de Aragua members in Maryland and South Carolina.

Within a month, ICE was carrying out similar operations around the country. Most took place over several days and were carried out alongside other federal agencies or state and local law enforcement. They arrested tens, even hundreds, of people at a time. The operations hit Texas, California, New Mexico, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, Massachusetts, Alabama, New York, Florida, and Maryland before reaching Tennessee.

Tennessee was a logical target. Located in the southeastern United States, the state typifies many of the organized crime and migration dynamics that have risen to the top of the Trump administration’s security agenda. Foreign-born residents account for around 6% of the state’s total population and 15% in Nashville, according to 2024 census figures. While accurate figures on the number of undocumented migrants are difficult to calculate, the American Immigration Council estimates a total population of around 156,000 living in the state, where they work in sectors such as construction and hospitality in urban hubs and in the agricultural sector that forms the backbone of the state’s rural economy.

But Tennessee also has gang problems and high murder rates in its major cities, human trafficking, and high levels of fentanyl addiction. And gangs such as the MS13 and Tren de Aragua are present in migrant communities, where they commit serious crimes, mostly against members of those same communities.

Of the two, the MS13 has a much deeper history. The gang has been in Nashville for more than two decades, and the city has seen two major criminal conspiracy investigations leading to multiple convictions on charges ranging from murder to kidnapping.

Tren de Aragua’s presence, however, is harder to pin down. State law enforcement first warned of the advances of Tren de Aragua across Tennessee in late 2024. While they have since faced criticisms for overplaying the threat posed, in 2025, federal prosecutors brought sex trafficking charges against what they allege is the first organized Tren de Aragua cell in the state.

Casting a Wide Net

From the beginning of the Nashville operation, it was clear that ICE and state police were casting a wide net. Legal observers described to InSight Crime how THP troopers pulled drivers over citing minor traffic violations. The THP would approach the cars first, then ICE officers would demand to see proof of immigration status. If any of those in the vehicles couldn’t provide it, ICE bundled them into their vehicles and whisked them away.

The ICE officers sometimes demanded to see people’s tattoos, but activists who spoke to InSight Crime said they did not see any authorities doing criminal background checks on the scene, and little more was done to establish any criminal affiliations or record. Beyond concentrating operations along the main roads of the town’s immigrant neighborhoods, there was scant evidence to suggest the stops were targeting specific individuals, they said.

“I don’t think they had any rhyme or reason. It was just whoever they decided that looked Latino at that instance and could be pulled over,” Jazmin Ramírez, a migrant rights activist and community organizer who witnessed two arrests while carrying out legal observer work, told InSight Crime.

Both state and federal authorities have refused to release all but a snapshot of data on the background of those stopped, which was obtained by local journalists. That snapshot provided details on the ethnicity of 34 of the drivers who were stopped: 29 of them were Latino, two Asian, two Black, and one white.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who heads ICE’s parent agency, pushed back on allegations of racial profiling in the operation.

“Do you have any indication that anybody was targeted just specifically because of what their race or creed was?” she responded when questioned by journalists in Nashville. “Every single enforcement operation that we have conducted has been based on case work and investigative reports of criminal activity.”

Activists, though, said anyone caught in the dragnet risked arrest. On one occasion, legal observers documented ICE pulling a mother from her children. On another, they detained a man in front of school children waiting for a bus.

During the operation, much of Nashville’s migrant community essentially went into lockdown, only leaving their homes when they had little other choice.

“It was this weird, eerie silence. People not on the streets, businesses completely empty — this hyper alertness of ‘could that be the car?’” said Ramírez.

Despite the claims the operation was targeting gangs, there were few signs of the authorities trying to gather intelligence or build cases after making arrests. Instead, they denied many detainees the due process and rights they would have been entitled to in the US criminal justice system, including access to a lawyer or the right to a phone call.

Many of those detained were shunted around jails in Tennessee before being transported to an ICE detention center in Louisiana, 500 miles away. Some spent time chained and shackled and did not get adequate food and medical care, according to multiple accounts by detainees, relatives, and activists.

“They were treated like they weren’t human,” said Chelsea White, whose Mexican husband, Hilario Martinez Garcia, was detained during the operation by THP working with ICE on the outskirts of Nashville.

While some of those detained were able to contact their families, many others were not. The first time some families heard from their loved ones was when they received phone calls from Guatemala, El Salvador, or Mexico.

White heard nothing about her husband for a week.

“I had no idea where he was, what was going on, what was happening, if he was okay,” she said.

Since the operation, there is no sign authorities have brought criminal charges against those arrested in the operation. Instead, in many cases, immigration officials pushed detainees to sign self-deportation papers, which many did not understand as they were only offered in English, activists and relatives told InSight Crime.

White’s husband eventually signed those papers after a court hearing in which a judge told him he would be held in ICE detention indefinitely if he decided to fight his legal case.

“There were people that had been there for months already and didn’t even have a court date, and he was scared that was going to be his fate,” she said.

White, a US citizen who has lived her whole life in Tennessee, moved to Mexico with her three children to keep her family together. As she tries to rebuild her life, she bristles at the suggestion that the operation that tore it apart was taking aim at organized crime. When Trump said his government would target gang members and violent criminals, she had believed it, she said during a telephone interview from Mexico.

“But he’s not just getting those people. He’s getting normal, everyday people that go to work and come back. He’s getting family people.”

Hundreds of ‘Aliens,’ but Few Gang Members

The Nashville operation lasted a week, after which ICE reported that agents had arrested 196 “criminal illegal aliens.” Of these, 95 — fewer than half — had prior criminal convictions or pending cases.

While ICE has refused to release any information on the case history of the 95 with criminal records, it did provide some details on seven “notable arrests.” Their rap sheets included rape, domestic abuse, sex with a minor, aggravated assault, drug possession, and intent to supply. Headlining the list were two alleged gang members.

One of them was Franklin Velásquez, an alleged MS13 member from El Salvador. Velásquez had been convicted in the US for drug possession, failure to appear at judicial proceedings, and criminal impersonation, and he is wanted in El Salvador on aggravated murder charges. However, no information was provided on what role, if any, Velásquez had with the MS13 in Nashville, and his name had not come up during an MS13 case that concluded in July 2024 with the conviction of 18 gang members.

The other detainee with alleged links to organized crime, according to the statement, was an unnamed 37-year-old Venezuelan who ICE claimed was a Tren de Aragua “affiliate member.” A later statement issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) providing further information on the “notable arrests” made no mention of the alleged Tren de Aragua member.

Federal authorities stonewalled efforts to provide more. ICE declined to provide details on the alleged Tren de Aragua member or any further information on the other detainees to the media, and it did not respond to InSight Crime’s request to discuss the operation. DHS sent InSight Crime a link to its press release.

When the legal department of Nashville’s mayor’s office asked DHS and THP for the details of those detained, THP responded that no such documents existed, while DHS did not respond at all. The THP also refused to release all but heavily redacted dispatch records on the traffic stops made from the first night, making it impossible to verify where, when, why, or how Velasquez and the alleged Tren de Aragua member were detained.

The results of ICE’s special enforcement operation in Nashville reflected the patterns seen on the national stage. Between March and late May, when new orders led to a change in ICE tactics, ICE reported carrying out 22 special enforcement operations. Of those, gangs and transnational criminal networks were explicitly named as priority targets in more than half of the cases. But of the total of 6,022 people detained in these operations, only 27 were alleged to be gang members or have gang ties – less than 0.5%. And only 8 of those were actually named.

ICE’s public statements may only offer the highlights of the overall panorama, and those arrested during the operations were not the only alleged gang members detained over the period. But the complete datasets available paint a similar picture.

According to an analysis by the Cato Institute that combined publicly available government data with internal ICE data, ICE detained 204,297 people between October 2024 and June 2025. Of those, 65.4% had neither convictions nor pending criminal charges. While the data did not include information on the number with alleged organized crime ties, records showed 6.9% were detained for violent crimes and another 4.5% for “vice” crimes — drugs, gambling, and the sex trade — sometimes linked to gang activity.

Among Law Enforcement, A Mixed Reaction

Backlash to the Nashville ICE operation was immediate. Activists organized patrols of legal observers, blockaded ICE facilities where detainees were being held, and organized solidarity campaigns. The city’s liberal mayor, Freddie O’Connell, also spoke out.

“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell said.

But the reaction among law enforcement and judicial officials to the sweep was mixed. Thomas Jaworski, a former federal prosecutor who in 2024 rose to the position of acting US Attorney for Middle Tennessee, told InSight Crime that while the numbers of serious criminals detained may be low, those individuals are likely major drivers of crime locally.

And while the operation in Nashville may not have directly weakened gangs or other transnational criminal networks, it may reduce their operational capacity, he added. The street presence of ICE and the threat of deportation, he said, will likely force these groups to keep a low profile.

“You’re going to see a slight dip going forward simply because of the immigration enforcement activities. That is not to be ugly about it. That’s just a fact of life,” he said.

Scott Mechkowski, a former ICE Deputy Director for New York City, told InSight Crime such broad operations can be an effective tactic for dismantling gangs by picking up what often gets left behind by slow-moving, costly investigations.

SEE ALSO: Gangs, Tattoos, and the Roots of the US Due Process Crisis

“Some of it may have shifted into wrapping it up in your daily local enforcement,” he told InSight Crime. “Why build the case if we know these guys are gangbangers and they’re illegal. Just lock them up and get rid of them.”

The operations, Mechkowski added, are likely not as indiscriminate as they can appear from the outside.

“It’s using intelligence and data collection to help you focus on your mission, your priorities,” he said. “You’re not racially profiling, but you are profiling.”

“You become experts on what to look for or what’s out of the norm,” he added.

Mechkowski sees the approach as a corrective to years of policies under the previous US administration of President Joe Biden that shackled law enforcement.

Under Biden, he said, ICE was restricted by protections for migrants lost in the never-ending asylum backlog or with protected immigration status, who could not be removed and had to be cut loose after arrest. He also highlighted the difficulties working in “sanctuary cities,” like New York and Los Angeles, where municipal authorities protect migrant communities by placing limits on the cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration authorities.

“Under the Biden administration, it was hard to lock anybody up,” he said.

In May, Mechkowski testified at a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing on the protection of ICE officers during such operations. Also speaking that day was another former official that saw the issue very differently.

In his testimony, former ICE Chief of Staff Jason Houser labeled the operations as “designed for media optics rather than public safety.”

“When resources are diverted toward the arrest of low-priority individuals, enforcement becomes a dragnet,” he told the committee. “That may generate high arrest numbers for press releases, but it pulls ICE personnel away from complex, high-risk cases that improve public safety. It creates a false sense of security while leaving human trafficking, narcotics operations, and violent criminal networks less disrupted.”

Houser did not respond to InSight Crime’s request for an interview. Other former officials, though, similarly questioned both the tactics and the results.

A former senior DHS official who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity expressed doubt that authorities are tracking down people whom they know have direct contacts with MS13 or Tren de Aragua in operations such as the one in Nashville.

“All the highway patrol operations and random traffic stops, that’s just to increase fear, it’s a fishing expedition,” he said.

Rather than a concerted crackdown on organized crime, the former official said, the results in Nashville and beyond point to agencies scrambling to deliver the numbers the Trump administration needs to keep its ambitious deportation promises. That pressure could also explain the lack of transparency over the allegations of gang affiliations.

“There are incentives to characterize somebody falsely or to err on the side of assuming that there’s activity with TdA or trying to conflate TdA or MS13 activity with stuff that’s pretty benign or routine,” he added.

A Law Enforcement Overhaul

While special enforcement operations such as the ICE sweep in Nashville have been the most eye-catching aspect of the convergence of crime and immigration under Trump, they are just one part of much deeper changes that could radically alter how transnational organized crime is investigated and prosecuted in the United States.

In March, the government announced its new “Take Back America” initiative. At the top of their new list of priorities was immigration — or, as the Department of Justice (DOJ) memo announcing the change put it, to “repel the foreign invasion.” To facilitate quick removals, the memo directs prosecutors to prioritize charging “the most serious, readily provable offense” over building cases.

The new priorities were then reinforced in funding plans. In 2026, the DHS will see a 65% increase in its budget. This will be the start of an unprecedented surge in funding planned for the next few years, much of it funneled to ICE, where billions of additional dollars will be allocated to recruiting new enforcement officers, building and operating detention facilities, and removals. With a projected budget of nearly $28 billion a year over the next four years, the changes will make ICE by far the most well-funded federal law enforcement agency in the United States.

At the same time, the DOJ faces billions of dollars in budget cuts. And the federal agencies traditionally tasked with investigating organized crime — the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) — have already seen their budgets slashed by hundreds of millions of dollars and their agents pulled from their duties to support ICE immigration enforcements.

As if to put an exclamation point on the new strategy, one of the main tools used by the DOJ to bring local and federal law enforcement together to target criminal networks — Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) — is being dissolved altogether.

The changing panorama has caused alarm among some of those who have been leading efforts to take on transnational organized crime in Tennessee, where recent cases brought against MS13 and Tren de Aragua have been built on slow-moving, complex investigations carried out by multiple agencies, including through the organized crime task forces that are now being disbanded.

One recently retired Tennessee organized crime prosecutor, who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity, doubts the effectiveness of prioritizing immigration enforcement and worries it could undermine efforts to investigate criminal networks.

“It’s having the reverse effect of what the administration claims that it should have and what most people think that it should have when you end up just arresting people based on their immigration status,” the former prosecutor said.

Not only are such operations unlikely to reach top-level criminals, they may also undermine the community relations that are key to prosecuting such actors.

“I’m sure that it has put a damper on people willing to serve as informants, because if you have some kind of status that might subject you to enforcement, you’re certainly not going to willingly go talk to anybody and provide information,” the former prosecutor added.

In some cases, such tactics could even strengthen the hold of criminal groups over their victims. The former prosecutor pointed to a recent sex trafficking case authorities connected to Tren de Aragua, where the alleged traffickers used their victims’ immigration status as leverage.

“It makes that even easier, [they can say] ‘you see these arrests out here? That’s what will happen to you unless you continue to do this,” the former prosecutor said.

The pulling of resources away from investigative agencies and to immigration enforcement will also undermine capacity to build cases, the ex-prosecutor added.

“The time and resources that [agents] have to put into these immigration arrests makes them completely unable to perform any of their long-term investigations, so you just completely hamstring them.”

However, ex-ICE officer Mechkowski believes this prioritization of immigration enforcement does not have to come at the expense of building cases against transnational gangs and criminal networks.

“I think they can exist side by side,” he said. “I don’t think they’ve abandoned dismantling gangs, just that maybe right now the focus has changed a little bit. And I still think they’re doing those investigations.”

The deployment of investigative agents to immigration enforcement operations, he added, is likely a temporary measure that will no longer be necessary with the surge in ICE funding and recruitment.

Security Policy and Politics: Worlds Apart

While security and justice officials and experts debate the effectiveness of immigration enforcement as a tool to combat organized crime, on the political stage, the two political parties occupy different realities. And again, Tennessee has seen its local version of the conflict playing out nationally.

Local Democrats called the ICE operation “white supremacist terror.” Republicans, meanwhile, accused Mayor O’Connell of shielding gang members after he criticized ICE tactics. In September, one local representative upped the stakes further by calling for the National Guard to be deployed to Nashville because the mayor was “using the city as an outpost for international gangs to set up shop in our neighborhoods.”

Nationally though, the Trump administration has moved away from the threat of organized crime in its orders to ICE. Several US media outlets reported on a meeting in late May in which Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff who is leading the administration’s immigration crackdown, tore into ICE leaders from around the country for not making enough arrests.

“What do you mean you are going after criminals?” Miller angrily told them, according to an account of the meeting in the Washington Examiner. “Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?’”

Within days, that is exactly where ICE went, as well as to construction sites, farms, and other workplaces that rely on migrant labor. The number of migrants with no criminal record being detained soared. And whatever remained of a “worst first” policy targeting gangs and organized crime fell away.

“At this point, I can’t see any strategy other than harassment, discrimination, and racism,” the former DHS official said.

While ICE reports since the Miller meeting reflect a pivot to worksite enforcement, special operations have continued, with four carried out between June and September that declared gangs and transnational criminal networks as their targets or that they were based on a “worst first” approach. In those operations, ICE reported making 1,172 arrests. Just 14 of them were suspected members of organized crime groups.",https://insightcrime.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gangs-and-Immigration-Cover-chapter-1-InSight-Crime-Sep-2025-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 07:56:46.387281

It’s the first time the financial agreement has been made public after the White House initially said the deal amounted to $6 million.

The payments were part of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown and decision to invoke a wartime law to remove Venezuelan nationals.

The four-page agreement between the United States and El Salvador verifies that the funds came out of the State Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law, which gives financial assistance to security forces and is subject to a human rights law known as the Leahy Law.

That human rights law bars State’s financial support of “units of foreign security forces” — which can include military and law enforcement staff in prisons — facing credible allegations of gross human rights violations.

“The purpose of this grant is to provide funds to be used by the Salvadoran law enforcement and corrections agencies for its law enforcement needs, which includes costs associated with detaining the 238 TdA members recently deported to El Salvador,” according to the agreement.

Those who drafted the law raised concerns that those payments violated human rights laws, as more than 250 Venezuelan men were removed from the U.S. to the brutal prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, despite a federal judge’s order barring such action.

Congressional Democrats have asked Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the White House for a copy of the financial agreement for months, over concerns the funds were being used in violation of human rights.

March flight to El Salvador

On March 15, the Trump administration sent 238 men to CECOT, after invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to apply to Venezuelan nationals 14 and older who are suspected members of the gang Tren de Aragua.

The agreement, dated March 22, noted the men could be detained up to a year.

It also bars any of the $4.76 million to be used to help asylum seekers seek legal counsel for the U.S. asylum process, for access to abortion, funds for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency that provides humanitarian assistance to Palestinians or for programs that promote diversity, equity and inclusion.

The men were released back to Venezuela as part of a prison swap in July, but they remained at CECOT for four months. Some of those detained, including Kilmar Abrego Garica, of Maryland, whose mistaken deportation captured national attention, detailed psychological and physical torture.

No protection from torture

The document was obtained through a lawsuit by Democracy Forward, which specifically argued the financial agreement between El Salvador and the U.S. “was created without any legal basis.”

“The correspondence between the U.S. State Department and El Salvador confirms what we have long suspected: the Trump-Vance administration did nothing to meaningfully ensure that individuals disappeared from the U.S. to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison were protected from torture, indefinite confinement, or other abuses,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement. “The agreement did, however, go to lengths to ensure that the funds the U.S. provided to El Salvador not be used to provide reproductive health care or to assist asylum seekers in accessing resources and counsel.”

The operation took place at the corner of Quail Gardens Drive and Encinitas Boulevard, where video captured ICE ERO agents running after people in the street as some tried to escape. At least one person was seen detained on the ground, while others ran into a nearby apartment complex.

Witnesses estimated that four to six people were arrested during the chaotic scene. ICE hasn't confirmed any details of its operation.

Kathy Stenger, an Encinitas volunteer who helps patrol the community for immigration enforcement, witnessed the operation on her way to work.

""I suspected that it was ICE, and so I made a U-turn and parked in the parking lot,"" Stenger said.

By the time she stopped, the people detained had been taken away.

""One of the construction workers shared a video with me that showed just chaos and ICE agents all running through the streets chasing after people,"" Stenger said.

Mercedes Ramos said her brother-in-laws were among those detained. She also said a couple was taken, leaving their 5-year-old child without her parents.

Work continued at the construction site after the operation, but community members expressed outrage over the enforcement action.

""This is about everyone, so when they attack one person's rights, and regardless of where each of us is from, we're standing together, standing by our neighbors,"" said Jeremy Ross, a community advocate and Encinitas resident.

Here's where they're happening,Melissa Montalvo,,,,,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article312445163.html,"ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have risen by 58% in the first seven months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period last year.
ICE arrested an estimated 1,156 individuals in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced and Tulare counties between January to the end of July.
The San Francisco ICE field office, which oversees operations in the Central Valley, made 305 arrests under a “fugitive operations” program.
However, ICE arrests have been confirmed at courthouses, ICE-check-ins and federal immigration service offices in the region, according to Fresno Bee reports.
Tulare (seven arrests), Fresno (six) and Kings (six) counties made up the bulk of ICE arrests at county jails.","ICE arrests in California’s Central Valley have risen by 58% in the first seven months of the Trump administration compared to the same time period last year.

The Fresno Bee analyzed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement data obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the Deportation Data Project, a UC Berkeley Law School initiative.

The data sheds light for the first time on how ICE operates in the Central Valley, such as where administrative arrests have taken place and which demographic groups have been most impacted.

ICE arrested an estimated 1,156 individuals in Fresno, Kern, Kings, Madera, Merced and Tulare counties between January to the end of July.

During the same time period in 2024, ICE made 733 arrests in the six-county region.

While many of these cases are pending, at least 516 individuals have already been deported. Most of these arrests took place in the Fresno and Bakersfield areas, where ICE has sub-field offices.

Bill Ong Hing, founding director of the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic at University of San Francisco, warned that arrests will likely increase throughout the state after last month’s Supreme Court decision that allows immigration agents to conduct “roving patrols.” He said the court’s decision gives ICE the permission to “racially profile.”

“They’re trying every strategy,” he said.

An ICE spokesperson said the agency could not verify or comment on the data compiled by the Deportation Data Project.

“U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is executing its mission of identifying and removing criminal aliens and others who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” an ICE spokesperson said. “All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality.”

This tally is likely an undercount of total ICE apprehensions of Valley residents.

The data only reflects administrative arrests made by ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, the division responsible for enforcing immigration law in the country’s interior. Also, not all arrest records in the dataset include details on where an individual was arrested. The San Francisco ICE field office, which oversees operations in the Central Valley, made 305 arrests under a “fugitive operations” program. Exact location details are unavailable for these arrests.

The data also does not include criminal arrests conducted by ICE or arrests made by other federal law enforcement agencies, such as U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

How many people have been deported from Fresno area?

Roughly half, or 516, of the 1,156 people arrested by ICE in the region have already been deported, data shows.

Most, or 333, of these deportations were from arrests made in Fresno County, followed by Kern County, with 185. (Deportations or removals are classified as: “Deported/Removed - Deportability” or “Excluded/Removed - Inadmissibility” in the chart below.)

Hing said people who have been arrested are probably taken to an ICE detention facility.

“If they sign away their rights, then they’ll be deported, probably within a week or so,” he said.

About 112 of those arrested, have “self-deported,” or returned voluntarily. (These cases are categorized as: “Withdrawal Permitted - I-275 Issued,” “Voluntary Departure Confirmed,” or “VR Witnessed.”)

As of late July, 369 cases remain active, meaning their immigration and removal cases are pending.

Where are people being arrested by ICE in Fresno area?

Most ICE arrests this year have taken place in the Bakersfield and Fresno areas, though the exact locations are unknown and are categorized as “general, non-specific” areas.

However, ICE arrests have been confirmed at courthouses, ICE-check-ins and federal immigration service offices in the region, according to Fresno Bee reports.

Approximately 21% of these arrests took place in the region’s federal and state prisons as well as county jails.

The top three state prisons for ICE arrests in the six-county region include Avenal, Corcoran and Pleasant Valley. Federal prison arrests took place at FCI Mendota and FCI Atwater, and there was one arrest recorded at the Golden State Annex ICE detention facility.

Tulare (seven arrests), Fresno (six) and Kings (six) counties made up the bulk of ICE arrests at county jails.

ICE arrests of Central Valley residents could take place outside the region, such as if they have hearings at immigration courthouses in San Francisco, Concord or Sacramento.

Hing said he’s aware of at least two Central Valley residents who have been arrested from the immigration courthouse in San Francisco through his involvement with the city’s rapid response network.

About half of all arrests were classified as “located” or “non-custodial arrests” — which the Deportation Data Project said likely indicates arrests made in the community.

Nearly half, or 43%, of total administrative arrests, were part of ICE’s “Criminal Alien Program,” or CAP. This program focuses on the “identification, arrest, and removal of Incarcerated aliens at federal, state, and local levels, as well as at-large criminal aliens,” according to ICE.

Only two individuals have been arrested as part of a workplace enforcement operation — which took place in Kern County in June.

Who is being arrested by ICE in the Central Valley?

Sixty-five percent of those arrested by ICE in the six-county region had previously been convicted of a crime — or 787 out of 1,156. Meanwhile, 112 people arrested by ICE, or 12%, had pending criminal charges.

The remaining 265 individuals arrested, or 23%, only had an immigration violation.

However, nationwide, most people held in ICE detention have no criminal history, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a Syracuse University research project.

A majority, or 61%, of those arrested were from Mexico (713), followed by India (115) and El Salvador (63).

DPD chief turns down ICE funding

Comeaux went so far as to claim that he recently turned down a $25 million offer to team up with ICE on immigration enforcement.

Comeaux says misleading social media posts are fueling the false narrative that DPD is assisting ICE in immigration arrests.

He says those videos actually show DPD officers working with U.S. Marshals to help arrest fugitives and sex offenders.

'We don't have the authority'

What they're saying:

""We at DPD are not doing any immigration enforcement. We don't have the authority to do that, nor have we done that, nor will we do that,"" Comeaux said at the meeting.

Questioning from board members prompted Comeaux to reveal the funding he allegedly declined.

""We were contacted by the federal government either last week or within the last two weeks, and we were offered $25 million to be part of 287-G, and we said, ‘Absolutely not. No.’ That was me who said that, turned it down,"" Comeaux said.

For now, DPD only assists ICE with requests for securing a perimeter or transport. But Comeaux is worried continued exposure on what he considers a non-issue will turn it into one.

""There's nothing happening in Dallas, but every time we do something like this, we're bringing more attention to Dallas. We don't need that attention. We don't want to deal with that smoke,"" Comeaux said.

ICE 287-G program

Funding from ICE's 287-G program allows ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement in the arrest and deportation of immigrants.

Several North Texas law enforcement agencies have partnered with ICE, including the Keller Police Department and several local sheriff's offices.

The federal government hopes others will join. A TV ad currently runs targeting Dallas and Fort Worth law enforcement.

The ad began airing just over a month after ICE held a two-day hiring event in North Texas, which was met with some community backlash.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/screenshot-2025-10-15-163146.png?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-16 03:01:47.011362

This isn’t just about immigrant workers coming to places like the United States, or the UK, or Western Europe.","Rumeysa Ozturk’s seizure by plainclothes masked agents outside of her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, in March 2025 had all the hallmarks of a kidnapping. The PhD student, originally from Turkey, was flown to a detention facility in Louisiana, stripped of her F1 student visa, and slated for deportation—all as part of a larger effort by the Trump administration targeting international students for pro-Palestine speech. The draconian arrest sparked outrage among elected officials, advocacy groups, and more. It signaled a frightening escalation—and served as a signal that more was to come.

After two months, however, and due to relentless mobilizing work conducted by a coalition of pro-Palestine activists, free speech advocates, labor organizers, and more, Ozturk was released on bail. She remains free today.

“If you want to know what [rapid response] looks like, it’s getting a call at 10 pm that your member was kidnapped off the street, there’s video of it that’s going to hit the new—and springing into action,” says Dave Foley, president of SEIU Local 509. Foley, whose local represents nearly 30,000 workers in human services and education across Massachusetts, was on the front lines in fighting for Ozturk’s release.

Ozturk’s arrest came as just one of many escalations in the Trump administration’s crusade against immigrants in the United States—including the illegal military occupation of Democratic-controlled cities, the repurposing of prison camps, and the use of detention to third-party nations. However, the expansion of ICE, immigrant detention, and rollbacks to civil liberties that’ve been at the center of Donald Trump’s second presidential administration are not entirely new. They build atop histories of anti-immigrant sentiment and policies—some more recent than others.

“It’s built on other layers of foundation,” says Dr. A. Naomi Paik, a historian at the University of Illinois at Chicago. “But the escalation and the rapidity—how quickly this is happening—that feels new.”

Dr. Paik’s research centers immigration and detention within the United States. She is the author of Rightlessness: Testimony and Redress in U.S. Prison Camps Since World War II and Bans, Walls, Raids, Sanctuary: Understanding U.S. Immigration for the Twenty-First Century.

In this August interview, Foley and Paik sat down for a conversation on the evolving threat that escalating immigrant detention poses to our communities—as well as new and historic lessons for our solidarity movements.

This interview has been condensed and edited lightly for clarity.

—Henry Hicks IV

Henry Hicks IV: Dr. Paik, how is what we’re seeing today unprecedented—and in what ways have we been here before?

Dr. A. Naomi Paik: One is the technological advances that have really escalated and accelerated the surveillance of not just migrants but of all of us; and the profiteering from these new surveillance technologies. This has been going on for quite some time, but Big Data and the advancement of AI has accelerated things so much, in such a way that it’s actually hard to keep up with what’s even happening.

In terms of detention, the extraordinary rendition of migrants from United States territory to extraterritorial sites of detention—like CECOT in El Salvador, or Uganda, or even Guantánamo—is new. Having said that, extraterritorial detention itself is not new. During the 1990s, the United States detained Haitian and Cuban migrants at Guantánamo during refugee crises. So, that set the precedent, not only for migrant detention in extraterritorial spaces, but also the indefinite detention of men captured under the War on Terror.

Under Trump, the US is taking migrants from the United States territory. That’s the new thing. [They are taking migrants] to this site now that is now synonymous with torture, whereas before, we would intercept migrants in international waters and then bring them to Guantánamo to prevent them from getting to the United States territory, where they have things like claims to asylum. Again, it’s an advancement. It’s an escalation of ideas that were already there.

HH: Dave, from your perspective as someone who’s doing work on the ground, how is what you’re seeing new?

Dave Foley: [SEIU has] always had connections with the different ICE Watch networks. Where we’re seeing things differently today is statuses being revoked. We had a member of ours on an F-1 student visa. Her F-1 student visa was terminated in a very high-profile, public way—and that’s new to us. It really scared a lot of people. The administration will constantly announce new things that leaves us scrambling.

HH: How are unions and different community groups well-positioned to be doing this kind of resistance work?

DF: Unions are fundamentally built on one-on-one relationships in a workplace. You can move people politically. You can give people a real political education that you can’t do through TV, or ads, or newspapers, or anything like that, in the actual worksite, because you have organic leaders there. So, you might have someone that you know that is a real xenophobe or a real racist, and you figure that they can’t be moved on something like immigration justice, but if anybody can do it, it’s the union steward who sits with them through a disciplinary hearing and saves their job. Or it’s the on-the-ground worksite leader who rallies the rest of the workplace to get a better raise or better rates on the health insurance premiums in a contract. These people can see real leaders, who can then give them a political education.

The other important thing that unions provide is two-way communication, in an organized way. We hear from our members. For instance, when our member was kidnapped off the streets by ICE, we knew about it before anybody did, really, because our steward network was plugged into it and knew to call the union very early, so we could spring into action and provide as much assistance as possible. We’ve got organized lists and can communicate with our members, so we can mobilize and turn people out to a rally or in the streets very, very rapidly—like within 24 hours.

And then, finally, a union like ours, with the size and resources that we have, we’re in a powerful position to actually talk to elected leaders and push them into positions that might make them feel uncomfortable. [We can] leverage the political power that we get from our rank-and-file members and turn our voting power into real political action.

HH: Dr Paik, how have you seen effective resistance movements manifest in prior moments that echo what we’re seeing today?

ANP: A lot of the resistance that we’re seeing—on the streets of DC, in Chicago, with community defense, people coming out on the streets to prevent ICE from taking somebody, or to chase ICE away, or recording them in the Home Depot parking lot—that didn’t come out of nowhere. It [builds] on previous eras and again. It’s not just from Trump 1.0. It’s also from Obama. The formation of those community defense groups, of rapid response networks, of these different kinds of communication—using social media, using email—that has already been built. When Trump got reelected, it could be activated once again.

And there’s muscle memory there—not only in organizing leadership but also just regular people. I am not one of the main organizers of any of the rapid response networks in Chicago, but when the call is made, I am going to show up for the trainings. The fact that they can make the call, that they know where to make it, and that people actually show up, that is, again, that kind of community muscle memory that’s being activated in this moment. People have learned over time what kinds of tactics and what kind of strategies are going to be effective.

In the Obama era, we saw more of this kind of “good immigrant, bad immigrant,” “were they here legally,” “did they commit a crime before,” etc. We should defend immigrants because they’re “good,” and they go to church, and they work hard, and whatever. In this moment, it makes zero sense to make those kinds of arguments—because anybody who is without status or is not a citizen is at risk.

HH: We’re talking about the role that unions are playing in defending immigrants—when citizen workers and immigrants are often positioned against each other. Why is rejecting that narrative of incompatibility so important?

DF: I think it’s something that has to be confronted and rejected very consciously at every opportunity. We have a whole lot more in common with our immigrant neighbors, brothers, sisters, and siblings than we do with those that try to divide us. We, as workers, have a common enemy that is raising prices and keeping our wages down consciously—and it’s not your immigrant neighbor. It is the billionaire who owns your company and probably owns the property that you rent from.

ANP: The kind of “citizen-worker versus immigrant-worker” is a total distraction, and it keeps us fighting each other so that we are not directing our ire where it should be: to the actual culprits who are making our lives worse.

The whole point of having borders is to keep wages low and to keep labor extraction for profit high. This isn’t just about immigrant workers coming to places like the United States, or the UK, or Western Europe. It’s also about our corporations going into poorer places, colonized places, and extracting low wage labor there as well. We have to think about how labor is working globally to extract wealth from the bottom and concentrate it at the top. One of the functions of borders is to divide the global working class.

HH: You described earlier that the practice of detention itself is something that’s happening across borders as well.

ANP: It’s becoming a global industry. Again, there are all these innovative ways of extracting profit from regular people—that don’t necessarily require labor. Our data is one source of profit extraction, and then also social control through things like detention, like policing, like surveillance networks. Those are other ways of extracting profit that don’t require us to work at subminimum wages. This is part of the technology thing that really worries me. They don’t even need to extract our labor. Then what?

DF: If I could add to that: Dr. Paik is saying that there’s no labor cost to this data collection—but that does not mean it’s free. We just saw in the Big Beautiful Bill a massive cut in what will be care work, what will be labor. The cuts that we’re going to see to Medicaid are going to translate into cuts to jobs in the fastest-growing industry in the United States right now, which is care work. And at the same time, we’re going to see a massive amount of money move right into ICE, into the building of new detention centers. Those facilities will be funded by cuts that will cost jobs. That’s the cost.

HH: There’s so much more time to go in this adminitration. How are y’all approaching the long-term nature of this fight? How are y’all thinking about how to withstand the continual escalation of these things over the next three years, at least?

DF: In the labor world, we use two different terms: “mobilizing” and “organizing.” Mobilizing is essentially turning people out, and organizing is really building that infrastructure so that when you need to, you can turn the maximum amount of people out or take the biggest action that you can. We’ve had to mobilize a lot lately, in these past seven months. But the real priority for us, is continual organizing.

No matter who the next president is and which party they come from, we know that we need to push beyond just defending against what Trump has done, and we need to really push for immigration reform—which has never happened in my lifetime. We have so many people in this country that have been waiting and waiting and waiting for justice to happen. We need to use a moment like this to really organize and to build, so that we can get beyond where we have been for my entire life. But you’re right, this is not a sprint. It’s a marathon. There’s a long way to go.

ANP: It’s so hard because the crises that we’re facing are so immense, and they have been building for so long. The roots of the crises that we’re facing go so deep. And so, to really extirpate those roots, it’s going to take so much effort. And it’s going to take everyone’s effort.

DF: It might feel like the forces arrayed against us are limitless, but you can outwork them. They’re not as resilient as us. They don’t work as hard. They’re not used to working as hard. I’ve seen it in so many fights—we can easily be outspent, but we can outwork them time and time and time again.

Ad Policy

HH: Are there prior resistance movements or flash points of community strength that give you hope?

ANP: Going further back, [I think of] the abolitionist movement against slavery. They weren’t just demanding freedom for the enslaved. They wanted to overturn an entire global political economy based on enslaved labor. That’s huge! They were really trying to change the whole world. And they did it. That is remarkable to me. People who were not even considered people overturned an entire global political economic system based on their nonrecognition as humans.

For more recent moments, I think of the summer of 2020. The lesson for me from that summer is that we don’t know how historical change is going to happen, and that it doesn’t necessarily happen in a linear fashion. I did not expect abolitionist thought to become a mainstream news item at all—ever. But it did. We also have to understand that even when movements don’t get the goods in the way that we would have liked to have seen, that they still make meaningful changes that we then build upon.

A lot of people criticize Occupy Wall Street because they weren’t organized enough, they didn’t move things in a certain direction, it didn’t have a durable life—but it gave us the language of “the 1%.” For me as a teacher, before Occupy Wall Street, if I said “the 1%,” no one would know what I’m talking about. I say it now and everyone knows exactly what I’m talking about. All of these movements build on each other and learn from each other.

DF: [I think of several], from the Haitian Revolution to the changes we’re seeing in public opinion when it comes to Israel and Gaza and the genocide. I get a lot of inspiration from historical reminders that popular opinion and people can be moved and they can be changed. Something that seems ubiquitous can change really, really quickly by the actions of very, very brave people.

We are seeing a level of disgust in what the Trump administration is doing, that is drawing people to action. This could be an inflection point. We don’t know where this is going to go, but it’s inspiring to know that this history isn’t written—and that we can shape it.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2226092155.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 21:56:58.310616

A Chicago judge signed an order Wednesday prohibiting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from making arrests at Cook County courthouses, citing concerns about ""fear or obstruction"" while suspected illegal immigrants attend court proceedings.

Local officials in the Midwest sanctuary city, which the Trump administration has targeted in its federal immigration crackdown, claimed people were avoiding court because they were afraid of being detained.

The order bans immigration authorities from making civil arrests of any ""party, witness, or potential witness"" during court appearances.

JUDGE ALLOWS ICE TO CONTINUE COURTHOUSE ARRESTS IN NEW YORK CITY FOLLOWING LEGAL CHALLENGE

Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans reportedly said justice ""depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction"" in his decision.

The Trump administration in June launched an initiative to arrest illegal immigrants after asylum hearings.

The tactic stirred controversy, with critics claiming migrants seeking legal citizenship would be less likely to show up to hearings, and those arrested after hearings may not have additional criminal histories.

FEDERAL JUDGE LIMITS ICE ARRESTS WITHOUT WARRANT, PROBABLE CAUSE

Videos of the arrests went viral on social media, with some accusing ICE of ""kidnapping"" migrants.

In September, the ACLU and immigrant rights groups filed a lawsuit in New York City regarding the practice, though a federal judge ultimately ruled there was not enough evidence to suggest ICE's courthouse arrest policy changes were ""unexplained, arbitrary and capricious"" after 2021 guidance allowed arrests at or near immigration courts.

ICE ARRESTS 'PEDOPHILES, RAPISTS, ABUSERS' IN CHICAGO SANCTUARY CITY CRACKDOWN OPERATION

""Every day, our members are forced to choose between being kidnapped and/or put into expedited removal or risking deeper legal consequences because they're too scared to go to court,"" Diana Konaté, deputy executive director of Policy and Advocacy at African Communities Together, wrote in a statement published by the ACLU related to the New York City case.

""This is exactly what the administration intended—for people to be so fearful of enforcement that they forfeit the very resources and systems in place to protect them,"" Konaté added.

The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday declared a local state of emergency in response to ongoing ICE raids in LA. President Trump sent National Guard troops and Marines to LA in June to support the federal agents. Destiny Torres of LAist has more.

DESTINY TORRES, BYLINE: The county typically uses state of emergency funding to help with natural disasters like flooding, earthquakes and fires. But county officials are hoping to help stabilize neighborhoods that have been hurt by ICE enforcement. LA County has nearly 950,000 immigrants without legal status, or 9% of the region's population. The Trump administration has been cracking down on undocumented immigrants in cities across the country and is conducting deportations. According to county officials, the raids have caused fear, disruption to local businesses and lost wages for immigrant workers who are afraid to go out in public. The declaration itself doesn't say how the funding would be used, but supervisor Lindsey Horvath says it will allow the county to respond quickly to the growing crisis.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

LINDSEY HORVATH: It means Los Angeles County can move faster, coordinate better and use every tool available to support and stabilize our communities.

TORRES: The declaration allows the county to seek financial aid from the state. Supervisor Kathryn Barger was the one dissenting vote on Tuesday. She said in a statement that a local state of emergency is not the way to address the fear among immigrant communities. She calls it a symbolic gesture that could open up the county to litigation, which the county can't afford. Supervisor Janice Hahn says the move is not symbolic but critical to the county's response moving forward to better support its residents.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JANICE HAHN: We have entire families who are destitute because their fathers or mothers were taken from their workplaces, and they have no way to pay their rent or put food on the table.

TORRES: The declaration remains in place until the board moves to end it. For NPR News, I'm Destiny Torres in Los Angeles.

POLITICO’s exclusive reporting on a Young Republican group chat filled with racist epithets and hateful jokes reverberated Tuesday across the country, resulting in mounting condemnation and more chat members out of their jobs.

Peter Giunta lost his post as state Assemblymember Mike Reilly’s chief of staff, Playbook reported.

Joe Maligno was out as an employee of the New York State Unified Court System.

Vermont’s Republican governor and GOP lawmakers called on state Sen. Sam Douglass to resign.

The Kansas Republican Party announced that the Kansas Young Republicans, where William Hendrix was a leader, were inactive.

That’s on top of what happened before the story published: Hendrix lost his job with Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, and Bobby Walker’s offer to join NY-19 congressional candidate Peter Oberacker’s campaign was effectively revoked.

In the chat — 2,900 pages of which were leaked and reviewed by POLITICO — Giunta joked: “Everyone that votes no is going to the gas chamber.”

Maligno responded, “Can we fix the showers? Gas chambers don’t fit the Hitler aesthetic.”

The remarks — a look into how a group of Young Republicans talk in private and the coarsening rhetoric in the Trump era — drew swift rebukes from Republicans and Democrats.

But not from Vice President JD Vance. He broke with Republicans who broadly condemned the comments within the chat.

On X Tuesday night, Vance drew attention to Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general Jay Jones, who texted a colleague about shooting the then-Republican House speaker and wishing harm on his children.

“This is far worse than anything said in a college group chat, and the guy who said it could become the AG of Virginia,” Vance wrote with a screenshot of the text exchange. “I refuse to join the pearl clutching when powerful people call for political violence.”

Maligno, Hendrix and Douglass did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

In separate statements, both Giunta and Walker apologized for the messages they wrote in the Telegram chat but questioned whether they had been altered or taken out of context. They also attempted to blame the release of their chat on the New York Young Republican Club, a political group that operates at the city level and which is often at odds with the state group.

“I am so sorry to those offended by the insensitive and inexcusable language found within the more than 28,000 messages of a private group chat that I created during my campaign to lead the Young Republicans,” Giunta said. “These logs were sourced by way of extortion and provided to POLITICO by the very same people conspiring against me in what appears to be a highly-coordinated year-long character assassination led by Gavin Wax and the New York City Young Republican Club.”

Walker struck a similar tone.

“There is no excuse for the language and tone in messages attributed to me. The language is wrong and hurtful, and I sincerely apologize,” he said. “It’s troubling that private exchanges were obtained and released in a way clearly intended to inflict harm, and the circumstances raise real questions about accuracy and motive but none of that excuses the language. This has been a painful lesson about judgment and trust.”

Wax declined POLITICO’s request for comment.

GOP Rep. Mike Lawler condemned their chat remarks, as his Democratic rivals circulated photos of him with Giunta and Walker.

“The deeply offensive and hateful comments reportedly made in a private chat among members of the New York State Young Republicans are disgusting,” Lawler said via his spokesperson Ciro Riccardi.

Several racial minorities were slurred in the private Telegram group chat, and congressional Democrats aren’t standing for it.

“When we say white supremacy is thriving on the right, they call us reactionary,” Rep. Yvette Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said on X. “Give me a break. The future of the Republican Party proudly embraces bigotry that belongs in the past, and every American needs to recognize how dangerous that is.”

Rep. Grace Meng, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said in a statement to POLITICO that “their willingness to engage in such vile rhetoric behind closed doors speaks volumes to their character and the tone set by our nation’s leaders.”

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries posted an image of POLITICO’s article on Instagram and wrote: “These are sick people. Every single one of these racists and antisemites must be publicly exposed and held accountable.” — Emily Ngo

ABOVE THE FOLD

TRUMP TO CITY: DROP DEAD: President Donald Trump once again threatened to cut off New York from federal funds if the “communist” Mamdani wins the mayoral race.

“If somebody wins and has no chance of ever having a great economy because of that philosophy, you would put a halt to what we’re doing,” Trump said at a lunch Tuesday with Argentine President Javier Milei.

Trump slammed Mamdani several times over the course of the nearly hour-long press availability, insisting incorrectly that the democratic socialist Mamdani is a communist.

“I’m not going to send a lot of money to New York. I don’t have to. You know, the money comes all through the White House,” he said. “And if they’re going to be sending us stupid policies, I mean, communist policies… we’re not going to ruin one of our great cities.”

Trump also took a shot at Mamdani’s opponents, Andrew Cuomo and Curtis Sliwa, saying “it’s a fluke if (Mamdani) gets in” because “there are a lot of failed people that he’s running against.”

Asked about Trump’s comments, Mamdani brushed it off as nothing new — Trump is already hurting New York by trying to pull infrastructure funding in retaliation for the government shutdown.

But if Trump tries while Mamdani is mayor, he said he’d go to the courts.

“We will continue to receive funding from the federal government, and that’s not because of President Trump’s generosity. That’s because it is the law,” he said. “And just because he utters something does not make it the law.”

Hochul, meanwhile, suggested she’d appeal to Trump’s own interests if he tried.

“There’s no person who’s ever sat in the Oval Office who understands more than Donald Trump that New York City is the economic engine for the entire state,” she said. “This is detrimental to his properties, business interests, his friends in the city, and a whole way of life that perhaps he may need to come back to.“ — Jeff Coltin

CITY HALL: THE LATEST

QUEENS BOY, NOT A QUEENS COLLEGE BOY: Cuomo’s past attempts to cut state aid to the City University of New York are raising questions about his commitment to public universities in a race centered on affordability.

CUNY endured decades of declining state aid, including during the former governor’s tenure from 2011 until 2021 — a trend the state has started to reverse.

POLITICO spoke to 16 people, including city and state lawmakers, former state and CUNY officials, and students and advocates, who portrayed a record of neglect toward public higher education — a history they argued bodes poorly for the university if he becomes mayor.

Read more from POLITICO’s Madina Touré on how Cuomo treated CUNY “as the foster child he never really wanted.”

CRYPTOKEEPER: Nearly four years after converting his first paycheck to cryptocurrency, Mayor Eric Adams created the new New York City Office of Digital Assets and Blockchain on Tuesday.

A City Hall spokesperson said the announcement had nothing to do with cryptocurrency entrepreneur Brock Pierce’s massive, $1.1 million donation to a pro-Adams super PAC and his gushing compliments about the mayor, and that the insinuation they’re connected “doesn’t make sense.” In fact, the spox said, City Hall’s been planning to launch it for months.

Alex Sommer, who advises crypto clients at Tusk Strategies, welcomed the news.

“Plenty of cities are clamoring to be home to this booming industry so it makes sense for the city to stake its claim,” he said. “It’ll obviously be up to the next mayor to see this through, but elevating New York with all the attention in D.C. should be helpful.” — Jeff Coltin

NEW FROM PLANET ALBANY

DEREGULATION TIME: Hochul’s plan to review unnecessary or outdated state regulations is potentially music to the ears of her allies at The New York Business Council.

The lobby group last month issued a report that decried the regulatory environment in New York that it argued is choking private sector investment.

“We have work to do,” Business Council President Heather Mulligan said. “But this report shows that we are all willing to work together with state leaders to address these challenges and make necessary changes to enhance our business climate, quality of life, and ultimately, strengthen our economic competitiveness to improve economic opportunities for all New Yorkers.”

Last week, Hochul’s top budget adviser requested state agency and department chiefs draft up lists of regulations for potential elimination. Some of these regulations are more than a century old and concern outdated modes of transportation like steamboats.

The regulatory push is a layup for the Democratic governor, who is running for reelection next year and has tried to show voters she’s focused on issues like affordability. It will be very easy for her campaign a year from now to boast about eliminating bothersome rules and regulations — stealing a Republican-sounding talking point along the way. — Nick Reisman

A FRIEND OF THE SENATE: Christopher Friend was appointed the top budget aide to state Senate Democrats. He replaces David Friedfel, who announced plans to depart the job earlier this year.

Friend has worked for the Senate Democrats for the last six years. He’s taking over the role ahead of a potentially tough state budget season as New York officials absorb federal aid cuts and prepare to run for reelection. — Nick Reisman

KEEPING UP WITH THE DELEGATION

RYAN’S FUNDRAISING: Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan today will report raising more than $1 million across a trio of campaign committees, according to details exclusively shared with Playbook.

The swing seat Hudson Valley lawmaker’s haul includes his main campaign committee and a pair of PACs, including the group he formed this year to aid down-ballot Democrats with public service backgrounds.

Ryan’s principal campaign committee will report raising more than $800,000 in the most recent fundraising period. His cash-on-hand total stands at more than $2.2 million.

The healthy fundraising clip stands to help Ryan as he prepares to run for a third term and potentially scare off rivals in the sprawling House district. — Nick Reisman

In compliance with the law, Ruano said she applied for a T Visa, which protects survivors of crimes related to human trafficking, in February while working in Wisconsin, and her attorney requested a stay.
ICE denied the stay in March and informed her attorney that if she did not “promptly” return to El Salvador, she would be detained at a forthcoming June check-in with ICE, according to the lawsuit.
“At the first check-in, the agents told me I would be deported,” Ruano said, according to a news release from the plaintiffs in the suit.
Those protection were designed to offer a pathway to permanent status, according to legal organizations focusing on immigration.","A coalition of legal organizations and undocumented immigrants has filed suit in Los Angeles challenging an ICE policy that authorizes the “routine” jailing and deportation of noncitizen survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking, according to court papers obtained Wednesday.

The suit filed Tuesday by the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law and others contends the policy “violates the very legal protections, crafted by Congress and passed with bipartisan support, that were designed to shield vulnerable adults and children from harm.”

The plaintiffs also allege in Los Angeles federal court that ICE “routinely imprisons and deports immigrant survivors who have been formally granted the right to remain in the U.S.” and “regularly deports survivors of trafficking and other serious crimes without carrying out the required legal review to determine if they are eligible for protections that Congress specifically created to keep survivors safe from deportation.”

A message requesting comment sent to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was not immediately answered Wednesday.

According to the lawsuit, the government’s practices are harming “vulnerable survivors,” including Yessenia Ruano, who says she came to the United States from El Salvador seeking safety from human trafficking in 2011 and worked as a teacher’s aid in Milwaukee until June 2025, when she says she was forced by ICE to self-deport.

In compliance with the law, Ruano said she applied for a T Visa, which protects survivors of crimes related to human trafficking, in February while working in Wisconsin, and her attorney requested a stay. ICE denied the stay in March and informed her attorney that if she did not “promptly” return to El Salvador, she would be detained at a forthcoming June check-in with ICE, according to the lawsuit.

Ruano returned to her home country with her U.S. citizen children.

“At the first check-in, the agents told me I would be deported,” Ruano said, according to a news release from the plaintiffs in the suit. “They said that if I didn’t go on my own, they would hunt me down and find me, and that I would be separated from my daughters, detained and deported. I was in turmoil, because I also could not face being taken away from my kids and imprisoned.”

To address the fear that frequently prevents immigrant survivors from seeking help due to the threat of deportation, Congress created the U and T visa programs in 2000 through its renewal of the Violence Against Women Act and the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act.

Those protection were designed to offer a pathway to permanent status, according to legal organizations focusing on immigration. The lawsuit’s plaintiffs allege the administration of President Donald Trump “is actively denying and unlawfully dismantling these vital protections, all in the service of illegal enforcement actions that ignore the law.”",https://www.dailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/LPT-L-DOWNTOWN-PROTEST-0612-KB19.jpg?w=1024&h=475,N,,2025-10-15 23:57:13.130939

Cook County includes Chicago, which has seen a federal immigration crackdown in recent months.

Detaining residents outside courthouses has been a common tactic for federal agents, who have been stationed outside county courthouses for weeks, making arrests and drawing crowds of protesters.

The order, which was signed Tuesday night and took effect Wednesday, bars the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests inside courthouses and in parking lots, surrounding sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The US Department of Homeland Security defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

“We aren’t some medieval kingdom; there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law,” DHS said in a Wednesday statement. “Nothing in the constitution prohibits arresting a lawbreaker where you find them.”

Immigration advocates decry immigration enforcement outside courthouses

Local immigration and legal advocates, including the county’s public defender’s office, have called for an order like this, saying clients were avoiding court out of fear of being detained. The office has confirmed at least a dozen immigration arrests at or near county courthouses since the end of July, when representatives said they’ve seen US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s presence outside courthouses increase.

“I have had numerous conversations with clients who are presented with a difficult decision of either missing court and receiving an arrest warrant or coming to court and risk being arrested by ICE,” Cruz Rodriguez, an assistant public defender with the office’s immigration division, said at a news conference earlier this month.

Domestic violence advocacy organizations also signed on to a petition earlier this month calling for Cook County Circuit Chief Judge Timothy Evans to issue the order. This comes after advocates said a woman was was arrested by ICE last month while entering the domestic violence courthouse.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office, which filed the petition, said she was “gratified” by Evans’ order.

“This is a necessary and overdue action to ensure that the people of Cook County can access the courts without fear,” she said in a Wednesday statement to The Associated Press.

Evans said justice “depends on every individual’s ability to appear in court without fear or obstruction.”

“Our courthouses remain places where all people — regardless of their background or circumstance — should be able to safely and confidently participate in the judicial process,” Evans said in a statement.

ICE tactics outside courthouses seen across country

The tactic of detaining people at courthouses in the Chicago area is part of a larger jump in courthouse immigration arrests across the country. The flurry of immigration enforcement operations at courthouses has been condemned by judicial officials and legal organizations, and has drawn lawsuits from some statesand the adoption of bills seeking to block the practice.

In June, President Donald Trump’s administration sued the state of New York over a 2020 law barring federal immigration agents from making arrests at state, city and other municipal courthouses.

Statehouse Democrats vow to adopt resolutions condemning federal immigration crackdown

Opening the second day of the six-day fall legislative session in Springfield, Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch decried the federal government’s immigration squeeze and vowed that his majority Democrats would use floor time Wednesday to adopt resolutions condemning the action.

“We won’t sit back and let our democracy be taken from us,” Welch said at the Capitol, surrounded by two dozen of his caucus members

Questioned about the practical impact of resolutions, Welch said there also are discussions about legislation to restrict federal agents’ patrol statewide. He lambasted reports of ICE arrests in medical facilities and applauded Evans’ ruling prohibiting warrantless arrests near courthouses.

“If we can do something similar statewide, I’d love to get that done,” Welch said. “These should be safe spaces.”

Republicans questioned their opponents’ sincerity. Debating a resolution condemning political violence, GOP Rep. Adam Niemerg noted incendiary language from Gov. JB Pritzker — in the spring he called for “street fighters” to oppose the administration — although the governor has not espoused violence. Rep. Nicole La Ha, who said she has received death threats, accused Democrats of trying to stifle opposition.

“This is not a stand against violence,” La Ha said. “It is a tasteless tactic to punish dissent and difference of opinion.”

Illinois governor denounces tear gas use on protesters

Meanwhile, Pritzker suggested federal agents may have violated a ruling by a federal judge last week that said they could not use tear gas, pepper spray and other weapons on journalists and peaceful protesters after a coalition of news outlets and protesters sued over the actions of federal agents during protests outside a Chicago-area ICE facility. Pritzker said he expected the attorneys involved to “go back to court to make sure that is enforced against ICE”

“ICE is causing this mayhem,” he said. “They’re the ones throwing tear gas when people are peacefully protesting.”

The comments also come after Pritzker denounced Border Patrol agents for using tear gas on protesters who gathered Tuesday after a high-speed chase on a residential street on Chicago’s South Side.

A few protesters also gathered Wednesday afternoon outside an ICE facility in the west Chicago suburb of Broadview, where a fence that has been at the center of a recent lawsuit had come down.

A judge ordered ICE to remove the fence after the village of Broadview sued federal authorities for “illegally” erecting an 8-foot-tall fence outside the facility, blocking public streets and creating problems for local emergency services trying to access the area. On Monday, state legislators and Black mayors of nearby suburbs gathered outside the facility to demand the fence be removed and announce an executive order limiting protests in the area to designated zones. Trump has long targeted Black mayors in large Democratic cities, many of whom have voiced solidarity with one another in recent months amid federal interventions in their areas.

Community efforts to oppose ICE have also ramped up in the nation’s third-largest city, where neighborhood groups have assembled to monitor ICE activity and film any incidents involving federal agents in their areas.

On Tuesday, hundreds of people attended “Whistlemania” events across the city and made thousands of “whistle kits” with whistles, “Know Your Rights” flyers and instructions on how to use them to alert neighbors of when immigration enforcement agents are nearby.

An increasing number of GoFundMe pages have also been launched to pay for legal costs for community members detained by ICE, most recently a landscaper and father of three children detained earlier this month.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap25288654664026.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-15 19:02:18.839079

The conservative justices, who make up most of the bench, appear sympathetic to the case that Louisiana’s congressional map – which added a second majority-Black district after a Voting Rights Act lawsuit – violates the constitution.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a conservative, pressed Janai Nelson, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, which was defending the map, as to why section 2 was still needed.

“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time. Sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases, but they should not be indefinite and should have an endpoint. What exactly do you think that endpoint should be?” he said.

The chief justice, John Roberts, a conservative but swing vote on the court, pressed Nelson on what the proper role of race in redistricting was.

“What’s the proper size?” he said. “Is it wiggle room we’re talking about or a significant percentage?”

Neil Gorsuch, another conservative justice, appeared skeptical of the use of race in redistricting.

“One argument is often, ‘Well, once you found a section 2 violation, you’ve got a compelling interest to go ahead and discriminate on the basis of race in your remedial map,’” he said.

2. Getting rid of section 2 would be ‘catastrophic’ for Black voters, lawyers said

Nelson was asked by Justice Elena Kagan what the consequences would be if the court got rid of section 2.

“I think the results would be pretty catastrophic,” Nelson said. She went on to say that many of the Black representatives in Louisiana alone were elected from districts that exist because of the Voting Rights Act. “Any further neutering of section 2 would resurrect the 15th amendment as a mere parchment promise.”

J Benjamin Aguiñaga, the solicitor general of Louisiana, pushed back, saying: “I think there’s been a lot of sky-is-falling rhetoric from the other side in this case. I don’t know what our legislature would do if the court rules in our favor … I don’t think the sky is going to fall.” He said that Republicans would not necessarily wipe out both the majority-Black districts in Louisiana, which elected Democrats last year, because doing so could make Republican districts more competitive.

3. There was a lot of wrangling over a similar case from 2023

There was a lot of back and forth on Wednesday over Allen v Milligan, a 2023 supreme court case in which the justices said section 2 of the Voting Rights Act required Alabama to add a second majority-Black district.

Nelson told the justices that Milligan was “a nearly identical case”. At another point during the arguments, Justice Kagan pointed out that many of the arguments Louisiana and white voters challenging the map were making were ones the court had already rejected in Milligan.

The message to the rest of the justices was clear – it was an effort to remind them that siding with Louisiana in this case would essentially amount to overturning precedent set just two years ago.

“This court said that it must be particularly concerned about changing its decisions or rejecting stare decisis in cases that involve a sensitive political context like this one, that calls the court’s legitimacy into question in a unique way. My opponents here have not done the labor of showing that precedent should be overturned,” Nelson said.

Recognizing that challenge, Roberts said Milligan “took the existing precedent as a given and considered Alabama’s application of its approach to the evidence”. It was a subtle but potentially significant remark that signaled he might be open to reconsidering the precedent in Milligan.

4. Louisiana argued that race-based redistricting is unconstitutional

Aguiñaga said in his opening argument: “Race-based redistricting is fundamentally contrary to our constitution.” He added that racial stereotypes were a consequence of the practice.

“They assume, for example, that a Black voter, simply because he is Black, must think like other Black voters, share the same interests and prefer the same political candidates, and this stereotyping system has no logical endpoint.”

Edward Greim, a lawyer for white voters who challenged Louisiana’s map, told the justices: “In today’s America, voters like the appellees are still being racially stereotyped to place them into single-member districts. If it was ever acceptable under our color-blind constitution to do this, it was never intended to continue indefinitely.”

5. Justice Kavanaugh appeared interested in a proposal that would make it harder to challenge districts

Throughout the arguments, Kavanaugh repeatedly asked lawyers to address a proposal from the justice department that would reconfigure the test plaintiffs need to go through to win a section 2 lawsuit.

Part of that test requires plaintiffs to show they can draw a reasonably configured alternative district that gives the minority group a chance to elect their preferred candidate. The solicitor general’s proposal would add an additional layer to that test. It would require the challengers to show an illustrative district that also meets the political goals of mapmakers.

Such a requirement would be essentially impossible to meet, especially in the US south, where voting is often highly racially polarized, Nicholas Stephanopolous, an election law expert and professor at Harvard, wrote in a blogpost earlier this month.

“Suppose the [solicitor general]’s position were adopted and Louisiana (the home of Callais) decided to get rid of both of its congressional minority-opportunity districts in order to craft an all-Republican map. Any section 2 plaintiff would then have to prove that a reasonably configured, majority-minority district could be drawn while preserving the plan’s all-Republican delegation,” he wrote. “In all likelihood, this showing couldn’t be made because, under conditions of severely racially polarized voting, any majority-minority district would almost certainly elect a Democrat, not a Republican.”

6. Progressive voting groups said the court’s decision could cost Democrats a significant number of House seats

The supreme court is considering the case as Republicans make a nationwide push to redraw district lines to shore up their advantage in the US House ahead of the 2026 midterms. The aggressive effort is unusual and has been criticized as an anti-democratic effort to prevent GOP politicians from being held accountable to voters.

A decision striking down section 2 ahead of the midterms, depending on timing, could significantly help Republicans. It could cost Democrats about 12 seats in the House, according to a New York Times analysis. A report by two progressive voting rights groups put the number of seats at risk even higher, at 19.

“It’s enough to cement one-party control of the US House for at least a generation,” said the groups, Fair Fight Action and Black Voters Matter.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d910783b55e45eebc59aa01e96c88b8de4a903ab/271_0_4272_3420/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ce1de38af6a110926e98a2933e75196c",N,,2025-10-15 19:57:33.589724

Reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents near St. Jerome Catholic Church in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood on Oct. 12 prompted warnings of caution from its pastor, although a spokesperson for ICE denied the church was targeted, NBC Chicago reported. The news outlet reported that neighbors have resorted to forming human chains to help Catholic migrants fearful of ICE go to and leave Sunday Mass so they could worship and receive the sacraments.

In February, more than two dozen Christian and Jewish groups filed a lawsuit in federal court to challenge a Trump administration policy that rescinded long-standing restrictions on ICE agents from making arrests at what are seen as sensitive locations, including houses of worship, schools and hospitals.

The lawsuit, in which Georgetown Law's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection represented the plaintiffs, argued the new policy sparked fear of ICE raids both in their own congregations and in the populations they serve, lowering attendance at worship services and curtailing their ability to serve the less fortunate.

In April, a judge declined to grant a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs, but the lawsuit is ongoing.

In September, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops submitted an amicus brief, sometimes called a friend-of-the-court brief, to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to support the plaintiffs' argument that the changes to the policy have put their congregations in an ""untenable position.""

""They either increase the risk to their congregants of harmful enforcement action by maintaining the obligation to attend weekly services, or limit the provision of in-person religious services to their congregants in response to the imminent threat of an enforcement action, and their congregants' well-founded fears thereof,"" it said.

Asked for comment, a spokesperson directed OSV News to the text of the amicus brief.

ICE has argued that the policy changes will help them deter criminal activity. In a previous statement about the lawsuit over those changes to OSV News, Tricia McLaughlin, the Department of Homeland Security's assistant secretary for public affairs, said, ""We are protecting our schools, places of worship, and Americans who attend by preventing criminal aliens and gang members from exploiting these locations and taking safe haven there because these criminals knew law enforcement couldn't go inside under the previous Administration.""

""DHS's directive gives our law enforcement the ability to do their jobs,"" McLaughlin.

But faith groups are not the only ones who have expressed concern about the rollback. An Oct. 14 report from Axios said health care workers have raised alarm about the same policy rollback, and that ""stepped-up enforcement is interfering with care in some instances."" LAist reported federal immigration agents have interfered in care or efforts to provide medical privacy to detainees.

The sensitive locations policy is among the religious liberty concerns some Catholic immigration advocates have expressed about recent immigration enforcement policy actions.

Catholic social teaching on immigration balances three interrelated principles — the right of persons to migrate in order to sustain their lives and those of their families, the right of a country to regulate its borders and control immigration, and a nation's duty to regulate its borders with justice and mercy.

As a group, Catholics in the U.S. are deeply connected to immigrant populations and are the single largest group of Christians directly affected by the U.S. mass deportation campaign.

A joint report by the National Association of Evangelicals, the USCCB's Migration and Refugee Services, the Center for the Study of Global Christianity at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, and World Relief, found more than 10 million Christians living in the U.S. would be vulnerable to deportation under Trump administration policies implemented in 2025.

Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of deportation. The Christians most at risk of deportation are Catholics, 61% of the total.

Another 7 million Christians who are U.S. citizens live in the same household as someone at risk of deportation.

According to Pew Research Center data released in June, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%). Pew also found that eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics were either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of immigrants (22%).

The Diocese of Nashville, Tennessee, issued a reminder to the faithful in May that they are not required to attend Sunday Mass if they fear for their well-being, according to the church's own teaching and canon law.

Police in some Texas cities get a heads up before ICE raids and arrests. Austin is not one of them.

In an interview with The Texas Newsroom, Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said they are not warned ahead of time when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to conduct sweeps in city limits. Davis said this lack of communication causes confusion and threatens to create dangerous misunderstandings between local and federal law enforcement agencies.

People who witness ICE arrests have even reported them as assaults or kidnappings, she added, prompting local police to investigate what happened. Davis said APD often only finds out about raids at all because of the public attention they draw.

The Travis County Sheriff’s Office said it also doesn’t hear about impending immigration raids.

“We are not notified, but that's not unusual,” Kristen Dark, senior public information officer for the Travis County Sheriff’s Office, said in an interview. “State and federal agencies have no obligation to notify us when they're conducting operations in our jurisdiction.”

There have been several raids in the Austin area this year, including one in East Austin near a construction site that resulted in multiple arrests. Federal and state officers were involved in that raid.

Aggressive public sweeps like this have become a hallmark of the second Trump administration’s immigration enforcement policies. In some places, local law enforcement has provided support to federal agents to carry out raids. In others, ICE has accused city police of refusing to help.

Notification has been inconsistent nationwide. In June, Los Angeles police said they were not informed ahead of raids in that city. That same month, city and county law enforcement in Omaha, Nebraska, said they were notified, with deputies backing up operations with traffic enforcement.

The Texas Newsroom reached out to police departments and county sheriffs’ offices across the state to learn more about their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Their answers revealed that ICE also provides advance notice to some local agencies in the state, while keeping silent with others.

In the Houston area, the sheriff is ""frequently"" given advanced notice of large-scale immigration operations “for situation awareness,” Communications Advisor Jason Spencer said in an email. “The Harris County Sheriff’s Office is in frequent communication with our counterparts at all local, state, and federal agencies, including DPS and ICE.”

The Houston Police Department was less open in explaining its relationship with federal immigration officials.

“We do not comment about other agencies' policies,” Spokesperson Shay Awosiyan said. He declined to answer follow-up questions.

El Paso Police Spokesperson Adrian Cisneros said they have “a working partnership” with law enforcement agencies at multiple levels, including ICE, but declined to elaborate. He too said “we're not speaking on behalf of other agencies.""

Police and sheriffs’ offices in Bexar and Dallas did not respond to questions.

Some departments coordinate with ICE, which can facilitate communication. Sheriff’s officers in Hays County, for example, actively partnered on a raid earlier this year that led to the arrest of dozens of men and women.

The Tarrant County Sheriff’s Office also partners more closely with federal law enforcement than many of its peers. It is the only one of the five most populous Texas counties to pen a formal agreement, through what’s called the 287(g) program, with ICE to enhance collaboration with state and local law enforcement partners. A sheriff’s office spokesperson said all questions about this coordination should be directed to ICE.

The federal agency did not respond to questions about why some law enforcement agencies were notified about immigration actions and others are not.

The lack of notification may be due in part to a lack of cooperation. Many big city police departments in Texas and elsewhere have preferred to keep the agency at arm’s length.

In Austin, the police chief said officers are required by state law to notify ICE if a background check indicates that a suspect may be in the county without legal status. But she added officers do not typically ask a suspect's immigration status.

“Our priorities are violent crime here in this city, crime prevention,” Davis said. “It’s not about immigration.”

She said while advance notification of big ICE operations would be useful, she does not want Austin police to work more closely with the agency.

“The Hispanic population is one that does not trust law enforcement to begin with,” Davis said.

The organizations are calling for a full withdrawal of both Bill C-2 and Bill C-12, which together form the Strong Borders Act.

The groups also highlighted that the provisions in the law would worsen the toxic drug supply crisis and that the expanded deportation powers would disproportionately endanger women fleeing gender-based violence.

Karen Cocq, spokesperson for the Migrant Rights Network highlighted:

The government is trying to skirt around the overwhelming opposition to C-2 by repackaging it as something new. But C-12 leaves intact the measures to block refugee hearings, impose arbitrary retroactive one-year bars, and grant ministers mass immigration status-cancellation powers. Prime Minister Carney is showing that his government continues to be aligned with conservative Trump-like anti-migrant sentiment.

U.S. District Court Judge William E. Smith in September ruled that the Department of Homeland Security directive making enforcement of Trump’s immigration agenda a condition for receiving federal disaster relief grants was unconstitutional and harmful to states and their residents.

Yet Smith found the department has continued to attach the condition to FEMA grants as part of a “ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make” or else risk losing funding already appropriated by Congress.

“In effect, defendants have done precisely what the memorandum and order forbids,” Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, wrote in a ruling Tuesday.

R.I. federal judge strikes down Trump edict tying federal disaster aid to immigration

A filing by a coalition of 20 Democratic attorneys general that sued the department over the grant conditions in May accused the Trump administration of violating Smith’s order. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is co-leading the case, Illinois v. Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The Oct. 8 motion asking Smith to enforce the order noted that states and municipalities in late September received award letters in which FEMA “copy-pasted the contested conditions” with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.

“Plaintiff States are, as a result, still required to certify, as a condition of obtaining federal funds,” they wrote.

AGs attached letters received by emergency management agencies in California, Colorado and Illinois. The Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency has not received any letters with the immigration language as of Wednesday, spokesperson Courtney Marciano said in an interview.

Smith ordered the Department of Homeland Security to permanently stop enforcing immigration conditions against plaintiff states and that the agency must amend grant awards within seven days to remove language related to complying with federal immigration law.

A Homeland Security spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for inquiry on whether officials intend to comply with the new court order.

The Trump administration argued in an Oct. 10 court filing that it had complied with Smith’s earlier decision and was only seeking to preserve its ability to enforce the immigration-related conditions should the ruling be overturned.

“Cities and states who break the law and prevent us from arresting criminal illegal aliens should not receive federal funding,” Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Rhode Island Current Wednesday. “The Trump Administration is committed to restoring the rule of law. No lawsuit, not this one or any other, is going to stop us from doing that.”

But Smith in his ruling Tuesday said that no matter how confident the Trump administration may be of their chances of appeal, the contested conditions at the moment are unlawful.

“The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference,” Smith wrote.

Neronha commended Smith’s latest ruling against what he called “blatant overreach” by the Trump administration in ignoring the September court order.

“Whether it’s a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction, or some other enforcement, the courts are holding up,” he said in a statement. “And we will continue fighting for the American people for as long as this administration puts them in harm’s way.”

Besides Rhode Island and Illinois, other states that were part of the lawsuit were California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and Vermont.

“This is a victory for the rule of law in a country that is still a democracy,” Thompson said in the statement.

“And it is a victory for Broadview residents and businesses who depend on their municipal government to assure public safety.”

Hunt ruled that ICE violated local safety codes by restricting first responders’ access and that the fence caused irreparable harm to public safety. The gate, which is 16 feet wide, is smaller than the 20-foot requirement set by the International Fire Code adopted by the village.

For more information, please visit www.democracyforward.org About the American Immigration Council","Washington, D.C, October 15 — Today, LatinoJustice PRLDEF, the American Immigration Council, and Democracy Forward filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, demanding the release of critical records the government has unlawfully withheld about arrests at immigration courts and the dismissal of immigration cases.

Read the lawsuit filing here.

Since May 20, 2025, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the U.S Department of Homeland Security (DHS), U.S Department of Justice (DOJ) and Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), have been taking part in a coordinated effort to detain noncitizens appearing for hearings in immigration courts nationwide.

Arresting people who voluntarily show up for their immigration court dates in search of protection is a deeply problematic practice. Immigration courts are not criminal courts and are supposed to be places that guarantee fair hearings, not act as pipelines into detention. When those who show up seeking a fair day in court are instead arrested, it undermines core tenets of our democracy, discourages people from pursuing their legal rights, and inflicts serious human costs.

Additionally, ICE attorneys have been asking immigration judges to dismiss cases and shift people into expedited removal, a fast-track process with fewer due process protections and no path to permanent residence. The EOIR, the agency which runs the immigration courts, has directed immigration judges to grant these dismissals on the spot, even though this violates agency policy and long-standing practice.

Seeking to better understand how and why arrests at immigration courts are taking place, LatinoJustice and the American Immigration Council filed a total of 11 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, six with the EOIR and five with ICE on July 28 and 29, 2025. The requests seek basic information about arrests and dismissals around immigration courts, and communications between and within the agencies coordinating these activities. LatinoJustice and the Council also asked for these requests to be handled quickly through expedited processing.

Yet to date, the government has failed to provide timely and adequate responses to ten of these FOIA requests, in violation of the law. The EOIR has declared that it cannot find any guidance it issued to immigration judges about dismissing cases and courthouse arrests, even though a copy of applicable guidance has been leaked to the public. The EOIR has also refused to even search for records about the extent of its coordination with ICE, while ICE has ignored or delayed the processing of all the requests to it.

“Our FOIA requests seek to shine a light on how ICE operates in immigration courts, where families are fighting to keep their families together and for their future,” said Rex Chen, supervising counsel for Immigrant Rights at LatinoJustice PRLDEF. “Instead of transparency, they have chosen secrecy, stonewalling or have provided inadequate responses to our request. It is unacceptable to prolong this urgent matter.”

“Families’ futures are on the line. That’s why we need to better understand how these arrests at immigration courts are being carried out, and the degree to which supposedly independent and neutral agencies like the EOIR are pushing a mass deportation agenda. The public has a right to know what the EOIR and ICE are doing behind closed doors,” said Chris Opila, staff attorney for transparency at the American Immigration Council.

Read the lawsuit filing here.

“The public has a right to know when our government rewrites the rules to make mass arrests and deny people of due process — especially inside the very courtrooms meant to deliver justice,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which is separately litigating to challenge these arrests. “The administration cannot hide guidance that turns immigration courts into traps and accelerates deportations without fair hearings. We will not allow these agencies to operate in the shadows. Transparency is the first safeguard against abuse of power, and we’re in court to demand accountability.”

The lawsuit seeks to compel the four agencies to comply fully with FOIA and turn over all the documents responsive to 7 of the requests. It also demands the expedited disclosure of guidance directives and correspondence between ICE and the EOIR.

Rosa DeLauro sent out an email press release about the Hamden ICE raid.","Hamden’s mayor, town council president, and two dozen immigrant rights activists and fellow politicians gathered on Dixwell Avenue Wednesday afternoon to denounce an ICE raid that took place at a nearby car wash Wednesday morning.

Still looking for answers as to what exactly happened, the elected officials said that federal agents seized a total of eight people.

An eyewitness to the raid, meanwhile, said she saw at least 10 agents show up — some wearing masks and tactical gear — and described a man being slammed to the ground and a woman being hauled away into an unmarked van.

Hamden Mayor Lauren Garrett said at Wednesday’s press conference at the Keefe Community Center that the raid happened at the Optimo Car Wash, located at 1126 Dixwell Ave., at approximately 10:20 a.m.

She said that, as part of this raid, federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained a mother and father while their kids were in school.

“The acts from the administration and ICE are deplorable, they are disgusting, they are not what we represent in Hamden,” Garrett said. “People are living in fear because of an inhumane presidency.”

Wednesday afternoon’s presser was also attended by Hamden Legislative Council President Dominique Baez and New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker, among a host of state legislators, pastors, and immigrant rights advocates.

One of the speakers at the presser identified herself only by her first name, Rachel, and said she was at the car wash Wednesday morning when the raid took place.

She said that, while she was at the car wash, she heard “tires screeching to a halt.” When she ran to the window to see what was happening, she said she saw at least 10 ICE agents, many of whom were wearing masks and tactical gear. She heard the girl who works at the front desk scream.

She said she saw a “man who was slammed to the ground.”

When she asked the man if he was OK, Rachel said, an ICE agent “got in my face and said I would end up just like him” if she interfered. She said she saw an ICE agent haul the girl who screamed into an unmarked van.

An employee at NE Motors, which sits right next door to the car wash, told the Independent on Wednesday that she also saw the raid play out, and that she saw a bunch of people get tackled. She said that, after ICE took people away, the car wash was left open and people’s stuff were strewn about. She identified Rachel as a neighbor of the car wash, and said that Rachel and other staff helped close up the car wash after the raid.

The ICE raid was partially captured on video and posted on Instagram by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition. The video’s caption states that seven people were “confirmed” to have been detained by ICE officers around 10 a.m. on Wednesday.

Unidad Latina en Acción (ULA) organizer John Lugo went to Optimo Car Wash after hearing about the incident. He told the Independent Wednesday that he heard that ICE agents surrounded the store and seized seven people, including a ULA member. He said he was also told that a client of the car wash confronted ICE officers, who then tried to arrest her. Lugo was unsure if the client had actually been arrested.

Garrett drove to Optimo after hearing that ICE had detained people there. She said in a separate interview with the Independent that witnesses to the incident told her that seven people were taken, while the Hamden Police Department told her they heard the number was eight.

“We’re in the middle of contacting family members of those detained,” added Garrett.

Tina Colón Williams, the lawyer representing previously ICE-detained Wilbur Cross student Esdrás Zabaleta-Ramirez, learned about the incident from the family member of someone who was detained. “It’s all very sudden, and we’re still figuring out what’s going on,” said Colón Williams in an interview with the Independent. She heard either eight or nine people were seized.

Garrett convened the press conference about the incident at the Keefe Community Center in Hamden at 2:30 p.m. Roughly 30 people attended the presser.

Rev. Emily Scott from First Presbyterian Church in New Haven said that one person who was taken was a customer, and not a worker. She said that when she and the New Haven Immigrants Coalition showed up Wednesday morning, “the entire staff was gone with no trace.” Doors were locked and no one was there to talk with them.

At 2:58 p.m. Wednesday., U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro sent out an email press release about the Hamden ICE raid.

“Right now, I am focused on confirming the safety and status of those who were detained during the raid on a Hamden car wash today, as well as their family members, some of whom are school-age children,” she is quoted as saying in that press release. “The aggressive tactics used by ICE and endorsed by President Trump have escalated tensions with communities here and across the country, exacerbating fear. They are not making Americans any safer. I will continue to engage with local leaders and law enforcement to understand the basis for this raid and to ensure that the rights of these individuals and all Connecticut residents are respected.”

The immigration judges’ stance stems from a September 2025 ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals agreeing with the Trump administration’s position that detainees are not entitled to such hearings.
Despite those rulings in U.S. District Court, immigration judges continue to deny bond hearings, leading to even more federal court cases seeking injunctions.
Shortly after coming to the United States, Reyes was given notice to appear in immigration court and was released on her own recognizance.
On Oct. 1, an immigration judge denied Reyes’ request for a bond hearing.","Immigration judges are continuing to deny bond hearings for detainees in Iowa and throughout the country, despite being repeatedly overruled by federal district court judges.

Five weeks ago, immigration judges across the country formally adopted the U.S. Department of Justice’s new legal position that detainees suspected of entering the country illegally can be held in jail indefinitely without being afforded a hearing on whether they’re entitled to release on bond while their case is pending.

The immigration judges’ stance stems from a September 2025 ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals agreeing with the Trump administration’s position that detainees are not entitled to such hearings.

The board’s decision endorsing that view has upended decades of past practice in which immigration judges — who are not part of the judicial branch, and are instead part of the executive branch and the DOJ — released individuals on bond in cases where the detainees were not considered a flight risk or a danger to the public.

In the past few months, hundreds of detainees have sought relief by seeking the intervention of U.S. District Court judges, arguing that being held under such circumstances is a violation of their right to due process.

In an overwhelming number of such cases, the federal judges have sided with the detainees, ordering the immigration judges to hold bond hearings at which the detainees can argue that their history, employment, family obligations or other circumstances warrant their temporary release on bond.

Despite those rulings in U.S. District Court, immigration judges continue to deny bond hearings, leading to even more federal court cases seeking injunctions.

More Iowa detainees seek court intervention

Among the most recent Iowa cases is that of Filemon Brito Barrajas, a citizen of Mexico who says he has lived in the United States for 20 years without legal status. Court records indicate Barrajas had no criminal record until July of this year, when he was jailed on a charge of contempt of court. Immigration and Customs Enforcement then issued a detainer for him, keeping him in jail after he’d served his sentence for contempt.

On Aug. 18, 2025, Barrajas requested a bond hearing, but was denied by an immigration judge who concluded he lacked jurisdiction, echoing the DOJ’s position on the issue.

Barrajas then took the matter to U.S. District Court, challenging the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and its director, Kristi Noem, as well as U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the DOJ and the Omaha Immigration Court.

Attorneys for Barrajas argued he was entitled to a hearing on the question of bond and that, in the alternative, he should be released from custody.

On Sept. 23, U.S. District Judge Stephen Locher of the Southern District of Iowa ordered that such a hearing be scheduled by the immigration court within seven days.

“District courts across the country have addressed arguments similar to – and often identical to – the ones raised here,” Locher wrote in his decision. “The overwhelming majority of these courts have concluded that aliens in the petitioners’ situation are … entitled to bond hearings.”

Locher’s decision was similar to that of many other judges in that while he found that Barrajas was entitled to argue for his release on bond, the issue of whether bond should be granted was for the immigration court, not a U.S. District Court judge, to decide.

“It is not the court’s prerogative to assume the role of the immigration judge by deciding bond or detention,” Locher wrote.

Another recent Iowa case involves Marua Enriquez Reyes, who entered the United States, according to her lawyers, to escape some form of persecution. Shortly after coming to the United States, Reyes was given notice to appear in immigration court and was released on her own recognizance.

But on Sept. 2, 2025, while attending her regularly scheduled check-in appointment at the ICE office in Cedar Rapids, ICE officials allegedly canceled her notice to appear in immigration court, entered an order calling for her expedited removal from the country, and had her detained in the Muscatine County Jail.

On Oct. 1, an immigration judge denied Reyes’ request for a bond hearing. A week later, on Oct. 7, 2025, attorneys for Reyes sought an emergency hearing on the matter in U.S. District Court, arguing the immigration court had violated her due process rights by denying her a hearing.

On Tuesday of this week, the Department of Justice sought and obtained a continuance in the case. Judge Locher has given the DOJ until Oct. 21 to file a response in the case.

The Barrajas and Reyes cases are among at least 20 such bond-hearing cases filed recently in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Because the final decisions on bond are still made within the immigration court system, the current status or outcome of the cases is difficult — and in some cases impossible — to track.

Federal judges rule against the DOJ

Last week, federal judges in the San Francisco area ordered the release of dozens of immigrants held in California detention facilities without a bond hearing. In each case, a U.S. District Court judge had already issued a temporary restraining order or an injunction granting the temporary release of the detainees until the bond-hearing issue could be resolved.

One federal judge in San Francisco, James Donato, recently expressed frustration when a DOJ lawyer argued in court that detainees have no right to a hearing in front of an immigration judge.

“This argument has failed in every court that it’s ever been argued,” Donato told the assistant U.S. attorney. “Just give them a hearing … What’s the master plan for making sure we don’t have the same cases coming up again, and again, and again, in front of every judge in this district?”

Two weeks ago, a U.S. District Court judge in the state of Washington ruled that the Tacoma Immigration Court’s practice of denying bond hearings to detainees was unlawful. That Sept. 30 ruling was made in a class-action lawsuit filed by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project in March 2025, challenging the then-new practice of denying bond hearings even to people who have lived in the United States for decades.

Other class-action lawsuits over the same issue, as well as the hundreds of individually filed cases, are still pending in courts throughout the United States.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-2048x1367.jpeg,N,,2025-10-15 17:02:24.727456

Despite this explicit law, President Trump and Director Vought have continued to bully and target our dedicated federal workforce, including by threatening(link is external) to illegally withhold back pay after the shutdown ends. In a bipartisan letter to Director Vought, the lawmakers underscore that the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019, which was passed and signed into law during the last shutdown under President Trump, is clear that all federal employees, whether they are excepted or furloughed, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends. There are more than 30,000 federal workers that reside in Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District.

“During the 2018-2019 shutdown, we worked with President Trump to enact the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act (GEFTA) of 2019, the intent of which is clear – federal employees are entitled to retroactive pay in the event of a government shutdown. We applauded President Trump for signing this bipartisan bill into law,” the members wrote.

“The law is clear: all impacted government employees, regardless of excepted or furloughed status, are entitled to back pay after a government shutdown ends, which is consistent with the guidance currently provided by federal agencies, including the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),” the members wrote. “OPM’s shutdown guidance from September 2025 still states that furloughed federal workers will be provided back pay once the government reopens.”

The members continued, “The decision by OMB to remove critical guidance on federal employee back pay is causing unnecessary stress for the federal workforce comprised of nearly 2.2 million employees.”

“We request you immediately clarify and update the Frequently Asked Questions During a Lapse in Appropriations Document and other relevant materials to affirm that furloughed employees will receive back pay, as is required by law,” the members concluded.

These funds extend the county’s initial $3.5 million emergency package approved on March 11, which helped establish the rapid response services now facing critical demand.
The Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline documented a 500% surge in monthly call volume since its relaunch earlier this year, receiving over 1,300 calls between March and October 2025.
The board also designated $50,000 for the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office.
Unlike all three of its neighboring counties — Contra Costa, San Francisco and Santa Clara — Alameda County does not currently operate a dedicated Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.","The Alameda County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday afternoon to approve a $3.57 million emergency allocation to dramatically scale up legal services, community outreach and rapid response networks for the county’s immigrant and refugee residents.

Sourced primarily from the Measure W Essential Services Fund, the allocation includes $2.5 million designated for immigrant and refugee support and an additional $1 million for a flexible contingency pool. The funds will extend and increase contracts for three frontline community coalitions.

These funds extend the county’s initial $3.5 million emergency package approved on March 11, which helped establish the rapid response services now facing critical demand.

Spearheaded by Supervisors Nikki Fortunato Bas and Elisa Márquez, the action is a direct response to what county staff reports describe as “exponentially more attacks” and “unprecedented levels” of federal immigration enforcement.

“This is about real-time response and building an infrastructure that will continue to educate and empower our communities to withstand this escalation of threats and attacks,” Márquez said.

Under the new federal budget, Immigration and Customs Enforcement is set to receive an additional $75 billion over four years, representing a more than 300% increase in enforcement and detention capacity.

Bas said that residents demanded greater support after a recent Supreme Court ruling that allows federal ICE agents to conduct stops based on perceived ethnicity, raising concerns about heightened racial profiling. The move also follows an incident last month where federal immigration officers detained a man inside an Oakland courthouse.

“With the surge in ICE arrests again, the targeting of our immigrant communities, the community has come to us to say it is urgent that we boost our capacity,” Bas said. “This will allow us to expand the rapid response hotline into the weekends and continue defending immigrants in our legal system to ensure they have due process.”

The six-month funding extension is designed to fortify the local safety net in a county where one in three residents is foreign-born and half of all children live in a mixed-status household, according to a letter from Bas and Márquez to the board recommending adoption.

Enforcement data for what ICE refers to as the San Francisco “Area of Responsibility,” which stretches from Kern County to Hawaii, Saipan and Guam and includes Alameda County, showed that immigration arrests doubled in early 2025.

This spike disproportionately impacts working-class families, particularly nationals from Mexico, Guatemala, India, El Salvador and Honduras, according to the supervisors’ letter.

The Alameda County Immigration Legal Education Partnership’s rapid response hotline documented a 500% surge in monthly call volume since its relaunch earlier this year, receiving over 1,300 calls between March and October 2025. At Tuesday’s meeting, ACILEP said during the weekday, one staffer currently mans the phone at a time, highlighting the group’s limited capacity.

The $3.57 million will support the county’s three core partners in scaling their services:

ACILEP: The largest portion of the funding will support the expansion of the organization’s Rapid Response Hotline to operate on weekends and ensure 24/7 coverage, alongside bolstering legal services and community volunteer network coordination.

California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice: The funds will maintain removal defense capacity, offset filing fees for low-income clients and fund legal education and outreach—ensuring immigrants in removal proceedings have access to due process and legal protection.

Trabajadores Unidos Workers United: The group will use the funding to provide resources, mutual aid and community organizing opportunities to low-income immigrant workers and their families.

The board also designated $50,000 for the Alameda County Public Defender’s Office. This funding will help offset skyrocketing immigration application and litigation fees for low-income clients, such as the recent significant increase in costs for asylum applications and green cards following the passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful” budget bill.

Unlike all three of its neighboring counties — Contra Costa, San Francisco and Santa Clara — Alameda County does not currently operate a dedicated Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.

“We definitely have to do more strategic planning and develop stronger infrastructure for the long term,” Márquez said.

Alameda County Together, an ad hoc committee prioritizing equity and inclusion for residents, recommended that the county establish such an office, which would be tasked with coordinating resources, overseeing immigrant-serving programs and advising the Board on responsive policies.

County staff have been directed to return to the Board on Oct. 21 with a comprehensive coordination plan, and again on Oct. 28. The county is engaging with philanthropy, including the San Francisco Foundation’s new initiative, the Stand Together Bay Area Fund, to support these initiatives.

“It’s really important that people have a sense of belonging in this county,” Márquez said. “By us investing in these services, to acknowledge the challenges that are occurring and finding a way to mitigate that, just reaffirms our commitment to being a space and inclusive community for everyone.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/09/250903-ICETRAINING_01023_TV-KQED.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 16:04:18.678943

As of January, there were 4.5 million immigrants living in New York; 1.8 million were non-citizens and an estimated 670,000 lack documentation. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association New York Chapter, however, there are around 1,600 immigration lawyers in New York. The accessibility of legal representation for immigrant New Yorkers is severely disproportionate to the demand — an issue that extends nationwide.

New York City, however, has a much higher concentration of immigration lawyers, funding and general aid organizations compared to upstate, where many struggle to get the help they need.

“Not only is there a lack in professionals handling the cases, but it's also an issue of availability of funds,” said Syracuse immigration lawyer Jose Perez. “It all limits [a client’s] possibilities — not to mention the fact that if they speak a different language, it becomes more complicated.”

Fifty-seven workers were detained in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Cato in September. Of those 57, Hediberto Ramierz was detained and sent back to Guatemala despite his valid work permit, and pending immigration case. He says he never had an opportunity to consult his lawyer, and others detained are still without representation.

Immigration by the numbers

When President Trump entered office in January, the U.S. immigrant population was at a record high of 53.3 million, accounting for 15.8% of the population. Compared to this year, in 2011, 13% of the population were immigrants. Owing to the series of aggressive immigration initiatives this year, this high declined by 2 million. Immigrants now account for around 15.2% of the population. There are about 20,000 immigration lawyers in the U.S., according to IBIS World's 2025 industry analysis.

Jessica Maxwell is the executive director of the Workers Center of Central New York, a pro-immigrant worker group, and highlighted the organization's efforts while stressing the current difficulties within the legal sphere.

“There is a shortage of lawyers,” said Maxwell. It's hard enough to get representation and then there's this layer of tension, making it really difficult for people to find representation or communicate and effectively coordinate representation.”

Maxwell and her Syracuse-based team often refer immigrants to at least three lawyers at a time, so they “have a chance.” Immigration law all over the country lacks essential components for such catered representation — and numbers aren't the only issue.

Language barrier proves to be an issue

Language is one of the largest barriers preventing immigrants from accessing legal help. Maxwell and Perez both say immigration law reflects a pattern of systematic disadvantages for individuals who speak languages other than English.

“There is a lack of attorneys, not only in the area, but in the whole [state] of New York,” said Perez. “We have very limited attorneys that do immigration, and only a handful of attorneys that speak Spanish and do immigration.”

The general morale of immigration attorneys is at an all-time low, for many say the administration’s “violations of human rights"" neglect their legal efforts, according to Perez. Representation in immigration courts has seen a general decline. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group associated with Syracuse University, this decline highlights a 10% drop this year in representation for Arabic, Creole and Spanish speaking defendants when comparing the previous four fiscal years to 2025.

Although federal law requires the court to provide those who do not speak English with interpreters, it is not required to provide legal counsel. Success in the courtroom has proven significantly more likely with representation than without. According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants with legal counsel are nearly 11 times more likely to seek relief than those without representation. Yet, 2025 has revealed nationwide that only 38% of all immigration cases were represented.

While the current law calls for attentive legal defense, immigrants face a lack of comprehensive representation and are left to fend for themselves, Perez said.

Tai Shaw, a Vietnamese immigrant-turned-business owner and advocate living in Syracuse, says he sees the struggle daily in his clients — whom he prefers to call “neighbors.” Financial factors coincide with legal limitations. Despite the case matter, legal fees are expensive, a burden that falls hardest on immigrants.

“Financial hardship is not just for my people, but is a question for everybody, especially now with the new administration,” said Shaw, who has lived in Syracuse for 20 years.

Employment and immigration

Poverty rates among immigrants consistently lean higher than their American-born counterparts. Therefore, many immigrants rely on pro bono representation, said Maxwell. Yet, these waitlists are months or years long — an adverse trend in immigration law. Public interest law organizations are a solution for those struggling. They provide legal services for people who would otherwise lack proper representation, focusing on public good rather than profit. Yet in conservative, poorer and less populated or rural regions — areas typically heavily populated with immigrants — these resources are scarce and packed with people, according to studies done by UC Berkely.

“We have a few very excellent legal services organizations here in New York state, but they're just way over capacity,” said Maxwell. “They are unable to provide services to a lot of people, especially as we see immigration enforcement ramping up.”

Millions of immigrants choose to settle in New York, whether it be in the city’s prominent urban and poorer areas or upstate, which is primarily rural. In New York City alone, one in four New Yorkers live in poverty, according to an annual report from Robin Hood and Columbia University. Nationally, New York City is home to the largest population of immigrants, accounting for 13% of all immigrants. In upstate, Onondaga, Erie, Monroe, Albany and Oneida counties are the top five counties with the highest immigrant populations. Within these areas, Census data found high poverty and limited English proficiency are prevalent, serving as primary factors for receiving legal aid and employment.

Now that the Trump administration is actively prioritizing U.S.-born individuals, especially in the workforce, it has become increasingly difficult for both immigrants here legally and illegally to find jobs and escape poverty, advocates said.

“Our community has an extremely hard time getting jobs right now, and most don't have decent jobs,” said Shaw. “Factory workers, janitors, cleaning, assembly line. The majority of my people are working at Amazon because of the language barrier. They don't have to speak. They're just throwing boxes.”

Employment opportunity is paramount to immigrant poverty rates, further curbing accessibility to legal aid.

At a press conference concerning September’s Cato Nutrition Bar Confectioners Factory raid, acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone III warned employers across New York not to employ unauthorized workers. He emphasized the unlawful employment of immigrants takes away opportunities from Americans. Sarcone pointed to the “high unemployment” rates in upstate New York, yet county unemployment is either lower or at the state average.

Perez, and many other experts, refuted Sarcone's — and the Trump administration’s — standpoints on immigrant employment. Perez’s work boils down to the crucial point that immigrants are not taking jobs from Americans but are working the ones U.S.-born workers are not willing to.

“How many Americans are picking foods in the farms around New York?” Perez asked. “You're not going to see a single person doing that. How many Anglo people are working in the kitchens, doing the dishes, or cleaning services in the hotels? If you spend a night in the hotel, you're not going to see white people cleaning rooms. They are going to see immigrants.”

Immigrant work is an integral part of the labor market, benefiting an economy all Americans work toward, Perez says, while also providing immigrants the money it takes to stay here and continue their economic contributions.

Maxwell emphasized that employment still doesn't solve every issue. Immigration enforcement is targeting all immigrants, whether they have legal status or not, making no immigrant, despite compliance with the system, immune, Maxwell said.

“I've had at least three people this week who have valid work permits and are working be detained,” said Maxwell. “They're losing that income right when they need it the most; to rely on legal services when there's no reason to believe they should have needed a lawyer.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/UNY-Spec-EmilyKenny-JosePerez-20250909-001_1,N,,2025-10-15 16:04:01.177395

As of January, there were 4.5 million immigrants living in New York; 1.8 million were non-citizens and an estimated 670,000 lack documentation. According to the American Immigration Lawyers Association New York Chapter, however, there are around 1,600 immigration lawyers in New York. The accessibility of legal representation for immigrant New Yorkers is severely disproportionate to the demand — an issue that extends nationwide.

New York City, however, has a much higher concentration of immigration lawyers, funding and general aid organizations compared to upstate, where many struggle to get the help they need.

“Not only is there a lack in professionals handling the cases, but it's also an issue of availability of funds,” said Syracuse immigration lawyer Jose Perez. “It all limits [a client’s] possibilities — not to mention the fact that if they speak a different language, it becomes more complicated.”

Fifty-seven workers were detained in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in Cato in September. Of those 57, Hediberto Ramierz was detained and sent back to Guatemala despite his valid work permit, and pending immigration case. He says he never had an opportunity to consult his lawyer, and others detained are still without representation.

Immigration by the numbers

When President Trump entered office in January, the U.S. immigrant population was at a record high of 53.3 million, accounting for 15.8% of the population. Compared to this year, in 2011, 13% of the population were immigrants. Owing to the series of aggressive immigration initiatives this year, this high declined by 2 million. Immigrants now account for around 15.2% of the population. There are about 20,000 immigration lawyers in the U.S., according to IBIS World's 2025 industry analysis.

Jessica Maxwell is the executive director of the Workers Center of Central New York, a pro-immigrant worker group, and highlighted the organization's efforts while stressing the current difficulties within the legal sphere.

“There is a shortage of lawyers,” said Maxwell. It's hard enough to get representation and then there's this layer of tension, making it really difficult for people to find representation or communicate and effectively coordinate representation.”

Maxwell and her Syracuse-based team often refer immigrants to at least three lawyers at a time, so they “have a chance.” Immigration law all over the country lacks essential components for such catered representation — and numbers aren't the only issue.

Language barrier proves to be an issue

Language is one of the largest barriers preventing immigrants from accessing legal help. Maxwell and Perez both say immigration law reflects a pattern of systematic disadvantages for individuals who speak languages other than English.

“There is a lack of attorneys, not only in the area, but in the whole [state] of New York,” said Perez. “We have very limited attorneys that do immigration, and only a handful of attorneys that speak Spanish and do immigration.”

The general morale of immigration attorneys is at an all-time low, for many say the administration’s “violations of human rights"" neglect their legal efforts, according to Perez. Representation in immigration courts has seen a general decline. According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a research group associated with Syracuse University, this decline highlights a 10% drop this year in representation for Arabic, Creole and Spanish speaking defendants when comparing the previous four fiscal years to 2025.

Although federal law requires the court to provide those who do not speak English with interpreters, it is not required to provide legal counsel. Success in the courtroom has proven significantly more likely with representation than without. According to the American Immigration Council, immigrants with legal counsel are nearly 11 times more likely to seek relief than those without representation. Yet, 2025 has revealed nationwide that only 38% of all immigration cases were represented.

While the current law calls for attentive legal defense, immigrants face a lack of comprehensive representation and are left to fend for themselves, Perez said.

Tai Shaw, a Vietnamese immigrant-turned-business owner and advocate living in Syracuse, says he sees the struggle daily in his clients — whom he prefers to call “neighbors.” Financial factors coincide with legal limitations. Despite the case matter, legal fees are expensive, a burden that falls hardest on immigrants.

“Financial hardship is not just for my people, but is a question for everybody, especially now with the new administration,” said Shaw, who has lived in Syracuse for 20 years.

Employment and immigration

Poverty rates among immigrants consistently lean higher than their American-born counterparts. Therefore, many immigrants rely on pro bono representation, said Maxwell. Yet, these waitlists are months or years long — an adverse trend in immigration law. Public interest law organizations are a solution for those struggling. They provide legal services for people who would otherwise lack proper representation, focusing on public good rather than profit. Yet in conservative, poorer and less populated or rural regions — areas typically heavily populated with immigrants — these resources are scarce and packed with people, according to studies done by UC Berkely.

“We have a few very excellent legal services organizations here in New York state, but they're just way over capacity,” said Maxwell. “They are unable to provide services to a lot of people, especially as we see immigration enforcement ramping up.”

Millions of immigrants choose to settle in New York, whether it be in the city’s prominent urban and poorer areas or upstate, which is primarily rural. In New York City alone, one in four New Yorkers live in poverty, according to an annual report from Robin Hood and Columbia University. Nationally, New York City is home to the largest population of immigrants, accounting for 13% of all immigrants. In upstate, Onondaga, Erie, Monroe, Albany and Oneida counties are the top five counties with the highest immigrant populations. Within these areas, Census data found high poverty and limited English proficiency are prevalent, serving as primary factors for receiving legal aid and employment.

Now that the Trump administration is actively prioritizing U.S.-born individuals, especially in the workforce, it has become increasingly difficult for both immigrants here legally and illegally to find jobs and escape poverty, advocates said.

“Our community has an extremely hard time getting jobs right now, and most don't have decent jobs,” said Shaw. “Factory workers, janitors, cleaning, assembly line. The majority of my people are working at Amazon because of the language barrier. They don't have to speak. They're just throwing boxes.”

Employment opportunity is paramount to immigrant poverty rates, further curbing accessibility to legal aid.

At a press conference concerning September’s Cato Nutrition Bar Confectioners Factory raid, acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone III warned employers across New York not to employ unauthorized workers. He emphasized the unlawful employment of immigrants takes away opportunities from Americans. Sarcone pointed to the “high unemployment” rates in upstate New York, yet county unemployment is either lower or at the state average.

Perez, and many other experts, refuted Sarcone's — and the Trump administration’s — standpoints on immigrant employment. Perez’s work boils down to the crucial point that immigrants are not taking jobs from Americans but are working the ones U.S.-born workers are not willing to.

“How many Americans are picking foods in the farms around New York?” Perez asked. “You're not going to see a single person doing that. How many Anglo people are working in the kitchens, doing the dishes, or cleaning services in the hotels? If you spend a night in the hotel, you're not going to see white people cleaning rooms. They are going to see immigrants.”

Immigrant work is an integral part of the labor market, benefiting an economy all Americans work toward, Perez says, while also providing immigrants the money it takes to stay here and continue their economic contributions.

Maxwell emphasized that employment still doesn't solve every issue. Immigration enforcement is targeting all immigrants, whether they have legal status or not, making no immigrant, despite compliance with the system, immune, Maxwell said.

“I've had at least three people this week who have valid work permits and are working be detained,” said Maxwell. “They're losing that income right when they need it the most; to rely on legal services when there's no reason to believe they should have needed a lawyer.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/UNY-Spec-EmilyKenny-JosePerez-20250909-001_1,N,,2025-10-15 17:01:44.265728

The federal government is planning on making the domestic spy agency’s powers for compulsory questioning permanent, while also significantly expanding the offences covered by the rules.

Introduced in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks, the compulsory questioning powers would cover sabotage, promotion of communal violence, attacks on the defence system and serious threats to Australia’s border security.

But legislation introduced to parliament by the home affairs minister, Tony Burke, would also end so-called sunset provisions – the effective expiry dates that require parliament to reconsider the powers on a regular basis.

Under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, intelligence operatives have powers to issue a questioning warrant, requiring a person as young as 14 to give information or produce items that may assist in a serious investigation.

The powers are being temporarily extended, for 18 months, to allow parliament to consider a permanent expansion.

Asio has hardly used the powers since 2020. Just four warrants were served on three people, in counter-terror and espionage cases, in that time.

Guardian Australia revealed in July a review of the legislation was under way by parliament’s joint committee on intelligence and security.

In a joint submission, Liberty Victoria and the New South Wales and Queensland councils for civil liberties say the plan would seriously diminish the right to a fair trial and risk Asio being characterised as a secret police force, rather than an intelligence agency.

They say the laws would unfairly allow the government to force an innocent person to undergo compulsory questioning, with their answers available for use by prosecutors.

“This creates an incentive for the executive to conduct ‘fishing expeditions’ against individuals who could not otherwise be investigated under ordinary criminal procedure,” their submission said.

It noted a 2016 review by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor had recommended the powers be repealed or allowed to lapse.

The NSW Council for Civil Liberties’ president, Timothy Roberts, said the powers should be withdrawn.

“Any government interested in maintaining its identity as ‘democratic’ would not have laws with such far-reaching powers,” he said.

“It is alarming with all the recent international examples of the dangers of this type of overreach, our government has chosen not to shore up its citizens rights, and instead erode them.”

His Queensland counterpart, Michael Cope, said warnings about permanent damage to civil liberties after 9/11 were being shown to be justified.

“These are the powers of a police state. They are found in no other liberal democracy and must not be made permanent,” he said.

Asio has told the committee the questioning powers were a “unique and critical tool” for investigating threats.

The agency said the country faced “more security surprises” in the next five years than what has occurred in the past few years.

Espionage and foreign interference were at unprecedented levels, it said, while political violence represents an “elevated concern” amid growing political polarisation.

It also warned sabotage will pose an increasing challenge to authorities and could quickly escalate, and insisted powers to question minors were warranted.

“Given the increase in the prevalence of minors in Asio’s terrorism caseload – all attacks and major counter-terrorism disruptions in 2024 involved minors or young people – the numbers of minors being radicalised online, and the way minors are moving towards violence more quickly, Asio considers the retention of these powers is necessary and proportionate to the potential threat to security.”

The organisation offered a hypothetical scenario to illustrate its use of the powers, in which an Australian citizen was helping organise a people-smuggling operation offshore. In the scenario, the individual refuses to answer questions after returning to Australia, before being compelled under the laws. Their answers see a people-smuggling boat stopped before it reaches Australia.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71c0efa5ffeceff7f524094b20ac59b67c947ba4/472_0_4718_3775/master/4718.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ee6badfc2d498fe61531741a1372dbe",N,,2025-10-15 16:04:05.791642

The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates — including during President Donald Trump’s first term — but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers’ jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands.

WATCH: How the latest round of federal layoffs could impact public health

The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.

Trump administration launches wave of layoffs

Farruggia is the head of the American Federation of Government Employees local representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.

With the agency’s leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean “people are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,” Farruggia said.

After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying “the longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.”

The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump’s budget office.

In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.

Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, “I, myself, have a backup plan” in case she is fired during the shutdown, “but I know most people don’t.”

She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn’t fear a massive layoff during the shutdown.

“The one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it’s codified into law,” she said.

Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since “my bills won’t wait for me to eventually get paid.”

Shutdown drags on, and frustration grows

For some federal workers, this isn’t their first shutdown — the last one, during Trump’s first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.

The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown — a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.

Adam Pelletier, a National Labor Relations Board field examiner whose agency furloughed nearly all of its workforce on Oct. 1, going from roughly 1,100 workers to fewer than a dozen people, said he wouldn’t mind if the shutdown continued if it meant meaningful progress toward gaining health care protections for Americans across the country — a key demand by Democrats for ending the stalemate.

Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said “right now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There’s no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.”

As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can’t even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because “the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.”

Workers used as ‘political pawns’

National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union’s members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.

Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using “federal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.”

“This isn’t about one party or the other. It’s about real people,” said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.

“The correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they’re not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,” Kelley said.

Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put “people over politics.” The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.

Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to “degrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.”

Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.

“Families go without income,” Bartley said. “Morale and retention suffer. Public safety is compromised.”

It’s time to rethink what we mean by “fixing” immigration—and work toward real solutions.

In the matter of K-E-S-G-, an asylum case decided by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals on July 18, Department of Justice officials declared that a Salvadoran woman stalked and threatened by gang members could not obtain asylum based solely on the argument that her persecution was due to her gender, despite occurring in a country that, she argued, views women as property.

The decision is the latest in a 30-year battle over the legitimacy of gender-based asylum claims and closely tracks the first Trump administration’s efforts to roll back decisions and policies that recognized the unique role gender plays in many asylum cases, particularly those involving domestic abuse, sexual violence or trafficking.

According to the attorneys representing S.G., while the decision does not prevent women from making gender-based asylum claims, it will make it much more difficult to prove them. Neela Chakravartula, associate director of litigation at the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies and a co-counsel in the case, predicts that this new ruling will lead to more denials of women’s asylum claims since it “sends a strong signal to immigration judges that women’s asylum claims should not be taken seriously.”

Chakravartula said in a press briefing:

“This isn’t the first time the Trump administration has singled out women seeking asylum, and we know where this path leads. More judges denying protection to women who qualify for it. More refugees being deported to danger. Even more chaos and confusion injected into our immigration system.”

The Tahirih Justice Center’s Kursten Phelps, another co-counsel on S.G.’s case, expressed concern about the chilling effect the decision will have on many potential asylum seekers.

“This decision does not mean they are suddenly ineligible for asylum,” she noted. “But harmful rhetoric and decisions like this one are designed to deter them—and us—from even trying. We must not do their work for them. These cases are still winnable, and we owe it to survivors to keep fighting and affirm that their stories do count.”

Asylum law is complex, making it difficult to obtain asylum in the United States. You must demonstrate that you have been or will be persecuted based on a protected category, and that your own government will not or cannot help you. You must show that your persecutor intended to harm you because you are a member of the protected category. You must show that you can’t simply move to another part of your country and that your life is in danger if you return home.

If you demonstrate all these things based on the protected grounds of race, religion, nationality or political opinion, you have a shot at winning your case. If someone is persecuting you because you are a woman, however, you also must prove that you are a member of a particular social group, one sufficiently distinct and separate from the general population of women in your country that your membership in this group makes you a target for some particular form of persecution.

Some asylum claims seem straightforward—persecution by the Russian government of a political dissident is tied to political opinion, while ethnic cleansing operations are persecution on account of race—but others are more complicated. Union membership, sexual orientation, gender, whistleblowing or geography can all be part of persecution claims that don’t necessarily fit under the delineated grounds.

Gender has been controversial, driven in large part by the fact that many forms of gender-based persecution are committed by private actors rather than by the government itself, and by fears of overwhelming the asylum system if gender is accepted as the basis for persecution without more evidence to distinguish the claim.

Since the Clinton administration, efforts to fully address gender have swung back and forth in U.S. courts; most advocates have pinned their hopes on regulations that would definitively address gender as part of a rule defining a “particular social group.” Those efforts have been thwarted politically in Democratic administrations and have been completely abandoned under the Trump administration.

The board’s decision in K-E-S-G- takes on deeper significance because it doesn’t simply reject the applicant’s definition of a particular social group. It goes further, declaring that gender is never sufficient on its own to demonstrate a protected class. In classic originalist form, the board pivoted to the 1950s, declaring that it could not recognize gender as a distinct protected class because it wasn’t part of the original group of five established at the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention.

However, an analysis of the Refugee Convention and its history argues for recognizing that protected groups can change over time and custom. It’s not that gender can’t be a protected category, but that gender must be tied to certain specifics that define a woman’s status in a particular country at a particular time. Given the state of the world, this should mean that gender-based claims would not require linguistic gymnastics to establish that a woman in El Salvador is likely at risk for persecution.

An obvious example is the condition of women in Afghanistan. Under Matter of K-E-S-G-, it appears that Afghan women fleeing the Taliban may not be considered a sufficiently specific group, despite the overwhelming threat to life and freedom women face in Afghanistan today. Afghan women refugees in the U.S., many of whom are still waiting for the government to keep its promises to protect them from the Taliban through permanent U.S. residence, are keenly aware of this possibility.

“When I learned about the decision in K-E-S-G-, I thought of our clients,” said Laila Ayub, cofounder and director of Project ANAR (the Afghan Network for Advocacy and Resources), a legal services organization founded to assist Afghan refugees. “With every new announcement from this administration, they reach out to us asking if they will face deportation. It is shameful that at a time when other countries are expanding protections for displaced peoples fleeing gender-based violence and persecution, this administration is weaponizing the immigration court system to further restrict them.”",https://msmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2194932514.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 15:03:30.226800

Small rural towns are the prime target for new and expanded immigration detention sites.","This is the first of a blog series that will examine how the 2025 reconciliation act funding is fueling an inhumane immigration detention machine that threatens our basic humanitarian and democratic values. In this series, we will lay out how various federal and state actors are using the funding to attack our democracy, increase authoritarianism, expand the prison/military industrial complex, and negatively impact communities, families, and individuals.

On July 3, Republicans in Congress and President Trump elected to trade away billions of dollars for health care and anti-poverty programs to fund an unprecedented expansion of immigration enforcement, specifically in the form of detention. We are only beginning to see and feel the impacts of this tradeoff of care for cages, but reports are already rolling in.

For a clear illustration of this trade, we can look to a corner of rural Nebraska. The town of Curtis, Nebraska recently lost its rural hospital center following the 2025 reconciliation act’s enactment. The CEO of Community Hospital said in his statement about the closure that the anticipated federal funding cuts to Medicaid were a major deciding factor in closing their clinic. Community Hospital’s headquarters is located in McCook, Nebraska – about 45 minutes from Curtis. Trading away critical care for increased detention, the only investment that appears to be on the table is a new immigration detention site at the McCook Work Ethic Camp. The state of Nebraska intends to move the nearly 200 Nebraskans currently housed at the McCook facility for rehabilitative programming into other prisons, converting the facility into an immigration jail that would house up to 300 immigrants on any given day.

We all know that money talks – if it wasn’t clear to see before, this bill shows that the Trump administration and the members of Congress that voted to pass the 2025 reconciliation bill only have one goal: cruelty at any cost to deter future immigrants and push out those already here, no matter their ties to the country.

As a country, we want everyone to be healthy and have access to the care they need. We all want our kids to go to school and learn. We want everyone in this country to have the tools they need to thrive. The government had the opportunity to invest in health care, create jobs, and invest in our children’s education. But instead of using our taxpayer money to make those visions a reality, the reconciliation act slashed funding for basic safety net programs like Medicaid and anti-poverty programs and redirected more than $150 billion towards fueling Trump’s anti-immigrant agenda. Here’s a quick breakdown:

$45 billion to detain immigrant adults and families

$75 billion in enforcement and surveillance funding for border communities, including $47 billion for construction of the border wall

$32 billion for immigration agents and operations related to enforcement and deportation

$13.5 billion for state and local enforcement of federal immigration law

$1 billion to divert military resources towards border militarization

This unprecedented slush fund for detention and enforcement comes at the expense of everyone’s wellbeing and economic stability.

The decisions made in the reconciliation bill spell out a dark future for the country: Hospitals will close. Millions of Medicaid recipients will lose access to their health care. The national deficit will balloon by $3 trillion over the next 10 years.

Meanwhile, the $45 billion awarded to ICE to jail immigrants is 13 times the government’s annual budget for immigration detention, which was already at a record high. The funding allocated to detention in the reconciliation bill is a moral failure and an existential threat.

State of Detention

The alarm has been ringing for decades about the inhumane, unsanitary, and deadly conditions inside immigration detention sites. From reports of rotten food, physical abuse, and over 230 documented deaths since 2003, the U.S. immigration detention system has been plagued with crisis-level concerns for years. Years of investigation from the media, advocates, and members of Congress into sites across the country document a disturbing pattern of abuse: physical and sexual abuse, denial of medical care (including mental health care), a lack of acceptable food and water, and restricted to non-existent access to legal counsel.

The history of ICE detention is rife with abuse, but we fear things are only going to get worse. With disturbing reports from inside detention sites documenting the rise in suicide attempts and deaths from medical neglect, it is no surprise that 2025 is on track to be one of the deadliest years on record.

The Trump administration’s expansion is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before: as of publication, ICE is holding 58,766 individuals in detention – with no sign of slowing down. As the Administration continues to carry out its goal of mass enforcement, advocates and organizers predict that the situation is about to get much worse.

There have been several stark developments as the Trump administration pushes for mass expansion, including:

The Everglades Detention Camp in Ochopee, Florida has been universally condemned as a human rights disaster – yet Trump officials still consider it the blueprint for future sites.

The opening of the largest federal detention site at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas is a massive expansion in a state that hosts over 20 detention sites. The soft-sided facility (a tent-like structure not designed for housing people for long periods of time will hold at least 1,000 individuals initially, with plans to expand capacity to 5,000.

Military facilities are being converted into detention sites across the country, including Camp Atterbury-Muscatatuck in Edinburgh, Indiana; Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas; and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in Trenton, New Jersey.

An ACLU investigation revealed plans for six potential new sites in Colorado – marking a 600% increase in detention in the state.

Private prison companies, namely GEO Group and CoreCivic, currently manage sites that hold 90% of detained immigrants, meaning there is even less transparency into the conditions and less oversight into their management than government-run facilities.

Small rural towns are the prime target for new and expanded immigration detention sites. Private prison corporations and the federal government are predatory, promising economic revitalization and an influx of jobs to areas struggling with high unemployment and budget shortfalls. But in reality, these sites cause more harm in the surrounding community than good.

The Trump Administration calls H.R. 1 the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA), but the truth is that this bill is far from beautiful. It is ugly, shortsighted, and it will take generations of advocacy to undo the pain it is causing for immigrants and their families. More immigration detention means more parents ripped away from their children, economic and health instability for the families left behind, and more people placed in life-threatening situations hidden behind the walls of detention.

As time goes on, it will become even more important to have a written record that documents the scope, harm, and significance of the reconciliation act’s funding for detention. In the next few entries to this blog series, we will examine how the act’s funds impact ICE-run sites, private-run sites, state-run sites, and detention facilities at military sites. Using first-hand accounts, news reporting, and research into detention conditions, we will continue to witness the devastating impacts of reconciliation act funding.

“We have residents afraid to leave their homes, we have constituents contacting my office because their family members never came home and they don’t know if they’ve been taken by ICE or where they’ve been taken,” County Supervisor Janice Hahn said, per the AP.

“We have entire families who are destitute because their fathers or mothers have been taken from their work places and they have no way to pay their rent or put food on their table,” she added.

Migrant workers have been targeted through raids at farms, places of business and at their homes.

Supervisor Kathryn Barger was the sole person to dissent on the board, warning the declaration could harm landlords and open the county to legal challenges.

Multiple airports in Texas are refusing to play a video at their security checkpoints in which Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blames Democrats for the ongoing federal government shutdown, citing advertising policies that bar the use of political content.

Airports commonly display videos from the head of homeland security on screens at Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, but these messages are usually apolitical. This changed when Department of Homeland Security officials directed TSA to display a video that begins with Noem outlining TSA’s priorities and ends with her expressing hope that “Democrats will soon recognize the importance of opening the government.”

“Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government,” Noem says in the video. “Because of this, many of our operations are impacted and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.”

Spokespeople for Dallas Fort Worth International Airport, Dallas Love Field Airport, Corpus Christi International Airport and San Antonio International Airport told The Texas Tribune that the video is not on display at their TSA checkpoints.

Dallas Fort Worth International Airport’s decision to not display the video is consistent with its longstanding policy that prohibits political advertising, said Zachary Greiner, a spokesperson for the airport.

Dallas Love Field Airport’s advertising policy also “prohibits political or issue-oriented content,” said spokesperson Patrick Clarke. Additionally, the airport has not received the permit application required for such videos.

Corpus Christi International Airport and San Antonio International Airport are also not running the video at this time, according to statements from the airports that did not include explanations.

Jacquelyn Eckmann, a spokesperson for Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, said the airport’s checkpoints do not have the ability to display the video because they are not equipped with video monitors.

TSA is displaying the video at its security checkpoint at El Paso International Airport, said spokesperson Tammy Fonce.

The Houston Airport System did not respond to an inquiry about whether they were showing Noem’s message.

As of May 2022, TSA employed nearly 50,000 officers across the country, with more than 4,000 in Texas, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Most of these workers are required to work without pay during government shutdowns.

This has contributed to staffing shortages and flight delays across the country, including at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Monday.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Texas Tribune that the government shutdown has created challenges for TSA employees, but that security operations are largely unchanged.

“It’s unfortunate our workforce has been put in this position due to political gamesmanship,” she said.

United States, in which the Supreme Court upheld the FTC commissioners’ removal protections.
The Slow Death of Humphrey’s Executor The first question presented in Trump v. Slaughter asks whether the Court should overturn Humphrey’s Executor.
Shortly after Myers, the Supreme Court jettisoned much of Taft’s reasoning in Humphrey’s Executor.
The majority in Humphrey’s Executor affirmatively “disapproved” of Taft’s strongest statements in Myers and characterized them as nonbinding dicta.
First, Roberts has explained that Humphrey’s Executor permitted Congress to “create expert agencies led by a group of principal officers removable by the President only for good cause.” Roberts’s description of Humphrey’s Executor is much narrower than the description offered in Morrison.","For almost 140 years, removal protections have been the hallmark of independence for multimember commissions like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). By statute, the president may remove FTC commissioners only “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” President Trump did not cite any of these reasons when, in March 2025, he removed FTC commissioners Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya. Instead, he argued that the Constitution vests all executive power in the president and, therefore, the FTC’s removal protections could not constitutionally constrain his power to remove them. Trump has also removed commissioners at other independent agencies, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board and the National Labor Relations Board, in violation of statutory removal protections.

Trump’s actions directly conflict with Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, in which the Supreme Court upheld the FTC commissioners’ removal protections. By removing Slaughter and Bedoya without cause, Trump overstepped his statutory authority and violated Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, Judge Loren AliKhan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment in favor of Slaughter, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit refused to stay that decision.

The U.S. Supreme Court, however, stayed the district court’s decision, allowing Trump to remove Slaughter during the pendency of the case. Simultaneously, the Court granted certiorari on two issues: first, “Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), should be overruled,” and second, “Whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law.”

Scholars largely anticipate that the Supreme Court will narrow or overturn Humphrey’s Executor in Trump v. Slaughter, but the degree to which the Supreme Court will carve back Humphrey’s Executor remains unclear. Regardless, Slaughter will carry significant consequences for public administration.

The Slow Death of Humphrey’s Executor

The first question presented in Trump v. Slaughter asks whether the Court should overturn Humphrey’s Executor. The Constitution discusses the removal of officers only in conferring the impeachment power upon Congress. Although Article II grants the president the power to nominate principal officers of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate, nothing in the Constitution explicitly grants them the power to remove these officers. Whether the president has the power to remove subordinates and whether Congress may restrict that power remains one of the most hotly contested issues in constitutional law.

Although silent on the question of removal, Article II vests the “executive power” in “a President of the United States.” Proponents of unitary executive theory argue that the “executive power” vested by Article II necessarily includes the right to control subordinates within the executive branch. Many proponents view the power to remove subordinate officers as a residual feature of the “executive power” inherited by the president from the British Crown. Others have alternative theories about why Article II confers the removal power. Of course, opponents of unitary executive theory—and even some of its proponents—argue that the Vesting Clause confers no removal power and that Congress’s power over agency design allows for removal protections.

Those who believe the Constitution necessarily confers the removal power upon the president draw support from the Supreme Court’s decision in Myers v. United States. In that case, Chief Justice William Taft—himself once president—held that “the power of removal of executive officers was incident to the power of appointment.” His decision follows a similar logic as unitary executive theory. Presidents rely on subordinates to execute the law, and, therefore, they have the power to appoint their agents. Consequently, presidents must also have the power to remove these agents when they fail to faithfully execute the law.

In various cases before Myers, however, the Supreme Court held that Congress could restrict removal for inferior officers. In Ex Parte Hennen, the Court upheld the removal of a district court clerk but implied that statutory law could limit removal. In United States v. Perkins, the Court held that Congress may limit the removal of inferior officers when it vests their appointment in the heads of departments. The Court reasoned, “The constitutional authority in Congress to thus vest the appointment implies authority to limit, restrict, and regulate the removal by such laws as Congress may enact in relation to officers so appointed.” Taft narrowly construed these precedents in Myers, reasoning that the different appointment mechanisms for inferior officers grant Congress greater control over the removal of inferior officers.

Shortly after Myers, the Supreme Court jettisoned much of Taft’s reasoning in Humphrey’s Executor. Relying on the precedent set in Myers, President Franklin Roosevelt removed FTC Commissioner William Humphrey, who enjoyed for-cause removal protections. The majority in Humphrey’s Executor affirmatively “disapproved” of Taft’s strongest statements in Myers and characterized them as nonbinding dicta. In upholding the removal protections, the Court reasoned that the FTC “cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive”:

To the extent that it exercises any executive function—as distinguished from executive power in the constitutional sense—it does so in the discharge and effectuation of its quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, or as an agency of the legislative or judicial departments of the government.

The precise rule of Humphrey’s Executor has confused both scholars and jurists. In Morrison v. Olson, the Supreme Court more or less abandoned the quasi-judicial and quasi-legislative categories it used to justify removal protections for multimember commissions. According to the Court, “the real question is whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President’s ability to perform his constitutional duty”—not whether the official exercises “purely executive” power rather than “quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” power.

Together, Myers and Humphrey’s Executor appeared to stand for the proposition that the president possesses the power to remove principal officers by default, but Congress could expressly restrict that power in specific circumstances. The Court’s decision in Wiener v. United States complicated this rule by holding that some agencies possess implied removal protections. The petitioner—an adjudicator of the War Claims Commission—argued that his removal by the president was unlawful, even though the War Claims Act did not expressly restrict his removal. Drawing from Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court concluded that the president had no constitutional authority to remove commissioners of an adjudicatory body and that statutory silence did not implicitly confer the removal power upon the president. Wiener allowed for the possibility that officers without express removal protections, like commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enjoyed impliedremoval protections.

The Roberts Court has chipped away at Congress’s power to restrict removal and simultaneously expanded the president’s control over principal officers. In Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of removal protections for members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). Congress created the PCAOB as an entity within the SEC but limited the SEC commissioners’ ability to remove their appointees to the PCAOB. For the sake of argument, the Supreme Court assumed that the SEC commissioners also enjoyed removal protections. Chief Justice John Roberts’s majority opinion reasoned that these “double for-cause removal protections” impermissibly insulated PCAOB members from presidential oversight. The Court emphasized that Article II requires the president to remain politically accountable for executive action, and such accountability dissipates if inferior officers are insulated not once, but twice, from presidential control.

In Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Court went further by invalidating removal protections for the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The CFPB’s statute permitted the president to remove its single director only “for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.” Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Roberts concluded that such a restriction on removal was unconstitutional when applied to a single-headed agency wielding substantial executive authority. In Collins v. Yellen, the Court extended Seila Law by holding that the Federal Housing Finance Agency’s single-director structure with for-cause removal protection likewise violated Article II, reaffirming that such insulation is incompatible with presidential accountability. The Office of Legal Counsel subsequently concluded that Collins permitted the president to remove the Social Security commissioner at will.

In all three cases, Chief Justice Roberts described the precedent as recognizing only two exceptions to the president’s general removal authority: the Humphrey’s Executor exception for multimember commissions and the Perkins exception for inferior officers. First, Roberts has explained that Humphrey’s Executor permitted Congress to “create expert agencies led by a group of principal officers removable by the President only for good cause.” Roberts’s description of Humphrey’s Executor is much narrower than the description offered in Morrison. Second, Roberts has emphasized that “Congress could provide tenure protections to certain inferior officers with narrowly defined duties.” Yet Roberts declined to clarify what types of responsibilities qualify as “narrowly defined duties.”

By the beginning of Trump’s second term, many legal scholars regarded Humphrey’s Executor as effectively on life support. That perception was reinforced when the Supreme Court stayed a district court order enjoining the removal of members of the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). In an unsigned, two-page opinion in Trump v. Wilcox, the Supreme Court concluded that “the Government [was] likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power.” The majority, however, stopped short of deciding whether those agencies fell within the Humphrey’s Executor exception. Nevertheless, it felt the need to recognize a new exception for the Federal Reserve—an agency not before the Court—reasoning that the “Federal Reserve is a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.” Such an originalist-inspired carve-out would have been unnecessary if Humphrey’s Executor remained firmly intact.

The Supreme Court appears poised to overturn—or at least substantially narrow—Humphrey’s Executor. How far the Court intends to extend the president’s removal power remains uncertain, and any prediction is fraught. Roberts authored the majority opinions in Free Enterprise and Collins, adopting a characteristically incrementalist approach to changing precedent. Yet Roberts is no longer the pivotal vote in the conservative majority. Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch have openly called for overruling Humphrey’s Executor. Justice Brett Kavanaugh has expressed skepticism about the decision, though scholars debate whether he would vote to overturn it. Justice Samuel Alito, who authored Collins, has not indicated whether he would support overruling Humphrey’s Executor. Justice Amy Coney Barrett has yet to write in a case involving removal protections. The coming term will reveal whether the Court is prepared to dismantle Humphrey’s Executor outright or continue its gradual erosion.

The narrowest path forward could preserve Humphrey’s Executor while distinguishing the modern FTC on factual grounds. Today’s FTC exercises greater power than it did in 1935, raising questions about whether it exercises “substantial executive authority” rather than “quasi-judicial” or “quasi-legislative” functions. The D.C. Circuit has interpreted the Trade Commission Act as providing broader authority than originally anticipated, and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act greatly expanded the FTC’s jurisdiction over consumer protection. This incrementalist approach would preserve the core holding of Humphrey’s Executor but would require lower courts to undertake the fraught task of parsing agency functions to decide whether a given agency exercises “substantial executive authority.”

Alternatively, the Court could simply overturn Humphrey’s Executor, striking down removal protections for most multimember commissions. As suggested by its rhetoric in Trump v. Wilcox, the Court seems poised to recognize an exception for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. Effectively, the Court may preserve removal protections for entities or officers that had some sort of analog at the Founding. (Such a test, however, has its own problems with respect to the Federal Reserve.)

As discussed below, the demise of Humphrey’s Executor would be immensely consequential, but its ripple effects may prove even greater in subsequent cases. Trump has already removed members of the Senior Executive Service—who are plausibly inferior officers—raising questions about the viability of Perkins and its exception for inferior officers. Judge James Ho of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has likewise suggested that the courts should reconsider whether tenure protections for federal employees violate Article II. Taken to its extreme, Slaughter could become the catalyst for dismantling long-standing civil service protections.

Remedies in Removal Cases

The second question presented in Trump v. Slaughter concerns the appropriate remedy in cases involving the removal of a federal official. The petitioners in Perkins, Myers, and Humphrey’s Executor sought back pay. (In fact, Humphrey died during litigation.) Recently, however, commissioners and former employees have sought to enjoin their removal from office. Whether courts have the authority to provide injunctive relief to principal officers has yet to be decided.

The remedy has significant consequences for the petitioners and the administration of government. In general, most commissioners are motivated to retain the power of their positions—not their modest government salaries. Until his death, Humphrey insisted he remained an FTC commissioner and retained authority to exercise its duties. Injunctive relief provides removed officials with the remedy they truly seek and incentivizes them to bring actions aimed at enforcing statutory limitations on removal.

Without interim relief, however, removal may cause instability. Suppose the president appoints a successor who occupies the office pending the resolution of litigation. Depending on the willingness of courts to preliminarily enjoin removal, the position may flip between the removed officer and the president’s preferred appointee throughout litigation. Thus far, the Supreme Court has suggested that it would not allow courts to preliminarily enjoin removals. In Trump v. Wilcox, the majority described its stay of the district court’s injunction as “reflect[ing] our judgment that the Government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.”

In a forthcoming article, Samuel Bray develops a remedial framework for officer removal cases that helps explain why the second question in Trump v. Slaughter is so significant. He argues that the best remedy for a wrongfully removed officer is typically declaratory relief—through a declaratory judgment or quo warranto—because such judgments definitively resolve the officer’s legal entitlement to office without requiring courts to manage the executive branch directly. On interim relief, Bray emphasizes what he calls the “anti-flipping principle”: courts should minimize the instability created when control of an office toggles back and forth during litigation. To achieve that, he proposes a presumption that officers who sue immediately to contest their removal should remain in place as de facto officers pending judgment, while those who delay should not be restored through preliminary injunctions. This approach, grounded in historical equity practice and the de facto officer doctrine, seeks to deter opportunistic removals by the president while avoiding the chaos of repeated turnovers in officeholders.

The debate over remedies is not abstract—the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook illustrates the stakes. President Trump’s attempt to oust Cook without cause raised precisely the instability that Bray identifies. If the courts lacked authority to provide interim relief, Cook could have been removed, replaced, and then reinstated after months of litigation, creating “flips” in officeholders at the very heart of monetary policy. Such turnover risks undermining market confidence and the Fed’s institutional credibility. By contrast, adopting Bray’s anti-flipping principle would mean that, because Cook immediately sued to contest her removal, she should remain as a de facto officer until the litigation concludes. This approach preserves continuity in the governance of the Federal Reserve while still leaving open the possibility of judicial resolution on the merits.

In a brief, unsigned order issued on Oct. 1, the Supreme Court deferred Trump’s request for a stay in Trump v. Cook. Consequently, Cook will remain in office at least until the Supreme Court hears arguments in January 2026. The Supreme Court did not explain why it granted Trump’s request in Slaughter but denied it in Cook. Presumably, its decision relates to the fact that a majority believes that the Federal Reserve’s removal protections are constitutional, while the FTC’s protections are not. The federal government does not technically challenge the Federal Reserve’s removal protections in Trump v. Cook, but the Court will likely distinguish (at least in dicta) its decision in Slaughter from Cook based on its reasoning in Trump v. Wilcox. Nevertheless, the Court will still need to decide whether the Federal Reserve’s officers are entitled to a hearing before their removal.

Whatever the court decides in Slaughter and Cook, the Supreme Court’s answer to the remedy question should have less impact on federal civil servants. When a federal employee is unlawfully removed, the statutory framework provides both a right to challenge the action and a remedy of reinstatement with back pay. Under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, employees may appeal removals to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which has the authority to order reinstatement if the action is found unlawful. Likewise, employees found “to have been affected by an unjustified or unwarranted personnel action” must receive back pay and benefits, effectively restoring them to the status quo ante. Because Congress has specified statutory remedies for civil servants, civil servants do not need to rely on the equitable powers of the court for relief.

Implications

In all likelihood, Slaughter and Cook will reshape the relationship between the president and independent agencies. The precise implications of the decision depend on the course the Supreme Court takes.

Before discussing how Slaughter affects administration within the executive branch, it is worth examining its implications for the relationship between the president and the Supreme Court. Some commentators predict that Trump will defy a ruling by the Supreme Court. Preserving its institutional authority requires the Court to assert clearly and forcefully that the president is bound to respect its precedent.

Yet Trump has openly defied existing precedent by removing the FTC commissioner. Even if the Supreme Court ultimately intends to narrow or overturn Humphrey’s Executor, its failure to check the president’s defiance risks signaling that the Court’s precedents can be ignored until formally enforced. The Court could have sent a stronger message about the rule of law by staying the district court’s decision, reinforcing that precedent binds the executive until the Court itself says otherwise. The decision signals that precedent binds only when the Court chooses to enforce it—undermining the idea of stare decisis, which holds that courts should decide cases according to prior precedents.

Ultimately, Slaughter may have little practical effect on the president’s ability to control multimember commissions. Survey research by Neal Devins and David Lewis suggests that—contrary to popular wisdom—independent commissions are not particularly insulated from White House influence. Todd Phillips demonstrates that control over commission chairs grants the president considerable control over the day-to-day operations of these agencies. Anecdotal evidence illustrates the degree of control presidents already exercise over most independent agencies. The Federal Communications Commission promulgated net neutrality regulations during the Obama administration, only to repeal those regulations during the first Trump administration. Extending the removal power may not meaningfully improve the president’s ability to exercise control over these agencies.

That does not mean, however, that independent agencies will experience no change. The organic statutes governing many multimember commissions, including the FTC, require presidents to appoint members of both parties to the commission. Members of these commissions also serve a staggered period of a fixed number of years. Structural features such as partisan-balancing and staggered terms are rendered less effective by an unfettered removal power.

Moreover, multimember commissions have quorum rules that require the presence of a majority of commissioners to conduct business. As Todd Phillips and I argue in a forthcoming article, expansion of the removal power enables presidents to break quorums. Depriving commissions of a quorum matters most for adjudicatory commissions, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board. Parties appearing before adjudicatory commissions typically must exhaust their claims before these adjudicatory commissions before filing a claim in federal court. Without a quorum, parties’ cases go undecided, and they remain trapped in adjudicatory limbo until the president nominates and the Senate confirms a sufficient number of commissioners.

Overturning Humphrey’s Executor could also weaken administrative capacity within independent agencies. On average, these agencies employ more skilled workforces than cabinet departments, in part because their institutional structures preserve the autonomy that attracts talented professionals to federal service. These same structures may reduce politicization within independent agencies—another leading cause of retention problems. In interviews I conducted around the 2020 election, early-career federal employees frequently expressed a preference for independent agencies over cabinet departments, favoring the perceived stability of these agencies. Slaughter may erode the advantage independent agencies enjoy in the job market, undermining their ability to recruit and retain qualified employees. And if the Supreme Court ultimately extends the decision to eliminate tenure protections for all career staff, the resulting instability could drastically impair the ability of the federal government to recruit and retain qualified individuals.

Regardless of whether unitary executive theory is ultimately correct that removal protections violate Article II, these protections have been central to the administrative state for nearly 140 years. Abolishing them will reshape the administration of many federal agencies. The degree of change, however, will depend on how far the Supreme Court ultimately extends the president’s removal power—whether in Slaughter or subsequent cases.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-15 13:57:21.525053

That means building stronger regional institutions with the authority and resources to act, supporting accountability mechanisms like the African Court and the International Criminal Court, and investing in early warning systems that can prevent crises before they spiral into atrocities.","(Washington, DC) - I moved to the United States in 2012 with great reluctance. I wasn’t sure why I should uproot myself to a country thousands of miles away from my hometown. The move reminded me of a childhood I hadn’t fully embraced—growing up in faraway countries like Russia and China, making constant adjustments, encountering racism, forging and losing friendships along the way. I had promised myself I would not impose the same cycle on my children.

But the U.S. turned out to be different. It wasn’t China, and it wasn’t Russia. It was, and still is, a mosaic of cultures, languages, and nationalities unlike anywhere else. Most important, it was a country rooted in the fierce belief that people are free to speak, dissent, and live as they choose.

That bedrock principle, however, is eroding. The US is changing in ways eerily reminiscent of my home country, Burundi. In 2015, when President Pierre Nkurunziza defied the constitution to seek a third term, peaceful protesters were met with bullets, political opponents were silenced, and journalists fled. Many of those journalists found refuge in the US—at Voice of America, for instance—only to lose their livelihoods recently when the government shuttered most of VOA’s Africa department.

The dismantling of USAID has left social workers and health experts reeling, their efforts to uplift millions crushed overnight. Yes, the US has long had a complicated role abroad. I grew up hearing about its support for abusive leaders like Mobutu in what was then Zaire and its meddling in countries’ internal affairs in the name of fighting communism.

But those contradictions always existed alongside a powerful counterforce: freedom in journalism and academia, and activism that relentlessly exposed America’s own wrongs. Writers like Alfred McCoy and critics like Noam Chomsky built careers by holding the U.S. government accountable—something unthinkable in today’s Burundi, Moscow or Beijing.

That commitment to truth and liberty was precisely why, when Burundian security forces fired live bullets into protesters, students instinctively ran to the US embassy—not the Russian or Chinese one. For decades, US soft power was rooted in the promise of human rights and democracy.

Today, that promise is faltering. The forced deportations of immigrants without due process, violent crackdowns against protesters in Los Angeles, ICE raids, and the deployment of military forces in Washington, D.C. are chilling reminders of the authoritarian playbook.

For those of us who have lived through repression, these are unmistakable warning signs. Dictatorships do not emerge overnight; they take root when fear replaces voice, when courts surrender independence, when social movements fracture. Above all, they thrive on apathy and isolation.

Defending human rights and democratic principles is never easy—as my organization, Human Rights Watch, knows too well. But it is the only way to safeguard the dignity of the vulnerable and the cohesion of our shared humanity. So if Washington retreats from that responsibility, who will step up?

The answer lies, in part, with African governments. This is the moment for the continent to claim leadership, to strengthen multilateralism, and to shape a global order rooted not in interventionism, self-centeredness but in Ubuntu — a vision of shared humanity, community, and interdependence. Many Africans applauded when South Africa took Israel to the International Court of Justice saying Israel violated the Genocide Convention in Gaza. That same courage is needed in Sudan, eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Sahel, where civilians face atrocities while the U.S. limits itself to mineral deals or silence.

“African solutions to African problems” cannot remain a slogan. It needs to become a policy agenda with concrete commitments. That means building stronger regional institutions with the authority and resources to act, supporting accountability mechanisms like the African Court and the International Criminal Court, and investing in early warning systems that can prevent crises before they spiral into atrocities.

It means protecting independent media and civil society so that governments are held accountable at home as well as abroad. And it means engaging at the United Nations and other multilateral forums not just as individual states but as coordinated blocks capable of shaping outcomes.

The US retreat is not simply a void; it is a test. If African leaders want to claim greater influence in the global order, they need to demonstrate it through pragmatic policies that protect civilians, strengthen the rule of law, and prioritize human dignity over mineral contracts and short-term business deals. This is less about replacing America and more about safeguarding Africa’s future on its own terms.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-15 13:57:18.012206

“Lawyers and courts are pushing back and upholding the rule of law,” Beasley said, noting why she is encouraged during a challenging moment for democracy.","The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution promises protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, yet its application differs sharply between criminal and civil proceedings.

Those distinctions can determine who has access to legal counsel, when warrants are required, and what remedies exist when rights are violated.

That complex divide was the focus of a panel discussion hosted by We The People: Elon Law’s Constitutional Law Journal on Oct. 7, 2025. “Unlawful or Unprotected? 4th Amendment Rights in Criminal vs. Immigration Detention” attracted a standing-room-only crowd to Room 204 at Elon Law’s downtown Greensboro campus, with discussion and response to audience questions lasting more than an hour and a half.

Panelists Cheri Beasley, Sandra Day O’Connor Professor at Elon Law and former chief justice of the N.C. Supreme Court, Erin Fitzgerald, assistant professor of law and a former prosecutor, and Jeremy McKinney, a renowned immigration attorney, explored variability in Constitutional protections and how those safeguards operate in practice. Their discussion was moderated by Professor of Law David Levine.

“Courts are grappling in real time with evolving issues,” Beasley said, noting a trend of brief orders and rulings from higher courts clouding how lower courts should respond. “Appellate courts sometimes use brief or per curiam dispositions. When major questions are resolved on abbreviated orders, the U.S. Supreme Court’s so-called ‘shadow docket,’ the lack of reasoning can disserve the public and the bar” through lack of legal guidance.

Fitzgerald explained that searches and arrests generally require a warrant supported by probable cause, except in limited, well-defined circumstances such as emergencies or brief investigative stops. Lesser encounters — like brief detentions or frisks — require only reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot.

“In the simplest terms, the Fourth Amendment protects people and their ‘persons, houses, papers, and effects’ from unreasonable governmental searches and seizures,” Fitzgerald says. “We care because we all have boundaries — our phones, cars, homes. … Knowing these standards is how we protect our rights.”

McKinney described how the same standards don’t necessarily apply in immigration matters, where proceedings are considered civil. People questioned or detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have a right to remain silent, may refuse entry to their homes without a judicial warrant, and can ask to speak with an attorney — but those rights are grounded in statute, not constitutional law. Because immigration cases are civil, the exclusionary rule that suppresses illegally obtained evidence in criminal court rarely applies.

Beasley expanded on the practical challenges this creates for courts and communities, noting that individuals are sometimes held in local jails at federal request and that many detention centers are privately operated, complicating oversight and access to due process.

“Detention usually implies criminal punishment, but immigration detention is labeled civil, and that fluidity raises due process concerns: Who may be held, where, under what conditions, and with what rights?” Beasley said. Despite these complexities, she said, lawyers and judges play a crucial role in upholding fairness, transparency, and public confidence in the legal system.

McKinney detailed a recent case where an immigrant was mistaken for someone on a watch list with the same name. He was detained and interrogated without a judicial warrant and held at a facility in Georgia, though McKinney said it was clear his client wasn’t the individual the government was looking for. The client posted bond, but ICE invoked an “automatic stay.” McKinney freed his client through a writ of habeus corpus — challenging the lawfulness of government detention — but hiring an attorney to take that step is cost prohibitive for many.

He cautioned that knowing your rights may not matter as much in the current climate if those “feel ignored on the ground.”

“The government can’t have it both ways — calling people ‘criminals’ while denying criminal-procedure protections in what it labels as civil proceedings,” McKinney said.

Panelists closed by urging future lawyers to understand these boundaries, help clients know their rights, and uphold justice in every setting — criminal, civil or otherwise.

“Lawyers and courts are pushing back and upholding the rule of law,” Beasley said, noting why she is encouraged during a challenging moment for democracy. “The pendulum swings, but advocacy, teaching and judging move the needle. To our students: It’s a good time to be a lawyer. Your work changes lives and strengthens institutions.”",https://eloncdn.blob.core.windows.net/eu3/sites/74/2025/10/10_07_25_We-the-People-4th-Amendment-001-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 15:03:12.532119

The court also rejected an appeal by several Colorado parents, who contend that a school district in that state violated their constitutional rights when they excluded them from discussions of their children’s gender identity.

The announcements came as part of a list of orders released by the Supreme Court from the justices’ private conference on Oct. 10. The court granted one new case, Hunter v. United States, from that conference on Friday afternoon; Tuesday’s order list did not add any additional cases to its oral argument calendar for the 2025-26 term.

Kelsey Dallas has more on the Alex Jones case in an earlier post for SCOTUSblog.

In Lee v. Poudre School District R-1, the justices declined to weigh in on a lawsuit against a Colorado school district by parents who allege that the district violated their constitutional rights by interfering with their parental decision making. Specifically, the parents contended that the school district’s policies “exclude parents from the conversation of their child’s gender identity by, inter alia, actively discouraging disclosure of such information by school officials” and “sowing doubt in the minds of students regarding the trustworthiness of their parents” – by, for example, telling students not to tell their parents what they discuss at an after-school group that addresses gender and sexuality, and by directing school staff to use a student’s preferred name and pronouns with the child, but the child’s birth name and pronouns with the parents. “This secrecy and concealment toward parents whose children discuss topics related to gender identity at school creates division within the parent-child relationship and undermines the trust essential to a family’s foundation,” the parents said.

A federal district court ruled for the school district, concluding that the parents had not shown that the school district had an official policy that caused the parents’ alleged injury. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision.

On Monday, the court denied the parents’ petition for review. Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, penned a statement regarding the decision to deny review. Alito wrote that he agreed with the court’s decision because the parents had not challenged “the ground for the ruling below.” “But I remain concerned,” Alito added, “that some federal courts are ‘tempt[ed]’ to avoid confronting a ‘particularly contentious constitutional questio[n]’: whether a school district violates parents’ fundamental rights ‘when, without parental knowledge or consent, it encourages a student to transition to a new gender or assists in that process.’” “The troubling—and tragic—allegations in this case underscore the ‘great and growing national importance’ of the question that these parent petitioners present,’” he concluded.

The justices denied review without comment in Doe v. Grindr, in which the court had been asked to weigh in on the scope of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which gives websites and online platforms immunity from lawsuits arising from content posted by their users, and for their moderation of content.

The question comes to the court in a lawsuit brought against Grindr, a dating app that is popular with bisexual and gay men, by an anonymous plaintiff, known only as John Doe. Doe contends that when he was 15, Grindr offered him a membership and recommended him to adults for sex, and that he was then raped by four adults over four days.

A federal court in California dismissed Doe’s case. U.S. District Judge Otis Wright acknowledged that the facts of Doe’s case were “indisputably alarming and tragic,” but he concluded that they were barred by Section 230. Although Doe “seeks to hold Grindr liable for the design, development, and sale of a defective product,” Wright wrote, in fact “Doe’s claims seek to hold Grindr liable based on its publishing of user content.”

When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld that ruling, Doe came to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to take up his case. “This abdication of responsibility by platforms is exactly what Congress enacted Section 230 to prevent, yet it has turned into a license to unleash harm in the name of profit,” he argued.

In Humphreys v. Emmons, the justices denied review in a death penalty case based on a murder and robbery in which a juror told the court before the trial began that she had been the victim of an attempted rape and robbery but swore that she could nonetheless be a fair juror. While the jury was deliberating whether to impose the death penalty, however, she told the other jurors that she had been assaulted while naked in her bed, and jurors later reported that she “had her mind made up from day one” of the trial. Jury deliberations eventually “almost completely broke down,” and the jury eventually returned a death sentence.

Although testimony and affidavits about the juror’s conduct later came to light, Georgia law generally bars the use of testimony by jurors to undermine a verdict. When the defendant raised the issue in an effort to overturn his sentence, the federal courts rejected his claim under federal post-conviction law, and the Supreme Court denied review.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, dissented from the denial of review. In Sotomayor’s view, the Supreme Court should have sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit for it to clarify the grounds for its decision. “In a capital case with a potentially meritorious juror-misconduct claim,” she wrote, “mere confusion about a lower court’s reasoning does not justify closing the door to relief altogether.” “Tragically,” she continued, “the Court denies review instead, allowing a death sentence tainted by a single juror’s extraordinary misconduct to stand.”

In Thomas v. Humboldt County, California, the court rebuffed an appeal from California property owners who challenged the county’s failure to provide them with a jury trial before imposing fines for alleged violations of county codes relating to growing cannabis – even though, the property owners say, none of them actually ever grew cannabis. The lower courts dismissed their claim under the Seventh Amendment to the Constitution, citing the Supreme Court’s 1916 ruling in Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Co. v. Bombolis, holding that the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial does not apply to the states. The property owners then came to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to take up their case.

Gorsuch wrote a statement regarding the denial of review in which he agreed with the court’s decision to turn down Thomas’ appeal, noting that the case was not a suitable one in which to decide whether to overrule Bombolis. “At the same time,” Gorsuch added, “I do not doubt that Bombolis warrants a second look.” He urged the justices to take up the question soon.

The justices called for the views of the U.S. solicitor general in two cases: Renteria v. New Mexico Office of the Superintendent of Insurance, involving New Mexico’s decision to bar organizations claiming an exemption under the Affordable Care Act from operating within the state; and Highland Capital Management v. Nexpoint Advisors, involving bankruptcy protections for nondebtors. There is no deadline for the solicitor general to file his response.

The justices did not act on Does 1-2 v. Hochul, a challenge to New York’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for health care workers that has since been repealed. The justices will meet for another private conference on Friday, Oct. 17.

In a statement sent to OSV News Oct. 14, Cardinal Blase J. Cupich of Chicago said keeping the country safe and being mindful of human dignity ""are not mutually exclusive.""

""In fact, one cannot exist without the other,"" he said.

The cardinal decried what he called ""unnecessarily aggressive tactics"" of federal agents whom he said have overreached in their task of apprehending people, ""and which seem to be intended to terrorize and cause chaos, rather than fulfilling the noble calling of law enforcement."" He said law enforcement should not be put in this position.

""Not only do they risk violating the dignity of others but such activity is beneath their own dignity,"" Cardinal Cupich said.

Local media reported that residents in Rogers Park, a Northside neighborhood surrounding St. Jerome Church, took action to protect Catholic parishioners' ability to enter and leave the church for Sunday Mass Oct. 12, forming a human chain, after learning of the presence of alleged federal immigration agents outside St. Jerome during the 8 a.m. Mass in Spanish.

Video footage from a Spanish-language news outlet Telemundo Chicago showed a priest warning Mass-goers to be very careful leaving the church. Various news outlets showed the church's outdoor signage had its Mass times covered.

A day earlier, federal agents did not allow priests, who led a Eucharistic procession in Chicago’s near-western suburbs to an immigration processing facility in Broadview, to give holy Communion to Catholics detained there. When they arrived and told Illinois state troopers their plan, the troopers checked with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, who said they could not give it to detainees.

Priests told various local media they had told ICE days in advance about the Eucharistic procession and distribution of holy Communion planned for Oct. 11.

The priests instead gave the Eucharist, which Catholics hold to be Jesus Christ in his body, blood, soul and divinity, to the 1,000 faithful who joined the procession. Afterward, all left the area.

Across the U.S., Christians account for approximately 80% of all of those at risk of Trump's mass deportation effort, with the single largest group of affected Christians being Catholics, according to a joint Catholic-Evangelical report published by World Relief. The report found one in six Catholics (18%) are either vulnerable to deportation or live with someone who is.

According to Pew Research Center data released in June, more than four out of 10 Catholics in the U.S. are immigrants (29%) or the children of immigrants (14%); eight out of 10 Hispanic Catholics are either born outside the U.S. (58%) or are the children of immigrants (22%).

The Broadview processing center has been a flashpoint for chaotic protests of the Trump administration's ""Operation Midway Blitz"" against immigrants in the Chicago area who lack legal authorization to live in the U.S. Tense confrontations between protestors and ICE agents have taken place at the ICE holding facility in Broadview, just 12.5 miles west of downtown Chicago, since mid-September.

On Oct. 9, U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis placed a temporary restraining order on federal agents' use of tear gas, pepper spray and deterrents against the protesters.

A Chicago-area Dominican priest, who attended the hearing, expressed relief for the two-week reprieve, calling it ""an absolutely courageous move by a federal judge.""

Dominican Father Brendan Curran, promoter of peace and justice for his order in the U.S. and Canada, told OSV News he is speaking as a witness in the case's next court hearing.

""I have witnessed people abusing the law as federal agents, hitting people -- tear gas is dropped right around me, out at Broadview, out at Pershing and Kedzie. It dropped right in front of my car,"" Father Curran said.

Multiple Chicago-area, Illinois state media groups and a national media union, as well as a Presbyterian pastor and other individuals, lodged a freedom of speech complaint Oct. 6 against the Trump administration after the plaintiffs reported multiple incidents of getting hit by various riot deterrents used by armed ICE officers during the protests.

Among the videos to be submitted to the court is one showing Presbyterian Pastor David Black being struck on the side of the head in a shower of pepper balls fired from federal agents standing atop the Broadview facility's roof Sept. 19.

The First Presbyterian Church of Chicago pastor said in an Instagram post that went viral Oct. 8 that he told ICE agents moments before being struck that ""there was still time to repent, believe the Good News, and turn from their wicked ways.""

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a lengthy post on X that the same video showed ""agitators were blocking an ICE vehicle from leaving the federal facility -- impeding operations."" She said these actions put people at risk.

""If you are obstructing law enforcement you can expect to be met with force,"" she said.

Homeland Security has claimed that, as of Oct. 9, ICE agents have experienced a 1,000% increase in assaults against them, as well as doxxing (publishing private information online) and threats to their families online. DHS also reported Oct. 3 more than 1,000 arrests of immigrants it said lacked authorization to live and work in the U.S. in Illinois.

However, Amanda Tovar said her video supplemented footage of this incident by showing what took place from a different angle, showing two out of three masked agents, both wearing camouflage, firing down in Pastor Black's direction from their rooftop position.

Tovar, a special education teacher from nearby Forest Park, told OSV News her footage ""clearly shows"" the pastor was unarmed, ""not being threatening"" and the agents were not under attack.

Tovar said she herself was injured when she was struck by a ""flash-bang"" grenade (designed to disorient with its bright flash and sparks) on the chest ""near the heart"" later that day. She said she was hit with multiple pepper balls in the ""really chaotic scene.""

""So I really got injured in that and I still have bruising ... even from weeks ago. That's how bad it was,"" said Tovar.

At Pershing Road and Kedzie Avenue, an intersection inside an area that has become a hotspot for ICE arrests in Chicago, a federal agent fired multiple shots Oct. 4 that injured a woman, Marimar Martinez who was treated for gunshot wounds and released. DHS claimed that Martinez deliberately rammed a Customs and Border Patrol vehicle; her attorney told the judge he had body-camera footage from an agent showing a CBP officer got out of the government vehicle and yelled, ""Do something (expletive),"" before shooting Martinez multiple times.

Father Curran told OSV News he got caught in the protest following the shooting on his way to his rectory after celebrating Mass elsewhere. The priest said he wanted to help cool things down, but the ICE agents ""did not look like they wanted me around."" Given that, and the tear gas in the air, the priest said he did not get out of his car.

Father Curran is part of a prayer group that has gone to the Broadview facility every Friday morning for more than 18 years. He said the prayer vigils had been peaceful and without incident all those years -- but recently he had to stop taking student groups there, because it had become dangerous. Father Curran said the behavior he saw in September from federal agents was ""just dreadful.""

Father Curran described ""intimidation, pushing people, hurling these things off the building.""

""There's snipers on both corners of the building,"" he said.

Father Curran said he hoped Judge Ellis' order would mean ""there is someone supervising this kind of abusive action that has been out of control for a month.""

Margie Rudnik, a Lay Sister of Mercy from the nearby River Forest suburb, who coordinates a weekly rosary for detained migrants, told OSV News that their prayer group that arrives at about 7:15 a.m. near the Broadview facility every Friday morning to pray, is not as affected by the chaos that has ensued at the protests. Rupdnik said for safety, they have purposely moved to a far corner about a block away.

""Before ... we could kind of see between the fencing, the detainees being loaded into the vans,"" she told OSV News. ""And then as the vans drove away, we would hold up our rosaries. And we have a picture and a flag of Our Lady of Guadalupe ,and we would hold those up in the hopes that the people on the buses would understand that we were praying for them. But now we've not been able to do any of that.""

Rudnik said she has not ""seen a van"" in weeks and she said she believes the detainees are likely moved very early in the morning.

She and Father Curran said the foremost prayer is for meaningful immigration reform.

But Father Curran also said his presence at the prayer site is also as a representative for Catholics whose community is ""absolutely terrorized"" -- to the point that religious education has been suspended, people do not go to church, nor leave home, even for food.

""This is real,"" he said.

Hours after the announcement, immigration attorney Eric Lee, a co-founder of the Consular Accountability Project, wrote on social media that the legal defense organization would represent anyone whose visa was denied or revoked over “Charlie Kirk-related speech” pro bono.

Lee has previously defended foreign students and activists whose visas were revoked for political speech. He’s challenged the Trump administration’s visa restrictions targeting pro-Palestinian protesters across university campuses.

Kirk was a prominent political voice in the conservative movement. He founded Turning Point USA, a group that mobilized young voters around right-wing causes and became a key player in President Donald Trump’s political movement.

He played a critical role in Trump’s reelection by bolstering his appeal to younger voters.

Sutro Professor of Law at the Santa Clara University School of Law and a faculty scholar with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. Views are his own.

In Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D., decided in June 2025, the Supreme Court gave a green light to the Trump Administration to continue its practice of “third country removals.” In a powerful dissent, Justice Sotomayor argued that the Court effectively authorized the president to deport non-citizens to countries where they are likely to be tortured.

The United States is a party to the Convention Against Torture, a multilateral treaty. Under Article 3, the United States has a binding international legal obligation not to deport “a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.” That legal obligation is also a moral obligation: it would be morally reprehensible for our government, or any government, to send an individual to a country where that person is likely to be tortured. The Court’s decision in D.V.D. raises the question whether the United States is violating both international law and fundamental ethical norms.

To evaluate that question, let’s begin with some background on federal statutes governing “removal” of non-citizens. If the government wants to expel a non-citizen from the United States, it must first obtain a “removal order” from a federal judge that authorizes the government to remove that person from U.S. territory. As a general rule, non-citizens arrested upon entry into the United States must be returned to the country from which they came. Most other non-citizens who are subject to removal orders are entitled to designate a country of their choice. If neither of the above options is practicable, federal statutes specify that the government must send the individual either to his country of citizenship or to his former country of residence.

In very unusual circumstances–where none of these options is feasible–federal statutes authorize “third country removal,” meaning that the U.S. government may send that person to any country where the government will accept him. However, federal law allows third country removal only after the government has tried all of the alternatives listed in the previous paragraph and determined that they are “impracticable, inadvisable, or impossible.”

Assume that the government intends to send Jane Doe to country X. Federal law grants Ms. Doe a right to object on the grounds that removal to country X would violate U.S. obligations under Article 3 of the Torture Convention. Federal law also grants Jane Doe a right to have her objection heard by an impartial judge before the government sends her to country X. That procedural right—the opportunity to be heard—is constitutionally protected by the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause. Moreover, I contend, in cases where Jane Doe fears that she may be tortured in country X, the opportunity to be heard is both a moral and a legal entitlement.

The Trump Administration’s policy, as articulated in internal guidance documents issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security, boils down to this. Individuals like Jane Doe have a procedural right to raise a defense to removal under Article 3 of the Torture Convention once, but not more than once. For example, assume that the government intends to send Jane Doe to Guatemala. Ms. Doe objects that removal to Guatemala would violate Article 3 because she is likely to be tortured there. An immigration judge agrees with her and issues an order barring removal to Guatemala. At that point, according to the Trump Administration’s policy guidance, Jane Doe has effectively exhausted her only opportunity to be heard on a Torture Convention claim. If the government then designates South Sudan, for example, as the destination for third country removal, Jane Doe no longer has a procedural right to raise a Torture Convention defense because she already used that right to avoid removal to Guatemala. (Technically, the bar to raising a Torture Convention defense applies only if the government has obtained “credible assurances” from South Sudan that individuals sent there will not be tortured. However, according to the Trump Administration, the executive branch has unilateral authority to determine whether assurances are “credible,” and courts cannot second-guess such determinations.)

The petitioners in D.V.D. included a Guatemalan man who was deported to Mexico, and six individuals who were sent to South Sudan—all under the third-country removal policy described above. Various news reports suggest that the Trump Administration has obtained diplomatic assurances, which it deems “credible,” allowing for third country removals to Uganda, Rwanda, Eswatini, and South Sudan. The government has reportedly considered both Uganda and Eswatini as potential destination countries for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man whom the Trump Administration wrongfully deported to El Salvador earlier this year, despite a court order prohibiting his removal to El Salvador.

Freedom House publishes an annual report that rates the level of freedom for every country in the world on a scale from zero to 100. 100 is the best possible score. In the most recent Freedom House report, Uganda scored 34, Rwanda scored 21, Eswatini scored 17, and South Sudan scored a whopping 1 out of 100. All four countries are rated “not free.” Given the terrible human rights records of all four countries, diplomatic assurances from those countries—that is, promises not to commit acts of torture—are not worth the paper they are written on. Although the Trump Administration claims that diplomatic assurances from those countries are “credible,” that claim itself is not credible.

What we know:

The airport sent the following statement to FOX 5 Atlanta:

""Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport strives to maintain a neutral and welcoming environment for all travelers. In keeping with federal and local airport policies, we will not display the recently-distributed video from DHS on airport controlled media.""

What they're saying:

""She might argue that she's trying to couch this in policy and so therefore, she's just pointing the blame where she sees that it lies, but I think other people could interpret this as being excessively partisan,"" Gillespie said.

Secretary Kristi Noem TSA video about shutdown

The backstory:

The video, first obtained by FOX News last week, was intended to be shown at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints where employees have continued working without pay on the 14th day of the shutdown.

In the message, Noem reportedly says, ""It is TSA’s top priority to make sure that you have the most pleasant and efficient airport experience possible while we keep you safe.""

She goes on to add, ""However, Democrats in Congress refuse to fund the federal government, and because of this, many of our operations are impacted, and most of our TSA employees are working without pay.""

Backlash towards shutdown TSA video

What they're saying:

Airport officials across the country have cited multiple reasons for refusing to play the video — from concerns about its ""political content"" to potential violations of federal law, specifically the Hatch Act, a 1939 statute designed to prevent federal employees from using their positions to influence elections or how government programs are administered.

While TSA checkpoints often display informational videos featuring government officials welcoming travelers or explaining security procedures, they typically avoid any content with political overtones.

According to CNN, airports that have declined to play the video due to its political nature include Seattle-Tacoma International, Phoenix Sky Harbor, Harry Reid International in Las Vegas, and Portland International. The Washington Post reports that airports in Buffalo, Charlotte, Cleveland, and Los Angeles also have no plans to show the video.

Since the federal government shut down on Oct. 1, the TSA has warned travelers to expect delays as staffing shortages and unpaid workdays begin to take their toll. Air traffic controllers are also continuing to work without pay, creating additional strain and financial uncertainty for critical aviation workers.

The shutdown’s impact on the aviation system is growing.

The map remained in effect for last year’s elections, but the Supreme Court’s decision could cause a major shake-up for future terms.","The Supreme Court leaned toward restricting the use of race in redistricting during high-stakes oral arguments Wednesday over Louisiana’s congressional map that could curtail a central provision of the Voting Rights Act.

Across more than two hours of arguments, the conservative majority raised alarm that states like Louisiana are going too far in intentionally drawing additional majority-minority districts to comply with the landmark 1965 law to the point where it’s unconstitutional.

It’s a premise that poses major implications for electoral maps not just in Louisiana, but nationwide.

It remains to be seen just how broadly the court will rule, but several conservative justices questioned if the court’s voting rights precedents need to be modified or even overruled outright.

“This court’s cases in a variety of contexts have said that race-based remedies are permissible for a period of time. Sometimes for a long period of time, decades in some cases,” said Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s second appointee to the court.

“But that they should not be indefinite and should have an end point,” he pressed.

The justices are weighing whether race-based redistricting under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act complies with the 14th and 15th amendments, which were ratified after the Civil War to provide equal protection under the law and prohibit intentional racial discrimination in voting.

Louisiana’s Republican-controlled legislature begrudgingly added a second majority-Black congressional district after the courts ruled a design with only one likely violated Section 2.

Last term, Louisiana defended its new map before the high court. But after the justices raised the stakes and set the case for a rare reargument, Louisiana abandoned defending its design.

Louisiana Solicitor General Ben Aguiñaga told the justices that the state fought “tooth and nail” during the earlier litigation to convince the courts that the Constitution would not permit a second majority-Black district, suggesting the current map would “never” have been passed if it succeeded.

“We never wanted to be here in the first place,” Aguiñaga said. “They have placed states in impossible situations where the only sure demand is more racial discrimination for more decades.

“But I think if anything is clear in this court’s dedication to eliminating all racial discrimination, it is that the Constitution does not tolerate this system of government-mandated racial balancing,” he continued.

The reargument has thrown into question the court’s decades-old voting precedents that have empowered minority groups to challenge maps across the country and force states to draw more majority-minority districts under Section 2.

Louisiana urged the court Wednesday to have zero tolerance for any consideration of race in redistricting. The state’s flip now puts it on the same side of the case as the Trump administration, but the administration has argued for a more modest approach.

Rather than completely overrule the court’s Section 2 framework, it told the court it should merely limit it.

Specifically, the Justice Department wants the high court to require Section 2 plaintiffs to

propose a superior map to the state’s — not just an equivalent one — and show an objective likelihood the state’s map reflects intentional discrimination.

The administration also wants the justices to decouple political party from race, even if it means modifying the framework that has governed Section 2 claims since the 1980s, known as the Gingles test.

“That’s part of the problem here,” said Principal Deputy Solicitor General Hashim Mooppan, “is that what’s going on under Gingles now is not actually figuring out whether there’s an unfair effect based on race; it’s figuring out whether there’s an unfair effect based on party.”

Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked if the court would “necessarily” have to modify the precedent.

“Is there a way to say it’s a clarification of Gingles? I mean, Gingles is a 40-year-old precedent. A big ask to change it.”

No matter whether it ends up being completely eviscerated, modified or tweaked, the court’s liberal justices took the administration’s stance to mean a more sweeping endgame was likely.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the government’s ultimate goal was to get rid of Section 2.

“Race is always a part of these decisions, and my colleagues are trying to tease it out in this intellectual way that doesn’t deal with the fact that race is used to help people,” Sotomayor said.

Justice Elena Kagan at one point said some of the challengers’ arguments “have been specifically rejected by this court over many decades and three years ago.”

The long-running legal battle over Louisiana’s map began after the 2020 census, when the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature overrode a former Democratic governor’s veto of a map with one majority-Black district.

Black voters and civil rights groups sued. They claimed that the design diluted Black voters’ power at the polls.

A three-judge appeals panel agreed, and the Supreme Court temporarily let the map stay in place ahead of the 2022 midterms, before throwing out Louisiana’s appeal after deciding a separate redistricting case in Alabama.

To avoid court-drawn boundaries, Republican leaders in the state took action.

They passed a new map with a second majority-Black district. Self-described “non-African American” voters then challenged it, which a three-judge panel invalidated, sending the case back to the Supreme Court.

The map remained in effect for last year’s elections, but the Supreme Court’s decision could cause a major shake-up for future terms.

With Louisiana and the “non-African American” voters now aligned, it left the Black voters and civil rights groups from the earlier litigation to defend the Voting Rights Act in its current form before the Supreme Court.

They argued that siding with Louisiana would effectively turn back the page to the widespread discrimination that existed before the landmark law’s enactment.

NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Janai Nelson told the justices that, in Louisiana, every Black congressional member was elected in districts drawn to enable minority groups to garner enough voting power to elect their candidates of choice.

“We only have the diversity that we see across the South, for example, because of litigation that forced the creation of opportunity districts under the Voting Rights Act,” she said, suggesting it would be “catastrophic” for Section 2 to cease to operate as it does today.

A decision is expected in the case by next summer. Though it may come too late to impact next year’s midterms, the ruling could spark changes to congressional maps for future election cycles.

Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry (R) was in the public gallery Wednesday as his state made its case, as was Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.).

The Louisiana governor told The Hill in an interview ahead of arguments that courts should stay out of redistricting, a process that’s political in nature and should fall to elected representatives.

“What you’ve seen is that the more the court gets involved in a legislative process, the more it entangles itself in its own opinions,” Landry said Tuesday. “Because what has happened is, each time it’s had to render or address an opinion based upon redistricting, it’s only complicated the process even further and ended up with a different series of litigation.”

He said he wants the Supreme Court to end the dispute entirely, so Louisiana can stop “needlessly” spending tens of millions of dollars on litigation tied to redistricting.

“I hope that this is the end of the tracks,” he said.

Callais, which could determine whether Black voters have a meaningful chance at equal representation in Congress. The question before the court is a crucial one: does creating majority-Black districts to comply with the Voting Rights Act amount to unconstitutional racial discrimination?

In 2022, Louisiana lawmakers drew a congressional map that gave Black voters—one-third of the state’s population—a realistic shot at electing a member of Congress in only one of six districts. Federal courts ruled that this violated the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws voting practices that discriminate based on race. The legislature then created a second majority-Black district linking the cities of Baton Rouge and Shreveport. For the first time in decades, the state’s political map reflected its demographics.

A group of white voters sued, claiming the remedy itself was discriminatory. A divided federal court agreed, finding lawmakers gave race too much weight. Now the Supreme Court must decide whether intentionally creating a district where Black voters can elect their preferred candidates violates the constitution, though Congress endorsed this remedy in 1965.

The challengers’ logic is upside down. But these attempts to undermine anti-racist efforts are not new. Legal experts warn Callais could become a sequel to Shelby County v. Holder, the 2013 decision that gutted key Voting Rights Act provisions and unleashed widespread voter suppression. If the court narrows this provision again, challenging racially skewed maps will become nearly impossible.

A constitutional scholar, Erwin Chemerinsky, cautions that the court could go even further, undermining the principle of disparate impact, the idea that policies can be discriminatory when they disproportionately harm people of color, even without overt racist intent. This idea, used to enforce equal rights in housing, education, and employment for decades, helps bring the United States into better alignment with international human rights law.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/10/202510usp_us_Louisiana%20v.%20Callais%20.jpg?h=e6ec9631&itok=n2e3ZcWB,N,,2025-10-15 16:04:10.097643

Steve Rios told NBC 7 that his parents, Esteban Rios and Luisa Rodriguez, were picking up his pregnant younger sister, Ashley, and her husband, who is also a Marine, at the enormous West Coast base on Sept. 28 — just like they had done every weekend for the past few months while expecting their first grandchild.

But this time, Rios said, his parents were stopped at the gate and held for ICE agents, who detained them.

They were released a few hours later with ankle monitors and picked up by their son, who said they were instructed to check in with the agency later that week.

When Rios drove them to their check-in appointment a few days later, he said, they waited for hours before being detained again.

“I just kept on looking at my parents. I didn’t know if it would be the last time I’d see them,” the young Marine said.

Rios shared that his father was wearing a red shirt and a white hat, both of which said “Proud dad of a US Marine,” when he was taken away and deported by ICE agents.

“He said, ‘Yeah, this is my lucky shirt, so we’ll be fine,'” Rios recalled.

He said he spoke briefly to his father on the phone the day after the second detention, and was told his parents were being held in the basement of the federal building that houses ICE and immigration court.

They were later transferred to the Otay Mesa Detention Center, NBC 7 reported.

While his father was deported after being detained by ICE, it’s unclear if his mother suffered the same fate.

Rios, who said he joined the Corps right out of high school to make his parents proud and is currently in the reserves after spending four years on active duty, mentioned that the couple came to the US from Mexico 30 years ago.

He described them as hardworking, law-abiding members of their community with no criminal record, who washed cars and cleaned houses to get by.

They were also waiting for green cards and work visas that he sponsored when they were detained.

“It was just making them proud, right? I’ve seen all the struggles they’ve gone through,” Rios said. “The least I could do, right, and serve this country and try to, you know, put some time in. I don’t think amounts to what they’ve done.”

He said the experience scared him because it was something he had worried about happening his whole life.

Ashley, his younger sister, recalled the gut-wrenching message she received from her brother when their parents were first detained at Camp Pendleton’s front gate.

“My brother texted me that they got stopped. And as soon as I heard that, I just started bawling,” she said, fighting back tears.

Now expecting her first child, Ashley said the ordeal has hit even harder.

“It’s just hard because you just want to hear your parents’ voices and know everything will be OK,” she said. “I’d always want my mom in that delivery room and everything, so it’s hard not to think about them.”

The siblings said they’re uncertain what will happen next, but their faith is helping them stay strong.

“They might get sent back. They might not,” Rios said. “The only person that knows is up there.”

A spokesperson for ICE told NBC 7 that “as part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws.”

Ninth Circuit:

No En Banc Rehearing in Case Over Legal Aid Funding

Divided Panel Rejects Call for En Banc Review of Denial of Bid for Stay of Preliminary Injunction Directing Reinstatement of Payments for Representation of Unaccompanied Migrant Children

By a MetNews Staff Writer

A divided Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday denied a request for en banc rehearing over a decision declining to stay a preliminary injunction directing the Executive Branch to reinstate funding to a left-leaning immigration group that provides, among other services, legal representation for unaccompanied migrant children through subcontracting with firms across the nation.

The case originated after Community Legal Services and Social Justice Collaborative, two Bay Area immigration firms, and other organizations filed a complaint against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) in March, asserting that the Executive Branch violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) by cancelling a $200 million contract with Acacia Center for Justice that served as a source of the plaintiffs’ funding.

They sought only declaratory and injunctive relief.

Acacia describes itself as a “non-governmental organization that supports and partners with a national network of human rights defenders who provide legal defense to immigrants” and says that the “U.S. immigration…system is…intentionally designed to exploit, exclude, criminalize, detain, and deport people who have historically been viewed as undeserving of inclusion in our national fabric, particularly Black and brown people.”

Under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), HHS is required to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that all unaccompanied children in immigration custody receive legal representation. In March, President Donald Trump’s administration paused the flow of federal dollars to Acacia, which was the sole vendor paid by the federal government to provide legal aid for migrant minors.

Preliminary Injunction

On April 29, District Court Judge Araceli Martínez-Olguín of the Northern District of California, an appointee of Democratic President Joe Biden, granted the plaintiffs’ request for preliminary relief, ordering:

“Defendants are ENJOINED from withdrawing the services or funds…as of March 20, 2025, under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008…, particularly [the] provision of funds for direct legal representation services to unaccompanied children.”

In May, a divided three-judge panel denied the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal of the preliminary injunction. Circuit Judge Lucy H. Koh, a Biden appointee, joined by Senior Circuit Judge William A. Fletcher, who was placed on the court by Democratic President Bill Clinton, concluded that the government had not shown a likelihood of success on the merits. Koh and Fletcher were each appointed by Democrats.

Dissenting, Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, an appointee of Republican President George W. Bush, wrote that “[e]ven if the district court had jurisdiction,” a decision to cut funding “is committed to agency discretion.”

En Banc Reconsideration

Fletcher and Koh wrote in support of Friday’s order denying en banc reconsideration of the stay denial. Circuit Judges Patrick J. Bumatay and Lawrence VanDyke, joined in by Callahan as well as Circuit Judges Sandra S. Ikuta, Mark J. Bennett, Ryan D. Nelson, Daniel P. Collins, Kenneth K. Lee, and Daniel Aaron Bress, penned a dissent, saying:

“Though Plaintiffs style this suit as one premised on the APA, ‘in essence’ it’s contractual. This dispute therefore belongs in the Court of Federal Claims, and we’re powerless to hear it. This should have been a hard point to miss….Even so, our court has decided against rehearing this case. In doing so, we leave in place a novel and intrusive injunction that the district court never had the authority to enter.”

Ikuta, like Callahan, was placed on the court by President George W. Bush. The remaining dissenters are Trump appointees.

Breach of Contract Action

Koh and Fletcher acknowledged that, under the Tucker Act, codified at 28 U.S.C. §1491, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive jurisdiction over any breach of contract claim against the federal government seeking monetary damages over $10,000. However, they rejected the view that the plaintiffs’ claims amount to a restyled breach of contract action arising out of the Acacia agreement, saying:

“The bottom line is that Plaintiffs have no contract with the Government. They do not invoke any contractual terms as the basis for their action. Nor do they seek a contractual remedy from the Government. Rather, Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief requiring compliance with the statutory obligations set out by Congress and the regulatory obligations set forth by Defendants themselves. Thus, as the district court put it, ‘Plaintiffs’ claims have no business before the [Court of Federal] Claims.’ ”

Noting that “every presidential administration since the TVPRA’s passage has provided funding for direct representation of unaccompanied children,” they pointed out that the APA directs that agency actions that are arbitrary or capricious are to be “set aside.”

No Reinstatement

They opined:

“Plaintiffs do not seek reinstatement of the Acacia contract. Rather, Plaintiffs challenge the Cancellation Order because the Government had previously complied with the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule solely through the Acacia contract and failed to provide any meaningful alternative to comply with the TVPRA.”

Koh and Fletcher added:

“The non-contractual source of Plaintiffs’ rights is dispositive….In any event, the second inquiry, ‘the type of relief sought,’ also supports jurisdiction in the district court….Under this prong, we assess whether the ‘complaint…seeks monetary relief.’…It does not.”

Under those circumstances, they declared:

“Our court made the correct decision in denying en banc review….In this appeal, the Government’s merits arguments have been limited solely to whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to entertain this appeal. For the reasons stated above, as well as those stated in our opinion denying the Government’s motion for a stay, the Government has failed to make the required ‘strong showing’ that it will likely succeed on the merits of its jurisdictional argument.”

Dissenting View

Dissenting, Bumatay and VanDyke asserted:

“The Supreme Court has warned against an ‘imperial Judiciary.’…In recent times, the Court has repeatedly needed to dial back lower court decisions that exceed the judiciary’s equitable authority….For cases involving hot-button policy issues, our review is often constrained—and sometimes curtailed altogether. That means staying in our lane and respecting our jurisdictional bounds. But once again, the Ninth Circuit fails to respect our role and the Supreme Court’s guidance.”

Saying that “groups opposed to the [federal government’s] policies rushed to the federal courthouse in San Francisco” after the administration “stopped funding ongoing work while the Executive Branch reviews the integrity of its multimillion-dollar payments to Acacia,” they asserted:

“But the district court never had jurisdiction in this case. No matter how hard we squint, we can’t avoid the fact that this is a contract dispute. No statute or regulation entitles Plaintiffs to funding. Instead, Plaintiffs simply want money from the federal government based on the government’s contract with the organization that Plaintiffs have subcontracted with.”

Subcontractor Exception

Characterizing the majority’s decision to deny rehearing as “brush[ing] aside these jurisdictional concerns” by creating a “subcontractor exception” to the Tucker Act, they reasoned:

“Now subcontractors can bring suits arising out of government contracts in any district court, including allowing them to utilize the full array of equitable relief available to district courts, while contractors are limited to the Court of Federal Claims.”

Citing two U.S. Supreme Court cases decided earlier this year, Department of Education v. California and National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association, the judges said:

“It’s our duty to follow the Supreme Court’s lead on how to exercise our equitable power. In cases where a district court’s jurisdiction is likely wanting,…the Court has directed that we stay injunctions against the Executive Branch.”

3) Trump is using immigration enforcement to deter free speech The president sees immigration policy as a tool for punishing speech he does not like.","When liberals denounce Donald Trump’s authoritarianism, they often cast his immigration agenda as a case in point.

Back in June, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee decried the president’s “mass deportation operations” as the “stepping stone” to his “radical attempts to seize absolute power.” In the same statement, they condemned the administration’s deportation of noncriminal immigrants “as cruel,” lamenting the harms that it imposed on “law-abiding families.”

Personally, I agree with both of these indictments of Trump’s policy. But it’s important for Americans to understand that they can accept the first one, even if they reject the second: In other words, you don’t need to share liberals’ moral objections to large-scale deportation in order to accept that Trump’s handling of that task is intolerably authoritarian.

For many liberals, the most morally horrifying aspect of Trump’s immigration agenda is its consequences for the undocumented and their loved ones. Armed agents forcing children from their homes, breaking up families, and exiling hardworking people pursuing the American dream — all this seems needlessly cruel.

For precisely that reason, it strikes many progressives as evocative of fascism: The government appears to be tormenting a vulnerable minority population for the sake of tormenting a vulnerable minority population. Thus, from the left’s vantage point, the humanitarian critique of deporting non-criminal immigrants — and the anti-authoritarian critique of Trump’s approach to deporting them — can look like one in the same.

But not all Americans share these intuitions. A significant segment of voters (in some — though not all — polls, a majority) favor large-scale internal immigration enforcement. To them, liberals may sound as though we are equating “authoritarianism” with “the implementation of policies that I don’t like.”

Indeed, some voters may feel that large-scale deportation efforts are the opposite of undemocratic. After all, immigration laws are the byproducts of democratic governance: Our elected representatives chose to put certain restrictions on migration. When people violate those laws, they undermine the electorate’s sovereignty over an issue of public concern. From this viewpoint, deporting law-abiding immigrants may generate sad stories and ugly scenes. Yet were America to adopt the rule, “if you make it past the border, you can stay forever, so long as you don’t commit any crimes,” it would only encourage further subversion of its laws.

I think this line of thought puts too little weight on the welfare of the undocumented, the economic benefits of immigration, and America’s capacity to deter unlawful inflows through border enforcement. But voters should know that they don’t need to agree with liberals about all that in order to reject Trump’s immigration policies.

The case for deeming those policies authoritarian does not hinge on the righteousness of cosmopolitan moral assumptions or economic theories. Rather, that case rests on the myriad ways that Trump’s immigration agenda is egregiously undermining Americans’ civil liberties and democratic freedoms.

Below, I will detail five reasons why even conservative voters should consider Trump’s handling of immigration anti-democratic.

1) The administration is openly flouting due process

Even those who favor strict immigration enforcement should support immigrants’ due process rights. After all, it is due process that prevents the government from deporting lawful US residents (either by mistake or design).

Yet Trump has explicitly called for ending due process in immigration cases and taken various actions consistent with that authoritarian ambition.

During his first term, he declared that the government should be able to deport undocumented immigrants “with no judges or court cases.” Since taking office a second time, the president has sought to curtail legal protections for those accused of being in the country illegally.

First, the Trump administration has expanded the use of “expedited removal” — a process that allows immigration authorities to deport the undocumented rapidly, without a full hearing. Historically, this process was used in a narrow set of circumstances: When an immigrant is intercepted near the US border without a valid visa, credible asylum claim, or proof that they have been in the US for longer than two weeks.

The idea here was that migrants who have just crossed the border do not possess the same legal protections as longtime residents. In some sense, they are still seeking admission into the country, rather than permission to remain in it. Therefore, Congress and the judiciary concluded that the government could deny such migrants a full court hearing, in the interests of administrative efficiency, particularly when border agents were overwhelmed by large inflows of asylum seekers.

But Trump has sought to authorize expedited removal throughout the United States. Under his guidance, the Department of Homeland Security has proposed a rule that would empower Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to summarily deport any suspected immigrants who can’t immediately prove that they’ve been in America for two years.

The risks of this policy to lawful US residents aren’t merely theoretical. Even in the absence of such broad authorities, ICE and Customs and Border Protection have wrongfully detained or deported legal residents, including American citizens. According to a 2020 Government Accountability Office report, between 2015 and 2020, ICE arrested 674 potential US citizens, detained 121, and removed 70.

Courts have intervened to block Trump’s expanded use of expedited removal, but the administration is appealing those rulings.

Meanwhile, Trump has sought to corrupt the independence of the immigration court system. Since taking office in January, 139 immigration judges have been fired, nudged from the bench with an early retirement offer, or involuntarily transferred. The purge is seemingly aimed at replacing neutral arbiters of immigration law with rubber stamps for Trump’s enforcement agencies.

Finally, and most appallingly, the president has infamously deported longtime US residents — who’d been convicted of no crime — to a notorious prison in El Salvador, where inmates are reportedly subject to torture and indefinite detention. In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the administration deported a resident unlawfully, and then claimed that it was powerless to reverse its mistake, since Garcia was now in the custody of a foreign power. The judiciary eventually forced the administration to return Garcia to the US. But his case illustrates the extremity of Trump’s contempt for due process.

2) Trump is normalizing the use of the military for civil law enforcement

The president has also deployed federal troops to oversee immigration enforcement operations, in defiance of local political authorities.

This is a severe breach of liberal democratic norms. Immigration enforcement is a civil authority. And in the United States, responsibility for upholding civil laws is supposed to lie with civilian officials — not the military — except under the most extraordinary circumstances. This division of powers is codified in the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars the use of armed forces for domestic policing absent explicit congressional authorization.

The administration has flouted this convention by invoking an obscure 1903 law, which authorizes the president to call up the National Guard if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” or “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Yet Trump has effectively defined such a rebellion as any public protest — even nonviolent ones — against immigration enforcement. In a June memorandum, Trump authorized the Guard’s deployment to any “locations where protests against” ICE functions “are occurring or are likely to occur based on current threat assessments and planned operations.” In other words, the president asserted the authority to send the military anywhere in the US where a protest against his immigration policy is happening — or where his administration thinks a protest against its policy could happen.

The danger that this poses to democracy is straightforward. Unlike civilian police forces, the armed services operate at the president’s command. If his use of the military for civilian functions isn’t tightly constrained, there is a risk that he could exploit his martial authorities to insulate his regime from democratic control. Today, Trump is asserting the right to deploy troops to Democratic cities, to preempt protests he does not like. Tomorrow, he could do the same to obstruct the election of politicians he opposes.

Of course, that catastrophic outcome is far from guaranteed. But it is important to maintain institutional obstacles to it. Instead, Trump’s immigration agenda is eroding them.

3) Trump is using immigration enforcement to deter free speech

The president sees immigration policy as a tool for punishing speech he does not like.

This is not conjecture but a description of the administration’s official policy.

Earlier this year, Trump declared, “To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you,” further promising to “cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses.”

This stance would be illiberal, even if the president were referring exclusively to genuine supporters of Hamas; the government should not revoke legal status from people on the basis of speech, no matter how reprehensible.

In reality, though, the administration’s complaint was with any immigrant who advocated for a staunchly pro-Palestinian point of view.

In March 2024, Rümeysa Öztürk, a Turkish national residing in the US on a student visa, co-authored an op-ed in her university’s newspaper, calling on it to divest from Israel and acknowledge the “Palestinian genocide.” This speech act put Öztürk on the radar of pro-Israel activists.

Upon taking office, Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked Öztürk’s visa. Six masked, plainclothes DHS agents proceeded to abduct her off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, and send her to an ICE processing facility in southern Louisiana.

The ostensible rationale for this was that Öztürk had engaged in pro-Hamas activities. But internal State Department documents, obtained by the Washington Post, revealed that the government possessed no evidence that Öztürk had ever publicly advocated for Hamas or participated in antisemitic activities.

The administration has similarly sought to revoke legal status from two lawful permanent residents — Mahmoud Khalil and Mohsen Mahdawi — who participated in pro-Palestinian activism at Columbia University.

Federal courts have disputed the legality of all these actions, although Khalil presently faces a deportation order.

4) The government is shielding ICE officers from accountability

A core democratic freedom is protection from abuse by armed agents of the state. The Trump administration has undermined such liberty by insulating DHS officers from legal accountability.

It has done this through both formal and tacit means. On the first front, it has essentially shuttered the DHS’s internal watchdog offices — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman — which sought to protect detainees against abuse and unfair treatment. The latter office investigated more than 11,000 complaints in 2023.

Meanwhile, the administration has condoned the decision of many ICE agents to operate in masks and plainclothes. This policy enables abuse by making it harder for the mistreated to identify abusive officers and thus hold them to account.

The threat of ICE agents acting abusively is not hypothetical. Recently, an officer was caught on video shoving a woman to the ground inside a New York City courthouse. Initially, he was relieved of his duties pending an investigation. Then, just days later, he was reportedly reinstated after facing no discernible punishment.

Critically, all this is consistent with the president’s own stated beliefs about how law enforcement officers should be allowed to operate. Speaking of his federal takeover of the DC police in August, Trump touted that, on his watch, cops would be “allowed to do whatever the hell they want.” He has also specifically said that when protestors throw rocks at ICE vehicles, the officers become entitled to “arrest these SLIMEBALLS” using “whatever means is necessary to do so.”

5) The pursuit of indiscriminate, mass deportation imposes inherent costs to civil liberties

To this point, I’ve been outlining reasons why one should consider Trump’s immigration policies anti-democratic, even if one regards mass deportation as legitimate.

But it’s also true that any attempt to deport millions of noncriminal, undocumented immigrants is bound to impose costs on Americans’ civil liberties.

The case for concentrating immigration enforcement on lawbreakers is not just humanitarian. Undocumented immigrants convicted of crimes are already known to the government and typically in its custody. As a result, DHS can remove them from the country without conducting sweeps that ensnare legal US residents.

Yet the Trump administration is committed to deporting as many of America’s 14 million undocumented immigrants as they possibly can. And that has led them to embrace tactics like going door to door in a Chicago apartment building, demanding families prove their legal status in the middle of the night; storming car washes and throwing senior citizens to the ground; and fining legal immigrants for not carrying proof of their status on their person at all times.

To refrain from these tactics, and set narrower enforcement priorities, is not to nullify America’s immigration statutes. The rule of law has never depended on perfect enforcement. Most crimes committed in the United States go unpunished, including nearly half of murders. We should obviously try to change that. But the only way to push the rate of unpunished criminality to anywhere near 0 percent would be to embrace gross violations of civil liberties: The government would need to surveil more or less all citizens more or less all of the time.

Most Americans would regard such enforcement as authoritarian. And so we instead accept that the police will prioritize the prevention and punishment of certain crimes, while acquiescing to a great deal of uncensured lawbreaking. Immigration enforcement entails similar tradeoffs.

That doesn’t mean that any enforcement regime broader than Joe Biden’s is fascism. But I would encourage those unmoved by humanitarian objections to mass deportation to consider the inherent, civil libertarian costs of such a policy.

In any event, reasonable people can disagree about exactly how the government should balance the objectives of enforcing borders and honoring civil liberties. What should be beyond dispute, however, is that eroding Americans’ most basic constitutional rights is never legitimate. And Trump’s immigration agenda does precisely that.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/gettyimages-2238859233.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-15 08:57:14.005781

Since then, 10 of those migrants have been deported to Togo even though only two are Togolese, Barker-Vormawor said.

Students, faculty and human rights groups are calling for VCU and other universities to protect students from profiling and detainment by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) as they expand raid operations nationwide.

Efforts include a student petition for VCUarts to outline its safety policy and a statewide proposal to reestablish campuses as protected “sanctuary” zones posed by faculty unions and the Virginia Coalition for Human Rights.

The efforts come as candidates for statewide office show broad support for local cooperation with ICE. Republican Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, as well as lieutenant governor — and gubernatorial candidate — Winsome Earle-Sears have both previously opposed efforts to make Virginia a “sanctuary state,” meaning they will not cooperate with federal agencies on immigration enforcement.

Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former congresswoman Abigail Spanberger said in last week’s debate that she also opposed “providing any sort of sanctuary policies here,” according to a previous report by The Commonwealth Times.

Alyse Few, a second-year graphic design major, is one of the students circulating a petition in the School of the Arts asking the university to address student detainment fears. The petition calls for classes to switch from in-person to virtual instruction when students feel unsafe on campus because of ICE threats.

“There have been several accounts made by students of ICE being spotted on or near the VCU campus, even from last semester,” Few said. “I’ve heard students, [myself] included, express their fears, worries and anger over ICE being on campus knowing how they have presented themselves over the last year. Some students have even avoided going to class out of fear.”

The biggest risk to students is walking to and from class, Few said. She believes there should be a transparent way to communicate with students about the presence of immigration enforcement that does not rely on hearsay. She suggested a system that operates similarly to VCUAlerts.

“No one should have to live in fear whenever they leave their home, class, clubs or any other location because of how they look or how they speak, especially at a school,” Few said.

Immigration operations have changed nationally since January as well as rules regulating agents’ behavior, according to NPR. Schools have not been a “protected area” from immigration enforcement since Jan. 20, when the Trump administration rescinded the previous policy protecting them, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

However, ICE cannot enter private homes, including dorms, without a judicial warrant signed by a judge, according to the National Immigrant Justice Center. The NIJC website shows viewers what a judicial warrant looks like, along with an administrative warrant — a more common form of permission not signed by a judge that does not carry the same power.

The Sacred Heart Center, a local nonprofit, operates a resource page with information for the community regarding immigration enforcement, including Virginia-specific examples of these forms.

Nearly 1,200 international students attend VCU, according to the Office of Admissions. Last semester, two students and one alum were among thousands nationwide to have their visas revoked, according to previous reporting by The CT. The three VCU students later had their visas restored.

VCU assistant professor of sociology Gabriela León-Pérez thinks there is a “heightened sense of fear and anxiety” surrounding ICE’s presence on campus. She thinks many faculty members have responded to the possibility of ICE entering classrooms by developing plans with their students.

“Other universities, such as Columbia University and the University of Michigan, have developed protocols for potential visits by ICE to campus, and it would be a good idea for VCU to develop similar guidelines for our campus community,” León-Pérez said.

Community organizer and former Virginia Tech professor Jack Leff recently collaborated with VCHR to create a list of proposed legislation to protect higher education.

One policy calls for Virginia campuses to be reinstated as “protected sanctuary sites” and prohibits cooperation between campus police departments and ICE. It would codify the requests into state law if officially proposed and passed. Leff said a member of the General Assembly has already agreed to sponsor a bill carrying the proposal — though it depends on the Nov. 4 election results.

Leff said the federal administration is weaponizing ICE to “quell political dissent” on campuses.

“We have seen ICE begin using racial profiling on college and university campuses to attack Latinx students and their families,” Leff said. “Education is a human right, and if people are afraid to come to campus or speak out because of the threat of ICE, then that would fundamentally dismantle the promise of higher education.”

First-year student Alex Cox said he thinks ICE has no business on campus and described the idea as “sickening.”

“I don’t like ICE at all,” Cox said. “I think it’s inhumane and absurd, the things the general public has been allowing to slide in terms of this administration as a whole. Seeing ICE on campus is … [a] nightmare.”

Cox said the precedent for racial profiling set by the Supreme Court is concerning to him because of his family’s immigrant background and Spanish surnames.

“Hispanics are everywhere, immigrants of every kind are everywhere, and this is really disproportionately affecting Black and brown people especially,” Cox said. “I feel like Afro-Latinos get forgotten about, but they’re also disproportionately affected.”

Michelle Poole, a second-year journalism student, said the presence of ICE officials would endanger students with visas in particular. She is skeptical that VCU would defend students by denying them access. She noted the concern over unwarranted detainments extends to her as a Black student.

“If I had to put an emotion to it, it would definitely be anger,” Poole said. “And also fear in a way. People have to realize that it’s not just one demographic of people of color at risk, it’s now all people of color.”

Kaleb Morton, a second-year biology student, believes ICE deployment on campus is unnecessary. He instead supports building a deeper relationship between VCU Police and students to increase security. He said ICE is not fulfilling their obligation as federal workers to protect and serve.

“The slightest increment of bias, hate or even just an oversaturated sense of power can lead anybody who is in that position to racially profile anybody,” Morton said. “It’s gonna be purely based off of self-interest at that point.”

Lola Good, a second-year forensic science student, is looking ahead to what all Americans can do to prevent violence towards citizens at the hands of immigration officials.

“I would say I’m honestly just confused and scared how we as Americans are letting this happen,” Good said.

All four students said they thought a proposal to put limits on how VCU could cooperate with ICE in some way is a sound idea.

Early in my career as a journalist, I had dinner with a source who would be assassinated less than two years later. Francisco Piedragil Ayala, president of the state coffee council in Guerrero, Mexico, spoke in slow, deliberate Spanish, his snow-white hair tied back. “I think—no, I know—that you and the young people like you are the light at the end of the darkness we are in,” he said, a gleam in his eye. “The way you are going to illuminate it is by learning. By getting to know.”

We were at a restaurant in Acapulco, where my editor had asked me not to stay out late because he was worried about cartel violence. But I was riveted by Piedragil. As the ocean blackened beside us, I took notes and asked questions. At twenty-two, I had moved to Mexico City to cover soft commodities—coffee, cacao, and other crops—for the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires. My job was to track their production in Mexico and Central America. But the deeper I went into the mountains and villages, the clearer it became that I wasn’t just reporting on supply chains. I was witnessing the silent machinery behind mass migration.

Piedragil told me that multinational industries were destroying the earth and displacing people. He’d led a longtime resistance to corporate extraction, such as by setting fire to coffee skins destined for Nestlé. When we met, he was helping opium poppy farmers become small-scale quality coffee farmers so that they could be free of the cartels and demand fair prices for their beans. Piedragil told me that the rapacious harvesting of the earth had to end. Otherwise, he said, the earth would become “a machine that will be able to feed only machines.”

He was pointing me toward a truth that our country’s political focus on the border obscures. Poverty and violence, the conditions that are often cited as “root causes” of migration, are symptoms of the industrial pillaging that he was fighting. That plunder—by corporations and cartels, at the behest of corrupt officials—is what was driving people from their homes. “I don’t care what you write about,” Piedragil told me. “I understand that you’ve got to get paid and that they only care to publish certain things.” He knew that my article would be limited to an economic report on rising coffee prices. “But,” he continued, “I can see the wheels turning in your brain.”

Piedragil was planting seeds that would mature long after his assassination, years after I returned to the US to become a border reporter for KPBS in San Diego, then wrote an investigative biography of Stephen Miller, the architect of President Trump’s immigration policies, and became an opinion columnist and commentator.

Earlier this year, as I watched the inward creep of the border under the second Trump presidency, it dawned on me: Every day, the border appears in the news as a wall, a fence, or a fixed stretch of land. Inert, unmoving. But the border is a mobile machine. The US has long outsourced border enforcement to Mexico and other countries. Now US federal agents have been deputized to carry the border deep into the US, dragging its violence and impunity to Chicago, Los Angeles, and other American cities; meanwhile, the Supreme Court has affirmed that those agents can target people based on their skin color, language, or low-wage jobs.

I worry about the border settling inside of the journalists who cover it.

Journalists are trained to privilege what we can see. It is easier to photograph concertina wire and corrugated barriers than to trace the snaking patterns of a system that manufactures disposability in the Americas and beyond. But the border is more than its steel. It is the circuitry that is turning the earth into a factory and people into its moving parts. It is a tool of caste, sorting human beings into categories of worth based on race, language, and class. It is the most effective instrument of the machine Piedragil warned about—a machine that can feed only machines.

The border was never confined to the borderlands. I worry about the border settling inside of the journalists who cover it, partitioning our minds and relationships. What began as a geopolitical barrier has become an internal one, regulating whom we can see, how we can feel, what futures we can imagine.

By describing the border only in terms of walls and trespass, the US news media distracts from the architecture of global inequality that our border sustains. We collude in its function: the separation of Americans from Americans across the Americas, from people across the world—from our shared history and humanity.

To report honestly, journalism must become unbordered.

What does unbordered journalism look like? First, journalists must refuse to treat the “border” as the origin point of immigration stories. Local reporting out of Los Angeles this year about the Trump administration’s racialized immigration enforcement is a case study in unbordered reporting.

Stories like “‘They run, we chase’: Immigration raids test limits of ‘probable cause,’” by Rachel Uranga and Brittny Mejia for the Los Angeles Times, and “Feds Arrest and Injure Two American Citizens During Raid in Ladera Heights, Leaves One Unconscious” by Izzy Ramirez for LA Taco shed light on how the border has become unmoored—snaking between white and brown, between Americans and neighbors, between citizens and their once-protected rights.

Another defining characteristic of unbordered journalism is that it does not let the border dictate who is worthy or unworthy. Xochitl Gonzalez’s article in The Atlantic, about Narciso Barranco, a father of US Marines who was pummeled by a Border Patrol agent, centered the humanity of people whom the border marks as disposable.

Bordered reporting, on the other hand, endows the border with greater authority than is accorded the people it is built to exclude. A 2023 New Yorker magazine article about Biden’s border policy is one such example; it starts and ends at the border, and frames immigrants as “numbers” and “bodies.”

Unbordered reporting, in contrast, does not avoid the complexity of people and their backgrounds. It shows how migration is shaped by global forces including wars, weapons trafficking, corporate extraction, and climate change. One story that made a lasting impression on me was a 2019 report in the New York Times by Nick Casey, a former Wall Street Journal colleague of mine, about the vanishing of Lake Poopó in Bolivia. The piece showed how the lake’s disappearance threatened not only the livelihood but “the very identity” of the region’s oldest Indigenous community, the Uru-Murato. It helped inform Americans about migration without centering migration or borders at all.

To achieve unbordered reporting, news organizations should invest in foreign bureaus with migration beats, and give conscientious reporters time and resources to pursue in-depth immigration projects. Jonathan Blitzer’s 2024 book Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here is a model for this type of reporting, with its sweeping, human-centered look at immigration from Central America and the role of US intervention. Similarly, Roberto Lovato’s 2020 memoir Unforgetting: A Memoir of Family, Migration, Gangs, and Revolution in the Americas, illuminates the ripple effects of US-backed violence in El Salvador.

Whenever possible, immigration reporting should strive to be not only geographically but also temporally unbordered. That means uncovering histories of slavery, genocide, and eugenics that help the public understand what is happening in the current day.

Caitlin Dickerson’s 2021 piece in The Atlantic “America Never Wanted the Tired, Poor, Huddled Masses” is exemplary, showing how the US immigration system has never been colorblind and was built to exclude non-whites. Another illuminating example is the 2019 New York Times story tracing the impact of Cordelia Scaife May’s fears of foreign breeding on today’s anti-immigrant movement.

And news coverage should be politically unbordered, holding all leaders accountable without deference. It is nonpartisan, yet partial to human rights. Under the Obama presidency, Maria Hinojosa was one of the few reporters who pursued an unwavering examination of his administration’s anti-immigrant cruelty. Her 2011 PBS Frontline documentary “Lost in Detention” exposed how Obama’s record-high deportations targeting “felons, not families” had the effect of separating innocent mothers and fathers from their children. The film also examined problems of sexual assault and other abuses in detention facilities.

Another reporter who repeatedly called attention to the Obama-era assault on immigrants was Roberto Lovato, the author of Unforgetting. But he often faced an uphill battle with editors. “The protection of the Democratic Party by editorial rooms throughout the nation has enabled fascism,” he told me. “The material fact of tens of thousands of children separated from their mothers was not that different under Obama and Trump—but newsrooms weren’t willing to report seriously on the Democrats’ role in building the deportation machine.”

The most powerful stories live in the spaces between categories. Though most papers separate immigration news and labor news into distinct desks, coverage of immigrant rights and workers’ and civil rights is deeply connected. For instance, a recent piece in The Intercept points to how the erosion of immigrant rights is evolving into the dissolution of privacy and due process nationwide.

Just as corporations strip the soil for profit, technology firms are stripping us of privacy and free will, feeding our data into vast systems of monitoring and control.

Unbordered reporting understands that the border is a laboratory for surveillance capitalism, which is constructing a world where human beings are programmable. It understands that the underclass status of some immigrants enables other exploitations; the solution is not criminalization, as conservative media and politicians suggest, but legalization.

When offering policy recommendations, columnists and commentators should highlight pathways to citizenship and other protections that would reduce economic inequality by emancipating the engineered underclass. Right now, conservative media outlets such as Breitbart and the National Review dominate reporting at the intersection of labor and immigrant rights, giving Trump the scaffolding to pit American workers against immigrant workers by framing them as at odds. Unbordered journalism sees through the false dichotomy between those two groups. Honest journalism needs to fill the vacuum in that space.

The unbordered journalist knows that accuracy does not come from detachment. It comes from attention.

Finally, I think that immigration reporting needs to acknowledge the positionality of the writer—feelings, identities, and lived experiences—rather than pretending to report from nowhere. Memo Torres, a reporter for LA Taco, starts his reports with references to the “ICE siege of LA,” positioning his dispatches as a form of resistance.

This type of language may be uncomfortable for a reporter working in a traditional mode at a legacy newspaper. But I would argue that it is truer and more honest than a lot of reporting that performs neutrality. Many centrist and left-of-center news outlets remain committed to outdated notions of impartiality at a time when conservative media is leaning hard into personality and propaganda. Journalists who value accuracy cannot regain the trust of general audiences until and unless we begin to embrace authenticity.

Hinojosa has modeled unbordered reporting for decades. Her Pulitzer Prize–winning podcast Suave, which follows one man’s journey across the boundaries of prison and freedom, approaches the story through the lens of Hinojosa’s friendship with him. The podcast challenges the journalistic tradition of keeping an emotional distance from sources. Hinojosa embraces reporting from the heart—not to sentimentalize, but to restore dignity to lives that are stripped of it by many in politics and the media. Her practice of unbordered reporting is to refuse the artificial walls between fact and feeling, between journalist and subject.

Suave recounts Hinojosa’s decision to send Christmas cards to her source in prison because it felt like the human thing to do. Because of disclosures like this one,

Hinojosa has dealt with accusations of bias her entire career. But the unbordered journalist is authentically herself. She knows that accuracy does not come from detachment. It comes from attention. When we refuse to reduce our humanity, we are more capable of recognizing others’ humanity. We become more curious.

Hinojosa’s advice to journalists is to approach immigrant sources with respect. “Respect, not empathy. Respect,” she told me. “Understand that the people you’re speaking to have the capacity to teach you life lessons that no one else can.”

Unbordered journalism pushes us to ask deeper questions, to listen for what lies beneath dominant narratives, to see the systems that invisibly shape what we call “news.” It does not distort reality; it restores it.

On one of the last days I saw Piedragil before he was murdered, I attended a meeting he led with small-scale coffee farmers deep in the mountains of Guerrero. The farmers spoke of their gratitude for his help in gaining national recognition for their coffee and in earning a decent living. But they were worried. They wanted to know what they should do if they lost Piedragil’s leadership. How could they resist corporations and cartels without him? He reassured them. He told them they had the wind at their backs; they didn’t need him anymore. All they had to do now was remember one thing. “You’ve got to make yourselves alive,” he said.

The heart of aliveness, he said, is connection: building coalitions to protect our common humanity. That is unbordered reporting at its finest: It organizes. It collaborates. It rages against the destruction of life.

If the border is part of a machine that feeds machines, then unbordered reporting is the act of jamming its gears. It is how we resist systems of extraction and begin to write a different future—one that honors the lives and lands that Piedragil died defending, and the human gifts of learning, of getting to know.",https://www.cjr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unbordered-reporting-birds-nb2.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 08:02:35.974689

U.S. Supreme Court considers Louisiana redistricting case

In one of the first major cases of this term to come before the U.S. Supreme Court, justices will hear arguments over Louisiana’s effort to draw new congressional maps in which the state is seeking to dismiss any consideration of race.

The state will not defend its current map, which includes two districts represented by Black Democrats.

That map was drawn two years ago, after the Supreme Court found Louisiana’s prior map likely violated the Voting Rights Act.

But now, a group of white Louisiana voters claims that race was the driving factor in drawing this map, leading the case back to the high court.

Justices first heard the case in March, and several conservative members suggested they could throw out the current map, and potentially make it harder to bring redistricting lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act.

At the time, the justices ultimately ordered the re-argument of the case.

In a brief filed with the court, the state of Louisiana says the Voting Rights Act’s rules regarding race-based maps are “unworkable and unconstitutional.”

“No amount of surgery can eliminate the constitutional defects inherent in a system that, at the end of the day, requires states to sort their citizens by race,” the brief stated.

“Make no mistake: Black Louisianians are entitled to the same fair and representative maps as voters anywhere in this country,” Louisiana Executive Director of the American Civil Liberties Union Alanah Odoms said. “We remain steadfast in our commitment to that pursuit — until equality is not just promised, but realized.”

If the court overturns Louisiana’s maps, it could have implications in Florida.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that a ruling declaring racial consideration in map drawing unconstitutional could require Florida to redraw its maps.

The governor also defended the practice of making political considerations in drawing maps.

“The Constitution prohibits discrimination based on race, which is why the court is likely to find racial gerrymandering to be unconstitutional,” DeSantis wrote on a post on X.

The Constitution says nothing about political gerrymandering, which is why the court has found such claims to be non-justiciable.

New lawsuit accuses state agency of illegally withholding public records concerning 'Alligator Alcatraz'

A new lawsuit filed by Friends of the Everglades against the Florida Department of Emergency Management is accusing the state agency of denying the existence of public records requested by the nonprofit, only to later admit they existed all along.

Despite acknowledging their existence, FOTE attorneys say the state has still not produced the records.

According to the lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday in Circuit Court in Leon County, just five days after FDEM announced plans to open and operate the so-called ""Alligator Alcatraz"" immigrant detention center in the Everglades on June 19, Friends of the Everglades, Inc., requested documents under Florida's open records law concerning communication between the state and federal officials about the site.

At the time, the lawsuit claims the state agency initially denied the existence of any communication records, before later making ""an incomplete production.""

On Sept. 11, the nonprofit's attorneys sent a follow-up on its request, ""to make clear that Plaintiff's request specifically sought '[a]ll documents pertaining to or constituting any application for funds or grants to FEMA, DHS or other federal agency from FDEM or another state agency for financial assistance in connection with building any immigration detention center in Florida including without limitation to the ('Alligator Alcatraz') detention center.""

The lawsuit does not accuse the state agency of denying the existence of the communication records following the Sept. 11 request, but rather, claims the Florida Department of Emergency Management simply did not respond to it at all.

On Aug. 21, a federal judge ruled that the ""Alligator Alcatraz"" detention site could not expand or take in additional detainees, and gave the state 60 days to begin removal of fencing, lighting fixtures and ""all generators, gas, sewage, and other waste and waste receptacles that were installed to support this project.""

An appeals court later blocked the lower court's order, noting several times in its ruling that the state had not applied for, or received federal funding for the project — which would have required the site to ""comply with a host of regulatory prerequisites in support of that application"" that would not otherwise be necessary.

The lawsuit specifically points to a line in the appellate court's ruling that said: ""Without an application, there is simply nothing on which a decision can be made.""

Unbeknownst to the court or the plaintiffs in the case, though, was the fact that Florida had in fact applied for a federal grant almost a month before the appeals court made its ruling. The Friends of the Everglades lawsuit cites a single-page email disclosed by FDEM on Oct. 10 that showed a FEMA grant application — titled ""Fiscal Year 2025 Detention Support Grant Program"" — had been filed by the state at 7:05 p.m. on Aug. 7.

""More than a month later, FDEM has not corrected the Eleventh Circuit Court's misimpressions,"" the lawsuit filed Tuesday said. ""What the federal District and Circuit Courts (and Plaintiff) were unaware of, because FDEM did not disclose the fact or produce the documents, is that FDEM had already applied for federal funding on August 7, 2025.""

The Florida Department of Emergency Management's release of the funding email comes a little more than a week after Florida announced that FEMA had awarded the state $608 million to cover costs associated with ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

The Friends of the Everglades lawsuit claims that the Florida Department of Emergency Management ""has not asserted that any documents requested by Plaintiff are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act.""

The nonprofit's lawsuit is asking the court to force the state to release all requested records within 48 hours, to find that the department violated the law by not releasing the requested documents, and award it attorney fees and any other appropriate relief.

County supervisors voted 4-1 in favor of the emergency proclamation to mobilize county resources and support affected communities despite potential legal challenges from the federal government.

County officials claimed the raids have ""created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy,"" including decreased workplace attendance, temporary or permanent business closures, and increased strain on schools, hospitals, and places of worship.

Supervisor Janice Hahn said the emergency declaration was needed to respond to ""the fear, the pain and the disorder these ICE raids are causing our community.""

Supervisor Holly Mitchell also added that the raids have emboldened others to commit acts of race-based violence and hate.

The one vote against the proclamation came from Board Chair Kathryn Barger, who warned that the county’s action could provoke legal consequences.

""The federal government has sole authority to enforce federal immigration law, and local governments cannot impede that authority,"" Barger said.

Robert Jenrick MP has spearheaded a campaign to reveal what he describes as ‘activist’ judges and named two who he said should not sit on immigration cases. One of those was Mark Symes, who sits part-time on the upper tribunal and is a barrister with 25 years of experience who practices at Garden Court.

Jenrick also compiled a list of 35 judges whom he singled out for criticism because of their public comments and alleged conflict of interests. The list included Greg Ó Ceallaigh KC, who presides over deportation asylum appeals and is a Garden Court silk.

The chambers posted a statement this week in response to ‘press and social media commentary focused on members of Garden Court Chambers and others who sit as part-time judges’. It said: ‘Like many others across the legal profession who sit in part-time judicial roles, those barristers continue their other legal work and practices. The immigration law team at Garden Court is among the best in the country, which is why the judiciary benefits from the high-level of skill and knowledge possessed by those practising at Garden Court.

‘The availability of high-quality specialist lawyers is of great importance to the effective management of the immigration appellate system which, as has been widely reported, has suffered significant backlogs.’

The statement added that many members of the court have engaged in charitable and public interest work, including in areas such as human rights, but said ‘this outside experience informs rather than diminishes their standing’.

At the Conservative Party conference Jenrick said a future Conservative government would restore the responsibility for appointing judges to ministers by scrapping the Judicial Appointments Commission, which selects judges in England and Wales.

Garden Court said this move would ‘represent a significant departure from the principles of judicial independence’. Its statement argued: ‘Allowing a serving minister to determine judicial appointments risks politicising the judiciary, undermining public confidence in the courts’ impartiality, and eroding the long-established constitutionally important principle of the separation of powers that underpins the rule of law in this country.’",https://d1d8vslyhr7rdg.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/5/7/0/125570_shutterstock_1831580941_509051_crop.jpg,N,,2025-10-15 03:57:52.956020

CHICAGO — Facebook removed one of the city’s most active pages for reporting ICE sightings on Tuesday after being asked to do so by the Department of Justice.

The page, “ICE Sighting-Chicagoland” had more than 80,000 members and was increasingly active as street arrests by federal agents accelerated in the past month under “Operation Midway Blitz.” Members shared photos, videos or reports of ICE sightings across city neighborhoods and nearby suburbs, occasionally including the license plates of federal agents’ unmarked vehicles.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media that the page was being used to “dox and target” ICE agents. The page was taken down two days after right wing activist Laura Loomer — a fierce ally of President Donald Trump who often aires out perceived enemies of the president online — posted about it and claimed “ICE tracking accounts are getting people killed.”

Trump officials have frequently claimed federal agents in Chicago are under attack, despite widespread reports that the masked agents have made ambush-style arrests and quelled mostly peaceful protesters with force. Two people have been shot, one fatally, by federal agents since the operation began.

“The wave of violence against ICE has been driven by online apps and social media campaigns designed to put ICE officers at risk just for doing their jobs,” Bondi wrote. “The Department of Justice will continue engaging tech companies to eliminate platforms where radicals can incite imminent violence against federal law enforcement.”

Francis Brennan, a spokesperson for Facebook parent company Meta, said in a short statement that the page was taken down for “violating our policies against coordinated harm.” Brennan is a former 2020 Trump campaign advisor hired by Meta after Trump’s election to a second term.

Kae Rosado, the administrator of the now-defunct page who runs a small imported jewelry business, has already started a new one: “ICE Sightings-Chicagoland 2.”

“I started it simply to warn others because I seen some ICE agents were using excessive force & they didn’t seem to be following any safety protocols our local police typically do. It blew up into so much more,” Rosado wrote on her personal Facebook page. “Now its not only a representation of Chicago’s United community but an entire example of the Trump administration’s clear attempts at violating the U.S Constitution and Eliminating Freedom of Speech for anyone who doesn’t agree with him.”

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has aligned more closely with Trump since the president’s return to power. The company settled a $25 million lawsuit over the suspensions of Trump’s accounts following the Jan. 6 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. Meta also sent $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, canceled its diversity programs, got rid of fact-checkers and appointed Dana White, a close Trump ally and leader of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, to its board of directors.

Loomer had accused Zuckerberg of a “leftist subversion of Trump and his policies” in her post about the sightings page.

“You’d think other Big Tech executives would use this as an opportunity to be in compliance and to support President Trump’s immigration policies, but they aren’t,” Loomer wrote.

The move to shutter the Facebook page comes as the Trump administration continues to exert influence on tech companies and pressure Chicagoans and journalists documenting its aggressive immigration enforcement operations in the city.

Outside ICE’s Broadview processing facility, federal agents detained an independent journalist and allegedly fired a pepper ball into a TV news truck. A lengthy ban on drone flights over the city was seen by the ACLU as “suspiciously like an attempt” to “prevent reporters and citizens from recording the activities of authorities.”

Block Club Chicago is a plaintiff in a lawsuit that has led a judge to limit ICE’s ability to fire chemical agents at peaceful protesters and journalists.

Before a decision last week temporarily blocking a deployment of the National Guard, U.S. District Judge April Perry expressed doubt over the “credibility and assessment” of federal authorities in Chicago.

Happening In Chicago

A large presence of federal agents were seen in East Chicago Tuesday morning, leading to arrests and clashes with protesters. Agents were seen on video chasing people inside a Walgreens.

A federal vehicle crashed at 105th Street and Avenue N in East Chicago, leading to “at least 45 military officers” flooding the street, arresting three people and using tear gas on a gathering crowd, according to Southeast Side Rapid Response.

Two arrests were also made at 91st Street and Commercial Avenue and three arrests at 106th Street and Ewing Avenue, according to Southeast Side Rapid Response.

Village officials previously demanded that ICE agents take down fencing erected around the facility, saying it posed a safety hazard as it blocked fire department access to a road.

Last week, a federal judge ordered the fence to be taken down by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday.

But what if the government doesn’t comply?

Alexa Van Brunt, a Chicago-based attorney with the Illinois MacArthur Justice Center, discussed the possibility with NBC Chicago.

""When any party, any litigant, ignores a court order, you are facing potential contempt proceedings,"" Van Brunt explained. ""Judges have a lot of discretion to take certain actions.""

Van Brunt also directs the Civil Rights Litigation Clinic at the Northwestern Pritzker School of Law.

""What we really need to be concerned about is that they are held accountable for ignoring the law,"" she said.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Sec. Tricia McLaughlin defended the erected fences in a previous statement to NBC Chicago.

""DHS is extending fencing surrounding U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Broadview Processing Center after rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property,” she said.

Outside the ICE facility, more protests took place on Tuesday afternoon.

Less than a mile away, outside village hall, a one-man press conference was held by the Revolutionary Black Panther Party, demanding the mayor and village cease and desist limiting peaceful protest hours to the hours of 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the ICE facility.

""This restriction has been unlawful, and state police have been aggressors,"" said Dr. Alli Muhammad with the Revolutionary Black Panther Party.

They also asked that the concrete barriers be removed because they obstruct public visibility and access to the facility and surrounding sidewalks.

""The facility is open 24 hours… so we have a right to assemble in peace 24 hours,"" Muhammad said.

The Illinois State Police Unified Command issued a news release on Tuesday, announcing additional safety measures to ensure public safety that it said ""ensures the safe expression of First Amendment rights.""

Among those are the closures of sidewalks along the east and west sides of 25th Avenue between Filmore and Lexington streets.

According to Nicolle Wallace, that criticism is evidence that Trump’s grip over his base may be slipping.
The sights and sounds are proving to be too much for arguably the most influential podcaster in the MAGA-adjacent universe,” she added.
“We have a labor force in America, across many industries, that has been built on illegal labor,” Greene said.","Some of MAGA’s loudest voices are starting to turn on Donald Trump over his mass deportation efforts. Podcaster Joe Rogan and Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia have publicly condemned the administration over its immigration crackdown.

According to Nicolle Wallace, that criticism is evidence that Trump’s grip over his base may be slipping. “If Donald Trump’s political power lies in being able to convince his supporters of anything and everything, then loud public dissent from inside his coalition from prominent MAGA influencers might be the thing that will melt his carefully crafted alternative, fact-based reality faster than the Wicked Witch in ‘The Wizard of Oz,’” Wallace said on Monday’s “Deadline: White House.”

In recent weeks, social media has been flooded with images and videos of what Wallace described as the administration’s “brutal and ugly and clunky and wildly unpopular mass deportation scheme.”

“The sight and the sound and the smells of heavily armed federal agents sweeping up people with no criminal records — everyone from grandmas to kids — with arrests everywhere, from outside of schools to outside of bakeries, even to a Marine base. The sights and sounds are proving to be too much for arguably the most influential podcaster in the MAGA-adjacent universe,” she added.

Wallace then played a clip from Thursday’s “Joe Rogan Experience,” where the popular podcaster called Trump’s deportations “horrific.” He went on to say, “When you’re just arresting people in front of their kids and just normal, regular people that have been here for 20 years — everybody who has a heart can’t get along with that.”

While the “Deadline: White House” host acknowledged that Rogan has spoken out against Trump and his immigration policies in the past, she said it was important to note that he was “not alone.”

During an appearance on “The Tim Dillon Show,” Greene, who is usually among the president’s fiercest defenders in Congress, said she’s seen the damage of Trump’s immigration crackdown firsthand. “We have a labor force in America, across many industries, that has been built on illegal labor,” Greene said. “That’s a fact that also cannot be ignored, and as a conservative and as a business owner in the construction industry and as a realist, I can say we have to do something about labor, and that needs to be a smarter plan than just rounding up every single person and deporting them just like that, right?”

Greene stated she knew she would get “pushback” for her comments, but said she was just “living in reality from here on out.”

Wallace said that while there was “plenty to not like about Marjorie Taylor Greene and Joe Rogan,” those who oppose Trump’s crackdown should welcome their newfound criticism, noting that “if we could have done this on our own, we wouldn’t be here.”

“The reality of Trump’s mass deportation campaign and how it is impacting everyone of us, everyone is going to be touched by it, regardless of who you vote for — it’s starting to sink in,” Wallace said.

“The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk. Here are just a few examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the U.S,” the department added.

According to the department’s thread, an Argentinian national, a South African national, a Mexican national, a Brazilian national, a German national and a Paraguayan national all had their visas revoked over comments about Kirk’s assassination.

In a post on X, the State Department said the Argentine national said in an online post that Kirk “devoted his entire life spreading racist, xenophobic, misogynistic rhetoric” and deserves to burn in hell. In a separate post, the department claimed the South African national had “mocked Americans grieving the loss of Kirk” by saying in a post online that “they’re hurt that the racist rally ended in attempted martyrdom” and alleging “he was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash.”

“@POTUS and @SecRubio will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws,” the State Department said in their X thread. “Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.”

Following Kirk’s death, debates have arisen regarding his legacy, rhetoric, and the limits of free speech. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel had his show briefly suspended by ABC over comments he made about Kirk’s assassination, drawing heavy backlash from Democrats.

If the orders are extended, that would continue to keep Guard troops out of Portland until the Oct. 29 trial and a final judgment from Immergut.
More than that, they’ll decide whether the president has the authority to federalize the Oregon National Guard.
It’s a longer strategy should higher courts rule that Trump can control and deploy the Oregon National Guard.
“The Supreme Court hasn’t talked about National Guard federalization in almost two centuries,” Williams said.","It’s been two and a half weeks since President Donald Trump posted on social media that he would send the military to Portland, setting off a legal battle that is now in the hands of four judges in two different courts.

The ongoing legal fight has implications for cities including Los Angeles and Chicago, where Trump has, or has attempted, to deploy National Guard troops to federal buildings. Trump has argued that protesters are impeding federal immigration officials from carrying out their orders, though the generally small and peaceful protests at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland don’t support his argument.

The state of Oregon and the city of Portland contend Trump violated several laws and the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by attempting to deploy Guard troops to Portland over the objections of state and local elected leaders. Each of these issues deals with the balance of state and federal power — particularly related to authority over policing within states — and the extent of presidential power over the U.S. military.

“It’s not just Portland. If the ruling is in favor of the Trump administration on this matter, then it means that the president can pretty much deploy the National Guard to any city where the president says they (the federal government) are unable to enforce federal law,” said Tung Yin, a law professor at Portland’s Lewis & Clark College.

In the meantime, a district judge in Portland and three appellate judges in San Francisco are considering stop-gap decisions that would block Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from deploying Guard troops to Portland while everyone awaits an Oct. 29 trial.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, could decide as early as Wednesday whether to extend for two more weeks temporary restraining orders she first issued on Oct. 4 and Oct. 5, that barred Trump from federalizing and deploying any National Guard troops to Portland.

If the orders are extended, that would continue to keep Guard troops out of Portland until the Oct. 29 trial and a final judgment from Immergut.

But another decision expected this week from three judges on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco could end up nullifying Immergut’s orders altogether, opening the door for Guard deployment to Portland, said Willamette University professor Norman Williams, a constitutional law expert.

U.S. Appellate Judges Susan Graber, Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade — the first a former Oregon Supreme Court Justice and Clinton appointee, and the latter two appointed by Trump — are expected this week to rule whether Immergut’s first order, which barred Trump from federalizing the Oregon National Guard, can stand.

More than that, they’ll decide whether the president has the authority to federalize the Oregon National Guard. Two of the three judges signaled in a hearing Thursday that they were deferential to giving the president the power to federalize those troops.

If the judges rule that Trump can federalize and control the Oregon Guard, it would be difficult for Immergut to restrain when and where they are deployed, Williams explained. It’s more likely that the federal government would, following the 9th Circuit ruling, ask Immergut to stay — or stop — legal proceedings.

“There’s no statutory basis that would allow her to say, ‘They’ve been properly federalized, but I’m going to order them to barracks. They can’t be deployed outside the barracks.’ I don’t think that’s a possibility,” Williams said.

This, he added, is why Oregon has also argued that Trump is violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which bars federal troops from undertaking domestic law enforcement. It’s a longer strategy should higher courts rule that Trump can control and deploy the Oregon National Guard.

“So the federalization is just the first step, but the state would still have arguments about: ‘Have they been used in an appropriate fashion?’ And that would depend on what he (Trump) actually does with them,” Williams said.

Both Yin and Williams said that if the Ninth Circuit hands the power to federalize the Oregon National Guard to Trump, it’s likely attorneys for Oregon will request a fuller review, called an en banc court, by 11 appellate judges across the Ninth Circuit, which spans Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, the Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon and Washington.

Those judges would decide if the three appellate judges in California ruled erroneously.

Until then, however, Trump could likely deploy the federalized Guard troops.

If the appellate judges rule that Immergut’s orders and justification for them are valid, then the current state of affairs will remain unless the federal government asks for an emergency hearing before the U.S. Supreme Court.

“The Supreme Court hasn’t talked about National Guard federalization in almost two centuries,” Williams said. “This just doesn’t come up in part because presidents don’t do it in politically contentious ways that are going to spur likely litigation over it.”

Immergut on Wednesday will also decide whether to grant the federal government a new request that, if the state’s case against them moves forward in Oregon, it be delayed by a month until “at least” Nov. 20, rather than Oct. 29.

On Monday, Michael Gerardi, a lawyer for the U.S. Justice Department, wrote in a joint-status report that federal lawyers need more time to collect, review, redact and produce documents that Oregon’s lawyers have requested.

In that report, Gerardi also argued that because the president is granted great deference in his powers, that lawyers for Oregon should not be entitled to communications they’ve sought from the White House that would reveal more clearly what Trump and other leaders were discussing regarding Portland before Trump made his social media post.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC094901-1-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 20:57:43.227338

“Ms. Brockman and her legal team adamantly deny any allegation that she assaulted anyone. Rather, Ms. Brockman was the one who was violently assaulted by federal agents on her way to work. Ms. Brockman feared for her life multiple times throughout this terrifying experience,” according to the statement released by the People’s Law Office.

In a video of the incident taken by a witness, a man is heard asking Brockman who she is, to which she responds, “I am Debbie Brockman, and I work for WGN.”

“Ms. Brockman stated that she worked for WGN. She added this information because she hoped someone would notify her employer so her coworkers would know that she would not be arriving at work that day,” the law firm statement said. “Ms. Brockman wishes to clarify that at the time of this incident she was not acting in any professional capacity as an employee of WGN.”

WGN confirmed shortly after Brockman was detained that she works in the station’s creative services department, separate from the news department.

“During the morning hours this past Friday, Ms. Brockman was walking to the bus stop as part of her morning commute when she was attacked by Border Patrol agents,” according to the statement.

According to the law firm statement, “Ms. Brockman was taken to the ground, battered, handcuffed and her pants were pulled down exposing her bare buttocks. No one should be treated like that in this city, in this country, or anywhere else in the world.”

Brockman was arrested for assault on a federal law enforcement officer, according to DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

US Border Patrol was conducting immigration enforcement when “several violent agitators used their vehicles to block in agents in an effort to impede and assault federal officers,” McLaughlin said in a statement Friday.

Officers struck a suspect’s vehicle to create an opening, and as they were driving, “Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol’s car,” McLaughlin said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/still-22022258-3622-2377179080822-still.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-14 19:57:48.398781

Varela",,,,,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/immigration/article312505540.html,"Lawyers for the federal government say the government shutdown prevents them from working and are requesting that an appellate court pause a lawsuit over the controversial detention center in the Florida Everglades, Alligator Alcatraz.
The environmental groups disagreed with the request.
Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued this summer, accusing the federal and state governments of failing to adhere to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires a federal environmental impact assessment for large federal projects.
A lower district judge agreed with the environmental groups and ordered the site effectively shut down within 60 days.
The appellate court expedited the case, and the state’s opening brief was due to be filed on Oct. 24, with oral arguments scheduled for January.","Lawyers for the federal government say the government shutdown prevents them from working and are requesting that an appellate court pause a lawsuit over the controversial detention center in the Florida Everglades, Alligator Alcatraz.

In a filing on Friday, Department of Justice lawyers asked the Atlanta-based Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to pause proceedings in the appeal filed by the DeSantis administration to overturn a lower-court decision siding with environmental groups who said the government had circumvented federal environmental regulations when building the makeshift facility.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including “emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,” the federal government lawyers stated.

The environmental groups disagreed with the request. They argued that if the appeals case is paused, the site’s operations and construction – which were allowed to continue after the appellate court overturned the lower court’s injunction – could cause more harm to the surrounding Everglades wetlands during the shutdown, the length of which is unknown.

“The balance of harms favors denying an indefinite stay in this case, which would cause Plaintiffs ongoing and irreversible harm,” the lawyers for the environmental group said. Any further construction and operation of the facility “imperils sensitive wetlands, endangered Species, and communities in the area,” they added.

The federal government shutdown has now added another obstacle to one of the multiple lawsuits challenging the legality of the tent detention facility built on the airstrip of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.

Environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe sued this summer, accusing the federal and state governments of failing to adhere to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), which requires a federal environmental impact assessment for large federal projects. A lower district judge agreed with the environmental groups and ordered the site effectively shut down within 60 days.

The state and federal governments argued that NEPA does not apply to the state, and the appellate court agreed with them, suspending the lower court’s decision pending arguments on the merits of the appeal and wresting the case from District Judge Kathleen Williams until the appeal is resolved.

The appellate court expedited the case, and the state’s opening brief was due to be filed on Oct. 24, with oral arguments scheduled for January.

The federal government lawyers told the court in their Friday filing that they would resume “as soon as Congress has appropriated funds for the Department.”

Lawyers for the environmental groups said, “It is indeed regrettable that the lapse in appropriations has disrupted the Department of Justice,” but maintained that there was an urgency to address the “irreversible harms” to the environment, given the ongoing construction at the facility.

On Tuesday, the environmental groups filed a related lawsuit against the Florida Division of Emergency Management for failing to disclose records regarding its agreements with the federal government to receive reimbursement from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for expenses related to Alligator Alcatraz.

On Sept. 30, FEMA approved the DeSantis administration’s $608 million grant request to cover the cost of operations at Alligator Alcatraz and other immigration detention facilities, including Deportation Depot.

The transfer of funds between the federal government and the state was a key point in the appeal judges’ decision to support the government’s claim that NEPA does not apply to states.

“When the Court of Appeals issued its order pausing the trial court’s order halting operations at the detention center, the Court of Appeals said more than once that the Florida Department of Emergency Management had not applied for federal funding,” Paul Schwiep of Coffey Burlington, the lawyer for the environmental groups, said in a statement.

Jack Dickinson, 26, has deployed a similar tactic — and has been a regular fixture of the protest scenes — by wearing a chicken suit and American flag cape.

""What they rely on is fear,"" he told Willamette Week. ""So by coming out in an absurdist manner, it speaks to them, to some extent, that we're actually not that afraid.""

Meanwhile, even local lawmakers are capitalizing on the stunt.

Attorney General Nick Brown is proposing legislation, dubbed the Immigrant Worker Protection Act, that would require employers to notify their employees of a planned inspection of employment eligibility paperwork within 72 hours of being notified about it by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Other states, including California, Oregon and Illinois, already have similar laws.

The attorney general’s office notes workplace raids are increasing under President Donald Trump. But first, federal immigration agents usually tell employers they want to audit I-9 documents.

“While the employer is given 72 hours to gather and produce their employees’ I-9 forms, employees often have no idea that their I-9 documents are being sent for review,” spokesperson Mike Faulk said. “This bill would give workers the opportunity to get their documentation in order, speak to an attorney, or make plans with their family if needed.”

Employers fill out I-9 forms for all of their employees. On the forms, workers attest to their legal status or authorization to work in the United States, and must provide documentation to that effect.

Businesses can use the federal E-Verify system to compare an employee’s I-9 to government data to determine their eligibility to work. Many states require at least some employers to use E-Verify, but Washington isn’t one of them.

The proposed law would protect against raids like one earlier this year at a Bellingham roofing company.

Immigration officials had reportedly asked Mt. Baker Roofing for I-9 documentation for its workers. Investigators said they found 56 employees had given false information. They used this information to get a judge to sign off on a warrant to search the company’s warehouse. In an early morning raid in April, federal agents arrested 37 people.

In May, agents arrested 17 workers at Eagle Beverage and Accessories Products in Kent, with the help of the Internal Revenue Service. Authorities attributed the arrests to employees presenting fraudulent work documents attesting to their immigration status.

The Biden administration had paused such large-scale workplace raids, and instead focused on holding employers accountable for hiring unauthorized workers. The Trump administration restarted the practice this year.

One of the Trump era’s largest workplace immigration operations came last month, when agents arrested nearly 500 workers, mostly South Korean citizens, at a car plant in Georgia.

The executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network called Brown’s proposal “an important means of transparency for workers.”

“Immigrant communities who are essential to the economic and cultural vitality of our state are facing enormous threats because of the federal government’s ongoing mass detention and deportation agenda, while also struggling to meet basic needs,” Catalina Velasquez said in a statement.

On the other hand, state Rep. Jim Walsh, the chair of the Washington Republican Party, called it a “clear effort to undermine enforcement of federal immigration law.”

“It’s not clever. It’s not smart,” Walsh, R-Aberdeen, said in a text message Tuesday. “It’s decadent. And it puts the interests of illegal aliens ahead of the rights of American citizens.”

The attorney general’s office and state Department of Labor and Industries would enforce the policy.

Brown outlined his proposal in a Labor Day report last month on his office’s efforts to protect workers, and in a request for funding to Gov. Bob Ferguson. Lawmakers next year will approve a supplemental budget building on the two-year spending plan they passed this year.

Brown wants about $400,000 to carry out the law if it is passed. Some of that money would go to community organizations like the solidarity network for outreach and education work.

US revokes visas from six foreign nationals for social media comments critical of Charlie Kirk

In a stunning departure for an administration that came to power vowing to stop social-media censorship, Donald Trump’s state department announced on Tuesday that it had revoked the visas of six foreign nationals who posted critical comments on social media about Charlie Kirk, in the wake of the conservative activist’s murder.

“The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,” the US state department said in a statement posted on X. “The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.”

The state department then listed six “examples of aliens who are no longer welcome in the U.S.” in a thread on the social media platform owned by Elon Musk, the Trump donor who called himself “a free speech absolutist” before buying the site formerly known as Twitter.

The thread included screenshots and quotes from people identified as foreign nationals of Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa.

None of the individuals was identified by name, but the screenshots made it possible to trace the identities of two people, including one who had been singled out for abuse by conservatives on X.

“Charlie Kirk won’t be remembered as a hero,” one of the comments posted on X read. “He was used to astroturf a movement of white nationalist trailer trash!”

The thread ended with a statement from the state department that Trump and the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, “will defend our borders, our culture, and our citizens by enforcing our immigration laws. Aliens who take advantage of America’s hospitality while celebrating the assassination of our citizens will be removed.”

Last month, a deputy secretary of state, Christopher Landau, urged social media users to send him posts critical of Kirk, saying he was “disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalizing, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”

The administration has previously ramped up efforts to identify and potentially expel thousands of foreign students it accuses of participating in unrest in the form of protests against Israel’s mass killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza. The administration has also required foreign visitors to make their social media accounts public so that they can be checked before they are allowed to enter the land of the free.

In recent months, the administration has expelled South Africa’s ambassador to the US for comments critical of Trump, revoked a visa for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York and cancelled visas of the visas for British punk-rap duo Bob Vylan.

The government has also said it is reviewing the status of the more than 55 million holders of visas to enter the US for potential violations of its standards.

Those actions have been criticized by civil rights groups as blatant violations of constitutional protections for freedom of speech, which apply to anyone in the US, not just citizens.

Leaders of Young Republican groups in New York, Kansas, Arizona and Vermont used racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic slurs in private Telegram group chat messages over a period of seven months obtained by Politico, the news outlet reports.

The young Republicans referred to Black people as monkeys and “the watermelon people” and joked about raping their enemies, driving them to suicide or putting them in gas chambers.

One of the Young Republican leaders, Peter Giunta, recently presented an award to Elise Stefanik, the pro-Trump congresswoman expected to run for governor, as chair of the New York State Young Republicans.

Giunta also praised teen activists who “support slavery” as “based.”

Congress remained deadlocked on legislation to reopen the federal government, as the US Senate on Tuesday again rejected a Republican plan to end the government shutdown that began two weeks ago.

The eighth Senate vote to advance a Republican bill that would fund government operations through 21 November failed on a 49-45 tally – far short of the 60 needed for advancement in the chamber. In a sign that that there has been little if any progress toward ending the stalemate, no senators changed their votes from the last time the measure was brought to the floor, though there were a handful of absences.

Earlier on Tuesday, the House speaker, Mike Johnson said he won’t negotiate with Senate Democrats as the government shutdown dragged into its 14th day, while defending the Trump administration’s decision to shuffle Pentagon funds to make sure military personnel get their paychecks.

Trump previously called presidential medal 'much better' than top military award

The White House ceremony in honor of Charlie Kirk has now concluded.

At a campaign event last year, Donald Trump said that the Presidential Medal of Freedom for civilians, which he bestowed on Kirk on Tuesday, was “much better” than the top military award for those killed or wounded in action: the Medal of Honor.

Trump was widely criticized for that comment, made as he addressed Miriam Adelson, the widow of the Republican mega-donor Sheldon Adelson. Trump had awarded Miriam Adelson the Medal of Freedom in 2018.

The civilian medal, Trump told supporters then, is “actually much better because everyone [who] gets the congressional Medal of Honor, they’re soldiers.”

“They’re either in very bad shape because they’ve been hit so many times by bullets or they’re dead. She gets it, and she’s a healthy, beautiful woman. And they’re rated equal.”

Charlie Kirk is not the first to receive the medal from Trump posthumously. During his first term, he gave it to Babe Ruth, Elvis Presley and Antonin Scalia.

In 2020, Trump also presented the medal to the rightwing radio host Rush Limbaugh during a State of the Union address.

In his speech at the memorial for Kirk in Arizona last month, Trump revealed that Limbaugh was one of Kirk’s role models. “He was an Eagle scout who spent his school lunch breaks listening to another champion for liberty, somebody that he greatly admired, Rush Limbaugh,” Trump said.

In paying tribute to Kirk, Trump railed against “radical left extremism, violence and terror.”

He asserted: “They have the devil’s ideology… They seem to become very violent on the left.”

Trump claimed these attacks included the attempt on his own life at a campaign rally last year, even though the would-be assassin had no apparent political motive.

The president went on tout his law and order crackdown on US cities. “We’ve done a great job.”

He said of Washington: “We’re done with the angry mobs.” He claimed the city is now safe.

But then police car sirens wailed near the White House. Trump, however, insisted: “That’s a beautiful sound. They’re stopping crime. That’s what they’re doing.”

Sirens interrupt Trump's boasts about ending crime in Washington DC

As Donald Trump boasted about the impact of his federal takeover of policing in the District of Columbia, blaring sirens could be heard in the distance, undermining his claim that there is no longer any crime in the capital city.

Trump then claimed, falsely, that sirens were previously not heard in Washington DC because the city’s police force did not respond to crime.

“You hear those sirens going off? That’s good, that’s a good sound,” the president said. “That means they either got the bad guy, or are gonna stop the bad guy. You didn’t hear that sound, because nobody wanted to do anything.”

Trump referred to the government shutdown and commented: “We’re dealing with some radical left lunatics.”

He suggested that Kirk would have responded by organising a young people’s march on the US Capitol.

Trump said: “Charles James Kirk was a visionary and one of the greatest leaders of his generation.”

The president seemed to be telling Kirk’s life story but veered off into talking about his past election campaigns. “Too big to rig.”

Trump praises Charlie Kirk at Presidential Medal of Freedom ceremony

Donald Trump just began his remarks by praising his own renovation of what he called “the new and improved Rose Garden, and people are loving it”. He also drew attention to the new “presidential walk of fame”, which is a gallery of portraits of 44 of the 45 men to have served as president, with an image of an automatic pen in place of Joe Biden.

Trump said that they were gathered to honor “the late, great Charlie Kirk”, the founder of the conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA he is awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honor.

The president took issue with the characterization of Kirk at his memorial in Arizona as someone who loved his enemies. “He didn’t necessarily love those enemies”, Trump said.

Trump also suggested that he would have asked to push back the ceremony so that he could stay longer in the Middle East with the wealthy leaders of Gulf nations, but “October 14 is Charlie’s birthday, and he should have been turning 32 years old”.

The president went on to give a largely familiar political speech, attacking Democrats as “radical left lunatics” and making jokes about the ABC host George Stephanopoulos, whose name he intentionally mispronounced.

Trump also suggested that the current government shutdown would have been ended by Kirk, had he not been killed last month in Utah, who would have led “a march on the Capitol.”

Here's a recap of the day so far

Donald Trump said that a list of ‘Democrat programs’ that White House plans to cut will be released on Friday. He noted that he plans to cut “egregious, semi-communist” programs that, he claims, Democrats hold dear, but doesn’t plan to touch Republican programs, “because we think they work”. While hosting Javier Milei, president of Argentina, Trump took questions from reporters, in what became a far-ranging, impromptu press conference.

Trump warned that Hamas must disarm ‘or we will disarm them’. Trump added that could happen “quickly and perhaps violently”. When he was asked about a timeline for disarmament, the president said that it would be “a reasonable period of time … pretty quickly”. So far, Trump has been taking a victory lap, complete with bipartisan praise, for brokering the hostage-prisoner exchange on Monday, and the ceasefire deal in Gaza.

Earlier, Donald Trump announced on Tuesday that the United States has struck another small boat that he accuses of carrying drugs in waters off the coast of Venezuala, killing six people aboard. “The strike was conducted in International Waters, and six male narcoterrorists aboard the vessel were killed in the strike,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. “No U.S. Forces were harmed.”

Back in Washington, the government shutdown enters its 14th day, with no end in sight. House Republicans continued to criticize the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, who they accuse of holding out on the House-passed funding bill to appease the left-wing base of his party. “We’re certainly not going to allow the American people to be taken hostage for his political gain,” House speaker Mike Johnson said today. Meanwhile Democrats, claim their colleagues across the aisle have abandoned good faith negotiations. House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries said that Republicans have gone “radio silent” since congressional leadership met with Trump at the White House days before the shutdown began. The Senate will hold its eighth vote, in the hopes of passing a funding bill to reopen the government. Spoiler alert: it’s unlikely to happen.

The supreme court declined to hear Alex Jones’s challenge to a $1.4bn judgment awarded to families of the victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in 2012. Jones, a noted conspiracy theorist and founder of Infowars, made several false statements that the shooting – which killed 20 children – was a hoax.

On the campaign trail, Maine’s Democratic governor, Janet Mills, has officially announced that she’s running for US Senate, challenging the incumbent, Republican Susan Collins. Mills, 77, will face a primary challenge from Graham Platner, the progressive oyster farmer entering politics for the first time and backed by Independent senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont.

Trump threatens to take world cup hosting away from Boston

Donald Trump floated taking away Boston’s ability to host several 2026 World Cup matches, calling out mayor Michelle Wu. “She’s intelligent, but she’s radical left,” Trump said, while offering to send federal law enforcement to the city. “All she has to do is call us. We’ll go in and take them back. But she’s afraid to, because she thinks it’s bad politically.”

Trump added that if he feels that the city is “unsafe” he will “call up Gianni” and tell him to move the games to another location. Gianni Infantino, the head of Fifa, has emerged as an ally of the president as the games inch closer.

“Boston better clean up their act, that’s all I can say,” Trump said.

“What we are looking for is the executive agency to meet its obligation under the appropriation statute to spend $28 million in the furtherance of services and activities of the legal orientation program.” U.S.","WASHINGTON (CN) — A D.C. Circuit panel on Tuesday appeared doubtful that the Trump administration’s sudden cancellation of a federal contracting program providing legal advice and services to immigrants was legal if the government fails to begin providing the same services itself.

The three-judge panel heard arguments brought by a coalition of 12 immigrant rights groups, which served as government subcontractors for several “legal orientation” programs previously paid for and administered by the Department of Justice’s Executive Office of Immigration Review.

When President Donald Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, he issued an executive order titled “Protecting the American People Against Invasion,” which directed the Justice Department to pause distribution of all government contract funds to nongovernmental organizations “supporting or providing services, either directly or indirectly, to removable or illegal aliens” pending review.

On Jan. 22, the Justice Department issued a stop-work order to Acacia Center for Justice, the main contractor the plaintiffs subcontract with.

The same day, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement also told its employees that the Executive Office of Immigration Review was pausing all legal orientation services and instructed any informational posters about the program to be taken down in ICE housing units and its law library.

Led by the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, the coalition filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on Jan. 31, arguing that the government’s decision flouted Congress’ decision to allocate $28 million to the program in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act.

The coalition specifically challenges the apparent termination of the Legal Orientation Program, the Immigration Court Helpdesk and the Legal Orientation Program for Custodians, which provide legal services to detained immigrants, non-detained immigrants and the custodians of unaccompanied minors, respectively.

Laura Sturges, attorney of Gibson Dunn and representing the providers, argued U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss wrongfully granted the government summary judgment after finding he did not have jurisdiction over the providers’ claims due to the Tucker Act.

The 1887 statute gives the U.S. Court of Federal Claims purview over most contractual claims.

Sturges said the Barack Obama appointee was wrong to accept declarations from acting director of the Executive Office of Immigration Review Sirce Owens that alluded to an “ill-defined” federalized version of the program that would no longer require third-party providers. She urged the panel to remand the case to allow Moss to rule on a more extensive record.

Sturges maintained that the providers were challenging the work stoppage itself rather than trying to restore their specific contracts, and thus, the only adequate relief they could obtain was an injunction lifting the stop-work order. The distinction would untie the Tucker Act from the case.

“The purpose of the services and activities of the legal orientation program are certainly to make the immigration courts more efficient and to provide the modicum of due process, the very bare minimum of due process for detained non-citizens going through the immigration system,” Sturges said.

U.S. Circuit Judge Gregory Katsas, a Trump appointee, noted Tuesday’s case was the latest “shutdown case,” a term for the challenges against the Trump administration’s effort to reshape the federal government by gutting independent agencies and related federal programs.

Katas said there were two categories of shutdown cases: cases like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, where the watchdog’s effective shutdown would injure consumers of the agency’s services; and cases like the Voice of America, where the media outlet amounted to a specifically named contractor receiving earmarked funds from Congress.

He asked Sturges how her case fit into that framework, to which she responded that the providers were around decades before the program itself existed, and their missions were now being thwarted by the government’s actions.

Justice Department attorney Sean Janda urged the panel to affirm Moss’ summary judgment ruling, arguing that on either challenged action — the termination of the Acacia contract and the federalization of the program — the providers fail because their claims can only be heard by the Court of Federal Claims.

Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Sri Srinivasan, an Obama appointee, asked whether the Federal Claims court would have sole jurisdiction in a case where the Justice Department completely stopped providing services, where the elimination of contracts is just part of that wider effort.

Janda suggested beneficiaries of the services could challenge the wider termination of the program but maintained that the providers’ only remedy here is related to their contracts and thus are limited to Federal Claims review.

“We’re not looking for damages — giving us money now does not solve our problem, which has been that every day, we are unable to provide the services that our organizations have been designed to provide,” Sturges said in her rebuttal. “What we are looking for is the executive agency to meet its obligation under the appropriation statute to spend $28 million in the furtherance of services and activities of the legal orientation program.”

U.S. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, rounded out the panel.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/07/donald-trump-and-kristi-noem-tour-alligator-alcatraz.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-14 16:58:13.026622

Then, in early March, after legal pushback, the migrants were bussed back and dropped off in Panama City after dark.
By the first week of June, when the migrants’ once-extended permits were set to expire again, only 24 migrants remained.
On their last day together, Jharana and the other Nepali women at the shelter swapped cooking shifts with another group of migrants.
The Afghan girl stayed behind in Tapachula; one of the four remaining Nepali women went to join her husband.","On a humid evening in early June, Jharana Chhetri said good-bye to the group of people she had come to know intimately over her last three months in Panama.

Jharana had freshly showered and wore an orange and white T-shirt with a tie-dye design. She and a small group — two other Nepali women, one of whom was her closest friend, a Nepali boy she had taken under her wing, and a young woman from Afghanistan — were ready to leave what had been their home since March. It was already dark by the time their car backed into the dirt driveway of the migrant-reception center in the outer rim of Panama City. Jharana hugged each person who was staying behind. When some of the women started to tear up, she steadied their shoulders. “Be strong,” she said.

Jharana, which is a nickname she asked to use to protect her privacy, and the other Nepalis at the center had met in January, when they crossed into the U.S. and turned themselves in to Border Patrol. Jharana had been traveling for two years by that point; in total, she spent 22 days in detention. The whole time, she was sustained by the hope that she would soon be reunited with her husband, who had arrived in the U.S. in 2022 to request asylum; he now had work authorization. “I kept thinking, I’ve made it, I’m here, I’ll see him soon,” she said.

Stranded

The second Trump administration has deported more than 8,100 people to places other than their countries of origin — also known as third countries. Some have been sent to foreign prisons or active war zones; other third countries have not offered long-term plans for legal status. A series about what happens next.

Instead, Jharana and her group of Nepalis were ushered onto a flight one early morning in February, in a group of about 300 migrants of various nationalities. The pilot and staff told them that it would be a six-hour journey to their destination but did not entertain any questions. Jharana believed they were being transferred to another detention facility in the U.S. It was only when the pilot announced their arrival in Panama that she understood what had happened. They had been sent back to the country with one of the deadliest land-migration routes in the world — the Darién Gap — which they had already passed through on their way up to the U.S. border from South America, after flying there on a multi-stop journey from Nepal. “After all that travel, all those difficulties, all that walking in the jungle for days, we were back there again,” she said. Jharana and other Nepali women started weeping loudly.

Most migrants in the cohort spoke little to no Spanish. Jharana was one of the few who spoke a little English, which catapulted her into the role of a sort of middlewoman — someone gathering and disseminating information to her group. Becoming a de facto leader “wasn’t so intentional,” she said. “I needed to get information for myself anyway, so it just ended up being the case that I was also asking for others.” Upon arriving in Panama, the migrants were separated by nationality, and locked up in the Decapolis Hotel, unable to leave their rooms except for meals and not allowed to speak with family or lawyers. But Jharana and the others watched the news on the TV sets in their rooms. With lipstick, they scrawled pleas for help on the windows.

Photos of this group barricaded in their hotel inspired headlines around the world. This was the first cohort to be hastily dumped in a third country in what would become a central tactic of the Trump administration’s deportation policy — one that human-rights groups have argued ignores the law and violates due process. And yet today many of the migrants are still stuck in Panama, a country where less than one percent of asylum applicants were approved in 2022 and the top border official said it would “never” offer asylum to “these people”; others, like Jharana, have decided finally to move on. All of their lives have been marked by the fleeting bonds they’ve made with others along the way, both forged and undone by circumstance. “That is just the nature of the journey,” Jharana said.“It is so difficult — and we become close in the process of checking up on each other and asking, ‘Are you okay?’”

Under pressure from the Trump administration, Panama had agreed to accept the migrants temporarily, acting as a bridge to their home countries or to other countries where they might be resettled, but it proved more complicated than the government expected. The U.S. had not screened most of these migrants for asylum and other types of protection, and it was against international law for Panama to send them back to their home countries if they expressed fear of being harmed there. So by March 18, the U.N.’s migration agency repatriated around 60 percent of the migrants who agreed to be sent to their home countries (although migrants later said that they felt coerced, and at least one had not fully realized what they were consenting to). The rest decided to stay in Panama, expressing fear of persecution or harm back home.

Among those who remained were women fleeing armed conflict in Cameroon, men who had escaped gang violence in Nigeria, Iranian women who had converted to Christianity and feared religious persecution, and Pakistani and Afghan migrants who were evading the Taliban. Jharana had spent two years of her life and thousands of dollars trying to make it to the U.S.; going back at that point would have meant resigning herself to a future of debilitating debt in a country in freefall. Nepal is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, and more than 400,000 people have left the country owing to climate disasters between 2008 and 2014 that put a stranglehold on its economy; political unrest has also swept the region. After Jharana’s husband left for America on the advice of a friend, following him felt inevitable. Jharana took out loans and paid $44,000 up front to the smuggler for a multi-stop package common among Indians and Nepali migrants, who pay much higher costs than migrants from elsewhere. By the time she landed in Panama, she only had around $200 left.

The Panamanian government agreed to keep migrants temporarily while it waited for a third country to accept them but, wary of the press frenzy, sent them to a camp in the Darién Gap for about four weeks. Conditions there, the migrants said, were unlivable. They had no access to their phones, and there were reports of unclean water and rotting food. The bathrooms had no doors, which for many migrants from conservative cultures and religious backgrounds that stressed modesty was particularly humiliating. Some got sick, one with dengue. “I can’t even express how bad it was,” Jharana said. “No one should have to go through something like that.”

In one instance, the guards patrolling them 24/7 hit an Iranian woman who begged for access to her phone. Syed Saqlain Badshah, a 26-year-old who fled the Taliban in Northwest Pakistan, said that the group was shocked and enraged that they hurt a woman. When the holy month of Ramadan started, Badshah asked for his phone so he could listen to, and carry out, his daily prayers. The guards laughed and made jokes, he said. “I got very angry,” Badshah said. “I said, ‘You’re laughing at our ritual and our religion.’”

In the turmoil, Jharana clung to a group of people she shared a language and national background with. One of them, whom she affectionately called “Niru,” had accompanied Jharana all the way from Nepal; another was a lanky 18-year-old boy named Milan, who reminded her of her own teenage son back home and whom she had picked up along the journey months prior in Brazil. She became close with a few other Nepali women in their 20s and 30s with whom she had been detained in the U.S. back in January.

Then, in early March, after legal pushback, the migrants were bussed back and dropped off in Panama City after dark. An American researcher, lawyer, and a few UNICEF officials received them and took the families in the group to the hotel that would become their home. The researcher Caitlyn Yates, an anthropologist who studies migration, bought the rest some fast food and put them up at a hotel for the night with her own funds (which she later recuperated through donations). Around 60 in that group moved into a school turned shelter run by the Jesuit nonprofit Fe y Alegría.

On their first day, they got a hot meal and some much-needed reassurance from Father Marco Tulio Gómez, director of Fe y Alegría’s Panama operations. “I told them, ‘You are free here,’” he said. The diversity of languages and disparate cultural habits posed some initial difficulties. But the staff went to great lengths to accommodate them: They made it possible for the women who were uncomfortable sleeping in the open, in the vicinity of men, to use private quarters. During Ramadan, they brought in a local imam for the Muslims. They took the Christians to church. Jharana, who is Hindu, could not avail herself of these benefits, but nevertheless she felt welcomed. For the first time since she arrived in Panama, “I felt like I was in my home with my family,” Jharana said.

Throughout March and April, the shelter saw a flurry of visits by reporters, researchers, officials, lawyers, and members of international organizations. Almost everyone who applied for asylum got a quick rejection, so every couple of weeks, officials would say they were asking another third country to take them. According to Yates, who — along with a number of advocacy organizations — was part of the talks with several countries to take these migrants, prospects looked positive at first, but they were “strung up for weeks or months” and would ultimately fail because of some small “logistical, bureaucratic or legal hurdle.” Jharana and the others understood that they were all being given the runaround. “Two or so months went by just like this: waiting, waiting,” she said. By the third month, the outside visits became sparse and boredom set in.

Without jobs or expendable income, the migrants didn’t have much to do. Some formed their own routines. An Afghan man named Hidayat Zazai, who had served in the Afghan special forces alongside the U.S. military and fled when the Taliban took over Kabul, said that he walked for hours around the neighborhood every day — often returning at dusk. A Nigerian man who fled armed militants back home and, for that reason, only wanted to go by his initials D.R.O., said he tended to keep to himself: work out during the day and take online Spanish lessons in the evening on his phone. “I normally sit alone and maybe make friends with my phone — it gives me company,” he said.

The Nepali women walked to local stores for lotions and bright lipsticks; they played Uno nonstop for weeks, until they tired of that too; some days, they picked fights with each other just to have something to do. Jharana was gregarious and outgoing; she tried to find joy in the newness — strange fruit at the market or marveling at scenery. She passed time by making TikToks in the shelter kitchen or in the nearby parking lot of the Super 99 store under a palm tree, lip-syncing and dancing to Hindi and Nepali songs. “We’ve wasted so much time,” Jharana said. “Might as well get some laughs out of it.” She encouraged the others to “to go see things and talk to everyone” instead of stewing in their room, but they didn’t like being told this; they didn’t think there was any point.

The Panamanian government had given out 30-day permits to the migrants who remained in the country starting in March, with the option of extending for up to 90 days. These recurring, short-term deferrals created a cloud of protracted uncertainty over the shelter that was perhaps strategic, Father Gomez said. The limbo was meant to wear the migrants down, push them to leave Panama. And it worked. After the first four weeks, the first group that “couldn’t take it” anymore, departed the shelter — frequently traveling north. After that, every month, about ten more followed.

By the first week of June, when the migrants’ once-extended permits were set to expire again, only 24 migrants remained. The large gymnasium in the compound, once lined on three sides with mattresses, now seemed deserted. Murmurs of a six-month extension were buzzing around that week — and would be announced later that month — but no lasting solution was on the horizon. Jharana was restless. This whole time, she hadn’t even told her in-laws in Nepal, whom she was closer to than her actual parents, where she was because she didn’t want to worry them. She was anxious to start making money and supporting her family, to actually start living a life — even if it was not the one she had imagined. “What would we do sitting here for another six months without being able to work?” Jharana told me.

Three members of the original Nepali group had left Fe y Alegría for Mexico City in late spring; fed up with waiting around, Jharana decided to follow suit. She shared the idea with her husband, and he agreed to send her the money — around $2,500 — for the journey. Once she was sure, she floated the idea to Niru and Milan and the rest of the Nepali group, asking if anyone else wanted to come along; their responses hinged on access to money.

Some had no relatives left to rely on, or the ones they did have back home were too burdened with debt from the sunk cost of their first journey to America to help them out a second time. Zazai, who had fled the Taliban, wanted to move on to Mexico, too, for instance, where he knew many Afghans were biding their time until it became safe to try to seek asylum in the U.S. again, but he had no choice but to stay in Panama. Three of the Nepali women also stayed behind, two for financial reasons; their relatives had put up their homes as collateral and were paying back their debts in monthly installments. Niru still had some relatives who could send her the money she needed for the trip to Mexico; Milan was from a village in Central Nepal where every household scrounged together money to send their boys to America — his relatives were able to help pay for him to move on.

On their last day together, Jharana and the other Nepali women at the shelter swapped cooking shifts with another group of migrants. Around 2 p.m., they took over the communal kitchen, boiling chicken and chopping onions, eggplants, tomatoes, and potatoes. In response to Jharana’s occasional directions, the youngest in the group jokingly used an Urdu honorific meant to signal seniority and high regard: “Okay, huzoor,” she said.

The women piled up the chicken curry and sabzi onto plates along with large mountains of white rice. Jharana rang Milan, who promptly sauntered in, watching a cricket match on his phone. They sat down to their last meal together. “In that time of sorrow, we were together,” Jharana said. “So when another trying time approaches, I’ll think of these people and gain strength.”

Jharana and her small group traveled by car and occasionally bus across successive borders up to Mexico. The acute pain she felt the day she left Fé y Alegría started to fade a couple of days into the journey. She has come to see separation as an inevitable part of her life on the move. “That’s how I steady myself and carry on — and I have to, right?” she added. “It’s necessary to get a hold of myself because no one else is around to do it for me.”

Upon arrival in Mexico in mid-June, the group splintered further. The Afghan girl stayed behind in Tapachula; one of the four remaining Nepali women went to join her husband. Niru, Milan, and Jharana rented a studio with a kitchen through an acquaintance for $500. They found an Indian store to buy ingredients to cook Nepali food. Some days, they explored the city a little and learned from others what they could do for work. Jharana felt her Spanish was improving.

Around two weeks after she arrived in Mexico City, Jharana applied for asylum with the help of a local lawyer. Around the same time, she posted a photo of herself on TikTok in front of the Metropolitan Cathedral in Mexico City with a caption in Nepali: “Seeking respect above your status is your greatest folly.”

At the end of August, Milan left the trio for the U.S.-Mexico border, paying up to $17,000 hoping to cross again to join relatives. “I felt really bad when he left,” Jharana said, “but he didn’t feel like he had an opportunity here.” By September, he had crossed and joined an uncle in America. Now, Niru, who is currently staying with Jharana at their third apartment in the outskirts of the city, is also considering another border crossing.

Jharana received a temporary document in September that allows her to stay in Mexico City for a year — and certifies that she is in the asylum process. When she gets work authorization, she wants to open a hair salon and set her own hours. After two years, she and her husband, who will have likely got his asylum decision by then, will recalibrate their plans. Every day, she talks to her boys. The younger one, 6, calls her some morning before catching the bus to school. The older one, 16, is now in 11th grade. She checks in with the migrants she left behind at Fé y Alegría less often. “I try to look out for people around me, make sure no one is feeling hurt, even when no one has asked this of me,” she said. “But I don’t feel like I have anyone like that here to do that for me.”",https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f90/112/bad78c5d9b5b7e340d4bbb0a6e63345ef0-third-countries-part-two-02.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:57:52.361432

The insertion of the language in effect means states are still being asked to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo the award of grants, and states have a right to accept grants without the conditions, Smith wrote.
The order comes as critics have accused the Trump administration of refusing to comply with court orders, especially in litigation related to immigration.
Even though the inserted language anticipates an appeal, the government as of Tuesday appears to have not done so.
The docket for the case contains no notice of appeal to the appellate court with jurisdiction, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit.","A federal judge rebuked the Trump administration Tuesday for “a ham-handed attempt to bully the states” that also defied his court order against conditioning eligibility for federal funds on cooperation with immigration enforcement.

Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for Rhode Island, an appointee of George W. Bush, last month issued an order to prevent the Department of Homeland Security from requiring those conditions on state and local recipients of Federal Emergency Management Agency grants.

Smith, in an order Tuesday, said DHS since then has inserted those conditions on award letters along with statements that the conditions will become immediately effective if Smith’s order is lifted or wiped out on an appeal.

“Defendants’ new condition is not a good faith effort to comply with the order; it is a ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make at the risk of losing critical disaster and other funding already appropriated by Congress,” Smith wrote.

The insertion of the language in effect means states are still being asked to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo the award of grants, and states have a right to accept grants without the conditions, Smith wrote.

“The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference,” Smith wrote. “No matter how confident Defendants may be of their chances on appeal, at present, the contested conditions are unlawful.”

Smith’s latest order bars FEMA from enforcing the contested conditions and “any materially similar term requiring cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.”

Additionally, the order requires states to “amend all award documents” within seven days to remove all mention of compliance with immigration law from award letters to localities.

The order comes as critics have accused the Trump administration of refusing to comply with court orders, especially in litigation related to immigration.

Even though the inserted language anticipates an appeal, the government as of Tuesday appears to have not done so. The docket for the case contains no notice of appeal to the appellate court with jurisdiction, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit.

Congress had appropriated more than $1 billion to the state under the initiatives, which include the Emergency Management Performance Grant, the Homeland Security Grant Program and Port Security Grant Program, according to a court filing in the cases from officials in 20 states.

The states argued the new language effectively requires them to affirm they would cooperate with federal officials in violation of the earlier order, saying the change “is materially identical to the text of the vacated and enjoined Contested Conditions.””

The states contended they must still agree to be bound by the conditions, it’s just they must “agree to be bound by them at a later date, if a specific event occurs.”

The Trump administration argued the conditional language did not deviate from the earlier order the judge, arguing the states “cite nothing that indicates that the Agency is currently enforcing the Contested Conditions in violation of this Court’s order.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/fema_BC_085_030625.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 15:56:54.283349

It previously cost employers a few thousand dollars per H-1B visa application, depending on the size of the company, according to the American Immigration Council.
He’s doubtful the new visa fee will go into effect, due in part to the lack of a clear process in place for collecting or enforcing the fee.
“So I’m highly skeptical that it will actually go into effect.” He said the increased cost for employers also raises legal questions.
“Employers are only hiring if they really need somebody because of these extra costs,” Sovern said.","The White House’s planned $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa applications could substantially raise costs for some Wisconsin businesses. But an attorney in the state says it’s unclear whether the proposal will ultimately stay on track.

According to state data, 372 employers in Wisconsin employ a total of 2,245 people who have H-1B visas, which apply to highly skilled workers in specialty occupations. It previously cost employers a few thousand dollars per H-1B visa application, depending on the size of the company, according to the American Immigration Council.

The Trump administration says the fee is being put in place to “curb abuses that displace U.S. workers and undermine national security” and that it may allow special exemptions “if in the national interest.”

A group of employers filed a lawsuit earlier this month against the Trump administration, claiming the president lacks the authority to change the visa system established by Congress.

‘Prohibitively expensive for companies in the Midwest’

H-1B visas are most commonly used by tech, education and medical sectors. The top employer of H-1B visas in Wisconsin is the financial technology company Fiserv, according to data compiled by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

“We’re reviewing President Trump’s proclamation and assessing any potential impact on our U.S. workforce. At this time, we don’t expect any immediate impacts to our operations or client service,” a Fiserv spokesperson said in a statement to WPR.

But the president and CEO of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, Dale Kooyenga, told “Wisconsin Today” the fee may disproportionately affect Midwestern companies with lower profit margins.

“The reality is a lot of companies that rely upon these are not high margin tech companies with billions of dollars in capital,” Kooyenga said. “Our fear is that it’s prohibitively expensive for companies in the Midwest, where the cost of living is lower and the margin for these mature industries is lower.”

Kooyenga also worries international companies like Fiserv will choose to keep their workforce offshore.

“With that type of fee, does it make sense to bring them to Milwaukee, Wisconsin? Or does it make sense to keep them in a part of the world where nearly all large companies have the ability to outsource parts of their workforce?” Kooyenga said. “If you have [the H-1B] program here, then you’re going to get these individuals to come here and [get] the company to invest here through these individuals.”

H-1B process already has strict requirements, disincentives

Grant Sovern is an immigration attorney at Quarles & Brady, where he regularly files H-1B petitions for Wisconsin businesses. He’s doubtful the new visa fee will go into effect, due in part to the lack of a clear process in place for collecting or enforcing the fee.

“There is no way to pay that fee or to show someone that you paid it so you could get into the country if you have an H-1B,” Sovern told WPR. “So I’m highly skeptical that it will actually go into effect.”

He said the increased cost for employers also raises legal questions.

“This $100,000 fee isn’t at all related to the cost of processing the H-1B petitions,” he said. “The law does require that any filing fee has to be related to what it costs to get it done.”

When announcing the fee, the White House said some employers “have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages” for American citizens.

However, Sovern pointed out that regulations are already in place to prevent businesses from using the program for cheap labor.

Employers are required to pay the prevailing wage for that position at that location and post it for other employees to see. They’re also required to file paperwork ensuring there hasn’t been a layoff or that a strike is not a strike happening.

And the costs associated with filing the paperwork to comply with those requirements is a disincentive for an employer to abuse the system, Sovern said.

(WGN) — Federal officials have until the end of the day on Tuesday to take down a fence surrounding an ICE processing facility in suburban Broadview, as immigration enforcement operations continue in Chicagoland.
The mayor said that over the weekend, protests spilled out onto 22nd Avenue, about a block from the ICE facility.
Going forward, protestors will only be allowed on Beach Street, which is closer to the ICE facility.
“We have the right, without giving any notice, to inspect any ICE detention facility,” he said.
“This particular Broadview facility, in my opinion, would qualify as a detention facility, whatever name they call it.","BROADVIEW, Ill. (WGN) — Federal officials have until the end of the day on Tuesday to take down a fence surrounding an ICE processing facility in suburban Broadview, as immigration enforcement operations continue in Chicagoland.

The fence was erected around the west suburban facility about three weeks ago by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). But it restricts access to Beach St, something the Village of Broadview took the agency to federal court over last week.

A judge later agreed that the fence must come down because it created a public safety concern for first responders who tried to access the area.

A court-issued deadline for the fence’s removal was set for 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, but there were still no signs of removal by around 9:30 a.m..

The court-ordered teardown comes just a day after Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson issued an executive order placing new restrictions that shrink the size and scope of where the demonstrators are allowed to protest.

The mayor said that over the weekend, protests spilled out onto 22nd Avenue, about a block from the ICE facility. That created a dangerous situation, according to the mayor. Going forward, protestors will only be allowed on Beach Street, which is closer to the ICE facility.

The new restrictions were put in place just a week after Thompson signed an executive order that limited protests to a designated area only between the hours of 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

The decision to further contain protests was not well-received by demonstrators.

“We care about what’s going on behind those walls,” one protestor said in part.

Elected leaders at all levels of government were at the facility Monday, praising the federal judge’s decision to grant, at least temporarily, the village’s request to bring the fence down.

“Without permission or collaboration with this community, this fence you see behind us has been standing here blocking the community’s access to its own streets and standing as a symbol of division,” Illinois House Speaker Emanuel “Chris” Welch said Monday. “It’s a symbol of Donald Trump’s contempt for this community and so many like it.

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois’ 8th District also came to the Broadview ICE facility on Monday and attempted to gain access himself to check on a 15-year-old girl from his district, who he believes is detained there.

But Krishnamoorthi was denied, just like Illinois Sens. Tammy Duckworth and Dick Durbin last week, and told that because it’s a holding facility and not a detention facility, his rights as a member of Congress to gain access did not apply.

Krishnamoorthi disagreed with that determination.

“We have the right, without giving any notice, to inspect any ICE detention facility,” he said. “This particular Broadview facility, in my opinion, would qualify as a detention facility, whatever name they call it.

The Department of Homeland Security has appealed the judge’s ruling as the clock ticks on the teardown of the fence.",https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/snapshot-2025-10-14T095023.975.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-14 15:57:11.963936

Through research, dialogue, and public engagement, the Judicial Foundations Project will explore and articulate the legitimate scope of judicial power and the risks associated with its growing influence in Canada’s parliamentary democracy. By fostering informed debate. The initiative aims to strengthen Canada’s democratic foundations and ensure that the delicate relationship between the courts, Parliament, and the executive continues to serve the common good.

Canada’s constitutional order, which is founded upon the principles of the United Kingdom constitution, embraces the primacy of political authority. Under the Westminster model of responsible government, it is Parliament, not the courts, that is charged with the responsibility to make and to change the law. Underscoring this primacy of political over judicial authority, the Constitution Act, 1867 establishes and vests “Executive Power” and “Legislative Power”, while providing for the “Judicature” or “The Administration of Justice” to be framed by the appointment and law-making powers of the Governor General and provincial legislatures, respectively.

The traditional primacy of the legislative and executive in law- and policy-making is increasingly displaced by the undisciplined exercise of judicial power. Across a wide array of matters, the policy agenda has largely been dictated by judicial rulings. But this expansion of judicial power is incompatible with the role of courts in a constitutional democracy.

There is a need for sustained reflection on the ways in which judicial power is exercised, the innovative adjudicative methodologies that underlie its expansion, its implications for the relationship between our judicial and political institutions—and, ultimately, its impact on Canadian democracy and the common good. This project seeks to provide Canadians with a deeper understanding of judicial power and its proper limits in the balance of our constitution. It does not seek to diminish our judiciary, but to reestablish the foundations of the judicial role in upholding settled law and legal principle, not choosing policy.

Washington, D.C. – The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has obtained credible intelligence indicating that Mexican criminals, in coordination with domestic extremist groups have placed targeted bounties on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel.

These criminal networks have issued explicit instructions to U.S.-based sympathetics, including street gangs in Chicago, to monitor, harass, and assassinate federal agents. Specific details from ongoing investigations include:

Spotter Networks: In neighborhoods like Chicago's Pilsen and Little Village, gang members affiliated with groups such as the Latin Kings have deployed ""spotters"" on rooftops equipped with firearms and radio communications. These individuals track ICE and CBP movements in real-time, relaying coordinates. This surveillance has enabled ambushes and disruptions during routine enforcement actions, including recent raids under Operation Midway Blitz.

Tiered Bounty System: Cartels have disseminated a structured bounty program to incentivize violence against federal personnel, with payouts escalating based on rank and action taken:

$2,000 for gathering intelligence or doxxing agents (including photos and family details).

$5,000–$10,000 for kidnapping or non-lethal assaults on standard ICE/CBP officers.

Up to $50,000 for the assassination of high-ranking officials.

In Portland and Chicago, Antifa groups have provided logistical support such as pre-staged protest supplies, doxxing of agent identities, and on-the-ground interference to shield cartel-linked individuals from deportation.

“These criminal networks are not just resisting the rule of law, they are waging an organized campaign of terror against the brave men and women who protect our borders and communities,” said Secretary Kristi Noem. “Our agents are facing ambushes, drone surveillance, and death threats, all because they dare to enforce the laws passed by Congress.

In his earlier ruling, the judge had struck down conditions the department originally had imposed on grant awards.

At the time, 20 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia had argued the restrictions were designed to coerce them into adhering to the Republican president’s hardline immigration crackdown.

After Smith’s initial ruling, the administration issued new grant award documents to the states with nearly identical immigration enforcement conditions but with a clause saying they would only become effective if Smith’s ruling was stayed or overturned.

Smith said the “fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference” as the administration was again unlawfully forcing the states to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo millions of dollars in funding.

“Defendants’ new condition is not a good faith effort to comply with the order; it is a ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make at the risk of losing critical disaster and other funding already appropriated by Congress,” Smith wrote.

The judge, an appointee of former Republican President George W Bush, blocked the new conditions from being enforced and required the administration to amend the grant award documents by next week.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The administration had argued it had complied with Smith’s earlier decision and had merely been seeking to preserve its ability to enforce the immigration-related conditions in the event his ruling was later overturned.

This was “not a good faith effort to comply with the order,” Smith ruled Tuesday.

“More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if defendants cut off federal funding to plaintiff states,” the states claim in that complaint, also filed in May.","(CN) — The Trump administration is continuing to make federal emergency relief contingent on states’ compliance with immigration enforcement, a judge ruled Tuesday, despite a court order barring that very action.

Senior U.S. District Judge William Smith, a George W. Bush appointee, scolded the government for what he called a “ham-handed attempt to bully the states into making promises they have no obligation to make.”

In September, Smith ruled that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency, is barred from enforcing new requirements that effectively withhold disaster aid from states with so-called “sanctuary” immigration laws.

But despite that order, Smith wrote Tuesday that the department tried to implement a workaround: adding a trigger clause to the FEMA disaster relief grants that would force states to comply with the immigration provisions if the judge’s prior injunction gets overturned on appeal.

“In effect, defendants have done precisely what the memorandum and order forbids, which is requiring plaintiff states to agree to assist in federal immigration enforcement or else forgo the award of DHS grants,” Smith wrote in a three-page ruling. “The fig leaf conditional nature of the requirement makes little difference.”

“No matter how confident defendants may be of their chances on appeal, at present, the contested conditions are unlawful,” the judge added. “Plaintiff states therefore have a right to accept the awards without regard to the contested conditions.”

The states complained earlier this month of potential violations to Smith’s order, writing in a letter to the judge that Homeland Security “copy-pasted the contested conditions” into a new grant term with the trigger clause.

This was “not a good faith effort to comply with the order,” Smith ruled Tuesday. He found that the government’s attempted workaround is indeed a violation of his September order.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.

A batch of Democratic states sued the administration in May, claiming that the government was “hanging a halt in … critical funding over states like a sword of Damocles” by requiring collaboration with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to get FEMA funds.

In doing so, the states claimed that they were put in the impossible situation of having to choose between emergency readiness and how to best use their local law enforcement. Complying with the government in this case, the states argued, would pull police resources off of crimefighting efforts and onto the government’s immigration agenda.

The requirements also mandate that states end any program that “benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration,” which the states say is a breach of federalism.

“Defendants’ grant funding hostage scheme violates two key principles that underlie the American system of checks and balances: Agencies in the executive branch cannot act contrary to the authority conferred on them by Congress, and the federal government cannot use the spending power to coerce states into adopting its preferred policies,” the states argue.

Emergency relief is just one of the ways the Trump administration has attempted to get states to comply with its mass deportation agenda, which has been scrutinized by Democratic lawmakers and civil rights leaders as an unlawful affront to the Constitution.

Federal authorities also tried to tie immigration enforcement to transportation funding — another move that prompted a massive lawsuit from a multistate coalition.

“My team and I continue to gather information about the exact details of what happened in Hoffman Estates on Friday — but there is no doubt that the video is real and that it happened here, in my district, on a street I have walked myself,” Krishnamoorthi stated in a media release.

“What that footage appears to show — a child being slammed to the ground by an ICE agent — is indefensible,” he said.

READ: Trump administration blocks Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi from entering ICE facility (

“The Hoffman Estates Police Department has confirmed that ICE agents were present in the department’s parking lot that same day and issued a statement referencing videos circulating about the day’s events.

“Yet instead of providing transparency or clarifying the facts, a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security aggressively spread misinformation online, falsely claiming this was an unrelated arrest from over a year ago and miles away in Chicago.

“This continues a disturbing pattern of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security denying the public transparency or accountability while actively spreading politically motivated disinformation.

“The events in Hoffman Estates embody everything that’s wrong with the Trump Administration’s militarized ICE raids: cruelty without accountability, secrecy without oversight, and power without restraint,” Krishnamoorthi said.

“That must end — and I will continue working in Congress to demand the transparency, oversight, and justice the American people deserve.”

Earlier today, Krishnamoorthi traveled to the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, to perform congressional oversight of reported detentions — including of minors — but was once again denied entry by the Trump administration.

The refusal follows a similar incident in June, when Krishnamoorthi and Congressman Jonathan Jackson were turned away from another ICE site in Chicago’s South Loop after attempting to inspect conditions and obtain information about detainees.

“I demanded access to the Broadview ICE facility to perform oversight — as is my right and my duty as a Member of Congress,” Krishnamoorthi stated. “Once again, the Trump administration slammed the door on transparency and accountability. Congress and the American people have every right to see what’s happening behind those walls.”

Krishnamoorthi emphasized that continued obstruction of lawful oversight undermines accountability at a time when federal enforcement actions have intensified under Operation Midway Blitz, the Trump Administration’s mass-deportation campaign targeting Democratic-led cities.

The move would allow the LA County Board of Supervisors to provide rent relief for tenants who have fallen behind as a result of the crackdown on immigrants. A local state of emergency can also funnel state money for legal aid and other services.

Funds for rent would be available to people who apply via an online portal that would be launched within two months, Supervisor Lindsey Horvath’s office said. The motion could also be a first step toward an eviction moratorium, but that would require a separate action by the supervisors.

Landlords worried it could be another financial hit after an extended ban on evictions and rental increases during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Since June, the Los Angeles region has been a battleground in the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration strategy that spurred protests and the deployment of the National Guards and Marines for more than a month. Federal agents have rounded up immigrants without legal status to be in the U.S. from Home Depots, car washes, bus stops, and farms. Some U.S. citizens have also been detained.

Horvath and Janice Hahn said the raids have spread fear and destabilized households and businesses.

“They are targeting families, disrupting classrooms, silencing workers, and forcing people to choose between staying safe and staying housed,” Horvath said in a statement, referencing actions by the Trump administration. She added declaring an emergency “is how we fight back.”

Last week the five-member board voted 4-1 to put the declaration up for a vote at its regular Tuesday meeting. The sole “no” vote came from Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who argued that the immigration raids did not meet the criteria of an emergency and that it could be unfair to landlords.

“I’m sure we’re going to be challenged legally,” Barger said. The county’s eviction moratorium during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in multiple lawsuits.

Landlords are “still reeling” from the COVID-era freezes that cost them “billions of dollars in uncollected rent and prohibited annual rent increase,” said Daniel Yukelson, CEO of the Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles.

He said housing providers are sympathetic to tenants and their family members affected by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities. But, he said, the association isn’t aware of anyone unable to pay rent due to immigration enforcement.

“If local jurisdictions once again allow rent payments to be deferred due to ICE enforcement activities, this will lead to the further deterioration and loss of affordable housing in our community,” Yukelson said.",https://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/APTOPIX_California_Immigration_Raids_45296.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 16:58:07.129713

I am writing this week’s newsletter on Thursday, so the usual disclaimers apply if any big news is missing. I usually prefer to ignore the utterances of certain politicians, but it has only been a few days since the last newsletter and I need some content. So I’m afraid that I am going to take a look at what the shadow Justice minister said last week, seemingly while using a judge’s wig as a puppet (??).

In a speech given at what appeared to be a sparsely populated Tory conference last week, the shadow minister continued an attack on judges that has been championed by the right wing press who have been misreporting immigration and asylum appeals since the beginning of the year. He apparently has a list of judges whose views he does not agree with because they are suspected of being pro-migrant, for reasons including previous cases and social media posts. Names have been made public and as a consequence those judges have been placed at risk of far-right violence.

Meanwhile, suspicions are that this recent hit piece was written by a judge, given the access to the bookshelves in Field House. The article acknowledges that the Home Office makes bad decisions, yet concludes that the solution is to get rid of both lawyers and judges. No wonder there is no name attached, as this is an embarrassingly incoherent position. Presumably though, Jenrick would have no issue with any judge holding these views.

On Free Movement, the latest podcast is out for those of you who want to listen to Barry and I discuss all things September. Right at the end I even managed to get Barry to discuss his most (in)famous case.

The Migration Advisory Committee has completed the first stage of its review of the temporary shortage list. Also last week, we finally have our newest Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration (and as a consequence are down one Immigration Services Commissioner). We republished our updated briefing on the role.

We also had a few case write ups, with more to come this week. For everything else on Free Movement and elsewhere, read on.

The state’s response revealed nine records requests made about Work Ethic Camp negotiations between Aug. 21 to Sept. 5, including the Examiner’s.
Both Houlden and Gutman said the exceptions allowing government agencies to withhold public records are meant to be narrowly interpreted.
A common obstacle that dissatisfied records requesters face: There is little to no recourse when they believe public records law has been violated.
In comparison to other states, Gutman said Nebraska has far fewer lawsuits challenging public records requests.","LINCOLN — As Nebraska moves forward in converting a McCook state prison into an ICE detention center, concerns grow about the Governor’s Office stonewalling public requests seeking more about what is going on.

By late September, Gov. Jim Pillen’s office had denied at least nine public records requests asking for information about the state’s negotiations with the federal government regarding the McCook Work Ethic Camp, records obtained by the Nebraska Examiner indicate. Additionally, there’s evidence that broader requests on the subject have also been denied, although some state agencies, including the prison system, have released some records.

These denials raised the eyebrows of local activists and legal experts who say they are suspicious that potentially thousands of public records could be withheld under the governor’s justifications. Though there is little evidence of wrongdoing, the lack of information on a subject that involves a state prison and state funds makes some believe the state has something to hide.

“Whether or not they file an open records request, people are calling out for this information and are entitled to understand what their government is doing in their name,” said Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska. “The interest in obscuring that information completely … is really suspect, and the motivation for that needs to be questioned.”

Meanwhile, Nebraska is well underway in transitioning the McCook property into a jail that holds migrant detainees for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A spokesperson for the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said just over 60 of the 180 men the camp typically holds remained housed there as of Oct. 8.

Charlie McPherson, executive director with the McCook Economic Development Corp., said his team is “keeping eyes and ears open for more information,” and hasn’t gotten any fresh info from the city or state. “Just sitting tight.” He said driving by the camp, he noticed fencing work being done.

Talks between state officials and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about the Work Ethic Camp have been going since at least late March, according to documents the government watchdog group Common Cause Nebraska acquired from the Department of Corrections.

News of the plan broke in late August. In early September, Pillen administration staffers revealed in a closed-door briefing that state officials initiated conversations with the federal government regarding the possibility of helping ICE.

At the time, State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Bennington said she was told state leaders expect a written agreement between Nebraska and the federal government to be completed within 60 days.

Though it’s still within the 60-day window, State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha said he’s heard from several sources that the state has already signed the contract and is waiting for a federal response. There has been no official confirmation as yet. Homeland Security operations continue during a government shutdown that could limit some ICE actions.

The Nebraska Examiner filed a public records request of its own Sept. 5 for communications between Pillen, his staff, and Homeland Security officials about the deal. The Governor’s Office responded to the request Sept. 18, well past the four-day deadline laid out in statute for how long state agencies have to respond.

In its response, the office denied the request based on four justifications:

The documents requested constitute “proprietary or commercial information.”

The documents requested constitute “negotiation records for the lease or sale of an interest in real property.”

The documents requested constitute “confidential communications.”

Cited a statute outlining the rules for lawyer-client privilege.

The Examiner sent a follow-up request on Sept. 22 seeking how the Governor’s Office responded to related requests from others. The office requested an extension and fulfilled the request on Oct. 8.

The state’s response revealed nine records requests made about Work Ethic Camp negotiations between Aug. 21 to Sept. 5, including the Examiner’s. All were denied, and seven of the nine were denied with virtually identical reasonings — those listed above. The requests were made by a range of individuals, including reporters, private citizens and State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha.

But the state’s justifications for denying the requests are questionable, according to multiple legal experts who spoke with the Examiner, including Houlden and Daniel Gutman, a lawyer who has litigated several public records disputes. Houlden said she believes the exceptions government agencies are granted under law are being applied more broadly than they ought to be.

“(The governor’s office) tends to blur lines when it comes to interpretations,” said Gavin Geis, executive director of Common Cause Nebraska.

Geis argued that the first two justifications treat the dealings between two public bodies — the Nebraska state government and the federal government — as though both are private businesses. Houlden noted the exact language of one of the cited statutes grants an exception for records that would “give advantage to business competitors and serve no public purpose” if they were made public, which makes her believe that the exception should not apply.

Houlden said the second justification contradicts previous public statements state officials have made that Nebraska will continue to own and operate the McCook facility.

Both Houlden and Gutman said the exceptions allowing government agencies to withhold public records are meant to be narrowly interpreted. Though Gutman said this isn’t a legally binding principle, there is a legal obligation for state officials to “understand and apply the exceptions in light of a broader public policy that favors disclosure.”

The Governor’s Office declined an interview for this story but sent a written statement.

“The Governor’s Office has responded to all record requests submitted about WEC and its transition to becoming a federal detention center,” Pillen spokesperson Laura Strimple wrote. “The process followed was the same as for any record request. Records have been provided to each requestor within the scope of law, which also allows for withholding information that meets specific exceptions.”

Gutman equated questionable public records responses to “the chicken or the egg” paradox, because while there is cause to suspect the Governor’s Office is withholding records that should be public, there is no way to know for certain without seeing the records being withheld.

There are legitimate reasons to withhold government records, Gutman said. The question is: Do those reasons apply to the potentially thousands of records that pertain to the WEC negotiations? Gutman said he thinks that’s unlikely.

Nebraska law treats most public documents as public records. According to the Attorney General’s Office, exceptions to the state’s public records statutes include personal information on students, medical records other than about births or deaths, trade secrets, investigatory records, vulnerabilities involving public property, firearms registration information and cybersecurity info.

A common obstacle that dissatisfied records requesters face: There is little to no recourse when they believe public records law has been violated. The main option is suing in Lancaster District Court, which Gutman said at best can take two to three months to resolve, or longer if the state appeals.

The state also recommends requesters petition the Attorney General’s Office for a review if they believe an error was made in their response.

In comparison to other states, Gutman said Nebraska has far fewer lawsuits challenging public records requests.

State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a vocal critic of the governor and other state agencies, said she believes Pillen’s office is banking on the assumption that most people won’t take them to court.

Cavanaugh acknowledged that hesitation over public records requests is not a problem specific to Pillen’s administration but argued it has gotten worse since he took office. Former governor turned U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., didn’t make the process easy, but he returned requests and allowed room for negotiations, she said.

When reached by the Examiner, McCook City Council members said they agreed to direct all questions on the McCook conversion to Molly Smith, a city spokesperson who did not return calls. McCook Mayor Linda Taylor also did not return calls.

State Sen. David Murman, whose legislative district includes McCook, said he had no fresh update. He supports the project and President Trump’s efforts to secure the border, he said, and believes many of his constituents do also.

Cavanaugh, along with fellow Appropriations Committee member State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha, requested that the committee hold a public briefing to better understand the transition process and its financial implications for the state. They were denied by committee chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, who said there will be opportunity to discuss the topic when the Legislature reconvenes in January.

Judiciary Committee Chair State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln also has denied requests for public hearings about the Work Ethic Camp.

The Urban Affairs Committee, chaired by McKinney, held a public hearing in September at the Capitol, which drew a large enough crowd that it required an overflow area. This is part of the “far-reaching consequences” Geis said come with withholding information on matters of high public interest. It limits the opportunities for voters to make informed decisions.

On the flip side, he said, it also keeps voters in the dark about good decisions their government is making. In this way, Geis argued Pillen could benefit from being more forthcoming.

“When they close the door, we can only assume that what’s happening back there is not to our benefit,” Geis said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said its agents use a “minimum amount of force” when making arrests, but every day it seems a new video pops up online that indicates otherwise.

Personally, my social media feed has been a stream of brutal ICE interactions: agents caught on video being both verbally and physically aggressive with the people they are detaining and with bystanders — all while many of them hide behind masks and plainclothes.

In one video, taken outside of an elementary school in Chicago, a group of masked ICE officers can be seen pulling a screaming woman out of her car. Eyewitnesses said she was in line for afternoon school pickup at the time of the incident. In the video, the woman said the agents did not have a warrant and claimed that agents had “forcibly opened” her car door.

Another video taken in Chicago showed masked agents in a white SUV throwing a canister of tear gas onto a pedestrian street near a middle school in broad daylight. Cars can be seen trying to block the unmarked vehicle, which was reportedly headed for a local grocery store. An agent then rolled down his window and threw the tear gas, causing bystanders to disperse.

In Maryland, two ICE officers chased a man into a busy intersection and then tackled him. The man could be heard screaming in Spanish “ayuda,” which means “help.” During the struggle, an agent dropped his handgun and then appeared to point it at bystanders. The Department of Homeland Security said the man being arrested in the video was resisting.

In Chicago, a journalist by the name of Debbie Brockman was forced to the ground and cuffed by three federal agents while she was out reporting. DHS said Brockman was arrested for allegedly assaulting a federal agent. WGN-TV, Brockman’s employer, said she was not charged with any crimes and was ultimately released.

Responding to criticism about its operation, DHS said that “anyone who actively obstructs law enforcement in the performance of their sworn duties, including U.S. citizens, will of course face consequences which include arrest.”

But the tactics seen in these videos are brutal in nature, alarmingly so, and the presence of a rolling camera does not seem to deter ICE agents’ behavior. While many of these videos are difficult to watch, it is also important to bear witness to what is happening to human beings on the streets of America.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251013-velshi-ice-videos-zz-25262a.jpg",N,,2025-10-14 12:56:57.870435

4.3 This instrument also makes minor changes to other policy areas, detailed in paragraphs 5.40 and 5.60 of section 5 of this Explanatory Memorandum.

Where does the legislation extend to, and apply?

4.4 The extent of this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (that is, the jurisdiction(s) which the statement forms part of the law of) is all of the United Kingdom.

4.5 The territorial application of this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules (that is, where the statement produces a practical effect) is all of the United Kingdom.

5. Policy Context

What is being done and why?

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

5.1 The changes will introduce a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana, which means that these nationals will need to apply for and obtain a visa prior to visiting the UK.

5.2 Linked to this Botswana will be removed from the list of countries whose nationals are eligible to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA).

5.3 By applying a visit visa requirement and removing eligibility to enter the UK with an ETA, those travelling to visit the UK can be assessed against the requirements of the Immigration Rules in advance of arrival in the UK. This means that their visit visa application will be refused where it is assessed that they do not meet those requirements or issued where it is concluded that they do.

5.4 UK visa requirements are kept under review. There are high numbers of nationals of Botswana who travel to the UK for purposes that are not permitted under the Immigration Rules for visitors. In particular, since 2022 there has been a persistently high number of nationals of Botswana who claim asylum. Between January 2022 and June 2025, 1,332 nationals of Botswana claimed asylum with 642 of these claims made at port. So far in 2025 (January to June), 147 nationals of Botswana have claimed asylum. While the number of people claiming asylum has fluctuated, numbers have remained high throughout this period and all asylum claims place additional resource pressure on the borders and migration system.

5.5 In 2023, 62% of asylum claims were made at the UK border. In 2024, 21% of asylum claims were made at port. All asylum claims made at port add significantly to operational pressure at the border, diverting staff from other priorities.

5.6 The visa national status of Botswana will be kept under review; particularly with regards to whether the visa introduction affects the number of individuals claiming asylum from within the UK.

5.7 The introduction of the visa requirement will include a transition period for nationals of Botswana to travel to the UK without a visa where they hold a confirmed travel booking made prior to the introduction. This period will commence at the same time as the visa requirement is introduced and run until six weeks after the introduction date: 15:00 GMT on 25 November 2025. During this period, nationals of Botswana who hold a confirmed travel booking at the time of the introduction and an ETA, for travel to the UK within the six-week transition period, will not be required to obtain a visit visa before travel. Applications for an ETA for nationals of Botswana will close at 15:00 BST on 14 October 2025. Nationals who hold confirmed bookings for travel to the UK on a date after the transition period ends will need to obtain a visa in advance of travel. Amending the date of travel on a confirmed booking to an earlier date that falls within the transition period would still require the person to have a visa.

5.8 This transition period is designed to prevent operational difficulties, general unfairness, and ensure that people who arranged travel before this announcement do not lose money. The length of the period (six weeks) has been chosen to give those affected enough time to apply for and receive a visa. The current customer service standard processing time for applicants to receive a decision and, if issued, a visitor visa, is three weeks. Further information can be found at https://www.gov.uk/guidance/visa-processing-times-applications-outside-the-uk.

5.9 The introduction of a visa requirement will be accompanied by amendments to the Immigration (Passenger Transit Visa) Order 2014, to ensure that nationals of Botswana will require a direct airside transit visa (DATV) when conducting airside transit travel (unless they fall within one of the exceptions set out in Article 4 of the Order). Airside transit passengers are those who do not need to change airports and do not need to pass through the UK border when changing to a connecting flight. If these amendments are not made, nationals of Botswana will be able to travel to the UK purporting to have booked onward travel and instead claim asylum, circumventing the visa requirement. It would also continue to enable nationals to transit through the UK with the intention of travelling to another country to claim asylum.

Recognition of Palestine: changes to the visa national list

5.10 In September 2025, the UK announced formal recognition of the state of Palestine. To deliver this commitment and ensure that the UK maintains the requirement for these nationals to obtain a visa to visit the UK, Palestine is being added to the Immigration Rules Appendix Visitor: Visa National List.

5.11 This change will introduce a visit visa requirement on nationals of Palestine, which means that these nationals will need to apply for and obtain a visa prior to visiting the UK. Whilst the Occupied Palestinian Territory (as formerly known) was not previously included on the Visa National List, its citizens were already subject to a requirement to obtain a visa to visit the UK, either as citizens of the Occupied Palestinian Territory or as stateless individuals in certain cases under existing operational guidance. In respect of the Immigration Rules Appendix Visitor: Visa national list, Palestinian nationals could also previously be considered under section VN 1.1(b) (stateless persons) or VN 1.1(C) (persons travelling on any document other than a national passport).

5.12 By amending legislation to include the newly recognised state of Palestine, those travelling to visit the UK can continue be assessed against the requirements of the Immigration Rules in advance of arrival.

5.13 This is a necessary change to protect the UK’s border and national security and to deliver on the Government’s decision to recognise the state of Palestine.

5.14 The addition of Palestine to the Immigration Rules Appendix visitor: Visa national list will be accompanied by amendments to the Immigration (Passenger Transit Visa) Order 2014, to ensure that Palestinian nationals continue to require a direct airside transit visa (DATV) when conducting airside transit travel (unless they fall within one of the exceptions set out in Article 4 of the Order). Again, this is not a new requirement but ensures continuity and consistency with changes to the Appendix Visitor: Visa national list. Airside transit passengers are those who do not need to change airports and do not need to pass through the UK border when changing to a connecting flight.

German school groups travel: easing travel requirements for German school groups visiting the UK

5.15 Following EU Exit (effective from 1 October 2021), the UK required passports from EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals, as is the case with nationals from the rest of the world. On the same date, the UK ended its acceptance of the List of Travellers scheme, which allowed people studying in an EU Member State to travel within the EU on an organised educational visit without a passport or visa. The requirement to travel on a passport and hold a visa (if a visa national) was viewed by Germany as a significant barrier to German school groups visiting the UK. The changes address this concern.

5.16 This change will allow people aged 19 years and under who are studying at a German school or educational institution, the existence of which is confirmed by the relevant German municipal or competent authority, to come to the UK without an advance permission (an ETA or visa) when they are travelling as part of a school party of five or more. It also allows EU, EEA, and Swiss nationals aged 19 and under who are studying at the school to travel on a national identity card rather than passport. This change mirrors the similar arrangement the UK already has with France and was agreed in the context of the UK-Germany Treaty.

Change to the validity requirements in Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery

5.17 The change will correct an inconsistency between the validity criteria of Immigration Rules Appendix Temporary Permission to Stay for Victims of Human Trafficking or Slavery and the caseworker guidance, to accurately reflect that there are two types of application under the route; one via application form FLR (HRO), and one made directly to a relevant competent authority.

Introduction of dependants to Appendix Statelessness

5.18 Changes are being introduced which affect partners and children of a Stateless Person. These include:

A partner or child of a stateless person may apply for entry clearance or permission to stay under Appendix Statelessness from 11 November 2025 where they formed part of the family unit before a stateless person was granted permission to stay. Those applying as a dependant on this route will need to meet the relevant partner or child requirements.

Where a partner or child of a Stateless Person are not themselves stateless and formed part of the family unit after a stateless person was granted permission, they may apply to come to or stay in the UK under the family provisions in Appendix FM. The existing provision in Appendix FM has been amended to reflect this change. Those applying under Appendix FM will need to pay the application fee, or be granted a fee waiver, as well as meet the relevant partner or child requirements.

5.19 As a result of these changes, a minor consequential change has been made to Appendix FM, Appendix Children and Appendix Relationship with Partner.

Changes to English language requirements for economic migration routes

5.20 As set out in the Immigration White Paper (Restoring Control over the Immigration System), we are introducing new requirements for English language in relation to economic migration routes.

5.21 The English language requirement for the Skilled Worker, High Potential Individual and Scale-up routes is increased from B1 Level to B2 Level (as defined under the Common European Framework for Reference for Languages (CEFR)).

5.22 The new requirements will apply to those seeking an initial grant of leave in a relevant route following the implementation of these provisions on 8 January 2026. Those who have already obtained a permission where they were required to show a B1 level, will continue to be subject to a B1 level requirement where they are seeking an extension on the same route.

High Potential Individual - targeted and capped expansion

5.23 Expansion of the High Potential Individual route, doubling the list of eligible institutions (subject to any exclusions the Secretary of State considers appropriate). This may be, for example, where inclusion of an institution would undermine UK national security or foreign policy. There will also be a cap placed on the route of 8,000 applications per year. This follows a commitment made in the Immigration White Paper, published in May 2025.

Change to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months

5.24 The Immigration White Paper published on 12 May announced the Government’s intention to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months. The Graduate route currently allows eligible graduates who have successfully completed a UK bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, or other relevant qualification to remain in the UK for two years, and PhD graduates for three years.

5.25 The change to 18 months will apply to applications submitted on or after 1 January 2027, with PhD graduates continuing to receive three years of leave. The data shows that too many graduates allowed to stay in the UK following the successful completion of their studies are not moving into the graduate level roles which the Graduate route was created to facilitate access to. It is important that those who stay transition into graduate-level jobs and are properly contributing to the economy.

Students transitioning to the Innovator Founder route

5.26 This is a specific change to Student work conditions that will allow Student visa holders to establish a business, where they have completed their course and are switching to the Innovator Founder route. It replaces a similar provision that previously applied to those switching into the Start-up route, which is now closed to new applications.

Change to replace Part 9: Grounds for Refusal, with Part Suitability

5.27 Part 9 has been replaced by a new section called Part Suitability, which serves as the central reference point for all suitability-related refusal and cancellation grounds. This change aligns with the terminology already used in simplified immigration routes, where applicants are assessed against “suitability requirements” rather than “grounds for refusal”.

5.28 Paragraph 39E, which sets out exceptions for individuals who have overstayed their visa or permission, has been moved into Part Suitability under a dedicated section titled “Exceptions for overstayers”. This ensures that overstaying exceptions are considered within the broader suitability framework and improves consistency across routes.

5.29 A number of consequential changes have been made to other parts of the Immigration Rules to reflect the new structure. These include updates to paragraph references, removal of outdated terminology, and alignment of drafting with simplification principles. For example, references to “Part 9” have been replaced with “Part Suitability” in various sections, and the treatment of overstaying has been clarified to reflect the new location of paragraph 39E in Part Suitability.

5.30 The definition of ‘permission’ has also been clarified to reflect it means either permission to enter or permission to stay and includes settlement.

5.31 These changes are part of a broader simplification initiative in line with the recommendations made by the Law Commission on Simplification of the Immigration Rules in January 2019, to make the rules more accessible and easier to navigate.

Amendments to Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life, Appendix Adult Dependant Relative and Appendix Settlement Family Life to apply Part Suitability.

5.32 Family and Private Life rules have, until now, not applied Part 9:Grounds for Refusal, and instead had their own suitability requirements which have resulted in a more generous approach where there are suitability considerations to be made.

5.33 This amendment will apply common suitability provisions to the family and Private life routes - deleting the suitability rules that were bespoke to the Family and Private Life rules and applying Part Suitability (which is replacing Part 9: Grounds for Refusal) to Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life, Appendix Adult Dependent Relative and Appendix Settlement Family Life.

Changes to Appendix Temporary Work – Seasonal Worker

5.34 Changes are being made to the rules concerning the number of months a seasonal worker must be outside the UK before being permitted to apply for a new seasonal work visa. These changes will permit seasonal workers to spend no more than six months working in the UK during any rolling 10-month period, rather than any rolling 12-month period under the previous rules.

Changes to the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme

5.35 The Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme (UPE) was launched on 4 February 2025. It provides a route for Ukrainians (and their eligible family members), who have already been living in the UK with Ukraine Scheme permission, to make a further application to extend their temporary sanctuary in the UK whilst the conflict in Ukraine remains ongoing.

5.36 Since the launch of UPE, children who apply with their parent who is either granted Ukraine Scheme permission at the same time as, or holds Ukraine Scheme permission, will have their period of permission aligned to that parent. Where both parents meet the criteria, the child’s permission is aligned with the parent whose permission expires last.

5.37 As part of ongoing safeguarding measures, we have identified a need to allow for a child’s permission to be aligned to that of their legal guardian. As such, we are updating the UPE eligibility requirements to ensure children can be granted permission in line with their legal guardian. As an additional safeguarding measure, in the eligibility requirements we are specifying that the adult (parent or legal guardian) must be in the UK for a child’s permission to be aligned.

5.38 We are also amending the residence requirement to allow an application to be refused where a child born in the UK or Islands (Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man) to a Ukrainian national parent who holds, or is eligible for, Ukraine scheme permission, has been outside the UK or Islands since birth.

5.39 Lastly, we are making minor drafting changes to the validity requirements, in addition to the nationality and relationship requirements to clarify the current policy intention as reflected in the rules.

Other Minor Changes

Changes to Appendix Global Talent

5.40 The Global Talent category is for talented and promising individuals in the fields of science, digital technology and arts and culture wishing to work in the UK. ‘Talent’ applicants are already leaders in their respective field, while ‘promise’ applicants have shown the potential to become leaders in their field.

5.41 As agreed with Arts Council England and their sub-endorsing body, Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), we are expanding some requirements to allow individuals within the architectural field to provide evidence of their achievements as a named member of a group or contributor, as well for their work as an individual. Additionally, we are allowing applicants to provide evidence of significantly contributing to being shortlisted or nominated for an international architectural award to qualify. Both of these changes more closely align the criteria for architects with other sections of the arts and culture requirements.

Changes to Appendix Global Talent: Prestigious Prizes

5.42 Applicants who hold a qualifying prize can qualify without the need to obtain an endorsement from one of the Global Talent endorsing bodies Our expert bodies consider the prizes listed demonstrate irrefutable evidence of prize holders being at the pinnacle of their profession. To be eligible, prizes must be given to named individuals, and therefore the list does not include prestigious awards for specific works, such as an award-winning film, or to whole organisations. Prizes included must also be open to all nationalities and winners must be determined by experts or peers, rather than a public vote.

5.43 Following consultation with the Global Talent endorsing bodies, a further 27 prizes have been added to the list and one prize has been deleted as it is no longer awarded and there are no living former winners. In addition, a number of small corrections have been made to existing prize names and the order they are listed in the tables.

5.44 The list will be kept under review and may be revised in future updates to the Immigration Rules.

Changes to the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS)

5.45 The EUSS in Appendix EU enables EU, other European Economic Area and Swiss citizens living in the UK before the end of the post-EU exit transition period at 11pm on 31 December 2020, and their family members, to obtain the immigration status they need to continue living in the UK.

5.46 The changes clarify the drafting of the change made from 16 July 2025 by Statement of Changes HC 836, enabling a holder of pre-settled status under the EUSS to be granted settled status where they have been resident in the UK for at least 30 months in total in the most recent 60-month period. They also bring the grounds for cancelling pre-settled status on or before the holder’s arrival in the UK into line with those for curtailing it in-country, so that, where proportionate, this can be based on the fact that the person never met, as well as where they have ceased to meet, the requirements of Appendix EU.

Deletion of obsolete Immigration Rules pertaining to the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa.

5.47 This change will delete obsolete Immigration Rules pertaining to the Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) visa. Applications for entry clearance or for leave to remain cannot be made after 6 July 2025. Given that 6 July 2025 has passed, these Rules, which only apply to entry clearance and leave to remain applications, are no longer needed. It remains possible for those already in the route to apply for indefinite leave to remain until 6 July 2027, where they previously held leave as a Tier 1 (Graduate Entrepreneur). Related changes have also been made to delete general requirements for points-based system routes in Part 6A of the Rules.

Changes to Appendix Sports Governing Bodies

5.48 These changes reflect the fact that British Kendo Association and Great Britain Wheelchair Rugby have met the requirements to become Home Office Approved Sports Governing Bodies.

Changes to Appendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes

5.49 These changes update the names of two visa schemes following requests from the endorsing government departments, the Ministry of Justice and the Department for Business and Trade, of each scheme. These changes also delete the Khebrat Leadership for Change Programme scheme endorsed by the Department for Education as the scheme is no longer in use.

Changes to Appendix Child Student - Safeguarding

5.50 A nominated guardian is a carer that looks after a Child Student for less than 28 continuous days and is not a close relative. The definition of nominated guardian in the introduction section of the Immigration Rules requires the length of care to be less than 28 days. This has been amended to clarify that the 28 days must be continuous days. The definition has also been expanded to include guardians that care for Child Students during periods of term-time. These amendments have also been reflected within Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules.

5.51 A new definition has been added to the introduction section of the Immigration Rules to describe a guardianship organisation, which is now mentioned in Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules, as a company that arranges a nominated guardian for a Child Student.

5.52 Clarifications are being made to paragraph CS5A.2 and CS5A.3 regarding those living with a nominated guardian. The Child Student’s application can be refused if their nominated guardian regularly lives with someone that has a criminal conviction. This has been amended so that this only applies if the person living with the nominated guardian is an adult. This clarifies that the rule does not apply to children.

5.53 Certain requirements are applied to ensure children have safe living arrangements. The ‘living arrangement requirement’ has been amended to clarify the permitted living arrangements on the route, including that as a boarding student you are able to stay with a parent who has permission as a Parent of a Child Student, if the Child Student is over 12 years of age and the parent is caring for their younger sibling who holds permission as a Child Student. The different types of boarding arrangements (flexi, weekly, and full boarding) have now been amalgamated under a single boarding category for simplicity when reading the rules and to formalise a concessionary arrangement permitting flexi and weekly boarders to be in the care of a nominated guardian when they are not staying at school.

5.54 A new paragraph has been added to Appendix Child Student to the Immigration Rules to cover the information guardianship organisations need to provide where an applicant does not have the details of their nominated guardian at the point where they apply for permission on the Child Student route. A new paragraph has also been added for this scenario so the named contact from the guardianship organisation must be British or Settled in the UK.

5.55 Paragraph CS9.4(g) has been amended to explain details that we require to be listed on the letter of undertaking relating to adults that regularly live with a nominated guardian.

Student Route Maintenance Requirement Annual Uplift

5.56 There is a maintenance requirement for student applicants to demonstrate they have funds to support themselves for each month of their course (up to 9 months). This level of funds is aligned with the maintenance loans available for home students, which is reviewed every year. This change increases the maintenance requirement to match the maintenance loans available for home students for the 2025/2026 academic year. We will ensure it continues to align with home students’ maintenance loans in future.

5.57 We have updated the maximum amount for the accommodation offset in line with the changes to the maintenance requirement. The accommodation offset allows students to demonstrate less maintenance funds if they have paid a deposit for their accommodation in the UK.

Changes to the continuous residence rules

5.58 Tier 1 (Entrepreneur) and Tier 1 (Investor) are being added to the list of provisions to which Appendix Continuous Residence applies, as part of changes to Part 6A of the Immigration Rules. The rule concerning the breaking of continuous residence is also being corrected.

Changes to align drafting across the Immigration Rules

5.59 Minor changes are being made to align the drafting across the Immigration Rules. These are not policy changes and are minor presentational changes that are intended to provide greater transparency, clarity, and consistency.

Other drafting changes

5.60 The Statement of Changes also introduces minor drafting changes to correct incorrect paragraph references and minor errors. It also clarifies and amends technical points relating to occupation tables in the changes laid on 1 July 2025 (HC 997).

6. Legislative and legal context

How has the law changed?

6.1 The Immigration Rules, as laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State, constitute a statement of practice to be followed in the administration of the Immigration Act 1971 for regulating the entry into, and stay of, persons in the United Kingdom.

6.2 This Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules will be incorporated into a consolidated version of the Immigration Rules. This can be found on the GOV.UK website, where all the Statements of Changes in Immigration Rules issued since May 1994 are published.

6.3 The changes will be implemented on various dates from 14 October 2025 as detailed in the implementation section of the accompanying Statement of Changes.

6.4 For the changes that introduce a visa requirement on Botswana, those changes will come into effect at 1500 BST on 14 October 2025. The changes regarding appendix HPI, will come into effect on 4 November 2025, the changes relating to Students transitioning to the Innovator Founder route come into effect on 25 November 2025 and the changes to English language requirements for economic migration routes will come into effect on 8 January 2026. All other changes will come into effect on 11 November 2025 and are detailed in the implementation section of the Statement of Changes.

Why was this approach taken to change the law?

6.5 This is the only possible approach to make the necessary changes.

7. Consultation

Summary of consultation outcome and methodology

7.1 The specific changes in this Statement have not been the subject of a formal public consultation, as this would be disproportionate given the nature of the changes.

8. Applicable Guidance

8.1 Guidance relating to these Rules changes will be updated and placed on the GOV.UK website when these changes take effect.

8.2 It is our practice to only publish guidance updates when Rules changes take effect to mitigate the high risk of users referring to the wrong version.

Part Two: Impact and the Better Regulation Framework

9. Impact Assessment

9.1 A full Impact Assessment for the changes that relates to the various White Paper changes made in this Statement of Changes will be published alongside the Explanatory Memorandum and Statement of Changes on the Gov.uk website.

Change to reduce the duration of stay under the Graduate route to 18 months

9.2 The Graduate route changes are expected to have a modest impact on Student visa demand. It is provisionally estimated a long-term reduction of approximately 12,000 Student visa applications per annum. Short-term impacts may also arise following the announcement. Financial implications include reduced visa fee and Immigration Health Surcharge revenue, with provisional estimates of £27m from the Student route and £23m from the Graduate route.

Other changes

9.3 Although there is a degree of impact as a result of the changes being made, a full Impact Assessment has not been prepared for the changes listed below because the level and effects of the changes do not meet the threshold for producing an Impact Assessment or Economic Note:

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

9.4 The changes are likely to have a meaningful impact on the public sector. High volumes of asylum claims, if left unchecked, can represent significant cost to the public sector, though overall costs for this population would be a small proportion of overall asylum costs.

9.5 As a result of a visa introduction on nationals of Botswana, there may be an impact on the number of genuine visitors coming from Botswana to the UK due to the requirement to obtain a visa before travel.

9.6 These changes therefore may represent a meaningful indirect impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies. The ONS estimated that in 2023, on average, nationals from Botswana arriving by air spent £983 per visit to the UK. Any reduction in spending resulting from a reduction in visitors to the UK is likely to represent a cost to business through a reduction in revenue.

German school groups travel: easing travel requirements for German school groups visiting the UK

9.7 The impact of the agreement on Border Force is assessed as low. It is possible that Border Force may experience minor fluidity issues due to the intended increase in German school group travel to the UK, but steps will be taken to mitigate this. The impact of the agreement on border security is low due to the robust authentication measures in place and the low-risk cohort involved.

Changes to the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme

9.8 An Impact Assessment was prepared for the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme more broadly and was published on 26 November 2024, following the laying in Parliament of the Statement of Changes to the Immigration Rules setting out the associated changes. No further economic impacts, beyond those set out in the already published impact assessment, have been identified as a result of these changes.

All other changes

9.9 A full Impact Assessment has not been prepared for the other changes in this instrument because the level and effects of the changes do not meet the threshold for doing so.

Impact on businesses, charities and voluntary bodies

9.10 For all other changes there is no, or no significant, impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies.

9.11 For all other changes the legislation does not impact small or micro businesses.

9.12 For all other changes there is no, or no significant impact on the public sector.

10. Monitoring and review

What is the approach to monitoring and reviewing this legislation?

10.1 The approach to the monitoring of these changes is to review the operation and effect of all the relevant Immigration Rules, including any Rules amended or added to by the changes in this Statement, and lay a report before Parliament within five years of 6 April 2017, and within every five years after that. Following each review, the Secretary of State will decide whether the relevant Immigration Rules should remain unchanged or be revoked or amended. A further Statement of Changes would be needed to revoke or amend the relevant Rules.

10.2 A statutory review clause is included in the instrument.

Part Three: Statements and Matters of Particular Interest to Parliament

11. Matters of special interest to Parliament

Introduction of a visit visa requirement for nationals of Botswana

11.1 The changes to introduce a visit visa requirement on nationals of Botswana will come into effect at 1500 BST on 14 October 2025, and therefore depart from the usual convention that changes to the Immigration Rules come into force no earlier than 21 days after their being laid in Parliament.

11.2 Controlling migration and securing our borders are Home Office priorities. After deciding to introduce a visit or transit visa requirement, it is necessary and reasonable to implement this as quickly as possible. The rationale for breaching the 21-day rule is that prior notification of implementation of a visa requirement could trigger a substantial increase in nationals of Botswana impacted by this change travelling to the UK prior to the visa requirement coming into effect, triggering an unpredictable and unmanageable strain upon the UK’s migration and borders system. This action continues to respect our international obligations.

11.3 Immediate implementation of a visa requirement is accompanied by a six-week transition period to prevent general unfairness and to mitigate the risk that people who arranged travel to the UK prior to the introduction of the visa requirement suffer a financial loss. Additionally, this period prevents serious operational difficulties. This approach has been successful on previous occasions and the Government is clear that implementing changes in this way is necessary and proportionate to protect the UK immigration system from abuse.

Recognition of Palestine: changes to the visa national list

11.4 Unlike previous changes that introduce a visit visa requirement, for this particular change, it is not necessary to depart from the usual convention that changes to the Immigration Rules come into force no earlier than 21 days after their being laid in Parliament. This is for the reasons set out in section 5 above.

11.5 For all other changes there are no matters of interest.

12. European Convention on Human Rights

12.1 As this Statement of Changes in Immigration Rules is subject to negative resolution procedure and does not amend primary legislation, no statement is required.

13. The relevant European Union Acts

13.1 This instrument is not being made under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 or the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Act 2023 (“relevant European Union Acts”). It does, however, relate to the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union because it supports further implementation of the EUSS.

13.2 For all other changes, this instrument does not relate to withdrawal from the European Union or trigger the statement requirements under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

14. Consolidation

14.1 The Government has committed to the consolidation of the Rules as part of its response to the Law Commission recommendations on simplifying the Immigration Rules.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/static/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-10-14 11:58:44.091722

The village of Broadview sued to have the eight-foot fence removed, saying it posed a public safety hazard because it blocks emergency responders.

Attorneys for the federal government argued the fencing is needed for business and to protect vehicles and personnel.

Illinois legislators gathered outside the Broadview ice facility yesterday in opposition of the immigration crackdown, and calling for the fencing to come down immediately.

""Mr. Trump, tear down this fence now. Tear it down,"" said Democratic Speaker Illinois House Speaker Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch, who represents the 7th District.

In suburban Chicago last month, a masked ICE agent shot a pepper ball into the head of a Presbyterian pastor as he prayed outside an ICE facility. Another ICE agent fatally shot a Mexican immigrant in Illinois. Also last month, in New York City, an ICE officer was removed from duty after he was captured on video forcibly shoving a woman to the ground outside an immigration court. Meanwhile, earlier this month, ICE agents conducted a military-style raid on a South Side Chicago apartment building, detaining hundreds of residents, many of whom are U.S.-born children.

On Thursday, after Chicago journalists and protestors sued the federal government alleging “extreme brutality” from agents on the ground, a federal judge in Illinois blocked federal agents from using force or threatening to arrest journalists.

Sandweg worked at the Department of Homeland Security for five years, spending four years as legal counsel. He capped off his DHS tenure with a one-year term leading the nation’s immigration enforcement agency from 2013-2014.

Immigration has always been one of the most polarizing and political fields of law enforcement, Sandweg concedes. But, he adds, it’s become even more polarizing now.

In a wide-ranging interview, Sandweg also expressed concern that ICE wouldn’t be able to adequately train the rapidly expanding ICE workforce and got candid about one of the most divisive trends at the agency: “I hate that the agents are wearing the masks,” he said.

The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity.

We’re seeing ICE agents display really heavy-handed use of force, smashing in car windows, shoving people to the ground, smoke bombing people, pepper spraying. Has ICE ever been this aggressive before?

Obviously, I don’t think we’ve ever seen a nationwide immigration enforcement effort like this. During the Obama administration, we did a large number of nationwide operations, but they’re very targeted. They’re the kind of work where you’re going after specific individuals, people that you knew had a criminal history. They were carefully selected. There was a lot of research and investigation done before you went out to make the actual arrest. These are much more akin to area sweeps, where they’re going out and just stopping people in the streets, or working in conjunction with other law enforcement as they execute traffic stops, or hitting a large number of apartments in a building where you suspect people are undocumented. We’ve never seen anything like this. I mean, the deployment of FBI agents and other law enforcement agents to supplement DHS efforts, the pulling of these border patrol agents into these urban cities. All of this is unprecedented.

In my experience, most ICE agents do their jobs. They do, and they treat people with dignity and respect. I know we’ve seen some incidents where that hasn’t been true. And I think that’s attributable to a lot of things. I think it’s because the agents are under tremendous pressure. They’ve been under a lot of pressure to ratchet up the number of arrests. They’ve been forced to adopt some of these more aggressive tactics, because the [Trump] administration seems more interested in the quantity of people arrested, more so than the quality. It’s not like we’re seeing those more surgical operations, where you might arrest fewer people, but they have a more serious criminal history. You’re seeing just large numbers of arrested people who have been here a long time, people who have U.S. citizen family members.

And then some of the incidents, I think, have been unfortunate reactions to the protests. This nationwide sweep of people who are not just criminal aliens, it’s triggered a lot of civil unrest, public protests, and I think, unfortunately, you’ve seen some aggressive tactics in dealing with it.

It’s not always clear to me whether it’s ICE, border patrol or even what’s called Federal Protective Service, the law enforcement DHS agency that protects federal buildings. If it’s immigration related, it just gets the ICE moniker.

This kind of enforcement is much more widespread, too, than what we’ve seen before. Tell me a little bit about the Trump administration’s emphasis on quantity over quality of arrests. That seems like a very marked shift from how previous administrations have handled and deployed immigration enforcement.

Even compared to the first Trump administration, you didn’t see anything like this. What we have seen is that immigration enforcement has become probably the central priority for all U.S. law enforcement, the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense. This executive order has elevated this to the highest priority. I’ve never seen a whole government effort focused like this, even in the State Department. As a result of that, we’ve never seen an immigration enforcement effort like this. And that manifests itself in a lot of different ways, really quickly.

When you’re at ICE, of course you can run down to a Home Depot parking lot. Any administration could have done this: round the Home Depot parking lot, stop a bunch of day laborers and ID them. In car washes, in places where low-wage workers work, places like that. The reason that historically hasn’t been done, is you just don’t find criminals there. Once in a blue moon you find someone, and we see that the administration highlights when they get someone who has some criminal history. But by and large, your really serious criminal threats don’t do shifts at the local car wash for minimum wage. They’re out making their money, making a living as a criminal.

And so ICE has always focused our operations on getting those individuals — that takes more time, though. You’re taking lists of people who are criminally convicted and you’re identifying them, and then once you identify them, you’re doing research on addresses, and then you’re building a dossier and sending a team out to get them. The Obama administration deported a large number of people, but generally, a very high percentage of them were people who either just crossed the border or people with a serious criminal history.

This administration, though, is taking a different tack. This administration has repurposed the way they’ve operationalized ICE — to go out and get as many people as possible, and that’s why we’re seeing these raids on the car washes and on the Home Depot parking lots. They know they can make a large number of arrests there, and they don’t seem to care whether or not those people pose a threat to public safety. They just say, “If you’re undocumented, you’re a fair target.”

It seems like this agency is much more politicized now than it’s ever been.

Immigration has always been the most politicized law enforcement work. Certainly during my time at DHS, the goal was always to just do our job, and the politics will take care of itself. Focus on the worst of the worst. Get the bad guys off the streets. Everything else will work out. It certainly seems to me that this administration has steered into the political debate. That’s unfortunate, because ICE has become this political football that makes it really hard for the agency to do its job. And it’ll make it really hard in years to come for the agency to do its job.

ICE is expanding, and has poured money into recruiting efforts. It’s looking to double its ranks, and it’s also expanding its units. So what guardrails can ICE place to properly train all of these new employees?

That’s a real concern. It begins with the recruitment. The first concern would be, let’s hope ICE doesn’t lower their standards. This administration is going to want to get as many of these new agents out in the field as quickly as possible. Normally, to hire this many people, it would take the agency three, four years.

The problem is that the agency only has the capacity to do so many background checks at once, to interview so many people at once. The training academy can only train so many people at once. It would take years to fully deploy these agents. This administration clearly doesn’t want to wait. They want to get people out there as quickly as possible. Now, some of what they’re doing makes some sense: They’re recruiting heavily from local law enforcement, other law enforcement agencies, offering signing bonuses and things. But the concern here would be, to the extent to which the administration wants to get these people deployed quickly, do they cut corners? I worry that if you start cutting corners on standards or background checks or training, that it’s only a recipe for problems down the line.

Official DHS policy requires ICE agents to use only the level of force that is “objectively reasonable,” and that’s not concretely defined. What is reasonable? From your experience, I’d love to hear how agents are trained to apply force and what they’re trained to recognize.

Just to keep it simple, the use of force needs to be commensurate with the threat that’s presented your way. It does seem to me that a lot of the episodes where [use of force] certainly seemed to push the line involved other agencies. A lot of them were Border Patrol related.

The hard part, and the reason why I’m always hesitant to question use of force, is that I just don’t know what the agents knew. This apartment building in Chicago, I don’t know what information they had before they went into the apartment building. Operations where it looks heavy-handed, but maybe they have good intel that says a violent, dangerous gang member is in the house. In a case like that, a ton of force is appropriate, if not necessary. But if it’s just a routine immigration operation, wearing the tactical gear and aggressively shoving people against walls and using long arms and some of these things certainly strikes me as excessive. But it’s hard to judge.

Speaking of Chicago, a Mexican immigrant was fatally shot by an ICE agent there in late September. And then last month in Dallas, we saw a shooter open fire at an ICE facility. This seems like such an uptick in violence, both coming from and directed at ICE. Have you seen this level of violence before? Or is this a new kind of escalation?

No, I’ve never seen it. The number one rule: You have to keep the agents safe. One thing that is tough for someone like me, having worked with people at ICE, is that they bear the brunt of people’s frustration with the administration’s policies. The agents have a duty to execute the president’s policies.

Unfortunately, there have been some psychopaths out there — the shooting in Dallas, absolutely horrific. The number of assaults, the uptick is real. There have been increased numbers of assaults, and as the officers do some of these operations, there’s rock throwing, the shooting in Dallas, all of that is real. It’s just a very unfortunate time we’re in. While I fully respect everyone’s right to protest these actions, you also have to make sure the agents themselves are safe.

I understand why it’s happening, but it’s not the agents who are crafting these policies. In my experience, most of these agents signed up with the agency because they want to make a difference in terms of making the country safer. But unfortunately, they do bear the brunt of this. But no, I’ve not seen this level of assaults on the agents themselves.

Why is this happening? Is it just because ICE is extending its reach?

Because it’s become such a symbol of the administration. I think that if people were asked to define what the Trump administration stands for, immigration enforcement would be top one or two. ICE has become the symbol of the administration, and that’s what makes it an attractive target for people.

And what about these headlines about violence and the use of force coming from ICE agents as well?

I think the whole thing has become so politically charged. It increases agitation, it makes it more likely that somebody crazy is going to try to assault an officer. I think as a result of that, the agents probably are more defensive than they otherwise would be. And more aggressive in terms of taking steps to protect their safety. It’s a difficult situation, and I don’t envy the officers at all. They’re in a very tough position.

And on this topic of officer safety, civil rights groups have raised alarms about agent masking. ICE’s current acting director, Todd Lyons, has justified agents concealing their identities, masking their faces — pointing out what you just mentioned, this increased risk of doxxing, threats, abuse and violence against officers.

It was never an issue. I spent five years at DHS working on ICE issues. It just wasn’t an issue. None of the officers felt the need to wear masks. I think it’s an unfortunate byproduct of the administration’s policies. This is a very contentious area of law, this idea that we’re not going to discern the difference between migrants who might be committing serious crimes and those who might have real long-term presence in the United States, young children and family members and things of that nature.

I hate that the agents are wearing the masks. I think it is hurting the reputation of the agency, and feeding a lot of these narratives about the agency. But I’m also sympathetic to the agents themselves, who need to protect themselves and their families. Like we just talked about, there are these upticks, these massive upticks in assaults on the agents. These threats against the agents are real, and there’s, unfortunately, a lot of people out there who can’t discern the difference between the administration and the policymakers and the agents themselves. And as a result of that, these agents feel compelled to take steps to protect themselves and their family, and I’m sympathetic to it.

Just to clarify, the decision to wear a mask, is that an individual choice? Is that coming from the agent, or is that an organization-wide policy?

My recollection, there was no policy on it. I don’t think this administration is requiring them to wear masks. There’s just no policy in place that restricts use of masks.

We’ve talked about how ICE has changed so much under the current administration, but looking back from when you were with DHS and looking at reports of activity now, and what we’re seeing on the ground, how has ICE’s work changed in the past decade?

Two big things have changed that are really significant. The first is the border. ICE has a responsibility to take people into custody who are not from Mexico, if they’re apprehended at the border. All these asylum seekers, ICE has the responsibility of detaining them, processing them through immigration court and supervising them if they were released. Since right about the time I left DHS in 2014, that’s when the border numbers really started picking up. And that has really overwhelmed ICE for 10 years. Detention beds were full of people from the border. It limited ICE’s ability to do much else on the interior of the United States.

Beginning with Biden in June of last year, the numbers at the border started declining dramatically. Those declining numbers frees up ICE, it starts to have more additional resources to rededicate to interior enforcement. And then the Trump administration comes in.

Are we seeing a brand-new shift in ICE’s mission and directive?

I wouldn’t say it’s a shift, this has always been a key part of ICE’s mission. What’s different is who they’re targeting. Under Obama, under Biden and even to a certain extent, under the first Trump administration, there were priorities. The agents were told, “Focus first on the worst. Worst first. Get the worst bad guys off the street first, we’ll deal with everything else later.” Those rules are gone.

Where do we go from here? How do we de-escalate?

Look, the country needs to pass immigration reform. We revert back to ICE’s more traditional tactics of focusing on “the absolute worst first.” This is a difficult question that the country has struggled with. We have people in this country for 15, 20 years who have been out of status, and in that time they’ve had children, they’ve married U.S. citizens, they’ve integrated themselves, they’ve gone to church, made friends with people at work. They’ve just integrated themselves in society.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fe4%2Fa0%2F02aac149428dbbe452f8dfc72e50%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2224603707,N,,2025-10-14 11:59:17.233304

Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled.
In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer's CEO, argues.
ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said.
Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.","The Nigerian man described being roused with other detainees in September in the middle of the night. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers clasped shackles on their hands and feet, he said, and told them they were being sent to Ghana, even though none of them was from there.

When they asked to speak to their attorney, he said, the officers refused and straitjacketed the already-shackled men in full-body restraint suits called the WRAP, then loaded them onto a plane for the 16-hour-flight to West Africa.

Referred to as ""the burrito"" or ""the bag,"" the WRAP has become a harrowing part of deportations for some immigrants.

""It was just like a kidnapping,"" the Nigerian man, who's part of a federal lawsuit, told The Associated Press in an interview from the detainment camp in which he and other deportees were being held in Ghana. Like others placed in the restraints interviewed by the AP, he spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations. Its use was described to the AP by five people who said they were restrained in the device, sometimes for hours, on ICE deportation flights dating to 2020. And witnesses and family members in four countries told the AP about its use on at least seven other people this year.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement. And the AP has identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined ""restraint"" played a role in the death.

The WRAP is the subject of a growing number of federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture, whether used in a jail or by immigration authorities during international flights. Among advocates' concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP's use as required by federal law when officers use force.

DHS has paid Safe Restraints Inc., the WRAP's California-based maker, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015 during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it's not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

The WRAP's manufacturer says it intended the device to be a lifesaver for law enforcement confronting erratic people who were physically attacking officers or harming themselves.

But ICE officials have a much lower threshold for deploying the WRAP than the manufacturer advises, the AP found. Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled. They said this was done to intimidate or punish them for asking to speak to their attorneys or expressing fear at being deported, often to places they fled due to violence and torture.

The West African deportee described a terrifying, hourslong experience that left his legs swollen to the point where he walked with a limp.

""They bundled me and my colleagues,"" he said, ""tied us up in a straitjacket.""

ICE and DHS would not answer detailed questions from the AP and refused a request for the government's policy for when and how to use the WRAP.

""The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights has been long standing, standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,"" Tricia McLaughlin, DHS' spokesperson, said in an email to AP. ""Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.""

The agency would not specify those authorities or describe its practices.

""The use of these devices is inhumane and incompatible with our nation's fundamental values,"" said Noah Baron, an attorney for the West African deportees.

Charles Hammond, CEO of Safe Restraints Inc., said his company has made a modified version of the device for ICE, with changes meant to allow people to be kept in it during flights and long bus trips.

ICE's version includes a ring on the front of the suit that allows a subject's cuffed hands to be attached while still allowing for limited use to eat and drink, he said. In addition, the ICE version has ""soft elbow cuffs,"" Hammond said, which connect in the back so a person can move for proper circulation but can't flip an elbow out to hit someone.

An AP reporter recounted for Hammond some of the allegations made by people who had been placed in the WRAP for long flights. All of those interviewed by AP said their hands and feet were already restrained by chains. All denied fighting with officers, saying they were either crying or pleading against their deportation to countries they deemed dangerous.

Hammond said that, if true that some people were not being violent and simply protesting verbally, putting them in the WRAP could be improper use.

""That's not the purpose of the WRAP. If (the deportee) is a current or potential risk to themselves, to officers, to staff, to the plane, restraints are justified. If it's not, then restraints aren't.""

Juan Antonio Pineda said he was put into ""a bag"" in late September and driven by immigration officers to the Mexico border. It was black with yellow stripes and had straps that immobilized his body and connected over his shoulders — the WRAP.

Pineda, who is from El Salvador, was in the U.S. legally, he said in a video from an ICE detention center in Arizona. On Sept. 3, he went to an appointment in Maryland to get permission for another year, his wife, Xiomara Ochoa, said in an interview from El Salvador. Instead, he was detained by ICE and told he'd be deported to Mexico, but the documents he was shown had someone else's name, he said. Even so, he was sent to the Florence Service Processing Center detention facility in Arizona.

Early morning on Wednesday, Sept. 24, he said officers tied his hands and legs, placed him into the ""bag"" and drove him four hours to the border. When he refused to sign the deportation papers, Pineda alleges officers broke his right arm and gave him a black eye before driving him back another four hours in the ""bag."" The AP was unable to independently confirm how he was injured. Pineda's video shows him with a cast on his arm and bruising on his face.

The next day, Thursday, Sept. 25, they tied him up again, put him in the bag and drove him to the border, where Mexican immigration officials turned him away, he said.

""Eight hours there and back and they don't give me food or water or anything,"" he said in the video, which his wife shared with the AP. ""Please help me.""

He was ultimately deported to Mexico, Ochoa said.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP regarding Pineda's case.

In addition to the Nigerian man flown to Ghana, four others interviewed by AP said they were placed in the WRAP and carried onto deportation flights since the first Trump administration.

As U.S. immigration officials move aggressively to meet the president's deportation goals, advocates and attorneys for immigrants are echoing the concerns of the government's own civil rights inquiry that ICE officers aren't trained on how to use the restraints.

""This should be a last resort type of restraint after they've already tried other things,"" said Fatma Marouf, a Texas A&M law professor who has sued ICE over its use of the device. ""Just being bound up like that can inflict a lot of psychological harm.""

Some deportees said they were left in the WRAP for an entire fight. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the Nigerian man and four others currently detained in Dema Camp, Ghana, included the allegation from one that ICE left the restraint suit on him for 16 hours, only once undoing the lower part so he could use the bathroom.

""No one should be put into a WRAP. I don't even think they strap animals like that,"" recalled a man who said he suffered a concussion and dislocated jaw being placed into the device in 2023 before a deportation flight to Cape Verde, an African island nation. AP's review of his medical records confirmed he suffered those injuries in 2023.

""It was the most painful thing I've been through,"" said the man, adding he was restrained most of the 10-hour flight. ""Forget the assault, forget the broken jaw. Just the WRAP itself was hurtful.""

Also, the man said, the metal ring his cuffed hands were attached to — one of the ICE modifications to the WRAP designed to increase comfort — injured him. ""When they slammed me face forward on the floor, that metal ring dug into my chest causing me bruising and pain which was part of my injuries that I complained about.""

ICE's current use of the WRAP comes amid an unprecedented wave of masked federal immigration officers grabbing suspected immigrants off the street, and mounting accusations that the Trump administration has dehumanized them, including by subjecting them to cruel and unusual detention conditions.

ICE's use of the WRAP has continued despite a 2023 report by DHS's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or CRCL, that raised serious concerns over the lack of policies governing its use.

ICE agreed with the internal findings on some points, a then-DHS official involved in the review said, but challenged the notion that the WRAP should be classified as a ""four-point restraint,"" a designation that would place more limitations on its use. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the inquiry.

DHS largely dismantled the office that produced the 2023 report earlier this year amid widespread government firings, calling it a roadblock to enforcement operations.

""Without changes to the current training, and the lack of policy, CRCL has serious concerns about ICE's continued use of the WRAP,"" wrote the report's authors, who cited a news article mentioning lawsuits claiming the device had led to deaths.

Last year police officers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, placed Rolin Hill in the WRAP, saying he was being combative during an arrest at a convenience store. The officers left Hill in the device when they dropped him at the jail. Video from the jail shows deputies punching the WRAP-immobilized Hill in the head and back. Hill died in a hospital, and while the WRAP's exact role is unknown, Hill's death was ruled a homicide by ""positional and mechanical asphyxia due to restraint with neck and torso compression."" Three of the deputies are now charged with his murder, and five were removed from their jobs.

Also last year, in Missouri, prosecutors charged five jailers in the death of Othel Moore Jr., who according to an autopsy asphyxiated in the WRAP. Jailhouse footage showed Moore, who'd also been sprayed with tear gas and placed in a ""spit mask"" covering his face, repeatedly told officers he couldn't breathe.

AP identified many of the other non-ICE cases involving the WRAP during an investigation into deaths after police subdued people with common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop someone without killing them.

While Hammond insists the WRAP has never been determined as the cause of death when used properly, the AP identified 43 times in which the WRAP was used by police or correctional officers in a case in which someone died. In 12 of those cases the official autopsy determined that ""restraint"" played some role in the death.

It was often impossible to determine the exact role the WRAP may have played, as deaths often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who in several cases were high on methamphetamine.

The WRAP first appeared in law enforcement in the late 1990s, presented as an alternative to tying a subject's hands and feet together in a practice known as ""hog-tying."" It first found widespread use in California jails and today is used by more than 1,800 departments and facilities around the country, according to the manufacturer, which says it has sold more than 10,000 devices.

Many of these cases have drawn little media attention, such as the 2020 case of Alberto Pena, who was jailed on a misdemeanor criminal mischief charge after getting drunk and damaging the walls and doors at his parents' home outside Rio Grande City, Texas. The 30-year-old became erratic on the way to the Starr County Jail, beating his own head against the inside of the patrol unit and, later, the wall of his cell.

Deputies placed Pena in the WRAP for more than two hours, where he repeatedly cried out for help and complained he could not breathe. But he was left unattended in the device for significant periods of time, court records show, and no medical attention was provided for his self-inflicted head injuries.

An autopsy ruled Pena's death ""accidental,"" but a forensic pathologist hired by the family attributed Pena's death in part to the WRAP's ""prolonged restraint"" and said it ""could have been averted"" with proper medical care.

""The WRAP should have never been used in this situation. It was a medical emergency and he should have been taken to the hospital,"" said Natasha Powers-Marakis, a former police officer and use of force expert who reviewed the case on behalf of Pena's family as part of their wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers who placed him in the device. The arresting officers had been told Pena suffered from bipolar disorder.

The Starr County Sheriff's Office has denied wrongdoing and maintained Pena did not require medical care. Robert Drinkard, an attorney for the county, told AP the use of the WRAP ""was neither improper nor caused Mr. Pena's tragic death."" He added that each deputy involved in placing Pena in the WRAP had been trained in its application.

A federal judge recently dismissed the Pena family's lawsuit, ruling the deputies were shielded from liability.

In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer's CEO, argues.

ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said. Given the high stakes of a violent confrontation on an airplane, Hammond believes cases like those described to the AP can warrant the WRAP's use, even if the person is already in chains.

However, properly trained agents are supposed to loosen the straps and allow enough movement so the subject can eat and drink, as well as use the bathroom.

""With the WRAP, when it is used properly, it's a shorter fight, which is good for everybody. It prioritizes breathing, which is good for everybody. And you have no more fight and can provide medical care or mental health care or de-escalation efforts,"" Hammond said.

Those placed in one of Hammond's restraint suits, however, recount the experience as traumatic.

One of these people was first put into five-point shackles when he became dizzy and tripped while ascending the stairs to board the ICE flight to Cameroon in November 2020. The officer mistook his stumbling as resistance, he said. Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.

Soon, he felt the straps cinching around his legs and upper body.

""They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,"" he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He'd fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

""I told him 'I can't breathe,'"" the man said. ""He responded, 'I don't care, I'm doing my job.'""

He wants his west suburban community to know that ICE agents assaulted and detained American citizens on private property last week.

What we know:

Forest Park Mayor Rory E. Hoskins provided cell phone video showing federal agents demanding to be let into Concordia Cemetery, and the vapor of chemicals deployed on four cemetery workers.

One of the workers told Fox 32 they heard a man in distress in the Des Plaines River on October 7.

When they looked into it, federal agents demanded access to the locked cemetery. The agents were told it was private property.

The agents cut the lock on the gate and, according to the workers, deployed pepper spray, body slammed, and cuffed them for five hours.

""What happened to me and my co-workers was alarming and it reminded me of how important it is we all uphold the constitution,"" said Darren Eichler, one of the workers.

Hoskins met with the men about their experience.

""It’s an indication of poor training or just bad intentions on the part of ICE,"" the mayor said.

What they're saying:

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that agents were trying to rescue the two men from the nearby Des Plaines River.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in the statement:

""Despite the agitation and lack of help from local government, ICE successfully arrested both illegal aliens, including Martin Martinez Guereca, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico, previously convicted of assault in 2004, and Jaime Arturo Martinez Rojas, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico with previous arrests for drug possession and driving under the influence. The four U.S. citizens who obstructed law enforcement from the rescue operation were arrested.""

Also on Monday, DHS said in a post on X that its so-called Operation Midway Blitz has resulted in the arrests of more than 1,500 people in the Chicago area.

The four workers are still unsure of the allegations.

""These are not public figures,"" Hoskins said. ""These are private men who work in a cemetery. They suffered a very traumatic incident, detained for hours at a time, maced, dehumanized, taunted and here they are back in our community, and we want to make sure they feel protected.""

Three workers were released from a facility in Lombard.

The hospitalized worker was treated and released from an area hospital.

The Democratic lawmaker said he had arrived to conduct official oversight amid reports of detentions, just days after video surfaced showing ICE officers forcefully restraining a 15-year-old from his district in Hoffman Estates. Despite his congressional authority, ICE officials denied him access to the site.

“I demanded access to the Broadview ICE facility to perform oversight — as is my right and my duty as a Member of Congress,” said Krishnamoorthi. “Once again, the Trump Administration slammed the door on transparency and accountability.

“This is Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, I have former Congressman Luis Gutiérrez with me, under section 527 of the appropriations law I am entitled to be able to inspect,” Krishnamoorthi could be heard saying on the phone call before the facility’s staff member interrupted him on the video posted on X.

Tuesday’s incident marks the second time in recent months that Krishnamoorthi has been denied access to an ICE facility.

In June, he and Congressman Jonathan Jackson were blocked from visiting a Chicago detention center while attempting to review conditions and obtain details about those being held.

Krishnamoorthi warned that such repeated refusals to permit lawful oversight erode transparency at a moment when federal immigration enforcement has sharply escalated under “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s aggressive deportation drive targeting Democratic-led cities.

I don’t even think they strap animals like that,” recalled a man who said he suffered a concussion and dislocated jaw being placed into the device in 2023 before a deportation flight to Cape Verde, an African island nation. AP’s review of his medical records confirmed he suffered those injuries in 2023.

“It was the most painful thing I’ve been through,” said the man, adding he was restrained most of the 10-hour flight. “Forget the assault, forget the broken jaw. Just the WRAP itself was hurtful.”

Also, the man said, the metal ring his cuffed hands were attached to — one of the ICE modifications to the WRAP designed to increase comfort — injured him. “When they slammed me face forward on the floor, that metal ring dug into my chest causing me bruising and pain which was part of my injuries that I complained about.”

ICE’s current use of the WRAP comes amid an unprecedented wave of masked federal immigration officers grabbing suspected immigrants off the street, and mounting accusations that the Trump administration has dehumanized them, including by subjecting them to cruel and unusual detention conditions.

ICE’s use of the WRAP has continued despite a 2023 report by DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or CRCL, that raised serious concerns over the lack of policies governing its use.

ICE agreed with the internal findings on some points, a then-DHS official involved in the review said, but challenged the notion that the WRAP should be classified as a “four-point restraint,” a designation that would place more limitations on its use. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the inquiry.

DHS largely dismantled the office that produced the 2023 report earlier this year amid widespread government firings, calling it a roadblock to enforcement operations.

“Without changes to the current training, and the lack of policy, CRCL has serious concerns about ICE’s continued use of the WRAP,” wrote the report’s authors, who cited a news article mentioning lawsuits claiming the device had led to deaths.

Use by police and in jails

Last year police officers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, placed Rolin Hill in the WRAP, saying he was being combative during an arrest at a convenience store. The officers left Hill in the device when they dropped him at the jail. Video from the jail shows deputies punching the WRAP-immobilized Hill in the head and back. Hill died in a hospital, and while the WRAP’s exact role is unknown, Hill’s death was ruled a homicide by “positional and mechanical asphyxia due to restraint with neck and torso compression.” Three of the deputies are now charged with his murder, and five were removed from their jobs.

Also last year, in Missouri, prosecutors charged five jailers in the death of Othel Moore Jr., who according to an autopsy asphyxiated in the WRAP. Jailhouse footage showed Moore, who’d also been sprayed with tear gas and placed in a “spit mask” covering his face, repeatedly told officers he couldn’t breathe.

AP identified many of the other non-ICE cases involving the WRAP during an investigation into deaths after police subdued people with common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop someone without killing them.

While Hammond insists the WRAP has never been determined as the cause of death when used properly, the AP identified 43 times in which the WRAP was used by police or correctional officers in a case in which someone died. In 12 of those cases the official autopsy determined that “restraint” played some role in the death.

It was often impossible to determine the exact role the WRAP may have played, as deaths often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who in several cases were high on methamphetamine.

The WRAP first appeared in law enforcement in the late 1990s, presented as an alternative to tying a subject’s hands and feet together in a practice known as “hog-tying.” It first found widespread use in California jails and today is used by more than 1,800 departments and facilities around the country, according to the manufacturer, which says it has sold more than 10,000 devices.

Many of these cases have drawn little media attention, such as the 2020 case of Alberto Pena, who was jailed on a misdemeanor criminal mischief charge after getting drunk and damaging the walls and doors at his parents’ home outside Rio Grande City, Texas. The 30-year-old became erratic on the way to the Starr County Jail, beating his own head against the inside of the patrol unit and, later, the wall of his cell.

Deputies placed Pena in the WRAP for more than two hours, where he repeatedly cried out for help and complained he could not breathe. But he was left unattended in the device for significant periods of time, court records show, and no medical attention was provided for his self-inflicted head injuries.

An autopsy ruled Pena’s death “accidental,” but a forensic pathologist hired by the family attributed Pena’s death in part to the WRAP’s “prolonged restraint” and said it “could have been averted” with proper medical care.

“The WRAP should have never been used in this situation. It was a medical emergency and he should have been taken to the hospital,” said Natasha Powers-Marakis, a former police officer and use of force expert who reviewed the case on behalf of Pena’s family as part of their wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers who placed him in the device. The arresting officers had been told Pena suffered from bipolar disorder.

The Starr County Sheriff’s Office has denied wrongdoing and maintained Pena did not require medical care. Robert Drinkard, an attorney for the county, told AP the use of the WRAP “was neither improper nor caused Mr. Pena’s tragic death.” He added that each deputy involved in placing Pena in the WRAP had been trained in its application.

A federal judge recently dismissed the Pena family’s lawsuit, ruling the deputies were shielded from liability.

‘Carrying me like a corpse’

In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer’s CEO, argues.

ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said. Given the high stakes of a violent confrontation on an airplane, Hammond believes cases like those described to the AP can warrant the WRAP’s use, even if the person is already in chains.

However, properly trained agents are supposed to loosen the straps and allow enough movement so the subject can eat and drink, as well as use the bathroom.

“With the WRAP, when it is used properly, it’s a shorter fight, which is good for everybody. It prioritizes breathing, which is good for everybody. And you have no more fight and can provide medical care or mental health care or de-escalation efforts,” Hammond said.

Those placed in one of Hammond’s restraint suits, however, recount the experience as traumatic.

One of these people was first put into five-point shackles when he became dizzy and tripped while ascending the stairs to board the ICE flight to Cameroon in November 2020. The officer mistook his stumbling as resistance, he said. Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.

Soon, he felt the straps cinching around his legs and upper body.

“They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,” he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He’d fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

“I told him ‘I can’t breathe,’” the man said. “He responded, ’I don’t care, I’m doing my job.’”",https://www.theindianalawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ICE-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-14 10:57:31.702945

But the gathering storm of a wider military deployment to Chicago with full arrest power is being considered by the White House and talked up publicly by the president, especially since Justice Department attorneys lost several legal cases here in the past week.

There were controllable skirmish lines last weekend handled by state police troopers in front of the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility. The operation was conducted by police without help from National Guard troopers sent in by the president. Soldiers last week were ordered by the courts here to disengage -orders being appealed by the White House.

""Our ICE agents, the people who are enforcing our immigration laws, have faced a 1,000% increase in violent attacks against them,” Vice President JD Vance said on NBC’s ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday morning. “They're being assaulted. They're being beaten. They're being shot at. The problem here is not the Insurrection Act or whether we actually invoke it or not. The problem is the fact that the entire media in this country, cheered on by a few far-left lunatics, have made it okay to tee off on American law enforcement.""

If Trump invokes the Insurrection Act of 1807, most legal barriers to military use in Chicago would disappear; the president claiming a rebellion is underway here and soldiers could then assume regular police duties, including arresting people.

Northwestern University Law School professor and constitutional expert Paul Gowder told NBC 5 Investigates the use of the Insurrection Act despite stern objections by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson is concerning.

“I think that it would set up a really stark conflict between the president's use of troops and our traditional understanding of the autonomy of state governments in local law enforcement that I think would be challenging,"" Gowder said.

An Insurrection Act declaration would allow the president to send in units from any service branch, including the Marines, and to employ the Air Force, regular Army or put together a federal militia, according to Syracuse Law School professor emeritus William Banks.

""They could start enforcing curfews. They could tell people to stay in their homes. They could close doors,” Banks said. “It's not martial law, but it's one step toward martial law.""

The last time the Insurrection Act was used in the United States was 1992 in Los Angeles after the Rodney King verdict, when LA officials asked for help.

And NBC Chicago has found that the Insurrection Act has been previously imposed on Chicago.

In 1894 - during the infamous Pullman Co. labor strike that had paralyzed the nation's rail system. Then-President Grover Cleveland sent in 2000 U.S. Army troops to break the union and stop deadly riots. And just as we are seeing in 2025, there was fierce opposition to federal soldiers from then-Chicago Mayor John Hopkins and then-Illinois Gov. John Altgeld.

""We don't talk about it very much in history classes for whatever reason,” said Northwestern Law’s Gowder. “But this extensive pattern is called the Labor Wars sometimes by historians because it turned into something that looked a lot like warfare.""

The use of the Insurrection Act and deployment of federal troops in Chicago more than 130 years ago is one of just a few dozen times in American history that it’s been used-most often to control unchecked uprisings and raging citywide riots. Presidents have great latitude to use it without oversight, unchecked by congressional review - but possibly checked by the judicial system. Legal experts say the courts can review after deployment if there are allegations a president ""acted in bad faith.""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/efe_ba2ab246b270a0798863e310c7b8acac28dc6bc4w.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-14 13:58:02.010257

Obama was keeping his fragile program intact by withholding the sticks and being generous with the carrots.
But the House lawsuit was more fundamental: Did the president have a kind of “prosecutorial discretion” that went beyond the criminal law?
Could the president move money around to pay for his priorities without congressional approval?
Rather than accept lame-duck status, Obama had announced before the election that he would stretch his executive authority to get around Congress.","In 2014, Congress sued the executive branch over the president’s refusal to enforce the law. It was kind of a mind-bender because the majority in Congress hated the law that wasn’t being enforced — ObamaCare — and had repeatedly tried to kill it entirely.

But there we were: U.S. House of Representatives v. Burwell, in which the Republican-controlled House sued over the failure to implement provisions of then-President Obama’s signature health insurance law that the same lawmakers who brought the suit said would cripple businesses by requiring large employers to provide insurance for workers.

Another, more obvious, claim from Republicans was that the administration was using a kind of slush fund in the Treasury Department to pay subsidies to insurance companies that hadn’t been included in the original legislation passed by Democrats alone four years earlier.

Obama was keeping his fragile program intact by withholding the sticks and being generous with the carrots. There were all kinds of lawsuits from states and organizations over specific provisions, notably the requirement that policies from religious groups still had to cover birth control and that very pricey employer mandate. But the House lawsuit was more fundamental: Did the president have a kind of “prosecutorial discretion” that went beyond the criminal law? Could the president move money around to pay for his priorities without congressional approval?

That question of prosecutorial discretion was a hot one just then. The day before the lawsuit was filed in November — which was just weeks after Democrats had taken a terrible drubbing in the midterms — Obama had unleashed a raft of executive orders to shield as many as 5 million migrants without legal status from deportation and grant them a path to citizenship. Rather than accept lame-duck status, Obama had announced before the election that he would stretch his executive authority to get around Congress. His ObamaCare moves and, more significantly, immigration decrees were pretty clearly meant to be understood as putting Republicans on notice that he would go it alone.

Democrats called the suit a stunt, and the party and the health care industry came down hard on the case, including scaring off the big law firm that had initially agreed to take it. Even some on the right who coveted executive power for themselves opposed the suit. Then, there were the political calculations. What if the House won and employers got crushed by mandates and customers saw their premiums skyrocket?

But House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) plowed ahead anyway.

“If this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well,” he said. “The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action.”

Remember that this was back when Democrats were very fond of the Roberts court’s deference to executive authority. The decision he wrote upholding the mandates as a “tax” had vaulted Chief Justice John Roberts into the firmament with Earl Warren and David Souter as the kind of Republican-appointed justice whom Democrats could love. Strange new respect was all around.

When a lower court judge appointed by former President George W. Bush threw out the part of the suit about enforcement but let the part about the slush fund proceed, the White House responded by calling it “just another partisan attack” and vowed to win on appeal. But the case went ahead, and in May of 2016, the judge ruled that “Congress is the only source for such an appropriation, and no public money can be spent without one.”

Had Hillary Clinton won that year’s presidential election as was expected at the time, the case would have certainly landed in the high court and we might have seen what could have been the biggest case on the separation of powers in decades. But she did not win, and new House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) swiftly came to terms with the incoming Trump administration to drop the suit because the new president would eliminate the dubious payments.

It was a smart play for Ryan because there was little sense in risking what could have been a ruling against congressional authority over a program that he, and most in Washington, believed would not survive the first year of the new administration.

As it turned out, everyone was wrong again. ObamaCare not only survived, but we are at this very moment watching Republicans discuss how long to extend extra subsidies passed in 2021 as a pandemic boost. Should it be for one more year or a $415 billion outlay to cover the next decade?

Obama was right about the premise of his executive overreaches. If he could just keep the program running long enough to get a critical mass of enrollments, it would become unrepealable from a political point of view.

Thanks in part to shifting partisan coalitions, Republicans are very much dependent on the working-class voters who like the expanded Medicaid benefits and the well-off older Americans who use ObamaCare to bridge the gap between employer insurance and Medicare.

Just as these subsidies will be extended, you can bet that one day Republicans will undo this year’s Medicaid cuts they craftily delayed until after the midterms. They took the revenue now for cuts that probably won’t ever fully go into effect. “Repeal and replace” has become “preserve and expand.”

But Boehner was right, too. One president got away with making his own laws, and future presidents have indeed done the same.

In the current funding fight, the power of Congress is to inflict pain by refusing to appropriate funds. And on the list of pain points in a shutdown, none surpass the troops going unpaid.

But by quiet, bipartisan assent, that’s being taken off the table as the president just moves some money around to make payroll. Just add that to the list of laws the president either just ignores or skirts, from the unilateral declaration of war against drug cartels to the TikTok ban.

Nicola",,,,,https://www.justsecurity.org/122485/when-deference-is-no-longer-due/,"In the recent cases challenging the federalization and deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has repeatedly argued that the courts should defer to the president’s determination that protests against ICE activity in those cities has rendered the government “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” and constitutes a form of “rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” – two of the possible conditions to federalization under 10 U.S.C.

While not deferring completely to the president, courts have nevertheless given DOJ significant deference, in accordance with how they have historically treated the president’s determinations regarding exigencies that threaten national security or involve foreign policy.
Even applying such deference, however, lower courts have concluded, at least preliminarily, that the president’s determination about the situation in U.S. cities where he has sought to deploy the National Guard does not reflect “a colorable assessment of the facts and law within a ‘range of honest judgment.’” This hesitation to defer to the president’s determination is warranted, not only because, in the words of Judge Karin Immergut in the Oregon case, that presidential determination was “simply untethered to the facts,” but also because the reasons for historical deference to the judgment of the Executive Branch in matters of national security and foreign policy have been severely undermined during the first eight months of the Trump administration.
Deference to the president based on his superior access to intelligence information provided by seasoned intelligence analysts and counterterrorism and counterintelligence experts is no longer warranted where: (1) many of these experts have been fired or stripped of their security clearances for political and retaliatory reasons; (2) presidential determinations have been contrary to the considered assessments of the intelligence community (for example, contrary to Trump administration claims regarding the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua (TDA), the declassified National Intelligence Council assessment that “the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in theUnited States”); and (3) the administration has pushed the envelope on compliance with court orders and then sought to shield itself from review by invoking deference in matters of foreign policy and national security.","In the recent cases challenging the federalization and deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, Portland, and Chicago, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has repeatedly argued that the courts should defer to the president’s determination that protests against ICE activity in those cities has rendered the government “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States” and constitutes a form of “rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States” – two of the possible conditions to federalization under 10 U.S.C. § 12406.

Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.
Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled.
ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said.
Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.","The Nigerian man described being roused with other detainees in September in the middle of the night. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers clasped shackles on their hands and feet, he said, and told them they were being sent to Ghana, even though none of them was from there.

When they asked to speak to their attorney, he said, the officers refused and straitjacketed the already-shackled men in full-body restraint suits called the WRAP, then loaded them onto a plane for the 16-hour-flight to West Africa.

Referred to as “the burrito” or “the bag,” the WRAP has become a harrowing part of deportations for some immigrants.

“It was just like a kidnapping,” the Nigerian man, who’s part of a federal lawsuit, told The Associated Press in an interview from the detainment camp in which he and other deportees were being held in Ghana. Like others placed in the restraints interviewed by the AP, he spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

The AP identified multiple examples of ICE using the black-and-yellow full-body restraint device, the WRAP, in deportations. Its use was described to the AP by five people who said they were restrained in the device, sometimes for hours, on ICE deportation flights dating to 2020. And witnesses and family members in four countries told the AP about its use on at least seven other people this year.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement. And the AP has identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

The WRAP is the subject of a growing number of federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture, whether used in a jail or by immigration authorities during international flights. Among advocates’ concerns is that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force.

DHS has paid Safe Restraints Inc., the WRAP’s California-based maker, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015 during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending. ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it’s not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

The WRAP’s manufacturer says it intended the device to be a lifesaver for law enforcement confronting erratic people who were physically attacking officers or harming themselves.

But ICE officials have a much lower threshold for deploying the WRAP than the manufacturer advises, the AP found. Detainees interviewed by the AP said ICE officers used the restraints on them after they had been shackled. They said this was done to intimidate or punish them for asking to speak to their attorneys or expressing fear at being deported, often to places they fled due to violence and torture.

The West African deportee described a terrifying, hourslong experience that left his legs swollen to the point where he walked with a limp.

“They bundled me and my colleagues,” he said, “tied us up in a straitjacket.”

ICE and DHS would not answer detailed questions from the AP and refused a request for the government’s policy for when and how to use the WRAP.

“The use of restraints on detainees during deportation flights has been long standing, standard ICE protocol and an essential measure to ensure the safety and well-being of both detainees and the officers/agents accompanying them,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS’ spokesperson, said in an email to AP. “Our practices align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.”

The agency would not specify those authorities or describe its practices.

“The use of these devices is inhumane and incompatible with our nation’s fundamental values,” said Noah Baron, an attorney for the West African deportees.

Charles Hammond, CEO of Safe Restraints Inc., said his company has made a modified version of the device for ICE, with changes meant to allow people to be kept in it during flights and long bus trips.

ICE’s version includes a ring on the front of the suit that allows a subject’s cuffed hands to be attached while still allowing for limited use to eat and drink, he said. In addition, the ICE version has “soft elbow cuffs,” Hammond said, which connect in the back so a person can move for proper circulation but can’t flip an elbow out to hit someone.

An AP reporter recounted for Hammond some of the allegations made by people who had been placed in the WRAP for long flights. All of those interviewed by AP said their hands and feet were already restrained by chains. All denied fighting with officers, saying they were either crying or pleading against their deportation to countries they deemed dangerous.

Hammond said that, if true that some people were not being violent and simply protesting verbally, putting them in the WRAP could be improper use.

“That’s not the purpose of the WRAP. If (the deportee) is a current or potential risk to themselves, to officers, to staff, to the plane, restraints are justified. If it’s not, then restraints aren’t.”

‘Please help me’

Juan Antonio Pineda said he was put into “a bag” in late September and driven by immigration officers to the Mexico border. It was black with yellow stripes and had straps that immobilized his body and connected over his shoulders — the WRAP.

Pineda, who is from El Salvador, was in the U.S. legally, he said in a video from an ICE detention center in Arizona. On Sept. 3, he went to an appointment in Maryland to get permission for another year, his wife, Xiomara Ochoa, said in an interview from El Salvador. Instead, he was detained by ICE and told he’d be deported to Mexico, but the documents he was shown had someone else’s name, he said. Even so, he was sent to the Florence Service Processing Center detention facility in Arizona.

Early morning on Wednesday, Sept. 24, he said officers tied his hands and legs, placed him into the “bag” and drove him four hours to the border. When he refused to sign the deportation papers, Pineda alleges officers broke his right arm and gave him a black eye before driving him back another four hours in the “bag.” The AP was unable to independently confirm how he was injured. Pineda’s video shows him with a cast on his arm and bruising on his face.

The next day, Thursday, Sept. 25, they tied him up again, put him in the bag and drove him to the border, where Mexican immigration officials turned him away, he said.

“Eight hours there and back and they don’t give me food or water or anything,” he said in the video, which his wife shared with the AP. “Please help me.”

He was ultimately deported to Mexico, Ochoa said.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP regarding Pineda’s case.

In addition to the Nigerian man flown to Ghana, four others interviewed by AP said they were placed in the WRAP and carried onto deportation flights since the first Trump administration.

As U.S. immigration officials move aggressively to meet the president’s deportation goals, advocates and attorneys for immigrants are echoing the concerns of the government’s own civil rights inquiry that ICE officers aren’t trained on how to use the restraints.

“This should be a last resort type of restraint after they’ve already tried other things,” said Fatma Marouf, a Texas A&M law professor who has sued ICE over its use of the device. “Just being bound up like that can inflict a lot of psychological harm.”

Some deportees said they were left in the WRAP for an entire fight. A lawsuit filed on behalf of the Nigerian man and four others currently detained in Dema Camp, Ghana, included the allegation from one that ICE left the restraint suit on him for 16 hours, only once undoing the lower part so he could use the bathroom.

“No one should be put into a WRAP. I don’t even think they strap animals like that,” recalled a man who said he suffered a concussion and dislocated jaw being placed into the device in 2023 before a deportation flight to Cape Verde, an African island nation. AP’s review of his medical records confirmed he suffered those injuries in 2023.

“It was the most painful thing I’ve been through,” said the man, adding he was restrained most of the 10-hour flight. “Forget the assault, forget the broken jaw. Just the WRAP itself was hurtful.”

Also, the man said, the metal ring his cuffed hands were attached to — one of the ICE modifications to the WRAP designed to increase comfort — injured him. “When they slammed me face forward on the floor, that metal ring dug into my chest causing me bruising and pain which was part of my injuries that I complained about.”

ICE’s current use of the WRAP comes amid an unprecedented wave of masked federal immigration officers grabbing suspected immigrants off the street, and mounting accusations that the Trump administration has dehumanized them, including by subjecting them to cruel and unusual detention conditions.

ICE’s use of the WRAP has continued despite a 2023 report by DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, or CRCL, that raised serious concerns over the lack of policies governing its use.

ICE agreed with the internal findings on some points, a then-DHS official involved in the review said, but challenged the notion that the WRAP should be classified as a “four-point restraint,” a designation that would place more limitations on its use. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the inquiry.

DHS largely dismantled the office that produced the 2023 report earlier this year amid widespread government firings, calling it a roadblock to enforcement operations.

“Without changes to the current training, and the lack of policy, CRCL has serious concerns about ICE’s continued use of the WRAP,” wrote the report’s authors, who cited a news article mentioning lawsuits claiming the device had led to deaths.

Use by police and in jails

Last year police officers in Virginia Beach, Virginia, placed Rolin Hill in the WRAP, saying he was being combative during an arrest at a convenience store. The officers left Hill in the device when they dropped him at the jail. Video from the jail shows deputies punching the WRAP-immobilized Hill in the head and back. Hill died in a hospital, and while the WRAP’s exact role is unknown, Hill’s death was ruled a homicide by “positional and mechanical asphyxia due to restraint with neck and torso compression.” Three of the deputies are now charged with his murder, and five were removed from their jobs.

Also last year, in Missouri, prosecutors charged five jailers in the death of Othel Moore Jr., who according to an autopsy asphyxiated in the WRAP. Jailhouse footage showed Moore, who’d also been sprayed with tear gas and placed in a “spit mask” covering his face, repeatedly told officers he couldn’t breathe.

AP identified many of the other non-ICE cases involving the WRAP during an investigation into deaths after police subdued people with common tactics that, unlike guns, are meant to stop someone without killing them.

While Hammond insists the WRAP has never been determined as the cause of death when used properly, the AP identified 43 times in which the WRAP was used by police or correctional officers in a case in which someone died. In 12 of those cases the official autopsy determined that “restraint” played some role in the death.

It was often impossible to determine the exact role the WRAP may have played, as deaths often involved the use of other potentially dangerous force on people who in several cases were high on methamphetamine.

The WRAP first appeared in law enforcement in the late 1990s, presented as an alternative to tying a subject’s hands and feet together in a practice known as “hog-tying.” It first found widespread use in California jails and today is used by more than 1,800 departments and facilities around the country, according to the manufacturer, which says it has sold more than 10,000 devices.

Many of these cases have drawn little media attention, such as the 2020 case of Alberto Pena, who was jailed on a misdemeanor criminal mischief charge after getting drunk and damaging the walls and doors at his parents’ home outside Rio Grande City, Texas. The 30-year-old became erratic on the way to the Starr County Jail, beating his own head against the inside of the patrol unit and, later, the wall of his cell.

Deputies placed Pena in the WRAP for more than two hours, where he repeatedly cried out for help and complained he could not breathe. But he was left unattended in the device for significant periods of time, court records show, and no medical attention was provided for his self-inflicted head injuries.

An autopsy ruled Pena’s death “accidental,” but a forensic pathologist hired by the family attributed Pena’s death in part to the WRAP’s “prolonged restraint” and said it “could have been averted” with proper medical care.

“The WRAP should have never been used in this situation. It was a medical emergency and he should have been taken to the hospital,” said Natasha Powers-Marakis, a former police officer and use of force expert who reviewed the case on behalf of Pena’s family as part of their wrongful death lawsuit against the county and officers who placed him in the device. The arresting officers had been told Pena suffered from bipolar disorder.

The Starr County Sheriff’s Office has denied wrongdoing and maintained Pena did not require medical care. Robert Drinkard, an attorney for the county, told AP the use of the WRAP “was neither improper nor caused Mr. Pena’s tragic death.” He added that each deputy involved in placing Pena in the WRAP had been trained in its application.

A federal judge recently dismissed the Pena family’s lawsuit, ruling the deputies were shielded from liability.

‘Carrying me like a corpse’

In the context of an ICE deportation flight, the use of restraints like the WRAP can be justified, Hammond, the manufacturer’s CEO, argues.

ICE officers have to ensure that they secure anyone who could pose a fight risk on a long flight, he said. Given the high stakes of a violent confrontation on an airplane, Hammond believes cases like those described to the AP can warrant the WRAP’s use, even if the person is already in chains.

However, properly trained agents are supposed to loosen the straps and allow enough movement so the subject can eat and drink, as well as use the bathroom.

“With the WRAP, when it is used properly, it’s a shorter fight, which is good for everybody. It prioritizes breathing, which is good for everybody. And you have no more fight and can provide medical care or mental health care or de-escalation efforts,” Hammond said.

Those placed in one of Hammond’s restraint suits, however, recount the experience as traumatic.

One of these people was first put into five-point shackles when he became dizzy and tripped while ascending the stairs to board the ICE flight to Cameroon in November 2020. The officer mistook his stumbling as resistance, he said. Immediately, camouflage-clad ICE officers quickly pushed him to the tarmac and onto a WRAP device, he said.

Soon, he felt the straps cinching around his legs and upper body.

“They bundled me like a log of wood from all the sides and they were just carrying me like a corpse,” he said.

Another man interviewed by the AP said ICE officers put him in the WRAP after he initially resisted efforts to move him onto a deportation flight in Alexandria, Louisiana, in 2020. He’d fled political violence and persecution in his native Cameroon, and was afraid to go back. He said officers took him out of his cell in front of the other detainees and put him in the WRAP, leaving him for hours in view of the others as a warning to them not to speak up.

“I told him ‘I can’t breathe,’” the man said. “He responded, ’I don’t care, I’m doing my job.’”

The immigration officers stopped their truck and went straight after them on Oct. 9, Cruz told the Tribune.

“They asked us if we have papers. I said I do but I don’t have them on me,” Cruz, a 60-year old man with heart problems originally from El Salvador, recalled in Spanish.

The agents stood Cruz up, put him in their truck, drove around in circles, and asked questions, he said.

Where was he born? What is his name? Who is his mother? Who is his father?

“I told them, they are dead,” Cruz said. The agents said they needed the information anyway so they could look him up in their databases. Eventually, the agents verified that he is, in fact, legally in the country. And they let him go.

But not before writing him a $130 ticket for not having his papers. Cruz’s friend, who is homeless, did not have legal status and was taken away by the feds.

Under federal law, registered foreign nationals must carry proof of registration with them at all times. But prior to a second Trump administration, it was rarely enforced. As President Donald Trump escalates his immigration crackdown in Chicago and its suburbs, “Operation Midway Blitz,” agents are using broad federal authority when targeting suspected immigrants, legal experts say.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Oct. 1 that it had made 800 arrests in the area since the mission began at the beginning of September.

While federal officials claim they are targeting the “worst of the worst,” bystanders have been swept up and people across the Chicagoland region have accused the government of widespread civil rights violations. In blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois last week, U.S. District Judge April Perry said the federal government had a credibility problem that made many of their claims “unreliable.”

The National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago told the Tribune it has not yet seen any of its clients receive this sort of citation. But it’s part of a recent push by the Trump administration to ensure immigrants register with authorities and maintain their documentation to them at all times or face potential penalties.

The Immigrant Legal Resource Center calls it a “hateful tactic” meant to “cause panic and fear throughout the country.”

“America has never been a place where people need to ‘show one’s papers.’ Ticketing a lawful permanent resident — and forcing him to appear in court and pay a fine for not carrying their papers — is unnecessary and cruel,” said Ed Yohnka, communications director for the ACLU of Illinois. “It does not make our communities stronger or more safe. It is simply part of the Trump Administration’s attempt to make life uncomfortable for all immigrants. It is just awful.”

A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not return messages seeking comment.

It’s not clear how many individuals have been ticketed for not having their papers on them. The ticket Cruz showed the Tribune references a law requiring immigrants to be registered with the government and have their registration documents.

A former dishwasher, Cruz lives in a government-funded apartment but isn’t working due to his health. Cruz said he was relieved to be released but worries how he will pay the fine. The ICE agents told Cruz he has to pay it within 60 days or go to court.

“It’s not fair because I said, let’s go to my house and I’ll show you my papers. I’m a resident,” Cruz said.

U.S. citizens say they’re also being questioned by federal immigration agents for proof of citizenship.

Maria Greeley, 44, had just finished working a double shift at the Beach Bar on Ohio Street earlier this month when she said she was surrounded by three federal agents who grabbed her, forced her hands behind her back and zip tied her.

Headphones in, Greeley had been focused on getting home to her two dogs for a walk. Instead, she said she was detained by masked agents who did not answer when she asked for names. They questioned her for an hour, she said.

Greeley, who was born at Illinois Masonic hospital and is adopted, carries a copy of her passport just in case she runs into federal agents.

“I am Latina and I am a service worker,” Greeley said. “I fit the description of what they’re looking for now.”

During the encounter, Greeley said they told her she “doesn’t look like” a Greeley.

“They said this isn’t real, they kept telling me I’m lying, I’m a liar,” Greeley recalled. “I told them to look in the rest of my wallet, I have my credit cards, my insurance.”

When the agents let her go, Greeley got home and screamed when she saw the shadow on her door. Days after the incident, Greeley said, it’s still “terrifying.”

“I just have to stay strong and not think about it, I’m still here, luckily,” she said, tearing up. “All those other people are getting taken.”

Days after Cruz had the encounter with federal agents, Cruz attended a hastily organized protest in Rogers Park residents. Hundreds turned out.

Ald. Maria Hadden, 49th, represents the Far North Side neighborhood on Chicago’s City Council. She said it was an effort to “recognize people from our community who were taken” and bring people together “to remind them that we are not powerless.”

The protest organizer group, Protect Rogers Park, posted on Facebook: “Today 400+ Rogers Parkers gathered to mourn, celebrate, defy authoritarianism, (canvass) and recommit to loving their neighbors. Oh, and buy a lot of tacos.”

It also has sent a jolt through the Senate, where the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee recently reintroduced legislation designed to strengthen the rules for the program and prioritize applicants with advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering or mathematics.

“We need an immigration bill, badly,” said Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a cosponsor of the bill who is working to get fellow conservatives on board with the effort. He’s also running for governor of a state with multiple major research universities.

“I think Trump, perhaps inadvertently, is strengthening our case for the bill,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), another co-sponsor of the legislation.

Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, however, are skeptical there is sufficient political will to make any meaningful progress on the issue. Immigration hard-liners still occupy senior positions throughout the White House and hold power on Capitol Hill; Trump has waffled on the question of whether the H-1B policy is worth preserving; and at least one key Democrat says any conservative enthusiasm now to tackle the program is too little, too late.

“There’s no appetite for immigration legislation at all,” said Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He is set to retire in 2027 with little to show for his work over nearly three decades in office to pass legislation that would create a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants.

The American economy relies heavily on H-1B visas, with the number of people applying for slots vastly outnumbering those which are available each year. And this is not the first time lawmakers have seen a glimmer of hope around efforts to overhaul the program — only to later see it fade.

Almost a year ago, the billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk was touting high-skilled immigration throughout the United States through H-1B visas, saying they were necessary to help fuel innovation. Trump, who suspended the program during his first term, suddenly appeared ready to side with Musk, lauding the initiative that he claimed to have leveraged for his own business interests.

Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), a MAGA stalwart and Musk acolyte, also signaled an openness to revisiting the H-1B system from his perch as chair of the House Judiciary Committee.

But Musk has since that time had a public falling-out with the president, and anti-immigration hawks like White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller have Trump’s ear. Trump’s new H-1B visa fee is a reflection of the administration’s current stance.

“Anything that’s going to get done, the president’s got to sign off on it,” said Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), “So it’s going to be something that the president feels comfortable with.”

Scott worked on a previous effort to limit the number of H-1B recipients who can receive green cards annually. Different versions of that bill passed the House and the Senate in 2019 and 2020, respectively, but the two measures were never reconciled, and the legislation was never signed into law.

Wishing to seize the moment but also cognizant of the political challenges ahead, Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in an interview shifted his comments to deliver a personal plea to Trump himself.

“The president has brought attention to the problems with H-1B’s,” the Iowa Republican said. “If the president will read your story, I’d give him this message: He’s created great credibility because he has closed down the border — great credibility on immigration issues.”

Endorsing an H-1B overhaul bill, Grassley continued, “would give him a chance to get some of these really simple things in immigration that ought to pass the Congress.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on its intentions to work with Congress on a legislative fix.

George Fishman, a senior legal fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies and former Department of Homeland Security official in the first Trump administration, said Trump is being pulled in radically different directions by those advising him. Barring true interest from Trump in the matter, Fishman suspected congressional action is unlikely.

“Based on three decades of bitter experience, I’m sort of resigned to not expecting things to happen legislatively,” said Fishman, who also worked on immigration policy as a Hill aide.

Trump aside, the political dynamics around the immigration issue on Capitol Hill are broadly problematic. For years, efforts to update the nation’s outdated immigration policy have fallen short. A bipartisan Senate “gang” in 2013 managed to pass a bill that combined border security with a pathway to citizenship, but it was never taken up in the House.

Since that time, the Trump ethos around immigration has further polarized the issue, hardening even Republicans who at one point linked their personal brands to being willing to work with Democrats on it.

That includes Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was once Durbin’s main partner in trying to pass legislation that would protect young immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children — the recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program.

Graham now says he isn’t interested in doing anything to expand legal immigration until the border is properly secured — and he doesn’t trust Democrats to restrain themselves.

“We all are agreed that we need H-1B reform,” Graham said in an interview. “Well, then Democrats will say, ‘Okay, let’s reform that, but what about the DACA folks?’ And they’ll want something there, and that’s just the way it goes.”

Grassley said he understood that reality. “We got some people on the right that think they aren’t going to vote for any [immigration] legislation until you load up 12 million people and get them out of the country.”

In the meantime, Trump’s new $100,000 fee is being challenged in court by a coalition of unions, education groups and others who argue the cost is unworkable and unjustified. A judge could strike down the proclamation, and the case is ongoing.

Until then, Grassley suggested the chaos and anxiety being caused by the presidential action could work to the advantage of the program’s proponents.

“The business groups that fought the Grassley-Durbin bill over the last 10 years, that are now upset with the $100,000 the president’s putting in on each one of these [visas] … maybe they would realize that they shouldn’t have fought our legislation,” he said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F0a%2F21%2Fa4f5d7dc4d86bb0a6f83ba9a9c0e%2Fu-s-congress-03541.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 07:58:19.658425

Even as an appeals court allowed a federal judge to temporarily block the Trump administration from sending 500 National Guard troops into Chicago, teams of masked immigration enforcement agents staged a series of increasingly aggressive raids across the city’s North Side.

U.S. District Court Judge April Perry issued an order on Thursday blocking “the federalization and deployment” of 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, 200 members of the Texas National Guard and 14 members of the California National Guard into Illinois.

The Trump administration immediately appealed that order to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which allowed Perry’s ruling blocking the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois to stand, while halting her order stopping President Donald Trump from federalizing those troops.

That decision means that the hundreds of National Guard troops remain at a military facility near Joliet, where they arrived last week, but are blocked by Perry’s order from doing anything other than training on land controlled by the federal government.

But the outcome of what promises to be just the first skirmish in a lengthy legal battle that could reach all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court did nothing to stop immigration agents from carrying out the Trump administration’s combative immigration enforcement operation dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The operations carried out by U.S. Department of Homeland Security agents, including members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol, appeared to be concentrated in neighborhoods away from the course of the 47th annual Chicago Marathon, which went off without disruption despite widespread concerns.

A WGN-TV employee was detained by Border Patrol officials on Friday near Lincoln Square on the city’s North Side before being released without charges several hours later. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, that the employee “was arrested for throwing objects at law enforcement.”

As agents left that scene, they struck a vehicle and did not stop.

“Several violent agitators used vehicles to block in agents to impede & assault federal officers. In fear of public & law enforcement safety, officers used their service vehicle to strike a suspect’s vehicle and create an opening,” McLaughlin posted.

After several people were detained Thursday and Friday in the Far North Side neighborhood of Rogers Park, hundreds of people rallied Saturday near Clark Street and Lunt Avenue, the location of at least one of the raids, Block Club Chicago reported.

After immigration enforcement agents were reported outside nearby St. Jerome Catholic Church, video of a priest warning parishioners about leaving Mass unaccompanied early Sunday went viral. After word of that warning spread, a human chain formed to protect attendees, witnesses told NBC Chicago.

Community organizations have been working to identify the location of federal agents in Chicago neighborhoods to warn undocumented immigrants of their presence. Groups have distributed whistles and created text and phone networks to sound the alarm.

During a separate incident Sunday morning, federal agents appeared to point a gun at a man who was objecting to their activities in a Rogers Park alley, according to several videos of the incident posted on social media.

But perhaps the most violent encounter between Chicagoans angry about immigration enforcement operations occurred Sunday afternoon in Albany Park, on the city’s Northwest Side, when a group of Chicagoans confronted four vehicles of agents, as reported by the Chicago Sun-Times.

After agents shoved people to the ground, the agents dispersed tear gas — without any warning — to the dozens of people nearby, according to witnesses and videos posted on social media.

A federal judge ordered agents to issue two warnings before using tear gas.

‘Unreliable’ Assertions by the Trump Administration

Although lawyers for the state of Illinois and city of Chicago had asked Perry to block President Donald Trump from deploying the military into Illinois, she found that there had not been sufficient evidence presented that the president planned to take that step.

The Posse Comitatus Act, which dates to 1878, is a criminal law that bars the use of the military for domestic policing.

Trump has said he would consider enacting the Insurrection Act, which allows presidents to deploy the U.S. military within the country in response to what is determined to be an insurrection against the government, if judges block his deployment of National Guard troops to Illinois and Portland, Oregon.

“So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason. If I had to enact it, I’d do that,” Trump said. “If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors, or mayors were holding us up, sure I’d do that.”

Read Perry’s full order.

Perry said she found federal officials’ assertions that federal agents had been subjected to serious and coordinated violence by protestors “unreliable.”

Perry wrote that she took note of “a troubling trend of Defendants’ declarants equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning, and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting, or doing violence.”

“This indicates to the Court both bias and lack of objectivity,” Perry wrote.

Perry also concluded that she could not “find reasonable support for a conclusion that there exists in Illinois a danger of rebellion satisfying the demands” of the federal law allowing the president to federalize the National Guard.

“The unrest Defendants complain of has consisted entirely of opposition (indeed, sometimes violent) to a particular federal agency and the laws it is charged with enforcing. That is not opposition to the authority of the federal government as a whole,” Perry wrote. “Defendants have offered no explanation supporting the notion that widespread opposition to immigration enforcement constitutes the makings of a broader opposition to the authority of the federal government.”

Perry, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, was first tapped to serve as the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois. Her confirmation to that post was blocked by former U.S. Sen. JD Vance, who is now vice president.

‘Countermanding the President’s Military Judgment’: Feds

During Thursday’s historic hearing, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton repeatedly asserted that Perry must give the president’s determination that the deployment of the National Guard is necessary “great deference.”

“The president’s judgement is unreviewable,” Hamilton said.

In its appeal, the Trump administration said Perry had misapplied the law.

“In countermanding the president’s military judgment, the district court largely ignored the facts on the ground, relied on an improper … factual investigation, and rested on an adverse ‘credibility’ finding that had no basis in the record,” according to lawyers for the Trump administration.

The appeals court panel could decide at any time whether to take up the Trump administration’s appeal and whether to allow the deployment of federalized National Guard troops while it resolves the case.

Perry scheduled the next hearing in the case for 9 a.m. Oct. 22, when she said she will consider extending the temporary restraining order she issued for an additional 14 days before the initial order expires at 11:59 p.m. Oct. 23.

Nearly 2,500 federalized National Guard troops from several states led by Republicans have been in Washington, D.C., since August.

While the president has credited those troops with lowering crime in the nation’s capital, crime data shows no significant drop in violent crime, records show. National Guard members have picked up trash and helped package meals for unhoused residents, according to the Associated Press.

A lawsuit brought by D.C.'s attorney general is challenging the deployment, with a hearing scheduled for Oct. 24.

Of the more than 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 U.S. Marines sent to Los Angeles, approximately 100 California National Guard members remain under federal authority, officials said, including the 14 soldiers sent to Illinois to provide “training and subject matter expertise.”

Los Angeles and California officials challenged that deployment in federal court. A judge found not only was it illegal, but the activities of the military violated the Posse Comitatus Act. That order has been halted by an appeals court, but the litigation remains ongoing.

Trump has also ordered National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, despite Gov. Tina Kotek’s objections.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, said the president’s claims of daily unrest in Portland were “untethered to facts” and risked violating the U.S. Constitution by imposing military rule. Immergut has temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops into Portland.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could decide at any time whether to overturn Immergut’s ruling.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-14 09:57:41.546410

During an interaction Sunday with immigration agents in Northwest Side neighborhood Albany Park, video appears to show agents deploying tear gas against the public without any audible warning - something that is unlawful under a court order from last week.

Other images show immigration agents outside of a church in Rogers Park that same day during a Spanish-language Mass.

That is prompting questions over whether they had warrants targeting specific people or were there without warrants, something that requires additional probable cause and an assessment of an immigrant's flight risk.

""What we have seen now to a much larger scale is federal agents indiscriminately stopping and arresting people without warrants and without probable cause required by federal immigration laws,"" said Mark Fleming, an attorney with the National Immigrant Justice Center.

A fence still up around the Broadview ICE facility is restricting access to a public road on Monday night after a judge ruled it should be taken down. The deadline to do so is Tuesday night -- but what happens if that does not happen?

Former federal prosecutor Ron Safer said, ""I am very worried about where we are right now. We are on the precipice, looking into the abyss of chaos, because if the norms of the government are not respected, if somebody says, the judiciary makes a decision, and then the executive branch ignores it. That's chaos.""

Safer explained federal judges can rule according to the law, but if the executive branch, in this case federal agents, refuse to follow those rulings, judges don't have an army to enforce their orders.

""Normally, judges enforce their ruling by contempt orders, and then the person who is violating the order is fined or imprisoned, if it's bad enough. How do you do that to a cabinet level official, and who is going to enforce that?"" he asked.

At that point, the constitution and American norms require the executive branch to enforce itself.

That is something Safer is skeptical the president will do.

""It is norms that presidents will respect the decisions of the courts, that they will respect the views of the governors. That's out the window. None of the norms are being observed, and that is going to create, and is creating crises on the streets and in Washington and across the country,"" he said.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18000976_101325-wls-iteam-mark-court-orders-6p-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-14 11:59:34.880249

Though most enrollment numbers increased across the board, international student enrollment dropped by approximately 6%.
Most international students at U.S. universities use the F-1 or J-1 visa.
According to Stonesifer, there is no “reliable mechanism” for the University to predict future enrollment percentages with the uncertainty of current immigration policy.
Andrea Peña-Vasquez, an assistant professor of international affairs who specializes in immigration at the School of Public and International Affairs, said the University may see more stark effects in international enrollment next year.","International student enrollment dropped this fall, which comes on the heels of the Trump administration’s restrictive immigration policy.

This fall, undergraduate enrollment increased by about 4.5% — marking an increase from 20,418 undergraduate students last year to 21,388 this year. Though most enrollment numbers increased across the board, international student enrollment dropped by approximately 6%. This comes after President Donald Trump’s 2025 strict immigration policies and harsh rhetoric against immigrants.

Most international students at U.S. universities use the F-1 or J-1 visa. The F-1 visa is used most commonly for international students to study in the U.S., while the J-1 visa is generally used for short-term academic exchange programs.

This fall, 2,711 students with F-1 and J-1 visas enrolled at Pitt while last fall, the number was at 2,860 students, according to University spokesperson Jared Stonesifer.

According to Stonesifer, there is no “reliable mechanism” for the University to predict future enrollment percentages with the uncertainty of current immigration policy.

“Students are advised to weigh these challenges against the substantial benefits of a U.S. education at our institution,” Stonesifer said. “The University is committed to monitoring changes in policy, visa processing and global events that may impact international students’ ability to study in the United States and to providing support strategies based on evolving circumstances.”

On April 9, the Trump administration revoked a Pitt student’s visa and two recent graduates’ visas. Shortly after, Student Government Board announced the students’ legal statuses were restored in the federal Student and Exchange Visitor Information System.

In early October, the Trump administration sent a memo to nine U.S. colleges — not including Pitt — with specific requirements to get preferential access to federal funds. One requirement said universities can have no more than 15% internationally exchanged undergraduate students.

The University approved 215 H1-B visas in 2025, non-immigrant visas for highly educated foreign professionals to work in specialized jobs at universities and companies. Trump instituted a new $100,000 H1-B worker visa application fee in September, which previously cost $215.

Andrea Peña-Vasquez, an assistant professor of international affairs who specializes in immigration at the School of Public and International Affairs, said the University may see more stark effects in international enrollment next year.

“We might see people choosing to stay in their home countries or look into other places other than the U.S. to come for school,” Peña-Vasquez said. “Other countries that also offer opportunities for international students might become more appealing in the future because of [national immigration policy changes].”

Peña-Vasquez said she thinks federal immigration policies will harm SPIA, too.

“At SPIA, especially, we have such a large international population,” Peña-Vasquez said. ”Our international students really bring in this wealth of perspective that our domestic students benefit so greatly from.”

Peña-Vasquez said as a political scientist, she believes in the “soft power” of person-to-person discussion and connecting through educational opportunities, which international students contribute to.

“We learn so much from [international students], and the ones that do return to their home countries end up bringing back lessons from the U.S. about democracy and things like American culture,” Peña-Vasquez said. “I think that is such an important part of soft power, and I think now we’re going to see this decrease in these exchanges.”

Stonesifer said the University is working with public officials on all levels to advocate for international students.

“We work with the University’s elected officials, Pennsylvania’s Congressional delegation and federal agencies to advocate on behalf of our international community,” Stonesifer said.

Peña-Vasquez believes the Trump administration’s immigration policies are harmful to universities nationwide.",https://pittnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Carthy-Drone-Photos-8.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 07:58:30.001919

The deal, signed by the UK and France in July, involves one asylum seeker who arrives in the UK from France in a small boat being sent back there in exchange for another selected in France to come to the UK.
“However, parliament was unable to examine this treaty.” The challenge comes as 25 asylum seekers returned to France under the terms of the treaty have drafted a joint statement about their situation in France, shared with the Guardian.
This allows one EU country to send asylum seekers back to another they previously passed through and were fingerprinted in.
“The agreement between the UK and France will go down as a dark chapter in history because it has abandoned us completely.","Fifteen French and UK human rights organisations are calling for the suspension of the controversial “one in, one out” treaty in a legal challenge that has been launched in France.

The deal, signed by the UK and France in July, involves one asylum seeker who arrives in the UK from France in a small boat being sent back there in exchange for another selected in France to come to the UK.

Those supporting the challenge include Utopia 56, Auberge des Migrants, Secours Catholique and Doctors of the World.

Lionel Crusoé, the French lawyer bringing the challenge, said: “We have filed an appeal with the Council of State against the decree publishing the Franco-British agreement. We challenge the readmission measures provided for in this agreement.

“These measures do not provide sufficient guarantees to take into account the specific situation of exiles. Furthermore, the ‘one-to-one’ approach seems highly questionable and does not sufficiently respect the principle of human dignity.”

He added that part of the case is that the conditions breach the French constitution, saying that before the treaty came into force, a bill ratifying it should have been submitted to the French parliament. “However, parliament was unable to examine this treaty.”

The challenge comes as 25 asylum seekers returned to France under the terms of the treaty have drafted a joint statement about their situation in France, shared with the Guardian. They say they need to “urgently bring attention to the extremely difficult and unsafe conditions we are currently living in”.

Twenty-six asylum seekers have so far been sent back to France. They have fled a range of conflict zones including Eritrea and Iran. One has left France soon after arriving there and his whereabouts are not known.

Many are in their teens or early 20s. They say they have been fingerprinted in France in preparation for being forcibly removed to other EU countries under what is known as the Dublin convention.

This allows one EU country to send asylum seekers back to another they previously passed through and were fingerprinted in. After Brexit, the UK no longer had access to this mechanism but, thanks to the new treaty, Downing Street now has indirect access.

Documents seen by the Guardian given to some asylum seekers by French authorities state: “Summons for the implementation of the Dublin procedure.”

The joint statement from the asylum seekers returned to France states:

“We are writing to urgently bring attention to the extremely difficult and unsafe conditions we are currently living in. The UK government has sent us away, and the country we were returned to has not provided us with any rights, support, or protection.”

They add that they have been given inadequate and unsafe housing, a lack of access to proper healthcare – including for survivors of torture – insufficient food and separation from families in the UK.

“We urgently request your help to ensure our rights are respected and that justice is restored. We ask you to imagine if you were a parent with children – how would you feel if your children were left alone somewhere with no one to care for them? Whatever care and protection you would give them, we ask you to extend the same to us. This is a humble plea based on humanity, and we hope our voices are heard so that support and protection can reach us immediately.”

One asylum seeker who was returned to France told the Guardian: “I don’t even have one euro. I can’t stay here because I was badly attacked by the smugglers. They are so dangerous. They all have guns in their hands. I saw how they beat asylum seekers.”

“I am worried we are going to be sent back to the very countries we fled from,” said a second asylum seeker.

“The agreement between the UK and France will go down as a dark chapter in history because it has abandoned us completely. The UK government is making an example of us and this is very painful and shameful.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Those arriving in the UK on small boats illegally will now be detained and returned thanks to the French deal.

“The government is working closely with our French counterparts to scale up the deportation of illegal migrants.

“We make no apologies for cracking down on illegal migration and will do whatever to takes to secure our borders.”

Home Office sources added that those returned to France were processed according to French immigration procedures and that the legal basis for the “one in one out” deal had been agreed with France and the European Commission to ensure compliance with domestic, European and international law.

The French interior ministry has been approached for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9429b64864d360eb14e317691ad667c78020a868/670_0_3352_2681/master/3352.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ea4e8b11f59dcf61b3e661aafd5af6e6",N,,2025-10-14 06:56:37.982976

The most controversial aspect of the bill concerns an obscure, decades-old form called a caregiver's authorization affidavit.
Proponents said parents at risk of deportation should get to choose someone trusted to care for their children if ICE detains them.

""What are parental rights?""","Gov. Gavin Newsom on Sunday signed a bill allowing a broad range of relatives to step in as children's caregivers if their parents are deported, a measure that had provoked a firestorm of conservative criticism.

Assembly Bill 495 will also bar daycare providers from collecting immigration information about a child or their parents, and allow parents to nominate a temporary legal guardian for their child in family court.

""We are putting on record that we stand by our families and their right to keep their private information safe, maintain parental rights and help families prepare in case of emergencies,"" Newsom said in a press release.

It was one of several measures the Democratic-dominated Legislature pushed this year in response to the Trump administration's aggressive deportation crackdown in Los Angeles and across California. Newsom, a Democrat, signed several of those other bills - banning Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from wearing masks in the state and requiring schools and hospitals to require warrants when officers show up - in a ceremony in L.A. last month.

He left AB 495 undecided for weeks, prompting a flurry of advocacy by immigrants' rights groups to secure Newsom's signature in the face of intense pushback from conservative activists. The governor announced his decision the day before his deadline to sign or veto the over 800 bills lawmakers sent to his desk last month.

The most controversial aspect of the bill concerns an obscure, decades-old form called a caregiver's authorization affidavit. Relatives of a child whose parents are temporarily unavailable, and with whom the child is living, can attest to being the child's caregiver; the designation allows the adult to enroll the child in school, take them to the doctor and consent to medical and dental care.

The new law will broaden who is allowed to sign the caregiver affidavit, from more traditional definitions of relatives to any adult in the family who is ""related to the child by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth degree of kinship,"" which includes people like great aunts or cousins. Parents can cancel the caregiver designation, which is intended to be a temporary arrangement and does not give that person custody.

Proponents said parents at risk of deportation should get to choose someone trusted to care for their children if ICE detains them. Expanding who is eligible for the caregiver form, they said, gives immigrant parents more options because they may not have close relatives in the country but benefit from strong ties with extended family or informal community networks.

The legislation was backed by immigrants' rights groups and children's advocates such as the Alliance for Children's Rights and First 5 California.

""I introduced this bill so children do not have to wonder what will happen to them if their parents are not able to pick them up from school,"" bill author Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, an Arleta Democrat, said at a recent press conference.

Critics claim strangers could get custody

But Republicans, the religious right and parental rights' activists argued the bill would instead endanger children.

They claimed it would allow strangers to sign the affidavit and claim the child into their care. Hundreds of opponents showed up at the Capitol by busload to rally against the legislation, organized by Pastor Jack Hibbs of the Calvary Chapel Chino Hills megachurch, who called it ""the most dangerous bill we've seen"" in Sacramento. Some of the blowback stemmed from false claims that the bill would allow strangers to get custody of children to whom they're not related.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a San Diego Republican, called the legislation ""a human trafficker's dream.""

In an email, Greg Burton, vice president of the California Family Council, took issue with the fact that parents might not be there when the affidavit form is signed.

""What are parental rights?"" he wrote. ""These rights are nothing if someone else can claim them by simply signing a form.""

Over the summer, Rodriguez narrowed the legislation to exclude ""nonrelative extended family members,"" but it was not enough to quell the controversy. The legislation was passed along party lines.

In comparison to a fairly progressive Legislature, the governor has often positioned himself as a moderating force on child custody and protection issues, which regularly galvanize conservative activists and put California Democrats on the defensive. In 2023, he vetoed a bill that would have required family court judges to consider a parent's support of a child's gender transition in custody disputes.

At a press conference last week where activists urged Newsom to sign the bill, Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrants' Rights Los Angeles, asked the governor ""to not listen to the lies, to not listen to all the other stuff that's being said about this bill.""

Newsom, announcing his decision, quietly acknowledged the controversy in a press release. He included statements he said were ""correcting the record"" on mischaracterizations and said the new law does not change the fact that parental rights and legal guardianships must be decided by family court judges.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/17999567_101325-kfsn-newsom-ap-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-14 11:58:58.536832

Roan, 27, played two shows at Brookside at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, over the weekend. During the first performance on Friday, October 10, she reflected on the city she now calls home.

“L.A.’s my favorite city in the world, to be honest,” Roan announced to the crowd, per Variety. “I’ve been living here nine years. I’m originally from Missouri and I had a really, really tough time the first five years.”

She went on to discuss the wildfires that affected the area earlier this year, saying, “I’m not gonna be eloquent about this. I loved L.A. more than ever when I saw how the community came together in Altadena to help, same with the Palisades. I just realized that I’m so lucky to be able to live here and to play here, and the city has taken care of me, and it’s my duty to take care of it back.”

She then added: “F*** ICE forever”, before repeating the phrase as the crowd chanted along.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been the subject of multiple protests this year after stepping up immigration raids and carrying out mass deportations.

The Department of Homeland Security responded to Roan’s pronouncement in a statement to TMZ. DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin said: “‘Pink Pony Club’ is good. Pedophiles are bad. That’s who we’re getting off of our streets. Get a grip.”

Earlier today, McLaughlin also responded to a Saturday Night Live sketch mocking Homeland Security Director Kristi Noem.

Amy Poehler returned to host the long-running NBC show Saturday, opening with a sketch spoofing Pam Bondi’s Senate hearing that starred Tina Fey as Noem.

McLaughlin commented on the sketch in a statement to Entertainment Weekly. “SNL is absolutely right — the Democrats’ shutdown does need to end!” she said.

The premise of the Cold Open was that Poehler’s Bondi — having not actually answered any questions during her Senate hearing — has been called back in to once again face questioning.

At one point, Poehler’s Bondi is asked why ICE agents are being sent to American cities. The question serves as a segue to introduce a special appearance by SNL legend Fey playing Noem.

Fey’s Noem walked into the sketch with an assault rifle, a baseball cap, and blinding lip gloss, living up to her recently-acquired “Ice Barbie” moniker.

Arguably the biggest laugh of the opening sketch is when a senator stand-in insists to Fey’s Noem that Democrats want to end the government shutdown more than Republicans do, to which she replied “ha — that makes me laugh more than the ending to Old Yeller.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/13/21/54/GettyImages-2213104761.jpg?trim=0,1,0,1&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-14 11:59:41.340357

Europe and Eurasia alone provide a plethora of examples — from European Union member Hungary — and previously Poland — to Belarus, Russia, Georgia, and Kyrgyzstan — governments seeking to centralize control have openly and systematically targeted those who defend the rule of law.

The tactics differ, but the aim is the same: to silence lawyers who represent politically targeted clients, judges who issue rulings that contradict the repressive government’s political – and often personal — aims, and prosecutors who pursue cases against its favored allies. Whether through formal legislation or informal pressure, these measures aim to curtail legal advocacy, judicial independence, and the rule of law itself.

The United States has long prided itself on a tradition of public interest lawyering rooted in the civil rights movement and sustained through legal aid, legal clinics, and pro bono representation carried forward by lawyers. By framing access to justice as a professional duty, organizations such like the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) or the NAACP Legal Defense Fund (LDF) institutionalized public interest advocacy. Yet, over time, these organizations have also been criticized for professionalizing and depoliticizing what began as grassroots social movements.

In recent decades, the legal profession in the West has continued to champion struggles for social justice by working alongside social movements, at home and abroad, to promote access to justice and defend fundamental rights, often supporting colleagues in contexts where the rule of law was under siege. Whether through government-funded programs like the American Bar Association’s former Justice Defenders program (where two of us, Jasmine and Natalie, used to work), or privately funded projects like the Amsterdam-based Lawyers for Lawyers, this support has taken a wide range of forms. They include trial monitoring, pro-bono assistance, training of lawyers and judges, support in drafting key legal frameworks such as constitutions, and sustained advocacy efforts. As Scott Cummings noted, lawyers have long sought to reconcile professional independence with commitments to democratic mobilization and public interest advocacy — roles that have become increasingly intertwined in polarized and fragile democracies.

Now, the U.S. legal profession is facing similar political retaliation, harassment, and institutional dismantling that it once sought to confront abroad, with a profound chilling effect at home. A comparative lens looking across multiple countries that have experienced similar – though always locally specific – conditions demonstrates that these attacks on the legal profession are not isolated incidents but part of a broader pattern of democratic erosion. The parallels between the United States and countries where legal repression has intensified, while distinct in their details and in each country’s experience, reveal a common strategy: weaken those who safeguard the law to weaken the rule of law itself. Legal communities in similar contexts have found that, by identifying early warning signs, they can better grasp the fragility of legal norms — even in long-established democracies — and the urgent need to defend them.

Public Interest Lawyering in Europe and Eurasia

Compared with the United States, public interest lawyering in Europe and Eurasia is generally more fragmented, and often constrained by historical, political, and institutional limitations. While many European countries uphold strong traditions of rule of law and fundamental rights, the infrastructure for systemic, independent public-interest lawyering, particularly in defense of the legal profession itself, remains uneven and, in some places, strikingly under-resourced.

In much of Eastern Europe and Eurasia, the space for independent legal mobilization remains narrow. In post-Soviet contexts such as Russia, Belarus, and Azerbaijan, legal aid organizations and bar associations are co-opted, tightly controlled, or outright dismantled. Lawyers who take on politically sensitive cases routinely face harassment, disbarment, and criminal prosecution. Public interest lawyering — where it exists — is often practiced informally, through fragile networks of human rights defenders and international NGOs.

Legal activism in these regions often takes the form of strategic (or impact) litigation, concentrating on pivotal cases to effect social change, rather than the more institutionalized public interest lawyering familiar to U.S. nonprofit organizations routinely pursuing broad policy goals through coordinated legal advocacy. Strategic litigation in Europe and Eurasia — particularly before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg — has become the dominant mode of legal activism, even for conservative NGOs, as many domestic systems are too weak, compromised, or underfunded to sustain systemic advocacy.

Even within the European Union there is no uniform model for public interest lawyering. In many Western European countries, legal aid systems primarily focus on access to justice but do not necessarily support strategic litigation or organized responses to political interference. Unlike in the United States — where large privately funded initiatives include Lawyers for Good Government, Lawyers Defending American Democracy, and the Society for the Rule of Law — Europe’s landscape remains more fragmented, often driven by individual lawyers, small NGOs, legal clinics in universities, or issue-specific transnational coalitions spearheaded in some member States.

As U.S. legal professionals confront mounting institutional threats at home, the experiences of their counterparts in Europe and Eurasia offer a critical lesson: legal resilience is not sustained solely by well-funded organizations or formal constitutional frameworks, because either can be quickly dismantled. Rather, resilience is forged through collective courage, strategic alliances, legal mobilization, and symbolic acts that galvanize public consciousness and professional solidarity despite the severity of suppression.

Across Europe and Eurasia, lawyers, prosecutors, and judges have found ways to push back against repression, whether through mass demonstrations, building transnational networks of support, or maintaining solidarity under severe restrictions. The following case studies from Poland, Hungary, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, Belarus, and Russia, illustrate both the escalating trend of state suppression and countervailing legal resilience and civic solidarity.

Poland

Poland provided one of the early examples of how quickly judicial independence can be eroded, and how collective solidarity can serve as a powerful tool of resilience. Poland’s struggle for judicial independence started in 2015, shortly after the right-wing populist Law and Justice party (PiS) took power. Over the next several years, until it was ousted in the 2023 parliamentary elections, that government enacted more than a dozen legislative measures aimed at restructuring the judiciary to give the government more control. These changes compromised the rule of law and separation of powers and created a climate of intimidation and fear not only among the members of the legal profession but also the larger public. Judges who defended the rule of law faced harassment ranging from biased disciplinary proceedings and professional retaliation to state-sponsored smear campaigns. Some judges were openly branded as political enemies.

One of the most striking demonstrations of resistance was the January 2020 Marsz Tysiąca Tóg (“March of a Thousand Robes”). In response to intensifying government interference in the judiciary and arbitrary disciplinary proceedings, thousands of judges marched in silence in their judicial robes through the city streets of Warsaw and all over Poland. Joined by legal professionals and citizens from more than 20 countries, the march sent a clear message: attacks on the judiciary in one country are a threat to judicial independence everywhere.

The 2023 elections brought a change in government to a liberal coalition that pledged to restore the rule of law. It presented an action plan containing proposed laws to reverse or mitigate the damage the previous government had done to institutions such as the prosecution services and bodies that selected judges. But the process has been challenging, painstaking, and complex, and has yet to be completed. For instance, a new president of the previous ruling party may exercise veto power over key pillars of the government’s reforms.

For Polish lawyers, judges, and advocates, the biggest lesson has been the importance of professional and civic solidarity. Judge Monika Frąckowiak, who was herself targeted for resisting PiS’s reforms, has often discussed how simple gestures of support — a message, a photo, a reminder that “you will never walk alone” — can weaken the chilling effect authoritarianism seeks to create. She also stresses the power of organized resistance. Poland’s Justice Defense Committee brought together judges, prosecutors, and defense lawyers to provide moral, legal, and public support to colleagues under fire.

Poland also offers a cautionary note: some lawyers, seeking influence or favor, sided with the ruling party and facilitated its authoritarian drift. “Lawyers are often the midwives of authoritarianism,” Frąckowiak warns. For those now confronting similar pressures in the United States, her advice is clear: document every abuse, be prepared legally and ethically, and build structures of professional and civic solidarity across national borders strong enough to withstand political retaliation.

Hungary

While Poland offers a hopeful example of democratic recovery, despite the current challenges of restoring the rule of law, fellow EU member Hungary shows how authoritarian control can become entrenched when early warning signs are ignored. Since Prime Minister Viktor Orbán returned to power in 2010, Hungary has experienced a systematic erosion of judicial independence. Through numerous constitutional amendments and legislative changes, Orbán centralized control over the judiciary, including lowering the mandatory retirement age for judges. These reforms allowed for the replacement of experienced jurists with government-aligned appointees, and restructuring the Constitutional Court to ensure a sympathetic majority. More recently, the government created a new administrative court system, placing cases involving fundamental rights under direct executive influence, thus further weakening the judiciary and dismantling separation of powers.

Beyond structural reforms, the government has targeted individual judges who spoke out. Judge Tamás Matusik, then-president of the National Judicial Council, became the subject of a government-sponsored smear campaign after holding a routine meeting with the U.S. ambassador. For weeks, pro-government outlets portrayed the encounter as evidence of foreign interference in Hungary’s judiciary, framing it as a threat to sovereignty.

Reflecting on these pressures in public sources and communications with one of us (Jasmine), Matusik stressed the importance of maintaining restraint and judicial integrity in that judges must not let external factors influence their decisions. He added that it is crucial for courts to operate with transparency and professional communication, and for judgments not to be influenced by political or ideological biases. Yet he also acknowledged the risks posed by populist rhetoric, such as when politicians label judges as “liberal” or “conservative,” creating additional pressure on judicial independence.

Matusik also noted that judges are particularly vulnerable in populist contexts because, unlike politicians, they cannot respond to attacks with press conferences or media campaigns. Populist leaders exploit these dynamic, making judges easy scapegoats.

Despite this chilling environment, resistance has not disappeared. As recently as February 2025, thousands of Hungarian judges and court staff protested outside the Ministry of Justice in Budapest, demanding judicial independence, freedom of expression for judges, and fair pay, after a covert agreement between the Minister of Justice and the National Office for the Judiciary linked salary increases to sweeping reforms without proper consultation with the judiciary.

The Hungarian legal community also continues to draw strength from international solidarity and transnational advocacy networks. Organizations such as the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary (ENCJ) and the International Association of Judges (IAJ) have amplified their concerns, ensuring that Hungary’s judicial reforms came under scrutiny from the European Commission.

The Hungarian experience carries a stark warning for the U.S. legal community and the public: once judicial independence is eroded, restoring it is far harder. For American judges, lawyers, and prosecutors now facing mounting political and institutional pressures, the Hungarian example underlines the urgent need for collective organization, legal mobilization and professional solidarity to safeguard the institutional integrity of the judiciary, before it is too late.

Kyrgyzstan and Georgia

Kyrgyzstan and Georgia illustrate an intermediate stage in the erosion of legal independence: the legal profession still functions, but the two governments increasingly suppress lawyers who take on politically sensitive cases.

In Kyrgyzstan, defense attorneys representing human rights defenders often become targets themselves as the government identifies them with their clients. Lawyers linked to foreign-funded NGOs or politically sensitive defendants now operate under constant surveillance and intimidation. One emblematic case is that of human rights lawyer Samat Matsakov, arrested on Nov. 29, 2024, and accused of large-scale fraud and document forgery — charges widely regarded as retaliation for representing activists linked to the investigative outlet Temirov Live and political dissidents. The arrest drew international condemnation, including warnings from the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the rights of human rights defenders and from legal bodies, both underscoring the broader assault on the right to defense.

Another legal professional, Klara Sooronkulova, a former Supreme Court judge and human rights defender who led an NGO called School of Law was herself prosecuted for advocacy on judicial reform and free speech. Her experience stands as a warning: legal reformers are routinely reclassified as threats.

Similarly, in Georgia, legal professionals are being swept up in the broader crackdown on civil society and democratic freedoms. Since late 2024, mass protests erupted after the government suspended EU membership talks. Lawyers and judges defending demonstrators or participating in movements have been increasingly targeted. For instance, Giorgi Davituri, a lawyer with the Institute for Development of Freedom of Information, was detained, physically assaulted, and subsequently fined in what observers called a blatantly unfair trial.

The lesson is clear: harassment of legal professionals is not merely external pressure from those outside the justice system (e.g., political actors, media, public opinion), but can quickly become systemic once the law itself is weaponized as a political instrument. As a result, solidarity, resilience, ethics, and integrity are no longer luxuries — they are survival strategies, helping lawyers preserve independence, credibility, and the very ability to continue practicing their profession.

Russia

If Kyrgyzstan and Georgia show increasing pressure on the legal profession, Russia exemplifies the next, darker stage, in which the law itself becomes a weapon, with defense lawyers being prosecuted alongside their clients. Professional independence has been almost entirely eliminated.

Russian authorities have long systematically harassed, intimidated, and prosecuted lawyers who defend opposition figures, journalists, and others perceived as a threat to the government. One of the most famous cases was that of Sergei Magnitsky, a tax lawyer for British-American investor Bill Browder who exposed government corruption and was then targeted for prosecution and died in prison in 2009. The U.S. and global Magnitsky anti-corruption and human rights sanctions laws were enacted in his name.

Since Russia’s 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine, repression in Russia has only intensified. In 2023 alone, human rights monitors documented more than 150 cases of harassment against lawyers, including detentions, disbarments, and fabricated charges. Government actions have effectively folded all independent lawyers into a single state-controlled bar, eliminating the last vestiges of professional autonomy.

As in the Magnitsky case, the repression is personal as well as structural. In 2023, three lawyers who represented opposition leader Alexei Navalny were sentenced to prison terms of three and a half to five years on fabricated charges of “extremism,” a label the government routinely applies to political opposition figures and their supporters. Another prominent attorney, Vadim Prokhorov, longtime defender of opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza, was forced into exile after facing threats of prosecution.

Prokhorov draws lessons, during our communication, from Russia’s previous eras of repression. He recalls the Stalinist gulag-era maxim: “Don’t be afraid. Don’t trust. Don’t beg.” From the Tatar-Mongol era, he notes how tax collectors gauged peasants’ reactions to assess what more could be taken from them. Those who pleaded or despaired lost everything; those who laughed were left alone. For lawyers, he suggests, resilience — and even defiant humor — can be a form of survival. Prokhorov’s advice is pragmatic and sobering: in repressive systems, trust no official assurances, not even from courts or prosecutors. Instead, resilience depends on self-reliance and solidarity with fellow lawyers.

Belarus

Belarus represents the endpoint of this trajectory: the near-eradication of an independent legal profession. Here, the system no longer merely pressures, harasses, or prosecutes lawyers; it extinguishes them.

Since the disputed 2010 presidential election, Belarusian lawyers, especially those representing opposition figures, journalists, or protesters, have faced waves of disbarments, prosecutions, and systemic harassment. After strongman Alexander Lukashenko rigged the 2020 election and brutally suppressed the resulting mass protests, the crackdown intensified: more than 5,500 people have been convicted in unfair trials, and at least 141 lawyers have been disbarred, 23 arbitrarily detained, and 11 convicted, six of whom remain imprisoned.

The impact on the legal profession has been devastating. The pool of practicing lawyers shrank from approximately 2,200 in early 2020 to just over 1,600 by the end of 2023, depriving citizens of independent legal aid even in non-political cases. National and regional bar associations, controlled by the Ministry of Justice, have fast-tracked disciplinary hearings to strip lawyers of their licenses under pretexts ranging from “lack of qualification” to spurious ethics violations.

Natalia Matskevich, a distinguished lawyer who defended political opposition figures and Nobel laureates, was disbarred and forced into exile. From this hardship, she offers a lesson, in a conversation with one of us (Jasmine), with profound relevance for the United States:

“Democracy and the rule of law are not a gift—they require constant effort. Lawyers serve as intermediaries between society and justice. When the regime makes lawlessness the norm, society still looks to lawyers as the last bastion of truth… Every lawyer must choose: either submit for personal safety or uphold your ideals despite the risks. My advice: do not give up, build communities, and never lose faith in the rule of law.”

Conclusion and Recommendations

The varied experiences of legal professionals across Europe and Eurasia — from Poland’s resistance and Hungary’s capture to the mounting pressures in Kyrgyzstan and Georgia, to Russia’s weaponization of law, and Belarus’ near-eradication of the independent legal profession — carry a clear warning: unchecked interference with the independent legal profession escalates quickly into systemic repression.

The lesson for U.S. lawyers is urgent and humbling: as they have already seen, no democracy is immune. Solidarity, resilience, and strategic resistance are essential to safeguard institutions before they reach a breaking point. American lawyers, judges, and prosecutors, whether acting as individuals or in firms, agencies, or other organizations, should:

Uphold the rule of law not only in the courtroom but also in broader public life, safeguarding democratic principles and constitutional rights — for example, by documenting abuses, engaging policymakers, and supporting those targeted for exercising their constitutional rights.

Refuse to remain silent in the face of injustice and have the courage to stand up to any regime or authority that seeks to undermine judicial independence or dismantle the foundations of the rule of law.

Build strong networks and coalitions across professions and borders to provide mutual support, to learn comparatively from each other, and coordinate strategic resistance against authoritarian pressures.

Promote solidarity and ethical commitments with legal professionals facing repression, both at home and abroad, by amplifying their voices, defending their integrity, and advocating for their protection.

Engage the public and educate society about the importance of an independent judiciary and dangers of its politicization, thereby reinforcing public trust in democratic institutions.

Document and expose abuses through legal channels, media, and international forums to ensure accountability and maintain historical truth.

In honoring these commitments, U.S. legal professionals not only defend their democratic institutions, but also bring this struggle to the broader public, while standing in solidarity with colleagues worldwide who continue to strive for justice, accountability, and the rule of law.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Poland-2020-judges-march-small.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 01:56:19.486853

“If we don’t fight back for fairness and equal treatment for all, it will only get worse.” In 2025, the Common School Fund distributed $70 million to school libraries across the state.
“The decision to specifically use the Common School Fund was made by Republican lawmakers alone,” Cudaback said.
“The Common School Fund remains healthy with over $1.4 billion of assets and tens of millions of dollars going into the school fund each year.” The Board of Commissioners of Public Lands manages four funds: the Common School Fund, Normal School Fund, University Fund and Agricultural College Fund.
“The Common School fund has grown over the years to $1.5 billion,” German said.","A provision in the 2025-27 Wisconsin budget allowing Milwaukee County to divert $4.4 million from school libraries to fund district attorney positions is being challenged in court.

The Common School Fund was established in the Wisconsin Constitution in 1848. The fund is maintained by money generated by counties through traffic fines and forfeitures.

But a provision in the biennial budget exempted Milwaukee County, instead allowing the county to use that money — $2.2 million per year — to help pay for 12 prosecutors.

The Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, or WILL, filed a lawsuit last week in Waukesha County Court, calling the move a “flagrant and unconstitutional money grab by Milwaukee County.”

The suit says if the provision stands, the next budget could include more carveouts from the Common School Fund.

Milwaukee County Treasurer David Cullen, who is named in the suit, and other county officials did not respond to requests for comment.

WILL is representing Waukesha County resident Christine Stueland, a former Menomonee Falls School District board member who is referred to as a “library user and taxpayer.”

The suit argues Stueland is directly harmed because her library will have fewer resources. And it contends the state Legislature overstepped its constitutional authority by granting a unique carveout to a single county.

“It’s frustrating to watch politicians in Madison give Milwaukee special treatment while others are shortchanged,” Stueland said in a statement. “If we don’t fight back for fairness and equal treatment for all, it will only get worse.”

In 2025, the Common School Fund distributed $70 million to school libraries across the state. The biennial budget increased school library aid by $36 million over the biennium.

The Common School Fund is managed by the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, or BCPL.

The group has been uneasy about the budget provision since it was passed and has also considered taking action, said Tom German, executive secretary.

German and the BCPL board believe the provision violates a 1973 Wisconsin Supreme Court decision regarding the fund and the Legislature’s authority.

The Legislature’s budget committee added the provision during the last executive session of this budget cycle under a “miscellaneous items” section of the motion as part of a budget deal with Gov. Tony Evers.

On Sept. 2, the BCPL board passed a resolution “expressing its serious concerns” with the budget change.

“BCPL recognizes Milwaukee County’s need for funding the District Attorney’s office, but not at the expense of a constitutionally created and protected trust fund that benefits public education,” the resolution states. “BCPL and the other parties seek a legislative solution that addresses the above concerns prior to commencement of litigation.”

Board member and Attorney General Josh Kaul abstained from voting to avoid a potential conflict of interest.

Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said providing additional assistant district attorney positions for Milwaukee County was part of the negotiations with Republican leaders during the budget process, but the mechanism for funding them were not.

“The decision to specifically use the Common School Fund was made by Republican lawmakers alone,” Cudaback said.

In a statement to WPR, Joint Finance Committee Co-Chair Rep. Mark Born, R-Beaver Dam, said Milwaukee has serious public safety challenges and the justice system is stretched thin.

“This isn’t an abstract issue—citizens are afraid, violent crime is rising, and the impact reaches far beyond city limits to the entire state,” Born wrote. “The Common School Fund remains healthy with over $1.4 billion of assets and tens of millions of dollars going into the school fund each year.”

The Board of Commissioners of Public Lands manages four funds: the Common School Fund, Normal School Fund, University Fund and Agricultural College Fund.

German said the funds become less consequential if their financial support does not continue to grow.

“The Common School fund has grown over the years to $1.5 billion,” German said. “But the University Fund and the ag college fund did not have a mechanism for growing, and so those funds are roughly the same size as they were 150 years ago. At one time, the University Fund could pay for about half the cost of running the entire system. Now it couldn’t pay for the cost of a (teacher’s assistant).”",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2025/02/Scales-Depositphotos_6077491_XL-w.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 23:57:11.809415

After weeks without action, the Supreme Court ordered legal briefs in late September on whether or not the judicial panels are required in these cases.
In an interview with WPR, Law Forward attorney Doug Poland said the judicial panel law is a “venue statute” and has clear directions for the Supreme Court.
Both lawsuits filed by Elias Law Group and Law Forward claim Wisconsin’s congressional districts are gerrymandered, but they take different legal approaches to get there.","Attorneys from liberal firms are urging the Wisconsin Supreme Court to quickly appoint a three-judge panel to hear lawsuits claiming the state’s congressional districts are gerrymandered and should be redrawn before the 2026 election.

Meanwhile, lawyers for the GOP-controlled Legislature and the state’s Republican U.S. House members say the court’s newest liberal justices should recuse themselves and the cases should be dismissed.

The cases were filed against the backdrop of a state-by-state redistricting battle aimed at swaying the balance of political power in Congress. In Wisconsin, which is known for its 50-50 elections, Republicans hold a 6-2 edge in the state’s U.S. House delegation. The two redistricting lawsuits from the Elias Law Group and Law Forward are somewhat unique because they rely on a 2011 law written by Wisconsin Republicans. That law, which is untested, instructs the Supreme Court to form a panel of three judges to hear redistricting cases.

After weeks without action, the Supreme Court ordered legal briefs in late September on whether or not the judicial panels are required in these cases. Elias and Law Forward both argue the statute is clear and the court has a duty to appoint circuit court judges from around the state to hear the lawsuits.

In an interview with WPR, Law Forward attorney Doug Poland said the judicial panel law is a “venue statute” and has clear directions for the Supreme Court.

“Our point here is that this is a purely ministerial or administrative task for the court,” Poland said. “This isn’t a statute that gives the court any kind of jurisdiction or supervisory authority over the case. It’s just, the court is just supposed to do something that’s purely administrative or ministerial in nature.”

Attorneys representing the Legislature, GOP House members and the conservative Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, or WILL, argue the statute was meant for lawsuits challenging maps drawn by the Wisconsin Legislature. Attorney Luke Berg of WILL told WPR the current congressional districts were adopted by the Supreme Court’s former conservative majority during another redistricting lawsuit three years ago, so the 2011 law doesn’t apply.

He said regardless, the lawsuits should be dismissed because the liberal firms waited years to file their lawsuits and the Supreme Court’s current liberal majority rejected another Elias challenge earlier this year.

“Whether this requires a three-judge panel or not, it’s so procedurally improper and so meritless that you should just dismiss it now and save everyone the time,” Berg said. “We’ll see if the court does that or not.”

Along with their briefs urging justices to dismiss both congressional map challenges, attorneys representing the state’s six Republican House members are urging liberal Justices Janet Protasiewicz and Susan Crawford to recuse themselves and not rule on the venue question.

The GOP congressmen argue Crawford shouldn’t participate because she was part of a call with Democratic donors during her 2025 Supreme Court campaign that was billed by liberal group Focus for Democracy as a “chance to put two more House seats in play for 2026.”

“Here, Wisconsin law requires Justice Crawford’s recusal because of Focus For Democracy’s donor advisors briefing, the Democratic Party’s overwhelming campaign contributions, and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee’s support,” said the brief from GOP congressmen.

The congressman also demanded Protasiewicz step aside from any decisions in the cases, reiterating past GOP complaints about comments she made about GOP maps during her Supreme Court campaign in 2022. They noted Protasiewicz declined to participate in the court’s March 2024 decision to reject yet another attempt by Elias to overturn the state’s congressional map. However, Protasiewicz did not recuse herself in a state legislative redistricting lawsuit decided in 2023.

Both lawsuits filed by Elias Law Group and Law Forward claim Wisconsin’s congressional districts are gerrymandered, but they take different legal approaches to get there.

Elias is using the more traditional partisan gerrymander argument, claiming Republicans initially drew the House districts in 2011 to keep their party in control of a majority of the seats. The Law Forward case takes a more novel approach and argues the congressional map is what the firm calls an anti-competitive gerrymander, meaning voters in a Democratic leaning district can’t elect a Republican and vice versa.

Currently, the GOP holds six of the Wisconsin eight House seats. Democrats have tried repeatedly to get the congressional map overturned ahead of the 2026 midterm election.",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2014/07/gavel10.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 00:57:15.039111

The Colorado chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and two Colorado law firms filed a lawsuit against Trump administration officials on Oct. 9, seeking to restrict Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials’ authority to detain people without judicial warrants.

The lawsuit, brought on behalf of four people who were allegedly arbitrarily detained earlier this year, claims ICE agents are arresting individuals without determining probable cause and flight risk, requirements they must evaluate case by case for each person detained.

Instead, the legal groups argue, their clients were apprehended based on their “skin color, accent or perceived nationality” to meet quotas they argue have been unlawfully set by Trump administration officials.

The lawsuit also requests a class certification for “people who have been or will be subject to ICE’s warrantless arrests,” allowing the plaintiffs to serve as representatives in a class-action lawsuit and potentially extending any ruling to others similarly affected by the agency’s practices.

Supreme Court to hear arguments on Louisiana redistricting case

On Oct. 15, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill will ask the Supreme Court to bar states from considering race when drawing congressional districts. She’s arguing that the Voting Rights Act (VRA) provision that sometimes compels race-conscious redistricting has become obsolete.

In 2022, a federal court ordered Louisiana to redraw its congressional districts based on that provision after a group of voters sued, claiming the state had unconstitutionally diluted the power of Black voters. The new map created two Black-majority districts instead of one. That map is now being challenged by non-Black plaintiffs.

The case, Louisiana v. Callais, is the latest in a long list of lawsuits challenging how states draw congressional districts. These cases focus on the difficult balance between avoiding racial discrimination and complying with federal laws like the Voting Rights Act (VRA), which sometimes requires considering race to protect the voting rights of marginalized groups.

Because Republicans hold a slim majority in the House, how the case is decided — and thus, how the district maps are ultimately drawn — could have significant consequences in the upcoming midterm elections.

Peruvian Congress ousts President Boluarte amid crime increase

On Oct. 10, Peru’s Congress voted to remove President Dina Boluarte from office, citing her government’s inability to combat rising crime and “permanent moral incapacity.” Congress leader Jose Jeri, now the country’s seventh leader in less than a decade, was sworn in as interim president.

Then-Vice President Boluarte succeeded former President Pedro Castillo after he was imprisoned in December 2022, when he attempted to dissolve the legislature to prevent his own impeachment.

Several scandals and a surge in crime, including a shooting at a concert in Lima on Oct. 9, ultimately led to what was the ninth attempt to impeach Boluarte, this time supported by nearly all of Peru’s legislative factions.

Boluarte was one of the world’s most unpopular leaders, with an approval rating of 2 to 4 percent. In the first three months of her presidency, there were more than 500 protests calling for her resignation.

Hostages and prisoners freed as part of Hamas-Israel ceasefire agreement

On Oct. 13, Hamas released 20 Israeli hostages in exchange for 2,000 Palestinian prisoners as a key first step in the ceasefire both sides agreed to last week. Meanwhile, President Trump traveled to Egypt to attend a summit on the future of Gaza and the broader Middle East with leaders from more than 20 countries.

In the West Bank, crowds gathered in Ramallah to celebrate the return of 88 Palestinians released from Israeli prisons, where they had been serving life sentences. Meanwhile, Gazans in Khan Younis welcomed 1,700 Palestinians detained without charge since Oct. 7, 2023. About 160 Palestinians were deported through Egypt following their release.

In Tel Aviv, 65,000 Israelis assembled to welcome the 20 remaining Israeli hostages, who spent 737 days in captivity in Gaza. They were reunited with their families at a military base before undergoing medical evaluations.

Meanwhile, world leaders in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, began a peace summit “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security and stability,” according to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

Former Trump White House chief strategist and influential far-right commentator Steve Bannon reportedly compared Congress’s role in the second Trump administration to that of the Russian Duma under dictator Vladmir Putin.

In an expansive report for The Wall Street Journal, Josh Dawsey reported that President Donald Trump’s recent actions — including his Department of Justice’s prosecution of New York Attorney General Letitia James and former FBI Director James Comey — “reflect a buoyed commander in chief who feels emboldened to go further after feeling as though he has faced surprisingly little resistance to his ambitious agenda in the first nine months.”

From Dawsey’s story:

Inside the White House, top advisers joke that they are ruling Congress with an “iron fist,” according to people who have heard the comments. Steve Bannon, the influential Trump ally, likened Congress to the Duma, the Russian assembly that is largely ceremonial. When senior White House aide Stephen Miller recently held a party at the exclusive Ned’s Club to celebrate his 40th birthday, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) showed up to honor Miller, the people said.

Bannon, who worked in the first Trump administration, attributed some of the faded resistance to Trump’s comeback after four years “in the wilderness,” a period that he said hardened Trump. “He’s doing things now he wouldn’t have ever considered the first time,” Bannon said. “He’s jackhammering away on levels you haven’t seen before.”

For his part, the president observed this summer that “Everyone’s on my side now,” has “expressed amazement” at the speed with which law firms have been cowed by his administration’s threats and private firms have set aside funds for his pet projects, including a White House ballroom.

Former GOP operative and NBC commentator Brendan Buck told the Journal that Congress’s surrender to him over already-appropriated funds “tells you a lot about what people think their likelihood is of being successful in fighting back.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KohLjYH82UrwEn1JTFtu5w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mediaite_845/357cf0f195c1761115ca7c680497cc4f,N,,2025-10-13 23:56:44.511922

Jessie Fuentes (26th Ward) is preparing to file a lawsuit against the ICE agent who handcuffed and threatened to arrest her at Humboldt Park Health earlier this month.

In an interview with Windy City Times, Fuentes said she has been consulting with lawyers about taking legal action and could file a lawsuit as soon as this week.

The lawsuit would stem from an Oct. 3 incident inside the hospital’s emergency room, where Fuentes was responding to support a man injured during an encounter with federal immigration agents.

“I’ve been doing fine since then, and my major focus has been making sure that we can get the support that’s needed for the individual who’s in the hospital,” Fuentes said.

A video shared by Fuentes’ office shows an agent suddenly grabbing Fuentes, turning her around and handcuffing her after she questioned whether the agents had a warrant for the man’s arrest. The incident prompted citywide outrage and a formal condemnation from most members of the City Council.

For several days, ICE agents forbade the man from speaking with an attorney or making phone calls, Fuentes said. He underwent reconstructive leg surgery and may need another.

ICE agents detained the man and several others at a work site, Fuentes said. He had temporary protected status and had filed for a renewal. He also has no criminal record.

“And so he’s the one that’s vulnerable right now,” Fuentes said. “He’s the one that needs support.”

Fuentes added that the same ICE agent who handcuffed her has been filmed in at least three other violent encounters, including one at a Walmart, the viral arrest in Waukegan where the mayor was present, and another incident involving a woman.

“It seems that he’s a bit unhinged,” Fuentes said. “He’s obviously a danger to individuals and particularly women.”

Fuentes said the violence she experienced is part of a broader campaign of control and intimidation.

“What’s happening in the city of Chicago is not about safety,” Fuentes said. “It’s about a white supremacist project—about eradicating people,” Fuentes said. “As a queer, masculine-presenting Latina, I pose a great threat.”

She compared recent federal actions to “Gestapo-like tactics” and said they reflect the authoritarian playbook of President Donald Trump and Project 2025, a federal blueprint for a radical restructuring of the executive branch.

Project 2025 was written by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that opposes abortion and reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, immigrants’ rights and diversity and equity initiatives. Although Trump attempted to distance himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail, policy analysts note that his administration has already implemented 48% of the policy agenda.

“I’ve been saying this is not very different from Nazi Germany in the 1930s, and this level of fascism is what Trump seeks to achieve,” Fuentes said. “We have to understand that this is not about fighting ICE agents that are quote, unquote, carrying ‘carrying out immigration enforcement.’ What we are fighting is fascism.”

Fuentes is among a coalition of alderpeople raising alarms that ICE’s recent actions in Chicago threaten not only immigrant communities, but democracy itself in the U.S.

Last week, 37 members of City Council—along with Mayor Brandon Johnson, City Clerk Anna Valencia and City Treasurer Melissa Conyears-Ervin—signed a letter condemning ICE’s conduct at Humboldt Park Health and other recent enforcement operations.

Thirteen alderpeople declined to sign on, including Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th), who is one of nine openly LGBTQ+ alderpeople in City Council. Lopez did not return a request for comment.

Fuentes said she hasn’t been in contact with any of the alderpeople who didn’t sign the letter, adding “this is not a moment to be silent.”

“What we are watching is an erosion of due process and an assault on peoples’ rights, and all elected officials should be enraged,” Fuentes said. “The fact that there are alders who see nothing wrong with this picture—even the incident with me being handcuffed at the hospital—it’s disappointing.”

A related lawsuit filed by the city government led a federal judge to temporarily block the deployment of National Guard troops to the city, a move that Trump’s administration claimed was necessary to “restore order.”

Fuentes praised the decision, calling it “the right side of history” and saying it gave her hope that “the courts can still stand up to authoritarian overreach.”

Fuentes said the same forces driving federal crackdowns on immigrants are also behind renewed attacks on LGBTQ+ rights across the country. Both are part of a broader effort to strip away civil protections and concentrate power in the hands of a few.

She drew a direct connection between the two fights, noting that many queer and transgender people are also immigrants or come from immigrant families.

“These struggles are not separate,” Fuentes said. “When immigrant rights are attacked, so are queer rights.”

Fuentes said these overlapping fights demand a unified response that brings together immigrant, queer and trans communities to defend one another against rising hostility and state violence.

“This is not a moment for us to stay silent and on the sidelines,” Fuentes said. “We have a city to protect.”",https://windycitytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ald.-Jessie-Fuentes-speaks-at-an-April-7-2025-City-Council-meeting.-Photo-by-Jake-Wittich-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-14 01:56:23.260258

When Protecting Children Makes Us All Safer Some may look at the evidence of harm to children and think it does not impact them.
Who is protected and who benefits by our government engaging in traumatizing children and subjecting them to fear and despair?","Masked men with guns drawn came in the middle of the night, rappelling from helicopters. Flashbangs cracked down the apartment building’s corridors where families were sleeping. Federal agents were screaming and forcibly knocking down doors on an entire apartment complex in South Chicago. Children – still in pajamas, some “buck naked” – were pulled from their beds, separated from parents, zip‑tied, and detained in the middle of the night.

The disregard that these children were subjected to was expressed by a masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer when a resident asked him about their lack of humanity. His response was simply:

F- them kids!

Some have claimed the reports were exaggerated. But DHS embraced it. As writer Greg Olear observed:

Not only did it really happen, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, didn’t even have the common decency to deny it. On the contrary, DHS produced a slick video clip bragging about it, making it seem cinematic, heroic, cool—like a video game come to life.

Here is that video:

In broad daylight, families with children are followed by masked men to school drop-off and pick-up lines. In those lines in front of schools, parents have had their car windows smashed by men in tactical gear who have targeted them based solely on appearance.

The violence is so sudden and severe that glass flies and nearby children and parents scream and run away in fear.

And as if school shootings and active shooter drills were not causing enough trauma, children now face a new threat: tear gas launched by our own government near schools.

In some communities, parents have started forming watch patrols around schools – stationing themselves near entrances and walking perimeter routes to try and protect children from what they now see as an invading federal force of armed and masked “kidnappers.”

Meanwhile, child care centers have a unique set of worries. Although they also worry about drop-off and pick-up lines, their child care providers are being forced into the shadows, as they are often immigrants themselves.

At a press conference in July, DHS Secretary Noem said the goal was to “make America safe again” and proclaimed that DHS was going after the “worst of the worst.”

But what we are seeking far exceeds those claims. DHS’s actions are just targeting criminal removals. These are raids with helicopters, flashbangs, and armed agents storming entire apartment buildings or officers smashing windows in elementary school or child care drop-off lines.

These sorts of activities by our own government in U.S. citizens is something we have never seen.

And who benefits from this cruelty?

How, for example, does Noem justify the jailing and trauma being imposed on the woman and her 4-year-old son, who is literally praying and begging for armed government officers to leave his family alone, in this video? Is that 4-year-old and his mother living in Peekskill, New York, the “worst of the worst” who need detainment and incarceration?

I provided links to these articles and videos to demonstrate that these stories of attacks on children, their parents, and caregivers cited above are not aberrations.

They are an increasing reality of fear and trauma being caused by an Administration that has moved from border enforcement and a proclaimed focus on “criminal aliens” to an interior siege and the weaponizing of government, including state National Guard units, against American communities and innocent children.

Protecting Children’s Basic Human Rights

While lawsuits have been filed and some courts have ruled that DHS’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency has overstepped its authority by threatening people’s basic constitutional and human rights, the Supreme Court has failed to protect people from this abuse.

In a shadow document opinion, Noem v. Perdomo, the Supreme Court ruled that ICE could continue its current operations, including its racial profiling of people. Although a formal opinion was not issued, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a “concurring opinion” that the government’s actions were fine:

The Government sometimes makes brief investigative stops to check the immigration status of those who gather in locations where people are hired for day jobs; who work or appear to work in jobs such as construction, landscaping, agriculture, or car washes that often do not require paperwork and are therefore attractive illegal immigrants; and who do not speak much if any English. If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go. If the individual is illegally in the United States, the officers may arrest the individual and initiative the process for removal.

Do any of these videos reflect Justice Kavanaugh’s words? And what about ICE’s terrifying and trauma-inducing interactions with children?

In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote:

We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job. Rather than stand idly by while our constitutional freedoms are lost, I dissent.

Sotomayor adds that families with children are being negatively impacted in many ways, including:

Many are “struggl[ing] to make ends meet” because they are “afraid to go to work.” Others are “reluctant to attend school meetings” and “pick their children up from school” for fear of being detained.

Kids do not carry paperwork related to citizenship, such as passports, Social Security cards, birth certificates, immigration paperwork, or real ID cards. It is nonsensical to expect them to prove their citizenship.

Furthermore, children often have a different citizenship status than their parents, so even if ICE ascertains the parent(s)’ or caregiver’s status, that should never justify the detention, incarceration, and deportation of children, including some who are U.S. citizens.

Children must rely on adults to provide for and to protect them from harm. These adults – both parents and the government itself – should serve the best interests of children. Nobody can reasonably argue that the detention and incarceration of children in these cases is in their best interest, especially when government agents are inflicting terror and trauma on kids with taxpayer funding.

When Children Are Placed in Custody

In many corners of the U.S., children are being held in Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody or under ICE oversight and remain detained well beyond traditional limits. In violation of long-standing court rulings and the Flores Settlement, children are languishing in detention settings.

Family separation is also back. The Trump Administration has resumed detaining parents apart from their children – and, in some cases, using that separation as leverage.

As Maria Sacchetti reports for the Washington Post:

In July, the Trump administration withdrew a Biden administration policy urging that parents be detained only in “limited circumstances.” As a result, immigrant advocates and lawyers say, ICE officers are arresting growing numbers of people with children to meet the president’s mass deportation goals and, in some cases, using the threat of separation to push them to abandon their immigration cases and leave the country.

When parents are deported, many children are falling into foster care. Torn from families, communities, and schools, they now face a new trauma: indefinite limbo in a system not built for them without any ties to family.

From U.S. Citizens to Children With Cancer: Deportations Without Mercy

Perhaps the most gut-wrenching of this Administration’s cruelty is the deportation of children who are either U.S. citizens or medically fragile – or both.

In a case earlier this year, three U.S.-born children – aged 2, 4, and 7 – were deported to Honduras with their non-citizen mother. The 4‑year‑old had advanced, stage-4 cancer. She was ripped from her treatment team, separated from her physician, and flown out before the courts opened.

In this and other cases, the Administration claims parent consent or “in absentia orders” – but internal memos and court challenges show the record is murky at best and deceitful at worst.

U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, appointed by President Trump, blocked a rushed deportation of dozens of Guatemalan children after finding the Administration’s argument for “family reunification” had, in his words, “crumbled like a house of cards.”

Judge Kelly wrote in his 43-page opinion:

There is no evidence before the Court that the parents of these children sought their return. To the contrary, the Guatemalan Attorney General reports that officials could not even track down parents for most of the children whom Defendants found eligible for their “reunification” plan. And none of those that were located had asked for their children to come back to Guatemala.

This is a reprieve, not a resolution – and the stakes remain the same: children’s lives, rights, and dignity remain on the line.

Broken Laws, Silent Standards, and Collapsing Ethics

These tactics are not just cruel: they violate U.S. law, international norms, and the moral fabric of child protection.

Advocates have also documented cases in which ICE agents conducted “wellness checks” on families – only to use those visits as a pretext for detention and deportation. What should be a tool for protection has become a vehicle for harm.

There is also a clear assault on due process. Children are being detained without lawyers. Parents are coerced into giving up claims. The right to a fair hearing is no longer guaranteed – but rationed. People who are working their way through the immigration process and showing up for court dates are being arrested inside the courthouse.

Ethically, we are in the midst of a paradigm collapse: the state treating children as pawns, coercion as strategy, suffering as policy, and enforcement masquerading as care. We are normalizing cruelty to children under this system.

Scars That Last: Trauma, Distrust, Broken Futures

When a child is wrenched from the safety of their home, their school, and their community and placed in a cold, unfamiliar detention facility, their world fractures.

These are not just temporary disruptions. Neuroscience shows that repeated stress disrupts the brain’s architecture, impairs emotional regulation, memory, and trust. It leaves a mark – often for life.

Many children arriving at U.S. custody already carry trauma from home and a journey that often involves violence, loss, and fear. To be re-traumatized by their host country, to which they were seeking shelter and protection, is a cruelty no child should endure.

Some children retreat inward. Others lash out. Many develop anxiety, behavioral disorders, PTSD, insomnia, and distrust of adults – even of caregivers. The damage seeps into every aspect of life: education, health, and identity.

We are building a lost generation: kids who may never fully recover from something done to them by a government.

When Protecting Children Makes Us All Safer

Some may look at the evidence of harm to children and think it does not impact them. But it does.

When federal law enforcement agencies – the FBI, ATF, National Guard, and other functions within DHS – are diverted from their core missions of anti-trafficking, counterterrorism, and child exploitation, every community becomes more vulnerable. Rather than stopping child traffickers and sex abusers, DHS is engaging in arresting and detaining the mom and 4-year-old in Peekskill, New York.

Meanwhile, in communities terrorized by raids, people stop reporting crimes. They stop cooperating. They stop trusting law enforcement.

That silence does not make anyone safer. It hides danger. It protects abusers. It silences victims.

When Government Fails Children, We All Lose

Immigrant parents bring their kids to this country to either provide them a better life or to protect them from grave harm in their country of origin.

Some argue that the children of immigrants are put in harm’s way by their parents. But even if you believe that, why should our government ever engage in the amplification of harm? Who is protected and who benefits by our government engaging in traumatizing children and subjecting them to fear and despair?

There is a moment in every healthy society when a child’s suffering becomes intolerable for the collective conscience. That moment should be now.

Today, children are being zip-tied, detained, ripped from treatment, deported, and coerced. They are silenced, invisibilized, and ignored. They pay for policies they had no hand in creating.

As Olear writes:

. . .little children were among those herded out of the apartments. Some of those children had their hands zip-tied, too – by grown men decked out in enough military gear to occupy Fallujah.

And when a woman – an American citizen, not in any way affiliated with a gang, guilty of nothing more than living in Chicago, a city Trump hates because Obama’s from there – called out the ICE agents on their egregious lack of humanity, she was given the dismissive three-word response:

F- them kids.

We must choose a different path: one where protecting children isn’t optional, where humanity and moral legitimacy includes empathy and heart. Podcaster Joe Rogan has thoughts on this.

We must act NOW and here are places to begin:

Congressional oversight : the government’s actions desperately need oversight. Committees must demand internal DHS memos, agent reports, and protocols that led to zip‑ties, night raids, and coerced deportations.

Restore legal counsel and due process: no child should face legal proceedings without legal counsel or fundamental rights.

Limit militarization: ban the use of National Guard, no‑knock tactics, or joint agency raids and use of force on children.

Reclaim “wellness”: child protection must be in the hands of social workers — not ICE. Let the professionals protect children and not interrogate them.

Support trauma-informed care: invest in mental health, education, and recovery systems in the best interests of children and not detention systems.

Mobilize narrative: we must center children’s voices and best interests.

What’s the law about?

Last year, 63% of voters cast their ballots in favor of Proposition 314, also known as the “Secure the Border Act.” The initiative was a priority for the GOP legislative majority, and it enshrined a bevy of new criminal penalties into state law, including making it a misdemeanor for a person to cross the Arizona-Mexico border anywhere other than an official port of entry. First-time offenders would face up to six months in jail. Other provisions make it a felony to submit false documents to apply for jobs or public benefits and enact harsh prison sentences for people convicted of knowingly selling fentanyl that causes someone else’s death.

The parts of the law allowing Arizona to take up federal immigration enforcement haven’t gone into effect because of a trigger provision that makes it dependent on a similar law in Texas being implemented first. That law, called SB4, remains frozen by a federal appellate court but litigation is ongoing.

What’s the lawsuit about?

In April, Living United for Change and the Arizona Center for Empowerment, sister organizations that advocate for progressive legislation and frequently oppose anti-immigrant proposals, filed a lawsuit against Prop. 314, urging the court to permanently block it from ever being enforced. The groups argued that the law violates the Revenue Source Rule, a provision in the state constitution that requires ballot initiatives to identify a dedicated funding source if they are likely to cost the state money.

During legislative debates, multiple law enforcement officials and critics of the Secure the Border Act warned lawmakers that it would cost money to arrest, jail and transport immigrants to the ports of entry once deportation orders were issued, but Republicans refused to set aside any funding for the initiative. The Arizona Department of Corrections, Rehabilitation and Reentry, which would be forced to take custody of people accused of illegally crossing the border if local law enforcement agencies don’t have the capacity to hold them, estimated a cost increase of up to $178 million. And a nonpartisan think tank projected Arizona could end up paying $325 million every year if the provisions involving the enforcement of federal immigration laws are ever implemented.

The progressive groups also claimed that the law should be nullified because a large part of it relies on Texas’ version becoming effective before it can be completely enforced. They argued that doing so violates a legal principle known as the “unlawful delegation of legislative power,” which prohibits giving anyone other than the state legislature power over Arizona laws.

Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, along with Senate President Warren Petersen and House Speaker Stephen Montenegro who both helped send the initiative to voters last year, filed motions opposing the lawsuit. The trio argued that the provision detailing Arizona’s potential future involvement with federal immigration laws is currently frozen and the harms outlined in the lawsuit are therefore nothing more than hypothetical.

What did the judge say?

In a 10-page ruling, Valenzuela concluded that problems posed by LUCHA and ACE aren’t timely and don’t merit judicial review because the Texas law is still frozen by a federal appellate court’s order, making Arizona’s version a nonissue for now. The courts, he said, can’t issue opinions on what might happen.

“(Arizona’s) provisions never become enforceable if that injunction is upheld,” Valenzuela wrote. “They are dormant. Ultimately, declaratory relief must be based on the facts as they exist and not what may occur in the future.”

The act only allows the unauthorized immigration provisions in Arizona’s law to be enforced 60 days after its Texas counterpart, or another similar law in another state, has been implemented. The rest of its new criminal penalties, and a requirement that state and local agencies use the Systemic Alien Verification for Entitlements federal database to determine a person’s eligibility for public benefits are active now. The Latino advocacy groups’ argument that the act falls afoul of the state constitution hinges on the costs baked into the SAVE system. The database has a $25 monthly fee and an additional $2.25 fee per individual verification.

But Valenzuela wasn’t convinced that the fees in the SAVE program constitute a violation of Arizona’s Revenue Source Rule. He noted that only federal agencies are currently required to pay those fees; in April the Trump administration eliminated all transaction charges for state, tribal and local agencies in a bid to encourage the program’s use.

Valenzuela also rejected the claim that making the Arizona law dependent on its Texas mirror makes it unlawful. The courts, he wrote, have long recognized that lawmakers have the authority to imbue their laws with contingency plans and that’s what the trigger in the Secure the Border Act is. It doesn’t mean that Texas politicians have been given the power to write Arizona’s laws.

“The Act sets forth provisions that apply within Arizona and the subjects that it seeks to control by legislation,” Valenzuela wrote. “The Act leaves no incomplete provisions that require further defining by another other entity.”

What’s next?

The progressive groups have 30 days to file an appeal, and their attorney Jim Barton told the Arizona Mirror he expects to do so. Valenzuela’s conclusions that the 2024 law doesn’t violate the state’s Revenue Source Rule because of its trigger clause and the elimination of local costs in the SAVE system are wrong, Barton said.

“There was a law passed. That law is in effect. And that law requires expenditures,” he said.

Just because the current administration has waived the fees in the SAVE program for now doesn’t negate that the 2024 law mandates expenditures, Barton said. He pointed out that the waiver might very well be temporary and said the actions of a “particular regime” shouldn’t sway the court’s review of the law. In the end, he said, it violates the Arizona Constitution’s revenue source requirement.

“The fact that we have a temporary expenditure waiver doesn’t change the fact that it does mandate expenditures,” he said.",https://azmirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/arizona-ice-act-protest-signs.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 20:57:54.650382

Las Vegas police serve civil immigration warrants upon people in their custody, who otherwise would be ready to be released, and then hold them for up to 48 hours so they can be transferred to ICE.
As of Sept. 1, the police department had received a total of 957 requests from ICE this year, the ACLU said.
Moreover, the ACLU argues, holding someone in custody despite their release on criminal charges constitutes an arrest under Nevada law.","(CN) — The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday asked a Nevada court to put an end to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s collaboration with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s crackdown on immigrants who are in the U.S. without proper authorization.

The ACLU of Nevada filed a writ petition on behalf of Sergio Morais-Hechavarria, who’s been detained for months at the Clark County Detention Center pursuant to an “ICE hold” even though a judge ordered him to inpatient treatment as part of a misdemeanor conviction.

Attorneys with the ACLU argue that Nevada law doesn’t give local law enforcement the authority to enter into agreements with the federal government to enforce civil immigration law.

While many liberal-leaning states don’t allow such agreements, ICE has entered into so-called 287(g) agreements with state and local police forces across the country under which ICE trains and certifies local officers to serve and execute arrest and removal warrants on people in custody.

“While ICE officials seemingly believe they can use local police to further destabilize communities, we don’t subscribe to their theory,"" ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said in a statement.

A representative of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said the department doesn’t comment on pending litigation.

Las Vegas police serve civil immigration warrants upon people in their custody, who otherwise would be ready to be released, and then hold them for up to 48 hours so they can be transferred to ICE. As of Sept. 1, the police department had received a total of 957 requests from ICE this year, the ACLU said.

An ICE warrant, or “ICE hold,” means a detainee can’t be released even if they post bond or are ordered to home incarceration as part of pre-trial monitoring on their state criminal charges.

In the case of Morais-Hechavarria, the ICE warrant prevents his release from the Clark County Detention Center, notwithstanding the judge’s order that he’d be directly transferred to an inpatient treatment facility. At the same time, according to the ACLU petition, the judge’s order has prevented him from being handed over to ICE, purportedly due to the police department’s belief that the order indicates his criminal case is still active.

As a result, Morais-Hechavarria has been stuck in detention since the Aug. 19 court order.

“A person shouldn’t rot in a detention facility when ordered into treatment because the federal government has pressured local governments and local police into complicity with a disastrous, destabilizing, and destructive approach to immigration enforcement,” Haseebullah said.

The ACLU argues the Las Vegas police’s agreement with ICE violates the “Dillon Rule,” which holds that unless the power to do something has been expressly granted to the county by the state legislature through the adoption of a statute, they do not possess it.

The only authority local law enforcement in Nevada has to hold people on behalf of the federal government, according to the ACLU, is when they are prisoners — detained for criminal conduct, not for civil, immigration violations — and the federal government covers the cost of their incarceration.

Moreover, the ACLU argues, holding someone in custody despite their release on criminal charges constitutes an arrest under Nevada law. While there are a limited number of cases in which local law enforcement can make a civil arrest, in general, state law prohibits peace officers from making arrests in noncriminal matters, including civil immigration arrests, according to the ACLU in its petition.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/ice-arrest.jpeg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-10-13 20:58:00.247008

Joe Lombardo agreed to fully cooperate with federal immigration initiatives.
In 2019, then-Sheriff Lombardo suspended Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE after a federal court ruled that ICE detainers could be honored only in states that permitted arrests for civil immigration violations.","The American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada is challenging the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department’s agreement with the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement to assist the federal agency by holding individuals in custody beyond their release. Nevada’s cooperation with federal agents violates state law, is eroding the integrity of the judicial system, and is hurting tourism, the ACLU alleges.

“This isn’t intended to disparage LVMPD,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said Monday at a news conference announcing the legal action against Metro and Clark County Sheriff Kevin McMahill. He suggests Metro acquiesced to the federal government because of President Donald Trump’s “administration’s perpetual threats against municipalities, local governments and state governments.”

Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE, named for a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows police to issue civil immigration warrants and detain individuals up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release so that federal agents may take them into custody. The agreement violates Nevada law, according to the lawsuit, because it was not condoned by state lawmakers.

Nevada is a Dillon’s Rule state, Haseebullah noted, meaning “if the Nevada Legislature does not grant authority for the local agency to act, the agency cannot do that action.”

State law provides that county jails may house prisoners at the request of the federal government, “but only upon payment of ‘all actual and reasonably necessary costs’ of such confinement,” the suit says, adding even if the term ‘prisoner’ referred to someone with a civil immigration infraction, Metro’s agreement with ICE violates Dillon’s Rule, because it requires Metro to cover all associated costs.

The suit was filed on behalf of Sergio Morais-Hechavarria, who was found guilty of attempted possession of a stolen vehicle, a gross misdemeanor. He was sentenced by Judge Tara Newberry Clark to an inpatient treatment facility for substance abuse and mental health, and upon completion, to outpatient treatment. Instead, he is being held in the Clark County Detention Center.

“The unlawful hold, caused by ICE’s 287(g) agreement with LVMPD, has trapped him in indefinite detention, directly obstructing a lawful court order issued by a Nevada judge,” the ACLU said in a news release. The filing asks a court to lift the hold and order Metro to end its agreement.

The suit, Haseebullah said, is another ACLU has “had to file because of this administration’s desire to create as much instability as they can within our communities.”

He says he expects the case to land before the Nevada Supreme Court.

“We’d love to get the proper outcome at the District Court level, but I imagine this will go up,” he said at the news conference. “We need a substantive ruling to know whether or not Nevada municipalities or local law enforcement agencies have the ability to act without approval from the state that funds them in large part.”

McMahill, who long maintained Metro would not assist federal agents with immigration enforcement, entered into a 287(g) Memorandum of Agreement with ICE on June 16 of this year, according to the lawsuit, “after the federal government idiotically labeled Las Vegas a ‘sanctuary city’ without even defining ‘sanctuary city,’ and forced Nevada taxpayers to cover the cost of ICE’s work…” Haseebullah said. An exhibit attached to the suit reveals that as of Sept. 1, LVMPD received 957 requests for assistance from ICE this year.

“In Nevada, sheriffs and political subdivisions, such as LVMPD, have no existence or powers except by grant of Nevada’s Legislature,” says the ACLU’s pleading.

“I recognize the tough position that the sheriff’s been put in, that the Mayor of the city of Las Vegas has been put in when they signed an agreement,” Haseebullah noted. “We recognize the decisions made by this administration don’t come with any sort of intellectual honesty.”

The sanctuary designation, he noted, is a “legal misnomer” that is bereft of common definition.

Nevada was removed from the federal list of sanctuary designations last month after Gov. Joe Lombardo agreed to fully cooperate with federal immigration initiatives.

In 2019, then-Sheriff Lombardo suspended Metro’s 287(g) agreement with ICE after a federal court ruled that ICE detainers could be honored only in states that permitted arrests for civil immigration violations. Nevada was not among those states.

Lombardo, however, informally honored provisions of the agreement after he announced its suspension.

“Immigrants can’t be the scapegoat for all the things that go wrong in this country.","CHICAGO — Three decades after she came to the U.S., on Tuesday 53-year-old Maricela Rosales Castillo put her hair in a ponytail, grabbed her favorite blue sweater and backpack, and left her home in Berwyn, Illinois, to head to a market for groceries. She was planning to make albóndigas, a meatball stew, for her children that day.

She didn’t make it far.

Just steps away from her house, she was intercepted by a group of Border Patrol agents armed and wearing dark masks. These agents, whose primary mandate is to secure the national borders, are now patrolling Chicago suburbs.

It’s part of Operation Midway Blitz, a campaign the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched Sept. 8 saying it would target “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens” in the area.

But the government’s own data and detentions like that of Rosales — a mother of three who has no apparent criminal record — cast serious doubt on whether that’s really the mission.

On Oct. 3, DHS announced that since the operation began in September, more than 1,000 undocumented migrants had been arrested across Chicago and its suburbs — “including the worst of the worst pedophiles, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers.” However, the agency provided detailed information for only 10 men with a criminal background, about 1% of those detained, making independent verification difficult.

In one particularly jarring raid, on Sept. 30 federal agents with Black Hawk helicopters and military-type vehicles descended on an apartment complex in Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood. DHS said the location was “known to be frequented by Tren de Aragua members,” a Venezuelan criminal gang targeted by the Trump administration.

According to DHS, 37 people were arrested during the operation; however, only eight of them were confirmed to have a criminal record — and that includes crimes ranging from aggravated battery to retail theft. The agency did not say whether any of those cases resulted in convictions.

Just one “verified” Tren de Aragua member and one U.S. citizen with an active warrant were among the 37, DHS said, without saying how it had verified that gang affiliation. Others taken that day, the agency said, were “illegal aliens.”

In other words, while the administration says it is disrupting transnational gang activity, the bulk of those detained seem to have no serious record. In fact, federal data shows that over 70% of detainees who were being held as of last month by Immigration and Customs Enforcement nationally had no criminal convictions.

One of Rosales’ daughters, Samantha Rojas Rosales, only learned about her mother’s detention after watching a video obtained by MSNBC. “That’s her,” she said. “She always wears that blue sweater.”

In tears, Rojas said these immigration operations ostensibly aimed at gangsters are tearing families apart. Her mother came to the U.S. from Mexico in 1995, she said.

“She has worked hard. She has paid her taxes. She’s done everything possible to make sure she isn’t a problem here,” the 21-year-old daughter said. “And she has raised me here my entire life.”

Asked about the arrest, a Homeland Security official focused on what Rosales did 30 years ago: “Rosales Castillo admitted to being illegally present in the U.S. to Border Patrol officers which is a crime,” DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told MSNBC in an email.

Grabbed up while grabbing coffee

The same morning Rosales was arrested, just blocks away in Cicero — an area with the highest concentration of Latinos in the state — another immigration operation unfolded. Two mechanics, Mario Martínez Serrano and Daniel Cabrera García, were standing outside a bakery drinking coffee when unmarked vehicles and Border Patrol agents surrounded them.

Surveillance footage obtained by MSNBC shows Border Patrol agents chasing the men inside the bakery. Cabrera was violently thrown to the ground, three witnesses said. Both men were taken away in an unmarked vehicle.

Rosie Rodríguez, who has an insurance agency next door to the bakery and witnessed the arrests, told MSNBC that immigration agents are snatching away “good people.”

“They’re my clients. These are hardworking men. These are not criminals,” she said.

DHS disagrees.

Martínez is a “criminal illegal alien with an extensive criminal history, including arrests for battery, DUI, domestic abuse, possession of a controlled substance, and two prior removals from the U.S.,” McLaughlin told MSNBC.

Martínez’s wife, who did not want to be named for fear of immigration authorities, said he's lived in Illinois for 30 years. She acknowledged he’s “made mistakes in the past, but in the 10 years we have been together he had no issues with the law. He’s a good husband, a father to two teenage U.S. citizens, and a hard worker.”

Cabrera’s cousin, David González, described him as a family provider. “He’s a good man. He had dreams. He was about to open his own car shop. He didn’t do anything wrong. Now everyone around here feels like a target, even U.S. citizens like me,” he said.

Asked about Cabrera’s case, McLaughlin only said he was “an illegal alien from Mexico who attempted to evade arrest.”

The scene in Chicago

Over a five-day span in greater Chicago, MSNBC received dozens of reports from families and neighbors alleging that their loved ones had been taken by immigration officials, seemingly without any reason other than being undocumented.

On Wednesday — the day after the detentions in Cicero and Berwyn — two sisters were stopped and dragged out of their vehicle in front of a school in Chicago’s Little Italy neighborhood by at least 10 agents, some of them wearing face coverings. Video obtained and verified by MSNBC shows one of the women pinned to the ground as she pleaded for help.

“They don’t have a warrant. They forcefully opened the door of the truck. It was locked, it was locked,” the woman repeated. MSNBC confirmed both women were later released.

“When Donald Trump campaigned, he said he was going after criminals, rapists and drug dealers,” said Humberto Fuentes, a resident who said he witnessed the women being detained. “Now, they’re assaulting women, deporting children, mothers and fathers — not criminals. And if they’re criminals, he needs to prove it. We haven’t seen that evidence yet.”

That’s the main argument being made by legal observers and state and local officials, including Gov. JB Pritzker.

“It’s not going after the worst of the worst when you’re just literally stopping people who happen to be brown and asking them for papers,” Pritzker told MSNBC. “We don’t want people picked up off the streets just because they happen to be undocumented and have committed no crime.”

President Trump insists Chicago is in crisis, that undocumented migrants are driving crime and that Democratic leaders including Pritzker aren’t doing anything about it.

A number of studies have found that immigrants — including undocumented ones — are less likely to commit crimes than Americans born in the U.S., and challenged claims that unauthorized immigration increases violence.

In Chicago, which has received over 50,000 asylum-seekers since 2022, ""Violent crime is down,"" Mayor Brandon Johnson told the U.S. House Oversight Committee in March, adding that ""the city ended 2024 with its lowest homicide rate in five years.”

In the first six months of 2025, those numbers declined even further, with all major crime categories lower than during the same period in 2024.

“We are good people,” insisted Fuentes, who is from Mexico and has lived in Chicago for 22 years. “Immigrants can’t be the scapegoat for all the things that go wrong in this country. Sooner or later, someone will have to admit this is all for show.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251013-jacob-soboroff-chicago-zz-05-7c0ab6.jpg",N,,2025-10-13 18:56:53.803708

Maxwell Frost would like to set you straight.

Maxwell said recently that thousands of Black people, who like him are of Black and Latino descent, are experiencing fear as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and state and local law enforcement arrest people regardless of their legal immigration status.

“I see it very prevalent in my community here from Orlando, Florida, with our Haitian community that is being targeted, and also with Black Latinos that are being targeted,” Frost said during a panel discussion at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s legislative conference in Washington, D.C.

The discussion came on the day that Des Moines Public Schools superintendent Ian Roberts, who is Guyanese, was detained. School district officials said they had no information on why he was being held.

Frost questioned the need for ICE.

“The fact of the matter is that we have other federal law enforcement to help ensure that we have an orderly and humane immigration process at the federal level,” he said. “Creating a whole agency to literally go to our communities and now en masse and terrorize our people, I think is not needed.”

President Donald Trump has authorized National Guard troops to take over law enforcement duties in Washington D.C., and dispatched them to cities led by Black Democratic mayors, including Los Angeles and Memphis, while weighing whether to send troops to Baltimore, Chicago and New Orleans.

Some Republican governors such as Patrick Morrisey of West Virginia and Mike DeWine of Ohio were quick to send their National Guard units to D.C., while Republican Gov. Bill Lee of Tennessee deployed troops to Memphis, his state’s second largest city, in aid of Trump’s orders.

Haddy Gassama, senior policy counsel at the ACLU, said people need to know the laws in their states.

Gassama said local and state agencies can participate in 287g agreements with ICE, allowing the federal agency to delegate certain tasks to state and local law enforcement officials such as executing warrants in their jails and identifying and beginning removal proceedings against individuals arrested by local law enforcement.

“The Trump administration has said that their goal is to, just this year alone, detain and potentially deport up to 100,000 immigrants. They’re well on their way to that goal,” Gassama said. “Currently, there are over 60,000 immigrants in detention. It’s almost flipped on its head where it is using immigration policies to expand the mass incarceration system.”

Panelists also urged conference participants to vote.

“If you don’t vote, you’re dishonoring the legacy of people who sacrificed, paid their lives so that we would have opportunities to participate in [a] democracy that they did not,” former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said during a discussion Friday morning with Rep. Terri Sewell (D-Ala.)

“This is not a non-contact sport,” said Holder, who is chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. “We just can’t watch television and yell at Fox News or something, or agree with MSNBC, [or] whatever.

The immigration officers stopped their truck and went straight after them Thursday, Cruz told the Tribune.

“They asked us if we have papers. I said I do but I don’t have them on me,” Cruz, a 60-year old man with heart problems originally from El Salvador, recalled in Spanish.

The agents stood Cruz up, put him in their truck, drove around in circles, and asked questions, he said.

Where was he born? What is his name? Who is his mother? Who is his father?

“I told them, they are dead,” Cruz said. The agents said they needed the information anyway so they could look him up in their databases. Eventually, the agents verified that he is, in fact, legally in the country. And they let him go.

But not before writing him a $130 ticket for not having his papers. Cruz’s friend, who is homeless, did not have legal status and was taken away by the feds.

Under federal law, registered foreign nationals must carry proof of registration with them at all times. But prior to a second Trump administration, it was rarely enforced. As President Donald Trump escalates his immigration crackdown in Chicago and its suburbs, “Operation Midway Blitz,” agents are using broad federal authority when targeting suspected immigrants, legal experts say.

The Department of Homeland Security announced Oct. 1 that it had made 800 arrests in the area since the mission began at the beginning of September.

ICE arrests increase across Chicago under Trump, many with no convictions, data shows

While federal officials claim they are targeting the “worst of the worst,” bystanders have been swept up and people across Chicagoland have accused the government of widespread civil rights violations. In blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois last week, U.S. District Judge April Perry said the federal government had a credibility problem that made many of their claims “unreliable.”

The National Immigrant Justice Center in Chicago told the Tribune it has not yet seen any of its clients receive this sort of citation. But it’s part of a recent push by the Trump administration to ensure immigrants register with authorities and maintain their documentation to them at all times or face potential penalties.

The Immigrant Legal Resource Center calls it a “hateful tactic” meant to “cause panic and fear throughout the country.”

“America has never been a place where people need to ‘show one’s papers.’ Ticketing a lawful permanent resident — and forcing him to appear in court and pay a fine for not carrying their papers — is unnecessary and cruel,” said Ed Yohnka, communications director for the ACLU of Illinois. “It does not make our communities stronger or more safe. It is simply part of the Trump administration’s attempt to make life uncomfortable for all immigrants. It is just awful.”

A spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not return messages seeking comment.

It’s not clear how many individuals have been ticketed for not having their papers on them. The ticket Cruz showed the Tribune references a law requiring immigrants to be registered with the government and have their registration documents.

A former dishwasher, Cruz lives in a government-funded apartment but isn’t working due to his health. Cruz said he was relieved to be released but worries how he will pay the fine. The ICE agents told Cruz he has to pay it within 60 days or go to court.

“It’s not fair because I said, let’s go to my house and I’ll show you my papers. I’m a resident,” Cruz said.

In Chicago, immigrants who thought they were following the legal path are also facing deportation under Trump crackdown

U.S. citizens say they’re also being questioned by federal immigration agents for proof of citizenship.

Maria Greeley, 44, had just finished working a double shift at the Beach Bar on Ohio Street earlier this month when she said she was surrounded by three federal agents who grabbed her, forced her hands behind her back and zip-tied her.

Headphones in, Greeley had been focused on getting home to her two dogs for a walk. Instead, she said she was detained by masked agents who did not answer when she asked for names. They questioned her for an hour, she said.

Greeley, who was born at Illinois Masonic hospital and is adopted, carries a copy of her passport just in case she runs into federal agents.

“I am Latina and I am a service worker,” Greeley said. “I fit the description of what they’re looking for now.”

During the encounter, Greeley said they told her she “doesn’t look like” a Greeley.

“They said this isn’t real, they kept telling me I’m lying, I’m a liar,” Greeley recalled. “I told them to look in the rest of my wallet, I have my credit cards, my insurance.”

When the agents let her go, Greeley got home and screamed when she saw the shadow on her door. Days after the incident, Greeley said, it’s still “terrifying.”

“I just have to stay strong and not think about it, I’m still here, luckily,” she said, tearing up. “All those other people are getting taken.”

Days after Cruz had the encounter with federal agents, Cruz attended a hastily organized protest in Rogers Park residents. Hundreds turned out.

Ald. Maria Hadden, 49th, represents the Far North Side neighborhood on Chicago’s City Council. She said it was an effort to “recognize people from our community who were taken” and bring people together “to remind them that we are not powerless.”

The protest organizer group, Protect Rogers Park, posted on Facebook: “Today 400+ Rogers Parkers gathered to mourn, celebrate, defy authoritarianism, (canvass) and recommit to loving their neighbors. Oh, and buy a lot of tacos.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-L-ICE-rogers-park-1009-4.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-10-13 18:57:09.336587

Protesters have been gathering outside the Broadview ICE facility for weeks, and several have been arrested.
Meanwhile, National Guard troops arrived at the Broadview ICE facility last week, and a federal appeals court this past weekend blocked the deployment of the troops to the streets of Chicago.","The Village of Broadview, Illinois, announced Monday morning that it is shrinking the zone where protesters are allowed to gather outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in the western Chicago suburb.

In a statement, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said she decided on the restriction after protests outside the facility on Saturday night ""degenerated into chaos.""

""There were 15 arrests, and 10 of those were around the age of my own daughter. As a mother and a mayor, I am mad at what happened,"" Thompson said in the statement. ""Broadview didn't choose to have the ICE facility in our community. But it's here. And so are Broadview residents.""

Thompson wrote that some of the protesters have been making life difficult for Broadview residents.

""There are too many protesters are raising their fists rather than their voices, creating chaos at the expense of the people who call Broadview home,"" she wrote. ""Broadview residents lack the protestors' privilege to return to calm, quiet neighborhoods for undisturbed rest.""

For that reason, Thompson said she has signed a new executive order in consultation with the Illinois State Police and the Cook County Sheriff's office, which will permit protests only in the safety zone at the ICE facility on Beach Street. Protests will no longer be allowed at 2000 S. 25th Ave. between Lexington and Fillmore streets, Thompson wrote.

""Additionally, it has been only God's grace alone that a protester has not been struck and killed by a motorist on 25th Avenue given how frequently protesters dash onto this busy, four-lane street,"" Thompson wrote. ""This new measure will provide for both the serenity of residents and safety of protestors.""

Thompson emphasized that she respects, supports, and defends everyone's right to protest, and decried the use of chemical munitions by federal agents at the site.

""Nevertheless, my first priority is to defend public safety and the residents who live here and people who work here,"" she wrote.

On Monday, barriers were placed on South 25th to prevent protestors from spilling into the streets.

Protester Jon Ort, one of the few demonstrators standing outside, said it seems as if the facility is being fortified.

""We are a city where we protect one another,"" he said.

Neighbors came out too when they realized the barriers had been put down. Some were placed on top of their plants.

James Baker lives on South 25th and says it's been almost impossible getting in and out of his home in the last few weeks.

""I went to the grocery store four days ago. Me and my son had to carry groceries from the end of that light right there to the house,"" Baker said.

Around the corner from where the barriers were placed, Thompson stood with other local mayors and elected leaders. She explained the barriers are meant to keep people out of the streets when protests spill over the sidewalk. A judge's order will soon take the fence outside the facility down.

""This unity is more powerful than any show of force that has come from the other side of that illegal that illegally build fence,"" Thompson said.

This comes after Thompson signed an earlier executive order restricting protest times to between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. daily.

New York recently enacted a law permitting the New York Public Employment Relations Board to assert its jurisdiction over private employers

The National Labor Relations Board has filed a lawsuit challenging the law, arguing that it is preempted by the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution

Amazon has also filed a lawsuit challenging the law on similar grounds

On September 5, 2025, New York Senate Bill S.8034A was signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul, effective immediately. The law amends Section 715 of the New York State Labor Relations Act, permitting the New York Public Employment Relations Board (PERB) to assert jurisdiction over private-sector employers. PERB is an agency created by Section 205 of New York Civil Service Law, which traditionally oversees public-sector labor relations.

The law’s sponsor memo indicates that its purpose is to ensure “employees still receive protections by the National Labor Relations Act” when the NLRB is unable to successfully assert jurisdiction. Currently, the NLRB lacks a quorum, which limits its authority.

In response to the law’s enactment, on September 12, 2025, the NLRB filed a lawsuit against the State of New York and PERB in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the enforcement of the law. The NLRB argues (1) that the law is preempted by the NLRA under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution; and (2) that the law usurps the NLRB’s authority to regulate areas which are “explicitly reserved for federal oversight.”

On September 30, 2025, the NLRB filed a motion for preliminary injunction to enjoin New York State and PERB from implementing and enforcing the law. The NLRB argues that the law “creates a parallel regulatory system that undermines the federal labor policy Congress designed to be national in scope.” Stated differently, the NLRB argues that its congressionally granted jurisdiction over private employers has been directly displaced by PERB under the law. Moreover, the NLRB argues that in the absence of a preliminary injunction there is a threat of imminent irreparable harm since the law operates to displace the NLRB’s jurisdiction even after its quorum is restored. The NLRB argues that a preliminary injunction is in the public’s best interest and that issuing an injunction is favorable because the NLRB will continue to process labor practice cases and PERB can continue to oversee public-sector labor matters.

On September 22, 2025, Amazon also filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against PERB and PERB officials, seeking to strike down the law for similar reasons as the NLRB. In response, PERB has filed a motion seeking to halt this lawsuit, given the parallel lawsuit that the NLRB has already filed. Meanwhile, certain unions have filed a motion to intervene in both lawsuits seeking to have the law upheld, and certain business associations have sought to file briefs in both lawsuits in support of the arguments that the law should be struck down. These legal battles are expected to play out over the next several months.

Lawmakers in other states have already adopted or considered laws which displace the NLRB’s jurisdiction. For example, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law which will expand the jurisdiction of the California PERB to private-sector employees, effective in 2026. Additionally, Massachusetts is considering a law which would make key aspects of the NLRA part of state law. Similar challenges to the legality of bills in other states are expected.

New York employers should continue to monitor developments in these cases, assess their labor policies, and prepare for possible situations where PERB seeks jurisdiction over private-sector matters.

And then we’ll be in good shape. Lot of brown people on our team.”

That set the stage for Rivers, on the eve of his 64th birthday, to express his disappointment and anger about the mass arrests by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Chicago.

“It bothers me. I’m trying, I’m trying; I mean, it’s just awful what you watch and see, people getting zip tied. I mean, that’s not this country. That’s not what we’re about,” Rivers said in his pregame press conference Oct. 12 at the United Center, located on Chicago’s west side.

I know that. My dad would have a major problem; I couldn’t imagine my dad going to work right now and have to protect ICE agents and doing what they’re doing. I couldn’t imagine him wanting to go to work. I think he’d call in sick. And it’s just so – did you walk around the city today? This is an amazing city.

“Riding down the elevator with a couple, I wish I could remember where they’re from, their daughter ran in the marathon and the couple was so proud and they were saying, man, this is the best marathon, the city is amazing, I’ve never been to this city, wow. And the dad says, but we were so scared, we thought there was civil unrest everywhere. And he was like, ‘where is it?’ It’s nowhere. It’s just sad. We hate it. We hate it. I’m from Chicago. I’m very prideful about this place, so I hate it.”

Since the beginning of October, ICE raids in and around Chicago have escalated – along with protests of its activities – resulting in President Donald Trump deploying members of the Texas National Guard to the city.Rivers is a Chicago native who grew up in Maywood, Illinois, a village just west of the city. Maywood is also located just blocks from Broadview, which is the location of an ICE processing facility and has been the site of continued protests.

“I had at least one girlfriend from Broadview, I'm sure of it,” Rivers said, adding a little levity to the session. “Yeah, it's awful. I know it well. My brother (Grady Jr.) lives in Elmhurst. You gotta go from Maywood to Broadview to drive through it. Again, it's the same thing. And it almost feels like it's intentional, like they're trying to create unrest. It wasn't here, and now it's here.

At least five U.S. airports will not air a politicized video message from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming the government shutdown on Democrats—but a legal expert tells Forbes the video does not violate the Hatch Act, which restricts federal employees from some kinds of partisan messaging.

Key Facts

Does Kristi Noem’s Video Violate The Hatch Act?

“This is probably not a Hatch Act violation, because it's not tied to an election,” Cynthia Brown, senior ethics counsel at the non-partisan ethics watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), told Forbes. “But it's entirely inappropriate to be using federal resources to message on a partisan basis and disparage the opposing political party.” The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees—with carve outs for the president and vice president—from making partisan attacks while on the job “to ensure that federal programs are administered in a nonpartisan fashion, to protect federal employees from political coercion in the workplace, and to ensure that federal employees are advanced based on merit and not based on political affiliation,” according to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). A 2021 report from the OSC found 13 administration officials from President Donald Trump’s first term violated the Hatch Act by engaging in partisan messaging, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, acting secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security adviser Robert O’Brien. Senior adviser Kellyanne Conway violated the act dozens of times in her official capacity, according to a 2019 OSC report recommending that Trump fire her.

What Is The Penalty For A Hatch Act Violation?

None, unless Trump decides otherwise. “As a general matter, if you violate the Hatch Act, you are subject to discipline” including potential suspension, loss of pay or even removal from position, Brown told Forbes. “But there aren't a lot of teeth for the most senior officials, when it is someone at the cabinet level who reports to the President.” The 2021 OSC report concluded that “the Hatch Act is only as effective as the White House decides it will be” and noted “President Trump’s failure to ensure compliance by his senior officials allowed for, as one federal court said of a senior administration official, members of the administration to ‘violate the Hatch Act with seeming impunity.’”

Tangent

A memo sent last week from Ha Nguyen McNeill, acting administrator of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), blaming “Senate Democrats’ recalcitrance” for the shutdown angered many in the workforce, according to three TSA officers who told Forbes “people are very put-off by this rhetoric” and “we feel sickened.”

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo shook the legal world when it overturned one of the cornerstones of administrative law: the Chevron doctrine. Established by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., the Chevron doctrine directed federal courts to defer to an agency’s reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute that the agency administers.

In Part I of this series, we looked at how the federal courts have begun to implement Loper Bright one year after the seminal case; here, we dive into where things stand at the state level.

In a minute or less, here is what you need to know.

States Still Free to Go Their Own Ways

The Chevron doctrine was a rule about how courts should interpret federal law; state courts were never bound by it.1 In overturning Chevron, Loper Bright relied purely on statutory grounds under the Administrative Procedure Act. Because of this, state courts and state agencies are not bound by this decision either. However, many states tend to look to federal law and its trends as persuasive precedent for their own legal structures.

State of Play in the States

While at least 34 states give some level of deference to state agencies, there has been a recent trend limiting or eliminating such agency deference.2 In 2025 alone, North Carolina, Missouri, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Kentucky have either ended or significantly limited deference to state agencies.

Generally, states are split into four general categories regarding deference practices:

Fifteen states provide substantial deference to state agencies similar or stronger than Chevron. Examples include Illinois, D.C., and Massachusetts.3

Fourteen states provide a moderate level of deference, although with great variety. Some states use a sliding scale to determine the weight of deference, others only providing deference to the interpretation of regulations but not statues, and some add additional tests that must be met in order for deference to attach. These standards vary and there are many unique tests for states that fall under this category. For example, Connecticut provides Chevron-like deference, but only if the agency’s interpretation has been previously subjected to judicial scrutiny or is “time tested.”4 In North Carolina, interpretations are treated as non-binding, with deference based on the ability of the agency to persuade the court. In Michigan, interpretations are given “due consideration,” but courts must provide “cogent reasons” for overturning.

Four states appear inconsistent in their application of deference, with courts ruling both for deference and de novo review or declining to formally set rules of deference. Examples include Nevada and South Dakota.

Eighteen states provide no deference.5

Despite Shift From Deference, States Remain Diverse

Even with seven states limiting deference this year, states that apply deference outnumber the states that don’t. And within the deference states, there still lies significant variation. Some states such as Illinois provide a “presumption of correctness” even in the absence of ambiguity, while others, such as Maryland, provide deference to regulatory interpretations based on a multi-factored sliding scale test. Virginia applies deference based on the ability of the agency to persuade the court based on reasoning and expertise.

The recent shift to abolish or limit deference is also not universal. The Hawai’ian Supreme Court rejected the reasoning set forth in Loper Bright, stating: “[n]ow, the U.S. Supreme Court considers itself and other federal courts the experts on exceedingly complicated areas of American Life…In Hawai‘i, we defer to those agencies with the na‘auao (knowledge/wisdom) on particular subject matters to get complex issues right.”6

The Takeaway

While the abandonment of the Chevron doctrine has led many states to end or restrict deference to state agencies, there still remains significant variation in state application. This trend is not likely to change anytime soon.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-10/litigation%20courts%20verdict%20word%20cloud%20%281%29.jpg.webp?itok=T7rwXqBc,N,,2025-10-13 13:57:18.450733

One, filmed by a photographer in Hyattsville, Md., shows a man pinned to the ground by two ICE officers. He pleads in Spanish and English for someone to help him.

During the incident, one of the officers drops his gun and fumbles for it. Then, he appears to point it at bystanders. Emily Covington, an assistant director in ICE's Office of Public Affairs, told NPR in a statement that drawing a weapon can be used as a de-escalation tactic.

Another video, from Broadview, Ill., near Chicago, appears to show a man outside an ICE facility getting shot in the head with a pepper ball, a projectile filled with chemical irritants. That man, Pastor David Black, has sued the Trump administration.

Late last month, a local CBS reporter said a masked ICE agent fired a pepper ball at her car at that same facility, causing her to vomit for hours. The reporter, Asal Rezaei, said there was no protest happening at the time. Broadview Police are now investigating.

""These are just the tip of the iceberg,"" says Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. ""People being tackled, people getting pepper sprayed or tear gassed. We've seen people getting threatened. And we've seen at least two incidents involving gunfire.""

A majority of Americans do not approve of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement tactics, according to a recent survey from The New York Times and Siena University. Yet in Chicago, immigrant advocate groups say federal immigration officers are escalating those tactics and becoming more violent.

""This administration overall seems more interested in heightening the tensions instead of trying to ramp them down,"" Tsao says.

In late September, federal officers broke down doors and arrested dozens of people during a massive apartment raid on Chicago's south side.

Earlier this month, federal officers shot a woman in the city, and a few weeks before, they killed a man in a nearby suburb. In both shootings, officials at the Department of Homeland Security said the victims threatened officers. But in body camera footage from the fatal shooting, the officer who responded says his injuries are ""nothing major.""

In the case of the woman, her lawyer says officer body camera footage from the incident contradicts that narrative, too. On Thursday, a grand jury indicted her and another man, alleging that they ""impeded, intimidated and interfered"" with the duties of a federal officer.

""What we're seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers,"" says Ed Yohnka, director of communications and public policy at the ACLU of Illinois, which has brought a lawsuit against the Trump administration for violating the constitutional rights of protesters.

In Covington's statement to NPR, she said ICE officers are ""highly trained and act accordingly with law and policy."" The statement also cited a sharp increase in assaults against ICE officers, though reporting from Colorado Public Radio suggests those claims are overblown.

Gil Kerlikowske, the former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection during the Obama administration, says federal immigration officers are not prepared for what is being asked of them.

""They do not have the training or skillset or experience to police an urban environment,"" says Kerlikowske, who was also the police chief in Seattle and police commissioner in Buffalo, N.Y.

Good policing in cities, he says, relies on de-escalation, trust and public cooperation. The show of force federal agents are using in Chicago and elsewhere is unnecessary, he says.

""These are tactics and strategies that are clearly not needed to be able to do their job,"" Kerlikowske says. ""I couldn't be more disappointed.""

Courts have weighed in on the amount of force a police officer — whether they're local, state or federal — can legally use, and determined that any use-of-force must be ""objectively reasonable.""

""What does it mean to be objectively reasonable? That term by itself doesn't actually mean anything without context,"" says Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who trains police officers.

DHS, which includes ICE, uses that standard. The agency's most recent use-of-force policy notes that officers should only use force when ""no reasonably effective, safe and feasible alternative appears to exist."" Among the agency's principles are ""de-escalation"" and ""respect for human life.""

For use of force to be constitutional, there must be a valid threat. But threats can range from someone with a gun, to someone resisting arrest, to many scenarios in between. How police respond to a situation also must be proportional to the danger of the situation.

""We look at the situation through the lens of the reasonable officer on the scene,"" adds Stoughton. ""It might be perfectly reasonable for an officer to step in front of someone, raise a hand and say, 'Stop. I need to talk to you.' And it would be totally unreasonable for the officer to put a gun in that person's face and say, 'Stop or I'm going to shoot you.'""

Many uses of force can be legally justified, but Stoughton says just because officers can do something doesn't mean they should.

""I don't think most people are asking the question, is this action in this particular video consistent or inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment?"" Stoughton says, referring to the law that governs searches and seizures, which also protects against excessive force. ""I think what they're asking is, is this a socially and democratically legitimate police action? And that's a very different question than whether it's a legal police action.""

Immigrant rights groups in Chicago, including the ACLU of Illinois, say federal agents are violating the law – by using ""violent force"" against protesters and others.

Because of that, they say it's important for bystanders to document what they witness, which helps make questions of force a little less open for interpretation.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5300x2981+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4d%2Fa8%2Fbaf668f44ed9a5363cc655419105%2Fgettyimages-2239229963.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 13:57:01.795049

Mayor Brandon Johnson said the Oct. 3 incident in Chicago’s Logan Square neighborhood sent students running into the school and prompted teachers and staff to create a barrier between the children and federal authorities.

“The escalation of ICE raids does nothing to keep our young people safe; in fact, it makes them afraid, and it disrupts their learning,” Johnson, referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said at a recent news conference.

Now, a new line of protection has surrounded students in the Chicago Public Schools system. Armed with whistles and know-your-rights pamphlets, these community volunteers call themselves “guardian angels.” Together, they secure the perimeters of elementary, middle and high schools across the city.

Asked about the incident, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said Border Patrol agents deployed tear gas and pepper balls when protesters impeded the arrest of an alleged undocumented immigrant. In general, federal policy prohibits immigration authorities from raiding sensitive locations such as churches and schools, although agents have been seen conducting operations in nearby neighborhoods.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: “During a targeted immigration enforcement operation in Chicago, U.S. Border Patrol vehicles were impeded by protesters. After repeated vocal attempts to disperse the crowd, USBP deployed tear gas and pepper balls. During this operation an illegal alien was arrested and later complained of a leg injury after attempting to flee law enforcement. Out of an abundance of caution he was taken to the hospital for medical treatment.”

McLaughlin accused protesters of trying to break into the hospital where the detainee was receiving medical care after the arrest.

“Our brave officers are facing a surge in increase in assaults against them, including sniper attacks, cars being used as weapons on them, and assaults by rioters. This violence against law enforcement must END. We will not be deterred by rioters and protesters in keeping America safe,” she said in a statement.

Volunteers fan out across Chicago schools

When the call for volunteers went out, 500 community members stepped up, filling more than 1,000 shifts at nearly 100 schools on Chicago’s northwest side. The goal is to ensure students can attend class for an education without fear of a confrontation with ICE.

This “guardian angel” movement has continued to grow, and volunteers have shown up in droves daily at school pick-up and drop-off locations.

“They’re just regular people who understand that people have the right to eat, to work, to go to school,” said Juliet De Jesus of the Logan Square Neighborhood Association.

Johnson said he’s hopeful there won’t be a repeat of what happened outside the school, thanks to a temporary restraining order, which prohibits federal authorities from using force against citizens.

However, DHS said individuals are subject to arrest and federal prosecution if they block authorities from doing their job and carrying out enforcement operations.",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/05/GettyImages-2195569096.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-13 15:57:21.854685

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X.","Overview:

The deployment of the Texas National Guard to Illinois to support federal authorities in immigration enforcement has been ruled lawful by a federal judge, despite protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants' rights. The troops, who are currently under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command, will remain in a federalized status. The deployment is part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Trump administration, which has flooded Chicago with ICE agents using increasingly aggressive methods to apprehend undocumented immigrants.

Hundreds of Texas-based National Guards deployed this week to Illinois to boost federal authorities can stay there, but can’t be activated, a federal judge ruled Saturday.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the latest ruling states.

This comes after fierce pushback from local residents and Democratic leaders in both Texas and Illinois who have called the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard — with the blessing of Gov. Greg Abbott — unlawful. Two days ago, U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the guard from being deployed, but the Trump administration appealed the decision, prompting Saturday’s ruling.

In a Fox News interview Monday night, Abbott said that the National Guard troops were being deployed to “safeguard” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The Trump administration over the last month has flooded Chicago with ICE agents who have been using increasingly aggressive methods to go after undocumented immigrants — drawing sharp protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants’ rights that in some instances has escalated to violent clashes on the streets.

Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Perry issued her ruling and order.

Around 200 members from different units of the Texas Guard are currently in Illinois, according to an update from the U.S. Northern Command. It also says that the troops were “mobilized for an initial period of 60 days and will be under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command.” After the initial ruling, the Department of Defense said the federalized National Guard troops “will remain in a federalized status,” though it declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

Some troops were already at an immigration building in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when Perry heard arguments on Thursday. The building has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and agents.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in President Donald Trump’s “animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” she said.

Since the Chicago-area crackdown began about a month ago, ICE has apprehended more than 1,000 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. U.S. citizens and children have been caught up in raids and altercations between masked federal agents and locals in the nation’s third largest city.

“The president has the constitutional responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States, and those laws include the immigration laws,” Abbott told Sean Hannity. “The president has the authority to call up National Guard to assist in enforcing those laws, and that’s exactly what the president is doing and what Texas is doing — we’re assisting the president in that cause.”

The leveraging of soldiers to help Trump carry out his promised mass deportations of undocumented people echoes a vision the president laid out on the campaign trail, when he pitched an approach of using multiple levels of authority much like former President Dwight Eisenhower’s infamous immigration crackdown.

Here is what you need to know:

What is the Texas National Guard?

The Texas National Guard, made up of more than 20,000 soldiers, is overseen by the Texas Military Department. Guard members are often deployed in response to natural disasters, and in the past have helped rescue people stranded by floodwaters after a hurricane and delivered basic necessities to communities ravaged by storms.

The Military Department’s mission is to provide the president and the governor with “ready forces in support of state and federal authorities at home and abroad,” according to TMD.

The governor has the authority to deploy the Guard as its commander-in-chief. Additionally, a president can take control of troops to deploy them as the nation’s top executive sees fit.

Trump’s federalization of Texas’ troops was blessed by Abbott, who authorized the request.

When has the Texas National Guard been used for non-traditional deployments?

No mission has drawn as much attention to the Texas National Guard or been drenched in politics more than Operation Lone Star.

Abbott launched the border security mission in 2021 in response to what he characterized as the Biden administration’s “open border” immigration policies. The mission became a long-term domestic military deployment, as the governor surged thousands of troops to the 1,254 miles of border that Texas shares with Mexico.

While it was not the first time that military personnel had been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, the deployment was unique due to the large number of troops quickly dispatched for an indefinite period of time. Also while soldiers in previous federal operations had provided logistical support roles, Texas tested the boundaries of how much immigration enforcement a state could undertake.

The Operation Lone Star deployment was initially defined by its messiness: Troops reported deplorable conditions for a mission that upended their lives.

It was also accompanied by scandal and questions of authority. Guard members were accused of spying on migrants, started shooting would-be border crossers with pepper ball irritants and helped block federal immigration authorities from parts of the border — dragging the Biden administration into court over a constitutional dispute as courts had long held that federal authorities have sole jurisdiction over the enforcement of immigration laws.

Earlier this year, Abbott directed the Guard to help the Trump administration with its immigration crackdown. The Guard is one of two statewide agencies that entered into an agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement which grants it limited authority to enforce immigration laws during regular duties.

In June, the governor deployed 5,000 soldiers across the state in anticipation of massive protests in the state’s largest cities against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Guard members can augment local police in certain circumstances — like during civil unrest — but federal law prohibits the use of troops as civilian law enforcement.

Is it legal for the Texas National Guard to be used for non-state purposes?

Under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the president is able to call upon the National Guard in the case of an invasion, a rebellion or the danger of one, or if the federal government cannot execute its laws “with the regular forces.”

On Sunday, the Texas governor said he “fully authorized” such a deployment.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott said in a post on X.

Trump’s attempts to federalize some blue states’ guards over their objections have, however, resulted in lawsuits.

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily barred the deployment of any state guards to Oregon. A three-judge panel — which includes two Trump nominees — from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then heard arguments on Thursday about the mobilization, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Illinois sued on Monday, saying that the federal government can still enforce its laws in the state and conditions have not been met to justify the mobilization. A federal judge then granted a partial temporary block on Thursday, but specific details were still unclear.

Ten Democratic U.S. representatives from Texas have called Trump’s deployment of national guards unlawful. They also said it set a bad precedent that could undermine Texas’ ability to resist deployment from other states in the future.

“If any other state deployed their National Guard to Texas without our consent, we would call that an invasion of Texas,” the lawmakers said in a Tuesday letter to Abbott.

Amid challenges against his use of the National Guard, Trump has also discussed invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 if necessary, which would allow the president to use the military for civilian law enforcement. But it can only be used under specific situations, such as when requested by a state or when “unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion … make it impracticable” to enforce federal laws.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots following an aid request from California’s governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

What do we know about what the Texas National Guard is doing in Illinois?

Texas Guard members were sighted in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to The Chicago Tribune.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X. “They are putting America first by ensuring that the federal government can safely enforce federal law.”

The following day, the U.S. Northern Command said in an update that troops were active in the greater Chicago area effective Wednesday. It says they are tasked with protecting ICE and other federal officers who are enforcing federal laws, as well as safeguarding federal properties. Troops may also “temporarily detain” individuals to stop them from interfering with federal officers, but they will not be performing arrests because “that is a law enforcement activity,” the command said.

Some Texas guards were then seen at the Broadview ICE facility, according to local media.

Before introducing Fine, he emphasized that Chicago is a city of immigrants.","A coalition of local elected officials, led by State Sen. Laura Fine (D-Glenview) and advocacy groups, including the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, held a community workshop in Lovelace Park on Sunday in response to continued federal immigration crackdowns in the Chicago area.

Around 150 people attended the session, titled “Together For Our Neighbors: People’s Defense Workshop.” The event included updates from mutual aid and legal organizations, and advocacy groups fielded questions on a variety of topics, such as whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are required to read detainees their Miranda rights and to what extent local police are barred from cooperating with immigration enforcement.

After the event, several organizers and attendees traveled to the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, which has been the site of confrontations between protesters, political candidates and Department of Homeland Security agents.

Fine, who is running to replace U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston) in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, said her office has received an influx of messages from residents concerned about immigration raids in the district.

“Today, we heard that somebody was taken from the Home Depot in Evanston,” Fine said. “We had landscapers who were taken across the street from Glenbrook South High School when school was in session. This is happening in our communities with our friends, our neighbors, the people we shop with at the grocery store, the families that our kids go to school with.”

In an X post, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss confirmed ICE was present in Evanston on Sunday morning. Multiple community members were taken, and ICE was also present in Rogers Park, according to the post.

The Department of Homeland Security also arrested an individual in Evanston near the intersection of Church Street and Brown Avenue on Sept. 10, according to a city statement released later that week.

Fine said she is optimistic that the Illinois General Assembly will pass new restrictions on ICE agents when it reconvenes Tuesday.

Jewish Child and Family Services Chicago also participated to highlight the effect of ICE raids on mental health, Skokie resident and JCFS CEO Stacey Shor said.

“What we see happening is, for people who may be directly impacted, there’s increased isolation,” Shor said. “They’re afraid to leave their homes. People are afraid to go about their business.”

Organizers also collected food donations for communities affected by the raids. The concrete tiles around the speakers had “God Bless Democracy” and “Love Thy Neighbor” written on them in chalk.

Chicago resident Carter Cleland, an activist with the anti-war group Chicago Area Peace Action, held a sign reading “Jail Bibi” on one side and with a symbol of the “No Kings” movement on the other.

Cleland said he has hosted weekly rallies in Wilmette for the last eight months to protest against President Donald Trump, the Israel-Hamas war and climate change. Attending this workshop was another element of that activism, Cleland said.

Ben Isabel, Fine’s chief of staff, told the crowd that “no human being is illegal,” prompting cheers from attendees. Before introducing Fine, he emphasized that Chicago is a city of immigrants.

“Our immigrant neighbors are our coworkers, our classmates, our friends and our family,” Isabel said. “They deserve safety, dignity and the full protection of their rights.”

An excellent piece by Telnaes that can be taken a couple of ways. Certainly, the brutality of the lawless attacks has damaged our freedom, but you can also take Liberty as a personification of the American people and those who wish to be American and interpret the attacks as happening to all of us.

An eagle, or Uncle Sam, wouldn’t include the immigrants as effectively. We’ve spent the last century-plus glorifying the concept of immigrants and refugees seeing the Statue of Liberty as they sail into New York harbor despite the plain fact that not everyone arrives either by ship or through that port.

We invented the myth of the First Thanksgiving as an embodiment of the friendship of the established inhabitants for those who might come seeking freedom. And, oh, BTW, to fill jobs in our growing mines and factories.

This was part of a view of American history I call “the virus that spread from Plymouth Rock,” since the Jamestown colony was already more than a decade old when that friendly feast happened or perhaps never did.

And Spain had begun establishing settlements here as soon as Columbus landed, but our kids don’t learn about the extensive and important Spanish settlements in the West until the land had become part of the United States, or until the virus reached that part of the country.

Not only does history not happen until the white folks arrive, they have to be the right white folks, and the Know-Nothings of the 1830s and 40s were quite sure that Catholics, and especially Irish Catholics, were not who belonged here. The burning of the Charlestown Nunnery was only one of the attacks on the wrong kind of people by a group that had surprising political success peddling their bigoted program.

And, by golly, didn’t they come back about 75 years later.

And again 75 years after that.

The Know-Nothing Party is long gone, but the current crop of nativists creates their own mythology, and I wasn’t surprised this morning by a report on social media that another bullet has been found, proving that Kirk’s murder was part of a conspiracy, though there was no mention of a grassy knoll.

Though speaking of conspiracy theories, I got a laugh when it happened that I saw Whamond’s cartoon just before I spotted this on social media:

Humor is an effective tool against hate, though you have to be cautious, since bullies don’t like being made to look revealed to be stupid.

Bagley’s accusation is very effective at comforting the afflicted, but likely not so good at afflicting the comfortable, given that a substantial number of the bullies think the January 6 events were a good thing, even as they put “Support the Blue” stickers on their bumpers.

They should understand the second panel, but the combination doesn’t click for them. Which is how we got to where we are.

Again.

They do hate, but don’t see themselves as motivated by hatred. Telnaes paints Noem as the evil reincarnation of Aimee Semple McPherson, which is probably unfair to McPherson, who was certainly flamboyant and religiously extreme but politically fairly moderate.

The thing is, Telnaes did not make up some bizarre phrase to stick in Noem’s mouth: Rather, she used the journalist’s sneaky trick of quoting her directly and accurately. Kosplay Kristi was speaking of sending ICE to the Super Bowl, under the impression that a lot of lawn workers and motel maids will be shelling out six grand each to watch Bad Bunny.

I have the responsibility for making sure everybody goes to the Super Bowl, has the opportunity to enjoy it and to leave, and that’s what America is about.

In case you wondered what America is about. It’s about going to the Super Bowl, enjoying it and then self-deporting. Or something.

You can’t copyright a book title, but I don’t think David Halberstam’s estate has to worry about anyone writing about this administration and calling it The Best and the Brightest.

It would all be hilarious if it weren’t so unspeakably, incredibly brutal and cruel. Part of the problem is that, while people being dragged out of their cars and beaten in the streets should be appalling, when seen on TV it seems to be happening to someone else, somewhere else.

I’ve seen a demonstrator hit in the face with billy clubs less than 10 feet from me, and it’s a whole lot different than seeing it on television. She was screaming in pain and fear and her face looked like bloody liver as they dragged her away, but I really think you had to be there, because three months later I watched the Chicago Convention on TV and it was the same town and the same cops, but it just felt like TV.

On the other hand, once budget cuts begin to double insurance premiums, and to simultaneously limit what financially-burdened hospitals are able to provide, the impact of a less physical, more organizational cruelty will hit more people more directly.

Unfortunately, the midterms are likely to be over before the worst of it has struck, which sounds heartless, but if it’s going to happen, it ought to at least have some strategic value.

One piece of cruelty that is beginning to hit a wide target is the flood of layoffs triggered by the shutdown. Trump once more proves that you can be clever without being intelligent, because he’s threatening to fire workers in revenge for the shutdown but had the good instinct to order the military paid, although they weren’t supposed to be.

The threats could bring a few legislators to heel, but there are lots of young families in the military and letting them starve or lose their housing would be directly felt.

“Crocodile tears” is a wonderfully well-chosen metaphor.

It’s odd to look back on Nixon nostalgically, but being on his enemies list was more of a compliment than a threat. It meant he didn’t like you. He might decide to have your phone tapped or order your taxes audited, but you didn’t have to worry about your family’s safety.

Those were the good old days.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin previously told MassLive that ICE had no idea that the teenager was a minor and that he was detained “to determine his identity and if he was a potential safety threat.”

“ICE does NOT target juveniles or children,” DHS Assistant Secretary of Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to MassLive. “At the time of the detainment, ICE had no knowledge of the individual’s age.”

Fearing persecution under a military government, he was able to get asylum in D.C. before coming to the Langley Park area.
“It was an onslaught, especially at Northwestern and High Point high schools” where many Langley Park teens attend.
“Then we had Purple Line construction, which took away business when it became too difficult to travel here.","Sit down in the San Alejo Salvadoran restaurant, near the corner of New Hampshire Avenue and University Boulevard in suburban Maryland, and you have entered the heart of Langley Park — like a mini Central America.

Situated on the border where Montgomery County ends and Prince George’s County begins, Langley Park’s mostly Latino community is proud of its 100-year history as a lively neighborhood of immigrants, filled with Hispanic markets, restaurants and small businesses that line its busy streets.

But challenges from landlord neglect and the impacts of the Maryland Transit Administration’s new Purple Line are making life more difficult for the residents who call Langley Park home. And more recently, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have put the community on edge.

National politics hit home

As she sat eating tamales at San Alejo, Maryland State Del. Deni Taveras talked about how the ICE raids in the neighborhood have also reopened old wounds.

“A lot of people here lived through wars in their countries. To have masked men with machine guns breaking down doors at 6 a.m., that brings trauma,” she said, referring to how ICE officers have been entering homes in Langley Park. “People are afraid to go to work. They’re afraid to make a living,” she said.

Lindolfo Carballo, senior director of community economic development of the Latino advocacy organization CASA, which is located in the center of Langley Park, agreed with Taveras. “What this administration is doing has horrified our community,” he said and added that he’s seen ICE officers pull people right off the street and social media posts have tracked the abuse in the neighborhood.

Carballo said ICE officers broke the window of a Langley Park woman’s car with her teenage daughter inside. “Her daughter saw the whole thing. And that’s not only illegal but it’s inhumane,” he said.

The reason for the targeting? About 85% of the neighborhood’s 22,000 residents are from Central America, and some are undocumented, Carballo said. The majority are from El Salvador and Guatemala, along with immigrants from Nicaragua, Honduras and other countries.

Thousands of Latino immigrants moved to Langley Park during the 1970s and 1980s, a time when civil wars were tearing through El Salvador and Guatemala, Carballo said. Now, the community has one of the highest populations of Salvadorans in the U.S.

Carballo himself is an immigrant who escaped El Salvador in the early 1980s after he was arrested for participating in anti-government activities during the nation’s civil war. Fearing persecution under a military government, he was able to get asylum in D.C. before coming to the Langley Park area. He is concerned that Central American immigrants now are being denied the opportunities he received.

Even before he came to work in Langley Park, the area was always a neighborhood of immigrants, Carballo said, stretching back to the 1920s when a British immigrant, Frederick McCormick-Goodhart bought the land where Langley Park now sits.

The mining magnate built a 30,000-square-foot mansion, where CASA is now headquartered. Developers built low-cost garden apartments surrounding the mansion, which attracted large groups of immigrants over the past 90 years, from Eastern European Jews to Africans to an influx of Central Americans starting in the 1970s.

Housing, economic strains and fentanyl

While ICE raids are the latest concern for Langley Park residents, the neighborhood has had some longstanding problems that leaders are still addressing.

Carballo said while immigrants were able to find cheaper housing in Langley Park, its housing stock has long suffered neglect. For years, landlords often deferred maintenance and faced few consequences because non-English speaking tenants didn’t have the tools to legally challenge them — leaving some occupants living in deteriorating buildings.

“Drive around here and you can see windows made of cardboard,” Carballo said. “And in the wintertime, that is cruel.”

About 20 years ago, with the help of CASA, which is celebrating its 40th anniversary next month, some tenants organized and fought to improve living conditions, which brought about upgrades in some buildings.

“This is a hardworking area of individuals that want to make their American dreams come true,” Taveras said. But now people are paying $1,700 a month for rent, which is very high for someone making just $15-$20 an hour, she said.

To make ends meet, many people rent out rooms or families double up so they can make rent, causing overcrowding in some buildings.

Taveras has represented different parts of Prince George’s County on the council for 12 years, and now represents Langley Park while living on the edge of the neighborhood. She came to the D.C. area from New York in the early 2000s.

Of Dominican heritage, she says she’s proud to fight for the neighborhood, a community grappling with the same housing and economic struggles she knew growing up as an orphan in one of New York’s Hispanic neighborhoods.

Adding to the economic strains, fentanyl is also eating away at the neighborhood, especially among young people, Taveras said. “It was an onslaught, especially at Northwestern and High Point high schools” where many Langley Park teens attend.

Over the past 10 years, however, “we’ve been able to address the addiction through Narcan,” she said. Legislation and distributing fentanyl detection strips have also helped “because a lot of people didn’t know that what they were taking was laced with fentanyl.”

The Purple Line — hopes and hazards

The Purple Line, MTA’s long-awaited 16-mile light rail stretching from Bethesda to New Carrollton, cuts directly through Langley Park.A 2017 report said few deny that the Purple Line will bring new amenities and services to what researchers referred to as a “long-neglected portion of the county.”

While many in Langley Park welcome better transit access, they also worry it will accelerate gentrification, Carballo said.

Construction of the line over the past seven years has cut into profits for businesses along the rail’s path, according to Yolanda Brewster, a Guatemalan immigrant who runs the Xelaju kiosk, which sells Guatemalan food, clothes and souvenirs in La Union Mall on University Boulevard.

“First we had the pandemic, which wiped us out,” she said. “Then we had Purple Line construction, which took away business when it became too difficult to travel here. Now it’s like a cemetery — no one comes here anymore.”

Culture helps build community

Despite these challenges, Langley Park endures as a place where families build futures. Carballo of CASA said that, to him, the neighborhood represents “everything positive.”

“It’s a very young neighborhood, right? There are so many kids here, so many people, and that is the future of the United States.”

Del. Taveras agrees on how deeply that spirit runs. “We have children here that are on their way to Dartmouth. We have families starting their businesses, that are extremely entrepreneurial.”

“We have a sense of resilience here, a sense of community here, a sense of culture that is extremely rich and very endearing,” Taveras said.

She said this is especially important to point out during Hispanic Heritage Month, when the U.S. celebrates all things Latino. She remembered celebrations past at Langley Park’s MegaMart Hispanic grocery store, which had a party for Guatemalian Independence Day on Oct. 15 last year that was “so big, it lasted until the next day.

“As somebody who could have lived anywhere, I chose to be here,” Taveras said, “and I’m so proud of where I live.”

Thompson said the protests at the ICE facility ""degenerated into chaos,"" adding that 10 of those arrested were ""around the age of my own daughter.""

""As a mother and a mayor, I am mad at what happened,"" Thompson said in a statement. ""Broadview didn’t choose to have the ICE facility in our community. But it’s here. And so are Broadview residents.""

Under a new executive order signed by Thompson, demonstrations will now be limited to the safety zone located directly at the ICE facility on Beach Street. The previous protest area on South 25th Avenue between Lexington and Fillmore has been eliminated.

Thompson said the decision was made in consultation with the Illinois State Police and the Cook County Sheriff’s Office.

""It has been only God’s grace alone that a protester has not been struck and killed by a motorist on 25th Avenue given how frequently protesters dash onto this busy, four-lane street,"" Thompson said.

While reaffirming her support for peaceful demonstrations, Thompson condemned violent behavior at recent protests and said her top priority remains protecting residents and first responders.

""I respect, support, and defend the protesters’ free and – peaceful – speech against the outrageous injustices and deplorable unprovoked chemical arms attacks by ICE agents against American citizens, journalists, and ministers that put Broadview police and firefighters in harms’ way,"" she said.

This development comes amid continuous legal challenges to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provides protection from deportation and work authorization for undocumented individuals who arrived in the United States as children.

The current status reflects the ongoing legal battle that has plagued DACA since its establishment in 2012. Recent court decisions, particularly from the Southern District of Texas under Judge Andrew Hanen and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, have determined that DACA was not lawfully implemented. In January 2025, the Fifth Circuit struck down key portions of the Biden Administration’s DACA regulation while stopping short of completely terminating the program, sending the case back to Judge Hanen for further determination.

Under the current framework, USCIS confirms that renewal applications for existing DACA recipients continue to be processed nationwide without interruption. However, initial applications from first-time applicants are being accepted but placed on indefinite hold. The agency will receive and store these filings but will not review, adjudicate, or issue work authorization until further court direction emerges. Advance Parole for international travel remains available to current DACA holders on a case-by-case basis.

This acceptance without adjudication approach stems directly from the injunction still in place under the Texas court order. Until that order is modified or lifted, no new DACA grants can be approved regardless of application submission. The Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security have requested that the court permit adjudication of new DACA applications outside Texas, arguing that Dreamers nationwide should not face penalties due to a geographically limited ruling. That proposal remains pending before Judge Hanen.

Legal experts anticipate that regardless of the Texas court’s next decision, the case will likely return to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final determination on DACA’s future in 2026. The program continues to stand at the center of legal and political debate in the United States, with this latest development representing both a technical step and a potential turning point in the ongoing litigation surrounding Dreamers’ protections.",https://www.citybuzz.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/favicon-65x65.png,N,,2025-10-13 12:58:08.114322

Villegas Gonzalez was killed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Sept. 12 during what authorities initially described as a routine traffic stop that Villegas Gonzalez tried to flee.
Though DHS said Villegas Gonzalez was a targeted undocumented immigrant because of his criminal background of “reckless driving,” the Tribune found no criminal history for Villegas Gonzalez, who had been living in the Chicago area for the past 18 years.
Since getting his children, Villegas Gonzalez dedicated his time to work and taking care of his two sons, his loved ones say.
That trip was also the last time she hugged Villegas Gonzalez goodbye.","On a recent humid morning in Michoacán, Mexico, hundreds gathered to mourn Silverio Villegas Gonzalez. His body had finally come home after getting shot and killed by an ICE agent in Franklin Park after he allegedly tried to run him over.

The small town where he was born and raised was filled that late September day with neighbors, friends, and relatives, many of whom have family members working or living in the United States. Among them were Silverio’s elderly parents, dressed in white, leaning on others for support as they made their way through their town, paying homage to Villegas Gonzalez.

Their faces were etched with sorrow; their steps heavy not just from age, but from the weight of a grief that may never leave them. At 38 years old, he was the youngest of their 10 children.

“Mi hijo era un buen hombre. Por qué me lo mataron así?” cried Esperanza Gonzalez, 77, his mother, on a phone call with Tribune. “My son was a good man. Why did they kill him that way?”

On the day of his burial, as they lowered their son into the ground, one absence loomed larger than the rest: Villegas Gonzalez’s two children were not there.

Villegas Gonzalez was killed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Sept. 12 during what authorities initially described as a routine traffic stop that Villegas Gonzalez tried to flee. A few weeks later, the state of Idaho took custody of his two kids, according to his family and Mexican officials.

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare could not immediately provide a comment regarding the case, but his family said Villegas Gonzalez had been seeking custody of his two sons, 7 and 3, in court before his death and had obtained partial custody. Their biological mother had moved with the children to Idaho about three years ago, the family said.

“The (U.S.) government killed their father and now they want to take them away from us,” Graciela Villegas, one of his sisters, told the Tribune. “Those children adored their dad.”

Now, from across the border, his family is not only seeking to reunite with his children, they’re also fighting for something just as important, they said: justice.

Earlier this month, Illinois Democratic leaders, including U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García and other congressional representatives sent a letter to the Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem asking for transparency and accountability about the fatal shooting by the ICE officer. Meanwhile, the Mexican Consulate in Chicago confirmed it is working to help reunite the children with their extended family who live in the United States.

Ambassador Reyna Torres Mendivil said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is demanding a “thorough investigation.”

In the weeks since Villegas Gonzalez’s death, new video evidence has emerged, including footage from witness cellphones and, most notably, body cameras worn by Franklin Park police officers who responded to the scene. Democratic leaders requesting the investigation say there are “inconsistencies between publicly released surveillance footage and allegations made by DHS,” which claimed that Villegas Gonzalez dragged an officer with his vehicle and attempted to run him over, causing serious injuries.

Back in Michoacán, the calls for justice can seem louder than the wailing at the burial. For Graciela Villegas, who had not seen her brother in nearly two decades, seeing her brother in a casket was “excruciating.”

Her brother, she said, was wrongfully portrayed as a criminal.

“They killed him for no reason,” Graciela said.

Though DHS said Villegas Gonzalez was a targeted undocumented immigrant because of his criminal background of “reckless driving,” the Tribune found no criminal history for Villegas Gonzalez, who had been living in the Chicago area for the past 18 years.

Since getting his children, Villegas Gonzalez dedicated his time to work and taking care of his two sons, his loved ones say. He was working on getting healthier and on saving money, his sister said.

“That’s because he wanted to prove that he could be a good father to gain full custody of his children,” she added.

She thinks that her brother was “so worried of losing his children” and “that’s why he may have tried to run away” from the federal agents who were questioning him.

Penny Kostoglakis, the mother of the children and Villegas Gonzalez’s wife, said she has not been able to see her children since the state of Idaho picked them up from Chicago. Though she lives in that state and intends to seek custody, she said she thinks her children will be well taken care of by the Villegas family if they stay in the United States.

“He was always good to me,” she said about Villegas Gonzalez. “He was always working and I would stay home to take care of the kids.”

When she found out about the shooting she immediately asked her sister in Chicago, “Were the kids with him?”

Villegas Gonzalez had just dropped off his kids at day care and was on his way to work when the agents approached him. Mexican officials say they are monitoring the welfare of the children.

“We are doing everything necessary, in coordination with the consular network, to ensure that these children are being taken care of now,” Torres Mendivil said. “(The custody of the children) will not be determined by the family or the consulates. No one else will intervene other than a judge who must assess whether the children are being placed in a safe environment.”

Graciela Villegas remembers her brother as a quiet and reserved man who left his rural hometown in Mexico to pursue opportunities to earn more money in the United States when he was 20 years old.

That was the last time Graciela saw her brother alive.

“But he would call or message me almost every day,” she said through tears. “Whenever he could, he would send us money, especially since our parents have been sick lately.”

The family lives in Loma de Chupio, a small town with dirt roads and houses made of stone with tiled roofs. The community lives off the land, raising cattle and relying on what they can grow.

Most people in their town have family members living in the United States without legal status, Villegas said. Many of them knew him personally.

“The whole town is grieving, and everyone is scared of what might happen to their loved ones in the U.S.,” said Lourdes Alejandra Lopez, director of migrant services in Irimbo, Michoacán, the municipality that includes Loma de Chupio. Lopez has been supporting the Villegas family through the repatriation process, the burial, and now serves as their liaison as Mexican authorities demand an investigation into the fatal shooting.

Local officials have also started compiling information on residents with family members abroad, aiming to provide resources and guidance in case of deportation for when they return.

“For now, the family needs to rest,” Lopez said. “They are facing not only the pain of losing a loved one but also the burden of a legal battle.”

For Esperanza Gonzalez, the only comfort amid the grief would be having her two grandchildren, Villegas Gonzalez’s sons, back home with them.

She met her eldest grandson during a visit to Chicago a few years ago. That trip was also the last time she hugged Villegas Gonzalez goodbye.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-L-Silverio-Villegas-procession-03_243180638_228574.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-10-13 12:57:55.323307

Indigenous Peoples’ Day as Resistance In this political landscape, Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds the public that the survival of Native nations is inseparable from Native sovereignty.","Indigenous Peoples’ Day has always been an act of celebration, resistance, and truth. When we gather and organize for Indigenous Peoples’ Day, we affirm that we are still here. It is a reminder that our stories did not begin with Columbus, and they do not end with the myth of American exceptionalism and conquest. But today, it carries an urgency we can’t ignore. In the current political climate, that affirmation takes on new meaning as questions about the legitimacy of our U.S. citizenship are raised in efforts to end birthright citizenship and erase the political existence of Native nations.

On October 9, 2025, Trump issued the 2025 Columbus Day Proclamation, declaring Christopher Columbus “a visionary who paved the way for the founding of our great Nation.” He urged Americans to honor “the values of courage, faith, and discovery that built Western civilization.”

In the proclamation, Trump made no mention of Indigenous people, unless you count the mention of a “vicious and merciless campaign to erase our history, slander our heroes, and attack our heritage.” The wording of Trump’s phrase echoes a similar line in the Declaration of Independence, which accuses King George III of acting against the colonists who opposed British rule by colluding with “the merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions.” Instead of taking the opportunity to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples’ Day, Trump doubled down on a myth of discovery that glorifies genocide and rebrands colonization as destiny.

This same worldview underpins Trump’s renewed effort to end birthright citizenship, a move that threatens not only immigrants but also the very foundation of Native existence. In one of the administration’s own legal arguments, officials claimed, “The United States’ connection with the children of illegal aliens and temporary visitors is weaker than its connection with members of Indian tribes. If the latter link is insufficient for birthright citizenship, the former certainly is.”

This suggests that tribal citizenship, the political relationship that predates the United States itself, is somehow incompatible with being American. It echoes the logic used to justify centuries of termination policies, removal, and forced dependency.

The Trump administration’s attacks on birthright citizenship do not just threaten immigrant communities. They strike at the very heart of Indigenous sovereignty. They threaten to bring back an era of termination and removal, creating the conditions for Native people to once again be treated as wards of the state, stripped of rights, and relocated to lands or countries we have never set foot in.

Recent reports from the Oregon Capital Chronicle describe how Navajo citizens were detained in immigration sweeps across border states, raising alarm among tribal leaders who warn that racial profiling and the refusal to recognize tribal identification put Indigenous people in the same danger as undocumented immigrants.

The American Immigration Council has also warned that the Supreme Court’s refusal to restrict racial profiling in immigration raids has encouraged law enforcement to target anyone who looks “foreign,” a pattern that puts Indigenous people at particular risk because our identities and documents are not consistently recognized or treated as valid government documents.

Tribal Nations have alerted their citizens to this threat, suggesting they carry their tribal IDs, Certificate of Indian Blood (CIB), passports, and other photo IDs to help reduce the risk of detainment in the event of ICE raids.

The Indian Law Resource Center also reminds us that many of those being deported are Indigenous people themselves. The center has raised concern over the planned deportation of more than 600 Guatemalan children, at least 90 percent of whom are Maya, stressing that these children are Indigenous and have rights under both U.S. and international law.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day has never been just a celebration. It is a call to action against the ongoing assault on our sovereignty and existence — and an assertion that, despite these threats, we will not be erased, silenced, or eradicated.

Sovereignty and Citizenship

Indigenous Peoples’ Day stands in defiance of a nation that has always treated Native sovereignty as an obstacle to overcome in upholding the myth of Manifest Destiny. In 1871, theIndian Appropriations Act ended the recognition of tribes as sovereign nations. With that single act, Congress declared that no tribe would be acknowledged as an independent power capable of making treaties. Our nations were reduced to wards of the state, entirely dependent on the same government that had stolen our lands.

TheDawes Act of 1887 went further. It divided tribal lands into individual allotments and stripped millions of acres from Native control. It was designed to assimilate Natives into mainstream society and dismantle tribal sovereignty, breaking apart communities and leaving many Natives impoverished and landless. The act also tied land allotments to U.S. citizenship, granting it to those who accepted allotments, severed their tribal affiliations, and left reservations, making citizenship a tool of assimilation rather than recognition of rights.

With the 1934 passage of theIndian Reorganization Act, also known as the Wheeler-Howard Act, tribes regained a measure of sovereignty. The Indian Reorganization Act allowed tribes to re-establish governments and manage their own lands, but the recognition came with heavy federal oversight. Yet even within those restrictions, our nations rebuilt and strengthened the scope and boundaries of our sovereignty.

Dual Citizenship

As Native peoples, we are citizens of the United States, but we are also citizens of our tribal nations. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 extended U.S. citizenship to all Native Americans without requiring them to sever their tribal affiliations, as was previously necessary. The Act created a dual framework, where we not only have the right to self-determination but also hold rights and responsibilities in two nations simultaneously.

This reality is fragile, and not all Native nations share the same protection. As Teen Vogue reported, nearly 400 tribes in the United States lack federal recognition, which means they do not share the same nation-to-nation relationship that federally recognized tribes have with the U.S. government. This also leaves their people without the legal rights, resources, or protections guaranteed to federally recognized tribes. For these communities, the lack of recognition means they exist in a legal limbo when federal policy turns hostile.

As Dina Gilio-Whitaker, author and professor of American Indian studies and lecturer at the California Indian Culture and Sovereignty Center, explained to Truthout:

Tribal sovereignty as a legal principle and self-determination as tribal autonomy has always been what’s at stake for tribal nations. Throughout U.S. history it has never been unassailable in U.S. law because of underlying logics of Euro-Christian superiority; that is what the doctrine of discovery is.

History has shown that while our sovereignty is an organic, inalienable right, it is not a fixed or guaranteed right in relation to the U.S. government. Indigenous nations must continually nurture the nation-to-nation relationship that we have and defend our sovereignty against political systems designed to limit or erase it.

If tribal sovereignty were ever dissolved as it was in 1871 with the Indian Appropriations Act, recognition of our tribal citizenship would disappear with it. If our U.S. citizenship were also revoked, we would be left stateless in our own homelands. That is the depth of what is at stake when sovereignty is undermined. Native identity, rights, and futures are tied to the recognition of both forms of citizenship, to the survival of our nations as sovereign powers, and to the protection of the land and water that sustain us.

Contemporary Threats to Citizenship and Sovereignty

The Trump administration’s attacks on Native sovereignty and citizenship are not isolated incidents. They are part of a consistent effort to undermine the rights of tribal nations and the people who belong to them. Treaty obligations are dismissed whenever they conflict with corporate interests. Sacred lands such asBears Ears andOak Flat are stripped of federal protection and opened to mining and drilling.Pipelines are forced through Native territories without consultation or consent. Federal funding for housing, health care, and education — already limited in many communities — is repeatedly threatened, further weakening the foundations of Native life.

Native children face a direct threat to their connection to their nations through attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, which has been challenged in multiple cases in state and federal courts. Native tribes and organizations successfully defended and even expanded this law.

Passed in 1978 to stop the mass removal of Native children from their families and communities, the Indian Child Welfare Act protects the right of children to remain with their families, in their communities, and connected to their cultures.

Despite ongoing challenges, the law remains one of the most important protections for tribal sovereignty and Native families. In June 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Indian Child Welfare Act’s constitutionality in a 7–2 decision in Haaland v. Brackeen, rejecting all challenges to the law.

More recently, in August 2024, the California Supreme Court strengthened the Indian Child Welfare Act by requiring child welfare agencies to investigate a child’s potential Native ancestry before separating families. But around the same time, the rejection of the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act denied survivors of cultural genocide a path to justice. The proposed commission would have investigated the legacy of Indian boarding schools and given survivors a chance to tell their stories and seek accountability.

Attacks on the Indian Child Welfare Act, birthright citizenship, and tribal sovereignty are interconnected. Each is a threat to the dual citizenship Native people hold. Undermining either form of citizenship puts Native people at risk of legal limbo, statelessness, and social and economic marginalization. The survival of our nations, our families, and our children hinges on protecting both our tribal and U.S. citizenship.

Refusing to Surrender

Despite continued threats to our sovereignty, Native nations, communities, and organizations use every means available, from the courts to direct action, to defend our rights and existence. The victories won and even the losses show that even in the face of systemic erasure and violence, Native people refuse to disappear, refuse to surrender.

The fight to protect Oak Flat in Arizona is a current example of this. Oak Flat, a sacred Apache site, is threatened by a copper mine authorized through a congressional land swap pushed by the Trump administration. Tribal leaders, activists, and allies organized to defend Oak Flat, arguing in court and mobilizing to ensure that sacred land is not exchanged and destroyed for foreign private profit.

As of October 2025, the U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear further appeals, supporting lower court rulings that allow the transfer to proceed. However, a federal appeals court issued an emergency injunction blocking the transfer and delaying the mine’s advance while legal challenges are considered.

At Standing Rock, hundreds of tribes and tens of thousands of allies gathered and occupied land near the Cannonball River in North Dakota to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline to protect treaty lands and water. Although the pipeline was completed, the resistance led to widespread awareness of Indigenous rights and environmental justice.

Standing Rock sparked solidarity actions around the world, inspired divestment campaigns targeting banks that financed the pipeline, and brought issues such as broken treaties, environmental racism, and missing and murdered Indigenous women into global conversations. It also resulted in ongoing legal challenges and inspired a new generation of Native activists who understand that sovereignty is not negotiable.

These interventions, whether through the courts or activism, are not symbolic but the literal defense of rights that are supposed to be guaranteed under tribal and U.S. law. It is the refusal to accept marginalization, neglect, erasure, and defeat. Indigenous Peoples’ Day is both a reflection of these struggles and a call to continue the fight.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day as Resistance

In this political landscape, Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds the public that the survival of Native nations is inseparable from Native sovereignty. When birthright citizenship is questioned, when sacred lands are desecrated, when funding for essential programs is threatened, and when cultural institutions are ignored or attacked, the very survival of our communities is at stake.

In an interview with Truthout, Dina Gilio-Whitaker explained:

Tribes will always be a threat to a certain segment of the American population (currently coded as Republican) because the doctrine of tribal sovereignty erects a system of guardrails to protect the rights that hundreds of treaties guaranteed, and the small amount of land that tribes still control. Those lands hold coveted resources that tribes have the power to choose to develop or keep in the ground.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day calls on everyone to honor our survival and acknowledge the ongoing struggle against colonization and genocide. Our struggles are not isolated; they echo in other parts of the world, from the defense of our homelands here to the fight for survival in Gaza, where people continue to resist displacement and violence. It is a reminder that what happens to Native nations today is a glimpse of what can happen to any community when power goes unchecked and rights are violated. Indigenous Peoples’ Day reminds us that defending our sovereignty is defending justice for all.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2220129370-1536x1025.jpg,N,,2025-10-13 10:57:17.820348

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants—regardless of status—have been pulling back.
Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64.
""Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what's happening to immigrants,"" she said.
""I can't express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,"" Durazo said.","An estimated 1.4 million immigrants who are in the country legally but are not citizens stand to lose their government-subsidized health care coverage under the sweeping tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law this summer, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts federal spending on Medicaid, the joint federal-state health insurance program for low-income people. It also places new eligibility restrictions on lawfully present immigrants, including refugees and asylees, who are enrolled in a variety of government-subsidized health programs: Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), Medicare and Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

Immigrants who are in the country illegally have long been ineligible for federally funded health coverage.

But seven states—California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington—plus the District of Columbia have extended state-funded coverage to some income-eligible noncitizen adults regardless of their immigration status. Fourteen states plus the district provide state-funded coverage to noncitizen children whether they are here legally or not.

The new restrictions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with other Trump policies limiting public benefits for immigrants, put those states in a financial bind. With less federal money to provide health benefits to immigrants who are here legally, states will be hard-pressed to maintain their programs that offer coverage to all immigrants, regardless of their legal status.

""We're taking a giant step backwards from that public health and preventive health measure by excluding more people and draining federal resources from states that need it,"" said Tanya Broder, a senior counsel specializing in immigrant health policy at the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group.

""And the result will be that our health—individually, as families and as communities—will be in jeopardy, and the health care infrastructure that serves all of us will also be compromised,"" Broder said.

Already, some states that had offered health coverage aid to all immigrants—regardless of status—have been pulling back.

To help close a $12 billion deficit, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June signed a state budget that bars immigrants who are here illegally from enrolling in the state's Medicaid program, known as Medi-Cal. Current enrollees between the ages of 19 and 59 will have to pay a new $30 monthly premium beginning in 2027. In July 2026, the state will eliminate dental care for noncitizens.

Illinois in July ended its state-funded health coverage program for all immigrants ages 42 to 64. The state still operates a state-funded plan for residents 65 and older regardless of immigration status, but enrollment has been paused. And Minnesota also plans to exclude adult immigrants who are here illegally from a program that used to provide coverage regardless of immigration status.

New York is in an especially tough spot, since its state constitution prohibits discrimination against lawfully present immigrants in providing public benefits.

""States have had some type of leeway to fund resources for migrant communities if they want to,"" said Medha Makhlouf, a law professor and the founding director of the Medical-Legal Partnership Clinic at Penn State Dickinson Law who studies immigrants' access to health care. ""But now this [federal] law makes it difficult for them to do that.""

Making it less attractive to stay

Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration policies, said these efforts are part of both Trump's larger anti-immigration stance and ""Congress' interest in getting rid of any incentive or benefit for people who are in the country illegally.""

""It's a way of making it less attractive for people to stay here illegally, right?"" Vaughan said. ""They're trying to give people reasons to leave rather than reasons to stay.""

As noncitizens who are here legally lose access to federally funded benefits, the demand for state-funded coverage is ""likely to increase,"" Drishti Pillai, director of immigrant health policy at KFF, a health policy research group, told Stateline.

""However, at the same time, states are facing increasing budget pressures, especially with the Medicaid cuts,"" Pillai said. ""So it's almost a double whammy, where there will likely be increased demand for state-funded coverage programs, but also states will have fewer resources to cover people.""

Makhlouf said the Trump administration's policy changes reflect a broader strategy of stripping public benefits from marginalized and poor communities.

""Everyone who cares about access to health care needs to pay attention to what's happening to immigrants,"" she said. ""When it becomes normalized to be able to sacrifice certain people's humanity or their vulnerability, or to minimize their contributions to society, and say, ""You don't deserve access to health care,"" then that can be turned on to any group.""

Under Trump's domestic policy law, California expects to lose at least $28.4 billion in federal Medicaid funding, according to Newsom's office.

On the California Senate floor June 27, Democratic state Sen. María Elena Durazo expressed her sorrow at the state's decision to deny coverage to immigrants.

""I can't express how much joy I felt when we expanded basic health care,"" Durazo said. ""Today, that joy that I was so happy about, that joy has turned into pain, that joy has turned into shame.""

Democratic Senate Pro Tem Mike McGuire, however, said the state had little choice.

""We are a state of immigrants, 10.6 million strong. And we will never turn our backs on those who are part of the heart of the largest economy in the United States of America,"" McGuire said during the debate. ""So we've had to make some tough decisions. I know we're not going to please everyone.""

Obligated in New York

One state, New York, is particularly in a bind, because its constitution requires it to provide coverage to lawfully present noncitizens.

New York mostly picked up the tab for immigrants and other lawfully residing immigrants until 2016, when it launched coverage it called the Essential Plan under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Under the ACA, the plan has no deductibles or monthly premiums for patients, and the federal government has picked up almost the entire cost—90%—of the plan, a huge economic relief for the state.

Now, New York faces an annual loss of $13.5 billion in federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act funds. Additionally, the phasing out of premium tax credits for noncitizens under Trump's law would lead to a loss of $7.5 billion in annual funding to the state's Essential Plan, which covers 1.7 million New Yorkers.

""These are billions of dollars that are being taken away and out of New York's delivery system,"" Amir Bassiri, director of Medicaid at the New York State Department of Health, said at a United Hospital Fund conference on July 30.

Another tamale street vendor not far from Maria's cart said she had heard of her detention and quickly teared up over what happened.
""People have taken root here, they have families here now"" and federal agents ""basically just stripped them from their life.","One minute Maria was selling tamales from her food cart in Chicago's West Side. The next, her son said, she was bundled into a van, the latest victim of U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive crackdown on immigrants.

Maria's family was left to pick up the pieces, removing her cart, food containers and umbrella before launching a frantic search for the Mexican-born mother of seven who has lived in the United States for two decades, albeit undocumented.

By Saturday morning, 24 hours after her arrest, her family had still learned ""nothing"" about her status from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the federal agency conducting aggressive raids in and around the nation's third largest city.

""It could be days, it could be months, it could be years, or we may never see her again,"" Eduardo Santoyo, 22, said of his mother.

Maria's detention in broad daylight — witnesses posted video online — fit a recent pattern: Agents swoop in without warning, snatch an unsuspecting resident and drive off, with relatives left to panic over the fate of their loved ones.

""What are we going to tell my sister?"" Santayo asked, referring to his mother's youngest child, who is only six years old.

Anguish colored the faces of Maria's son and another daughter, age 16, as they stepped in to continue running the tamale cart in the very spot where their mother was taken into custody.

This week saw scores of immigration detentions in Chicago, many of which only came to light after witnesses posted footage of the arrests on social media.

Alerts about raids are popping up regularly online as activist groups warn residents about sweeps in neighborhoods with a large Latino population like Cicero, Little Village and Pilsen.

Migrants reportedly have been detained at Chicago-area construction sites, near a university building, along strip malls and outside schools.

A local television producer, who holds U.S. citizenship, was arrested by federal agents during immigration enforcement operations on Chicago's North Side, her employer WGN said. She was later released.

Federal agents also targeted rideshare drivers in a sweep Friday at O'Hare International Airport, resulting in 12 arrests, according to local reports.

While protesters have been beaten, tear-gassed and arrested in recent weeks at an ICE facility in the suburb of Broadview, anti-immigration unrest across the rest of the city has been sporadic.

But the impact of the raids has been nothing less than chilling.

""You may not see a raid, but this is affecting our community,"" said Casey Caballero, 37, a self-described soccer mom from Lombard who is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen.

Caballero and others accuse immigration agents of discriminatory racial profiling.

Santoyo has U.S. citizenship, but expressed anger and fear that such status may matter little if agents are doing what he suspects: targeting people because of the color of their skin and the language they speak.

""That's racism,"" he said. ""If they come after me, I have papers, but how would they know that?""

Another tamale street vendor not far from Maria's cart said she had heard of her detention and quickly teared up over what happened.

""It could be anyone"" swept up in the raids, she said.

A heavily tattooed man, who said he was driving past when Maria was taken into custody, expressed outrage at the operation, noting she had been serving food to the community for years.

Nae Campbell, a longtime customer, recalled how this ""good woman"" could be found vending year-round, whether in searing heat or Chicago's famously bitter cold.

As for the raids, Campbell called them ""the most ... inhumane gesture I've ever seen.""

""People have taken root here, they have families here now"" and federal agents ""basically just stripped them from their life. That's crazy,"" the 32-year-old hospital worker said.

But Campbell, who drove across the city for Maria's goods, said she had faith that the vendor's family would be supported.

Doctors at Adventist Health White Memorial hospital in Boyle Heights told LAist that hospital administrators are allowing federal immigration agents to interfere in medical decisions and block doctors from properly treating detainees who need emergency care.

Administrators at White Memorial have told doctors not to call a detained patient’s family members, even to find out what type of medication they’re on or what conditions they have, doctors told LAist. Hospital leaders also have told doctors to allow immigration agents to remain by a detained patient’s side, even during consultations, inhibiting frank discussions between doctors and their patients and potentially violating patient privacy laws. Doctors say this is not typical protocol for any patients, including those brought in by local police or sheriff’s deputies.

These doctors are equally concerned about their inability to ensure follow-up care for patients released to the ICE processing facility known as B-18 in downtown L.A., where critics say some detainees have been held for days on end with no proper beds or medical care.

Why this matters

White Memorial is part of a network of private, nonprofit hospitals affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church, with $7 billion in annual revenue. The hospital has been operating for more than 110 years. Its calling is to “help improve the lives of our friends and neighbors in East Los Angeles and Boyle Heights,” according to its website.

Five physicians at White Memorial shared the details with LAist about ICE’s presence at the hospital and hospital administrators’ response on the condition that they not be named for fear of retaliation from their employer or from immigration authorities. LAist reviewed internal emails supporting their claims.

“We have an ethical and moral duty to provide excellent medical care and to serve the patient’s interest,” one doctor at White Memorial told LAist. But the doctor said the frequent presence of masked, armed immigration agents in the hospital makes it “very difficult to do that.”

The physicians told LAist they believe the directives from their bosses conflict with the responsibilities all doctors have to their patients and with guidance from the California attorney general.

White Memorial did not respond to a request for an interview from LAist or to our emailed list of questions.

In a statement, a White Memorial spokesperson said the hospital’s staff “are passionately committed to providing the highest standard of medical care to all who come through our doors, regardless of their circumstances” and that the hospital has “protocols in place that are designed to help support the lawful respect of patient rights.”

“We are doing everything in our power to provide safe and compassionate care to our community during this time of unrest,” the statement reads. It also urged people not to “delay the medical care you need.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond to specific questions from LAist or agree to an interview.

In a statement, she wrote that “ICE is not denying any illegal alien access to proper medical care or medications.” McLaughlin said it was “longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody.”

She added that she hoped LAist “would consider NOT writing this garbage” in the wake of the recent shooting outside an ICE detention center in Texas, where one detainee was killed and two injured.

“These types of smears are contributing to our officers facing a 1000% increase in assaults against them,” she wrote.

An analysis of federal court filings for assault on a federal officer by Colorado Public Radio shows a sharp increase in charges in recent months. The data is far short of the scale suggested by officials.

The bigger picture

A version of the conflicts described at White Memorial is happening across the state and the country as hospitals are forced to contend with fallout from the Trump administration’s mass deportation program. Caught in the middle are doctors and other medical professionals who have a legal duty to provide medical care to patients and ethical concerns about policies they feel affect the traditional standards of care.

The five doctors who spoke with LAist say the conflicts are especially acute at White Memorial, a hospital whose patient and surrounding population is mostly Latino and where several doctors told LAist they’re seeing two to three detained patients per shift.

The situation also raises questions about medical privacy at a time when the federal government is seeking access to sensitive personal information, including medical information from both immigrants and U.S.-born citizens.

Lorenzo Antonio González is a physician who volunteers with Unión del Barrio, which patrols Boyle Heights and other neighborhoods to warn people about ICE raids. He does not work at White Memorial but is aware of the doctors’ concerns. He said he fears ICE’s frequent presence at the hospital will further the chilling effect already causing many Boyle Heights neighbors — where more than 80% of households speak Spanish and a quarter of residents are noncitizens — to forgo medical care and avoid leaving their homes. González called White Memorial’s alleged behavior “an erosion of trust within this pillar of a community.”

How we got here

As immigration raids ramped up in Los Angeles this year, some detainees have needed urgent medical care, either because they were injured while being detained, had a pre-existing illness, or because they became ill while being held at the downtown immigration facility.

Some of these incidents became headlines. In July, a Salvadoran woman was brought to Glendale Memorial Hospital with injuries suffered during a raid. In that case, camera crews descended on the hospital as activists protested the presence of ICE agents in the public lobby.

Meanwhile, White Memorial stayed out of the news. In June, a hospital leader sent an email to colleagues, flagging several incidents involving immigration detainees, including one in which agents remained in the room with a detained patient during the patient’s entire stay at the hospital. The email also noted that agents told doctors they could not call the patient’s family members when the patient couldn’t remember her medications, according to the email and doctors who spoke with LAist.

Doctors at White Memorial and other hospitals told LAist it’s not typical for law enforcement officers to remain in the room during patient care, even with criminal detainees, unless there’s a serious security risk. People in ICE custody are civil, not criminal detainees. Doctors also told LAist it’s common practice to call family members, with a patient’s permission, to inquire about their medical history and current medications.

So the doctors at White Memorial pressed hospital administrators for a clear policy and legal guidance on how to balance ICE agent demands with the hospital’s responsibilities for patient care.

The answer that came back from hospital administrators: defer to the agents.

Hospital leaders told doctors — both verbally, doctors say, and in writing in several emails reviewed by LAist — that immigration agents are allowed to be present at all times, even during discussions about a patient’s sensitive medical information. Doctors also were told they could not call a detained patient’s family member without an agent’s permission. In one email to subordinates, a hospital leader told White Memorial staff that doing so could be a “security risk.”

“That’s like encouraging medical negligence,” one White Memorial doctor told LAist in response to this guidance.

At least one doctor told LAist they are defying hospital leaders’ guidance, deferring instead to their medical duty to the patient and to follow medical privacy laws.

“There’s no way you can get me to not call a patient’s family if they’re hurt and need support,” the doctor said.

Why detainee care is under scrutiny

The concerns about White Memorial come at a time when the care of people in ICE custody is under scrutiny. In August, a man was severely injured while being detained at a car wash in Carson. Agents brought him to Harbor-UCLA medical center for treatment and remained by his bed, to which the man was cuffed, for over a month, according to a recent court ruling. He was never charged with violating any immigration laws, and in October, a federal judge ordered the agents monitoring him to leave the man’s hospital room and remove restrictions on the man’s “ability to make telephone calls to family and friends and to confer confidentially with counsel outside the presence of ICE agents.”Concerns about the medical care of detainees also extends to formal ICE detention centers. In September, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a Westminster man who was being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center, became the 17th person to die in ICE custody this year. Last year, 12 people died in ICE custody, according to agency statistics.

Ayala-Uribe, 39, was a former DACA recipient who supporters say had lived in the country since he was 4 years old. He was picked up in an ICE raid in Fountain Valley in August and sent to Adelanto. From there, a medical provider at the detention facility sent Ayala-Uribe to a nearby hospital, where he was evaluated for an abscess, scheduled for surgery and sent back to the facility. He died in custody the following day.

Earlier this year, as immigration raids ramped up, the advocacy group Disability Rights California interviewed 18 people detained at the Adelanto ICE facility. In a subsequent report, the group concluded that “due to the surging numbers of people at Adelanto, conditions appear to have quickly deteriorated.” The report claimed detainees faced “inadequate access to medical treatment, such as life-saving medication and wound care and exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses.”

In response to LAist’s emailed questions about medical care for ICE detainees, McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, said detainees received “medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare … many aliens have received in their entire lives,” she wrote.

McLaughlin did not respond to LAist’s follow-up email asking her to specifically respond to questions about hospital care for detainees outside of detention centers or to questions about the availability of health care at the B-18 processing center, which unlike the Adelanto facility, is not an official detention center.

In a recent, ongoing lawsuit over the L.A. immigration raids, the ACLU and other groups called out alleged unsanitary conditions and a lack of medical care at B-18.

“Individuals with conditions that require consistent medications and treatment are not given any medical attention, even when that information is brought to the attention of the officers on duty,” reads the initial complaint, filed in July.

One doctor at White Memorial told LAist she had called ICE supervisors at the holding center on several occasions to inquire about follow-up care for patients and was told there were no doctors at the facility and there was no way to obtain medication.

What this all means for detainees — and doctors

Other groups have tried to bring attention to the problems associated with immigration agents in hospital settings. The Committee of Interns and Residents, which is is part of the Service Employees International Union, publicly denounced the presence of ICE agents at University of California hospitals in July, saying it creates “an unsafe environment that … directly contradicts our mission to provide safe, effective and quality healthcare to every member of our community.”

Mahima Iyengar, a doctor at L.A. General hospital and secretary-treasurer of the committee, told LAist that having a law enforcement officer present during doctor-patient conversations can compromise care.

“There’s that level of trust that people have with their doctor that they don’t necessarily have when somebody else is listening,” Iyengar told LAist. “Your doctor is then not getting as much information as they need, and that information … very well could be what helps them come up with a diagnosis or what helps them decide what treatment [the patient] is going to be on.”

Iyengar said doctors also are unlikely to feel comfortable asking a patient important non-medical questions when an ICE agent is present.

“A lot of what determines our patients’ health are all of these social determinants, like where they’re living, how they’re getting to the hospital, if they have money, if they have kids that need childcare right now while they’re hospitalized,” she said. “All of those questions are important questions to ask that I would not personally feel comfortable asking if an officer was standing right there.”

McLaughlin, the ICE spokesperson, did not respond to LAist’s specific questions about whether the agency recognizes detained patients’ privacy rights at hospitals.

What do legal experts say?

Last December, California Attorney General Rob Bonta issued “guidance and model policies” for health care facilities in responding to the anticipated increase in immigration enforcement. The guidance is not mandatory for private hospitals, like White Memorial, but all health care facilities were “encouraged to adopt” model policies. Doctors who spoke with LAist said they had read the guidance and felt beholden to it.

The document states that:

State and federal medical privacy laws apply to all patients “regardless of immigration status.”

Health care facility staff “should identify circumstances in which granting immigration enforcement officers access to patients may interfere with physicians’ duty to provide competent medical care, to safeguard patient confidences and privacy, and to otherwise prioritize their obligations to their patients”; and

Facilities “should educate patients about their privacy rights and reassure them that their healthcare information is protected by federal and state laws.”

A spokesperson for Bonta told LAist the attorney general could not comment on whether the office had received complaints about ICE privacy breaches in health care settings because they are confidential.

“We continue to monitor compliance with all state and federal laws,” the spokesperson said in an email.

LAist also asked two health care legal experts about White Memorial’s direction to staff to allow ICE agents to be present during patient exams and bar calls to detained patients’ family members. Both said the guidance could violate medical privacy laws and ethical standards.

“From a patient safety perspective, it certainly raises red flags,” said Paul Schmeltzer, an L.A.-based health care and data privacy lawyer, referring especially to the prohibition on calling a detained patient’s family member. Schmeltzer also said letting an ICE agent remain next to a patient throughout their hospital stay without the patient’s consent is likely illegal. Patient privacy is protected under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, and California’s Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. Both generally prohibit doctors and hospitals from disclosing a patient’s medical information without their permission or a search warrant or other court order.

Schmeltzer said he saw “no permissible situation” under these laws for “disclosing” a detained patient’s hospital treatment to an ICE agent.

“The fact that an ICE agent is present in the room while this patient is receiving treatment, that’s a disclosure,” he said.

Deven McGraw, chief regulatory and privacy officer for the company Citizen Health, a patient data platform, agreed.

“ You’re basically saying, ‘Yeah, patient, you don’t have a choice but to disclose your medical information to this law enforcement official,’” she said.

McGraw was in charge of enforcing HIPAA at the federal Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights from 2015 to 2017. She said there are personal and public health reasons for shielding a patient’s medical information from law enforcement. For example, a patient might hide that they have a communicable disease out of fear they’ll be targeted or isolated.

“ We’re supposed to treat people,” McGraw said. “The failure to treat them has potential consequences for their own health, plus the health of others.”

Schmeltzer and McGraw both said the administration at White Memorial might be making a calculated decision when weighing the hospital’s potential liability for violating the privacy rights of immigration detainees versus angering the Trump administration. Only the federal government and state attorneys general can prosecute a hospital for violating HIPAA, Schmeltzer and McGraw noted.

Some of the behavior described by doctors could be prohibited under a new state law, enacted in September as an “urgency” measure. The law requires health care facilities to ban immigration agents from entering non-public areas without a valid warrant and to advise staff on how to respond to agents’ requests for entry.

Even before the law, groups like the Committee of Interns and Residents had begun to train colleagues on the privacy rights of detained patients and how to handle ICE agents. Iyengar said doctors at L.A. General, for example, distribute “Know Your Rights” cards to immigrant patients and hospital employees are instructed to immediately call hospital directors if immigration agents appear.

“ Even just if there is an ICE officer in the hospital, that will put people off from visiting a loved one, or if word gets out, the community finds out, and they don’t want come to that hospital,” she said. “So, it’s just an unsafe environment to have an ICE officer in a hospital, especially [a hospital] that’s serving mostly immigrants.”

Bradford Exchange, Ltd., the Ninth Circuit addressed a plaintiff's attempt to sidestep the Class Action Fairness Act (CAFA) by structuring a complaint to avoid federal jurisdiction. The decision confirms that defendants can keep such cases in federal court by expressly waiving the ""adequate remedy at law"" objection that might otherwise deprive the court of equitable jurisdiction.

Plaintiff's Strategy: Equitable Remedies Only

The plaintiff filed a putative class action in California state court alleging that the defendant failed to disclose that his product purchase was part of a subscription program. Instead of seeking damages, the plaintiff sought only equitable restitution under California's Unfair Competition Law (UCL) and False Advertising Law (FAL).

The plaintiff admitted that he could have pursued damages under the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (CLRA), a legal remedy, but elected not to do so. His omission was deliberate. By limiting his complaint to equitable relief, the plaintiff sought to avoid removal by arguing that federal courts lack equitable jurisdiction when a plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law.

Initially, the plaintiff's strategy worked. The district court granted plaintiff's motion to remand on the grounds that the court lacked equitable jurisdiction. Notably, the district court held that the defendant could not waive this ""jurisdictional"" defect.

The Ninth Circuit: Waiver Saves Federal Jurisdiction

The Ninth Circuit reversed. In doing so, the Court reaffirmed that, while federal courts lack ""equitable jurisdiction"" where a plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law, the defendant may waive that defect. Specifically, the Court held ""district courts are empowered to remand a removed case to state court for lack of equitable jurisdiction, but only after the removing defendant is given the opportunity to waive the adequate-remedy-at-law issue to keep the case in federal court."" The Court described the impact of its holding plainly: ""if a plaintiff files a lawsuit in state court seeking only equitable relief and the case is properly removed to federal court, a defendant can defeat remand on equitable jurisdiction grounds by waiving the adequate-remedy-at-law issue.""

Practical Implications

The Ninth Circuit's ruling provides defendants with a new mechanism to defeat anti-removal tactics increasingly seen in California consumer class actions. While plaintiffs may continue to tailor complaints to seek only equitable restitution under the UCL and FAL, defendants can now neutralize that strategy and stay in federal court by waiving the argument that plaintiffs have an adequate remedy at law, ensuring that CAFA's jurisdiction reach remains intact.

In UK News:

The number of hate crimes committed in England and Wales has risen since the previous year, according to statistics released by the Home Office. In the year ending March 2025, 115,990 hate crimes were recorded by the police: this marks a 2% increase overall, a 6% increase in race hate crimes, and a 3% increase in religious hate crimes. A 19% increase in religious hate crimes targeting Muslims coincided with the time of the Southport murders and the subsequent race riots across the country.

Kemi Badenoch has confirmed at the Conservative Party Conference that her party would withdraw the UK from the European Convention on Human Rights and repeal the Human Rights Act if they form the next Government. This follows a legal review by the Shadow Attorney General, Lord Wolfson, into the impact of remaining in the ECHR. The Wolfson Report concluded that ‘it is hard to overstate the impact the ECHR has had on government decisions’, placing ‘substantial’ limitations on government policies to do with immigration, veterans’ rights, benefits, and reforms to sentencing and protest laws. Read Rosalind English’s summary of the Report here: The UK can, and should leave the Human Rights Convention (7 October 2025).

In International News:

A ceasefire has been agreed for the war in Gaza. The deal, brokered by the US, provides for a cessation in the conflict between Israel and Hamas which has been ongoing since 2023. The full text of the deal — entitled ‘Implementation steps for President Trump’s proposal for a comprehensive end of Gaza War’ — has not been publicised, though parts have been published by Israeli media. Trump’s 20-point plan, announced last week, provided for Gaza to be a ‘deradicalised terror-free zone’ which will be ‘redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza’; all hostages will be released, and full aid will be sent to the Gaza Strip.

In the Courts:

An asylum seeker unsuccessfully challenged the housing and financial support given to him by Enfield Council. In R (on the application of BLV) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2025] EWHC 2516 (Admin), the Claimant was a disabled man suffering from deafness, impaired eyesight, and major depressive and anxiety disorders. The Defendant was obliged, under the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, to provide ‘adequate’ accommodation and other ‘essentially living needs’ to the Claimant; under the Equality Act 2010 and Human Rights Act 1998, it was also bound to adjust its general approach to providing support under the IAA 1999 to account for the Claimant’s specific disabilities. The Defendant contended that Enfield’s support was inadequate for two reasons:

His accommodation was inadequate, because it was too far away from his support network and did not have a suitable disabled lift;

His internet access was inadequate, because it was not sufficient for him to access mental health and other support services via video-call (his deafness made it impossible to rely on voice call alone).

The court applied the ‘twin-track’ test, namely: 1) whether the Secretary of State met an objective ‘minimum standard’ for ‘ensur[ing] full respect for human dignity and a dignified standard of living, maintain[ing] an adequate standard of health and meet[ing] the subsistence needs of the asylum seeker’; 2) even if the minimum standard has been met, whether the Secretary of State complied with public law standards including rationality. The court found that (stage 1) the Claimant’s accommodation did meet the minimum standard. Furthermore, (stage 2) the Defendant’s treatment of the Claimant did not violate its duties under the EA 2010, HRA 1998, or other public law principles.

An interesting aspect of this case was that internet video calling was deemed capable of being an ‘essential living need’ because of the Claimant’s disabilities. The court ruled that ‘the concept of ‘need’ is…affected by technological progress and consequent changes in societal expectations’, and that ‘internet-based communication… has become essential for interacting with other people and accessing public services.’",https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.png,N,,2025-10-13 10:57:29.726233

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — HOSTAGE AND PRISONER RELEASES

All 20 of the remaining living hostages in Gaza have returned to Israel this morning. They have been brought to the Re’im military facility in southern Israel to undergo initial medical screenings. Oren Liebermann reports for CNN.

Buses carrying Palestinian prisoners released by Israel arrived in Ramallah in the West Bank today. These are the first of nearly 2,000 detained Palestinians expected to be freed in the coming hours. David M. Halbfinger, Aaron Boxerman, Natan Odenheimer, Isabel Kershner, Adam Rasgon, and David E. Sanger report for the New York Times.

Israel has not included Marwan Barghouti, a popular and potentially unifying Palestinian leader, in the list of around 250 prisoners to be released from Israel. Senior Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouk told Al Jazeera that the group that Hamas insists on the release of Barghouti, and other figures, and that it was in discussion with mediators. Lee Keath, Julia Frankel, and Jalal Bwaital report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — HUMANITARIAN RESPONSE

The first aid trucks since the ceasefire began arrived in Gaza yesterday. A spokesperson for the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said that supplies of cooking gas had entered Gaza for the first time since March. The easing of restrictions has allowed the agency to deliver medical and emergency supplies where they are most needed, OCHA added. BBC News reports.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not travel to Egypt today for a summit on ending the war in Gaza due to the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, according to a statement from his office. This statement came following an announcement by Egypt’s presidency and a White House official that Netanyahu would be attending. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas will be attending the summit. Wafaa Shurafa, Samy Magdy, and Melanie Lidman report for AP News; Eyad Kourdi, Kevin Liptak, Tal Shalev, and Kaitlan Collins report for CNN.

“Only by embracing the opportunities of this moment can we achieve our goal of ensuring that the horrors of recent years will never happen again,” Trump told the Knesset today during his speech, adding that “the long and painful nightmare is finally over.” Two members of the Knesset held up signs that said “Recognize Palestine” as Trump spoke, according to a Knesset spokesperson. As the two were escorted out of the room, other members of the Knesset began chanting “Trump! Trump!” Trump was still speaking to the Knesset at time of writing. CNN reports; NBC News reports.

Egyptian and Qatari mediators told Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya that Trump’s deal was his last chance to end the war, following Al-Hayya’s immediate reaction to refuse the deal, according to officials. The sources said that Turkey warned him that Turkey and Qatar would remove all diplomatic and political cover if Hamas did not agree to the deal. Jared Maslin and Summer Said reports for the Wall Street Journal.

Fighting between Hamas Security forces and armed members of the Dughmush family in Gaza City over the weekend killed at least 27 people. The Hamas-run interior ministry said that eight Hamas members were killed in “an armed assault by a militia.” Medical sources said that 19 Dughmush clan members had been killed. Both sides accused the other of triggering the clashes. Hamas has recalled about 7,000 members of its security forces to assert control over areas of Gaza vacated by Israeli troops, according to sources. Rushdi Abualouf reports for BBC News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

U.S. intelligence shared with Kyiv has enabled Ukraine’s strikes on Russian energy assets, including oil refineries far beyond the frontline, according to Ukrainian sources and U.S. officials. Officials said that the United States has been helping Ukraine mount these long-range strikes for months, in an attempt to weaken Russia’s economy and force them to negotiate. Christopher Miller, Amy Mackinnon, and Max Seddon report for the Financial Times.

Trump said that he had spoken with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy yesterday on the phone about Ukraine obtaining long-range Tomahawk missiles. Trump told reporters during his flight to Israel that before he agrees, he “might speak to Russia about that, in all fairness,” because it would be a “step up” in the war. Megan Messerly reports for POLITICO.

First Lady Melania Trump said on Friday that she has had an “open channel of communication regarding the welfare of children” with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the last three months. The First Lady claimed that eight Ukrainian children had been reunited with their families in the past 24 hours due to the initiative, adding that both sides had “agreed to cooperate with each other for the benefit of all the people involved.” Sophia Cai and Diana Nerozzi report for POLITICO.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

The Rapid Support Forces paramilitary has killed at least 57 people and wounded 43 others in a series of drone and artillery strikes on the besieged Sudanese city of El-Fasher overnight into Saturday, according to local medics and aid groups. The Sudan Doctors Network medical advocacy group said the attack targeted a shelter for displaced people and was a violation of international law. The RSF denied that civilians were killed as a result of its strikes. Pranav Baskar reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

A spokesperson for Afghanistan’s Taliban government yesterday claimed that Afghan forces had killed 58 Pakistani soldiers in “retaliatory” border operations overnight into Sunday. The Pakistani army disputed the figure, stating that 23 of its armed forces’ members had died and that “200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralized.” The Taliban have accused Pakistan of violating Afghan airspace and bombing a market in eastern Afghanistan last Thursday. Pakistan did not claim responsibility for the alleged assault. Carrie Davies, Stuart Lau, and Ethirajan Anbarasan report for BBC News; Riaz Khan reports for AP News.

French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu late yesterday announced his new government, two days after French President Emmanuel Macron re-appointed Lecornu as France’s Prime Minister on Friday. Lecornu resigned from the premiership last Monday after his coalition partners’ pushback to his first attempt at forming a government last week. Giorgio Leali reports for POLITICO; Noemie Bisserbe and Sam Schechner report for the Wall Street Journal.

Qatar and other Arab states have expanded security cooperation with the Israeli military over the past three years, according to leaked U.S. documents. The documents show that in May 2024, senior Israeli and Arab military officials convened at al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar to discuss the threat posed by Iran.
