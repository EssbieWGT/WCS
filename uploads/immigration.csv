Rae Lindenberg, a resident, shouted against the agents’ presence, urging them to leave the neighborhood. The agents arrived in Lakeview to apprehend a construction worker, prompting protests from locals like Courtney Conway, who felt the agents were creating fear and turmoil in their community.

Since the start of President Trump’s immigration crackdown in September, Chicago’s neighborhoods have banded together to resist enforcement, using social media to share information about the agents’ movements. This community effort has helped slow down the agents, and in some cases, forced them to retreat. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the professionalism of their officers amid the unrest.

In response to increased arrests, tens of thousands of residents are actively tracking immigration agents in real-time via online groups, sharing details such as vehicle information and targeted neighborhoods. Protesters often follow the agents, sounding horns and whistles to alert others. However, confrontations have escalated, leading to instances where agents have used tear gas, Tasers, and even firearms, resulting in injuries and at least one fatality.

U. S. District Judge Sara Ellis has mandated that agents use body cameras and provide warnings before using tear gas. Local communities are taking protective measures, such as parents standing guard at schools and residents locking their doors. In Little Village, a Latino neighborhood, residents organized to block ICE and Border Patrol vehicles. Community leaders like Baltazar Enriquez have celebrated these actions as community defense against immigration enforcement.

Additionally, some protesters are monitoring for Black Hawk helicopters used by authorities, further indicating potential raids. One resident, Brian Kolp, recounted a chaotic scene where agents attempted to arrest a worker and a protester, leading to a rapid response from local residents.

On Oct. 28, Wilmette residents pleaded with village officials to act swiftly — two days later ICE agents were confirmed operating in the area.","Marci Sahinoglu has spent the past decade living in Skokie as a criminal defense lawyer for the Illinois Attorney General’s Office, regularly defending state police officers in federal court against allegations of unlawful arrests and unlawful seizures.

After learning one of her neighbors in the Fairview neighborhood was “abducted” on Oct. 17 in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation, Sahinoglu came to a recent Village Board meeting to say it doesn’t take an expert to recognize what ICE is doing is wrong.

“My heart is broken. It shouldn’t feel any different when it’s the guy who cuts the lawn in the neighborhood next to you who’s taken, versus the neighbor who you’ve had dinner with and whose kid has jumped on your trampoline, but somehow it does feel different when it’s literally closer to home,” Sahinoglu said. “And those of us with privilege have an obligation to speak up.”

Sahinoglu was one of several people who stood before Skokie trustees on Oct. 21 to express their rising concern about ICE’s local activity and demand village officials’ take stronger action against the federal government’s operations.

Trustees voted unanimously in March to update Section 58 of its code, reaffirming, among other things, that village staff cannot provide information about individuals in custody to immigration detainers or provide them access to village facilities without a criminal warrant.

But Skokie’s interim corporation counsel Barbara Mangler clarified that the Village does not have jurisdiction to enforce that ordinance when ICE operations occur on property owned by other municipalities, like the Skokie Public Library and local school districts.

The agenda for the Village Board’s next meeting on Nov. 3 shows that trustees will discuss a recommendation from staff to add more language to its code that “strengthens and clarifies restrictions on Village-owned property for civil immigration enforcement.”

Prior to the public session, The Record checked in with Skokie’s public agencies to gain insight on the scope of ICE’s operations in Skokie and what measures they are taking in response.

Multiple agencies told The Record that immigration agents have apprehended Skokie residents. Residents have also testified in public settings about local ICE detainments.

Mayor Ann Tennes addressed the community on Halloween, Friday, Oct. 31, when immigration operations were confirmed in Evanston, Skokie, Wilmette and other surrounding communities.

“Today’s been a hard day in our community,” she said. “There’s been an enhanced presence of federal immigration enforcement. … This has been terribly distressing, difficult and frightening.

“Skokie is a community of immigrants, and we’re also a community that supports one another. Time and again we step up and stand together.”

ICE, however, in an email to The Record on Oct. 31 denied that its agents have made any arrests in Skokie.

“No ICE arrests have occurred in Skokie during Operation Midway Blitz,” ICE Communications Director Tanya Roman wrote.

‘We help anybody’

The Village Board first passed an ordinance in 2017 that prohibited village staff from collecting individuals’ immigration status, engaging in immigration action without a criminal warrant and refusing village services based on a person’s immigration status.

Amanda Sabri, a social worker in Skokie’s Department of Health and Human Services, said the mayor and village manager tasked the Human Relations Commission in July with outlining the rights that ordinance enshrines and other resources that may be helpful for local immigrants.

That information, which the commissionfinalized into a flyer in October, is now published online and was distributed to residents, area school districts and service groups like the Early Childhood Alliance, said Michael Charley, Skokie’s director of Health and Human Services.

The village’s health department does provide residents with legal, food and rental assistance, and staff have connected the local business community with training from local groups like the Illinois Workers in Action about what to do if ICE visits their business, Charley said.

Moving forward, Sabri said the Human Relations Commission’s Community Engagement Subcommittee will work on programming that focuses on “social cohesion” to help make the local immigrant community feel welcomed and connected to Skokie.

“In general, the Village just wants to reaffirm our long-standing commitment of inclusion, dignity and respect for all,” Charley said.

“Our board stands behind that and as ICE activity started I think the Village Board wanted to not only remind but just reassure Skokie’s public that we have our own Chapter 58 of the village code that says it doesn’t matter what your immigrant status is, we help anybody in the community.”

The library, parks and schools

The Skokie Park District “is following the Village of Skokie’s policy” regarding ICE operations and has had no reports of ICE personnel on park property, said Jim Bottorff, the Skokie Park District’s director of communications, in an email.

Jane Hanna, the Skokie Public Library’s communications manager, said its existing policies prevent staff from sharing information about patrons without a subpoena, and its security team are within their rights to intervene if there is a disruption to the safe, appropriate use of the library

The library parking lot and building, however, are public property, which means “there’s little the library can do in terms of preventing ICE from coming in,” Hanna said.

“That being said, our staff have received guidance from our administration on how to respond if there are ICE agents on the property and one of the core values of librarianship is protecting patron privacy, so we are definitely committed to that,” Hanna said.

Ruth Sinker, communication manager for Skokie School District 73.5, said she is only aware of one family in the district who has had a member detained by ICE so far.

The district recently sent an update to parents outlining how staff will respond if ICE comes to a D73.5 building. The response includes asking for a signed judicial warrant to protect the disclosure of a student’s citizenship status without proper authorization.

Takumi Iseda, director of communications for Niles Township High School District 219 (Niles West, North and Central high schools), said there have been no confirmed reports of ICE on campus, but school staff have received updated information on procedures and federal laws to follow related to immigrant rights.

‘Enormous financial and emotional stress’

Both D219 and D73.5 have intergovernmental agreements with Niles Township. The two school districts administer funds to the government entity to support the social programs, like childcare services or rental assistance, that the township provides to qualifying families.

Bonnie Kahn Ognisanti, Niles Township’s supervisor, said the state limits who can receive assistance. The office can provide emergency eviction prevention to people with refugee status, a demographic that reportedly accounts for about a third of the township’s cases.

But since ICE has operated in Skokie and the surrounding communities, Ognisanti said the township has utilized more “flexible” funding sources, like intergovernmental agreements, to provide wrap-around services to local families struggling after a breadwinner was detained.

“We’ve helped people with immigration issues (before), but never because ICE was involved — never,” Ognisanti said, noting that the kind of stress her team is seeing since ICE’s Operation Midway Blitz began in September is new.

“We were never needing to help a family because a loved one was detained and removed, creating just enormous emotional and financial stress on that family and the community that surrounds the family and cares about them,” Ognisanti said.

The township is typically connected with families impacted by ICE via referrals from other social workers or even grassroots organizations. While Ognisanti said her office has helped Skokie families who have had a member detained by ICE, she declined to share how many.

Committed to creating a safe place that will always puts the needs of everyone in its community first, Ognisanti said her office is careful not take any actions that could potentially identify or endanger its users, many of whom are afraid to get help for fear of detainment.

To that end, the office doesn’t keep a list of those impacted by ICE. For a Know Your Rights workshop the township is helping facilitate with the North Shore Legal Aid Clinic, Ognisanti had attendees sign up using their initials only.

Ruth Orme-Johnson, director of social services at the township, said she would like to see ICE call off their immigration blitz so the community can return to a sense of “normalcy and safety.”

“So many of the people who are picked up (by ICE) are folks who have lived here for decades, people with small businesses, people who have owned houses and had multiple generations,” Orme-Johnson said. “It’s just incredibly corrosive to the social fabric for some of these immigrant communities, and therefore, for all of us.”

‘Make it crystal clear’

On Oct. 21, Skokie resident Kimberly Polka placed her phone underneath an overhead projector in the Skokie council chambers to show trustees a recent confrontation in Evanston she filmed between herself and an ICE agent.

Polka said the agent confronted her when she saw them near an unattended landscaping truck. She urged the Skokie Village Board not to allow federal agents to use village-owned property to detain members of the community, emphasizing that “silence is complicity.”

“Please make it crystal clear that ICE is not permitted to use our village property in their campaign of cruelty and terror,” Polka said. “November 3 is too long; Will County has done it. Evanston has done it — Chicago, Cook County, Lake County. We are behind the ball.”

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order on Oct. 6 prohibiting ICE from using city-owned properties and requiring spaces that may be used for immigration federal enforcement operations to be identified with clear signage.

The Cook County Board, Lake County Board, City of Evanston have all since followed suit, approving similar measures in October. On Oct. 28, Wilmette residents pleaded with village officials to act swiftly — two days later ICE agents were confirmed operating in the area.

As Skokie’s Human Relations Chapter already forbids staff from assisting with immigration enforcement by providing access to village facilities, it remains to be seen what more language trustees can add to its code that will ensure local residents feel more safe and secure from ICE operations.

“I should not have to hesitate before asking my children’s 70-year-old Mexican grandparents to take them to the library or around the corner to the park or run an errand because I worry about them being stopped, questioned, or even worse, detained simply based on the color of their skin,” said Kristina Fleck, another Skokie resident, on Oct. 21.

“That is not the definition of safe access to our services,” Fleck said.

,Agencies,2025-11-02 15:03:11+00:00,CNN,They were arrested at an ICE protest outside of Chicago. Here's what happened next. | CNN,Nicquel Terry Ellis,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/02/us/ice-protest-arrests-illinois,"Lee has protested at the Broadview ICE facility on several recent Fridays, taking issue with how ICE is picking up allegedly undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, and how federal agents are deploying tear gas during protests in neighborhoods.
To voice his frustrations, Mills, 37, of Chicago, has become a weekly demonstrator at the Broadview ICE facility.
So it may have surprised acquaintances that for two weeks, he faced a felony charge of assaulting a federal officer at a protest at the ICE facility in Broadview.
Ivery walked from his home in Oak Park to the Broadview ICE facility on September 27 to join the demonstrations, family spokesperson Scott Sakiwama said.
Ivery was temporarily held at the Broadview ICE facility on the day of his arrest and transferred to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago that evening, Sakiwama said.","As demonstrations outside an immigration enforcement facility near Chicago have ramped up over the past couple of months, so has the number of protesters being led away in restraints and facing a court date.

Since September, protesters have rallied weekly outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview against President Donald Trump’s intensified immigration enforcement campaign in Chicago.

Early on, federal agents guarding the building deployed tear gas and shot pepper balls in clashes with protesters and arrested some of them, including some charged with felonies on suspicion of assaulting or blocking officers.

But by early October, state, county and local law enforcement officers took a larger role in policing the protests at the facility. These agencies have made 68 arrests in connection with Broadview protests since October 3, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said on October 28.

The arrests sometimes expose a tension between demonstrators’ desire to exercise their constitutional free speech rights and the intention of authorities – who say some protesters have resisted their attempts to keep paths to the building clear – to let ICE agents and others travel safely to and from the facility.

CNN talked to some arrested demonstrators or, in one case, a protester’s representative, to ask about their experiences in getting arrested on accusations ranging from petty to felony offenses. Here are their stories.

Chicago woman held for hours after a crowd scuffle with police

A’Keisha Lee was standing and chanting with a crowd of protesters near the Broadview ICE facility on October 17 when she saw a swarm of police officers hop out of police vans wearing helmets and carrying batons, she said.

“I was sickened,” the 30-year-old Chicago resident recalled. “And I remember feeling really scared.”

The officers walked toward her and the other demonstrators in a “militarized fashion” and began pushing them back, she said. Video of the encounter shows Lee at the front of the crowd when officers with Illinois State Police patches on their sleeves pushed in an apparent attempt to clear them from a paved area, and some demonstrators tried to hold their ground.

Chaos ensued. There was yelling, people falling, and some who appeared to get hurt in the scuffle, Lee said.

She was hit in the face with a baton, and wasn’t sure whether the strike was intentional, she recounted. She’d later discover a bruise on her face.

Lee fell to the ground, and officers helped her up, according to Lee and the video, which was distributed by Reuters. An officer then detained her, putting zip ties around her wrists, she said; that moment is not shown in the Reuters video. Lee couldn’t understand why she was being arrested.

“I was asking them to let me go,” Lee said, “and reinforcing that I hadn’t did anything I wasn’t allowed to do.”

She was escorted to a curb to sit, and moments later placed in a police vehicle that took her to the Broadview Police Department. Lee’s mind raced as she rode in the police car. She worried about going to jail and whether the conditions would be clean and safe. She also worried about whether she’d be treated differently as a Black woman in the legal system.

At the police station, she was booked, fingerprinted, photographed, and placed in a holding cell with other female protesters for about five hours before being released.

Illinois State Police had arrested her on two Class A misdemeanor counts of resisting a police officer – punishable by up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 – Cook County court records show. She also was cited on suspicion of disobeying a police officer, a petty offense that carries a fine. Her court appearance is scheduled for November 25.

The court documents do not offer details about what led to the arrest, but Lee denies resisting and says it was never made clear to her how she was disobeying police.

“From my understanding, it was in my rights to be there,” she said.

Illinois State Police did not directly answer CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including Lee’s assertion that she did nothing wrong or why officers pushed back this crowd. However, they did issue a statement generally addressing the approach of the state, county and local officers who’ve been policing the protests since early October – a group they call the “Unified Command.”

These officers in Broadview “give loud, clear, consistent, and repeated directions and commands to crowds and provide individuals numerous opportunities to comply with the law,” state police said.

“It’s important to note that since the establishment of the Unified Command, there have been no violent confrontations between ICE and protesters in Broadview involving the use of chemical agents, which is a significant departure from operations prior to their presence,” the statement reads.

Lee has protested at the Broadview ICE facility on several recent Fridays, taking issue with how ICE is picking up allegedly undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, and how federal agents are deploying tear gas during protests in neighborhoods.

“I think how this country has treated immigrants is one of our original transgressions,” Lee said. “And this is the first tester for what we will allow as a people.”

Lee, who works for a local nonprofit, worries about the fate of her court case; however, she stands by her decision to protest.

“There’s always a fear of being treated like an example when these things happen,” Lee said. “But I do believe that I did not break the law.”

He was arrested while trying to enter the ICE facility

Sean Mills says he is not happy about how immigrants have been treated since the Trump administration started aggressively cracking down on illegal immigration earlier this year.

To voice his frustrations, Mills, 37, of Chicago, has become a weekly demonstrator at the Broadview ICE facility. He shows up every Friday and Saturday – sometimes wearing an American flag draped around his shoulders – and joins other protesters outside the facility.

But on October 17, Mills was arrested for the first time in his life, he said, after he tried to enter the building. Mills had become increasingly concerned with claims by local activists that the facility’s conditions were inhumane. So, Mills wanted to view the building’s interior himself.

“I just had the urge to walk over and test my luck,” Mills said. “I walked over to see if I could investigate as a citizen and enter the facility to ask questions and document.”

Officers surrounded Mills near the facility’s entrance, and one told him he was not allowed inside, Mills said. That same officer told Mills to “go back immediately” or be arrested, according to Mills.

“I tried to explain myself a little bit further,” Mills said, adding he told the officers he was a concerned citizen who wanted to go inside. “And I think about five or 10 seconds later, he (the officer) said ‘OK, you’re under arrest.’”

Mills was shocked because he didn’t believe he had done anything wrong. He also felt the officers had not given him enough time to explain himself before restraining his hands with what he believes were zip ties.

Three other protesters who also were trying to enter the building were arrested, he recalled.

“I think it’s just an over-policing example, because I walked up there with my hands out to my side, declared myself very openly, and said I’d like to enter the facility,” Mills said. “One hundred percent it was just to show an example of us.”

Mills was escorted to a nearby curb, where he waited roughly 10 minutes for a police van that took him to the Broadview police station, where he was processed and given a citation, he recounted.

Illinois State Police cited him on suspicion of disobeying a police officer – a petty offense punishable by a fine – Cook County court records show, and is scheduled to appear in court November 25.

The court documents do not offer a narrative of the arrest. State police did not directly respond to CNN’s questions about this specific incident, including about Mills’ claim that he did nothing wrong. Instead, they provided the same general statement they gave for Lee’s arrest.

Mills has no regrets protesting and getting arrested because he’s standing up for his beliefs.

“It’s a shame that us peaceful protesters are being targeted instead of being encouraged to exercise our First Amendment rights,” Mills said.

Mills objects to law enforcement officers being able to stop and ask people about their immigration status based at least in part on their apparent ethnicity. A US Supreme Court ruling in a California case last month appeared to clear the way for a person’s ethnicity to be a factor behind immigration stops by law enforcement.

Mills also does not support ICE’s roundups throughout Chicago of people accused of being in the country illegally.

“We are doing the least that we can do to keep our neighbors safe, which is so important to us right now,” Mills said.

School cafeteria worker tackled after threatening agents, authorities say

Paul Ivery is a Chicago-area man with an intellectual disability who works at a high school cafeteria and admires and respects the police and first responders in his community – even saluting officers when he passes them – people who know him say.

So it may have surprised acquaintances that for two weeks, he faced a felony charge of assaulting a federal officer at a protest at the ICE facility in Broadview.

The case would draw numerous supporters, including his own mayor, to one of Ivery’s court hearings in an attempt to persuade a judge he wasn’t a threat. Ivery declined to be interviewed for this story, but a family representative, court filings and bystander video help chronicle a case that the government wanted prosecuted one moment but dismissed the next.

Ivery walked from his home in Oak Park to the Broadview ICE facility on September 27 to join the demonstrations, family spokesperson Scott Sakiwama said.

Ivery would later tell investigators he was there to “protest against ICE” because he believed that “ICE agents were disrespectful towards the Broadview Police Department and veterans,” a criminal complaint filed against Ivery in federal court said, without elaborating on his motivation.

Ivery was also upset that federal agents had been deploying tear gas and shooting pepper balls at protesters at Broadview, according to Sakiwama.

At some point during the protest, Ivery approached a US Border Patrol agent and shouted something at him, according to the complaint. While the agent couldn’t recall what was said, Ivery would admit to investigators later that he said, “I’ll (expletive) kill you right now,” and, “do something,” according to the document.

After the shout, Ivery ran and jumped on top of an occupied vehicle as agents chased him, the complaint says.

Video from a bystander shows Ivery jumping off the vehicle, and an agent tackling him as he hits the pavement. Ivery yells as several agents restrain him. Nearby, other agents fire chemical irritants into the ground to keep bystanders away, appearing to cause some people to cough, the video shows.

An onlooker asks Ivery for his name. Ivery yells it and says, “Help me!” Minutes later, after agents tied his hands behind his back and sat him up, an agent helps Ivery drink from a water bottle. Ivery is eventually pulled to his feet and led into the back of an unmarked vehicle.

The complaint alleges that as agents were restraining Ivery, he grabbed an agent’s helmet and pulled it down, hurting the agent’s chin and exposing the agent to pepper spray.

Ivery was arrested and charged in federal court with felony assault on a federal officer, according to court documents.

Ivery was temporarily held at the Broadview ICE facility on the day of his arrest and transferred to the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago that evening, Sakiwama said.

Ivery was held for several days. But by October 1, prosecutors asked to have him released from jail and put on house arrest pending trial, acknowledging his disability, CNN affiliate WLS-TV reported.

At a hearing that day, a judge released Ivery on his own recognizance. Many of Ivery’s supporters, including Oak Park Mayor Vicki Scaman, were there to back him, according to WLS.

In a letter to the judge, Scaman said Ivery is a “valued member of our community” who stops and salutes police when he sees them on the street. She wrote that Ivery is not a threat to the community, and she hoped the judge would consider Ivery’s “special needs diagnosis.”

On October 9, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charge altogether, and the judge ordered the dismissal the next day. The court records did not say why the case was dismissed.

The US attorney’s office for Illinois’ northern district did not respond to CNN’s request for information about the dismissal. Ivery’s court-appointed attorney declined to be interviewed about the specifics of the case.

“I am happy for Mr. Ivery and the just resolution of his case and hope that others who are also having their First Amendment rights trampled by the government receive justice as well,” Ivery’s attorney and federal public defender Johanathan Brooks said in an email to CNN.

,Policy,2025-11-02 14:15:58+00:00,NBC News,Poll: Frustration with Trump gives Democrats an opening a year before the midterms,"Ben Kamisar, Bridget Bowman",,,,,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/poll-frustration-trump-gives-democrats-opening-year-midterms-rcna240551,"This poll was conducted Oct. 24-28, with a majority of respondents (52%) blaming Trump and congressional Republicans for the monthslong government shutdown — but historically high numbers blaming congressional Democrats, too (42%).
That 7-point enthusiasm edge in the survey is on par with the 9-point enthusiasm edge Democrats enjoyed in the 2018 midterms.
Thirty-nine percent of registered voters view ICE positively and 50% view it negatively.
White voters are split in their view of ICE, while two-thirds of Black and Hispanic voters view the agency negatively.
And it’s pretty clear that Americans are not taking them for granted these days, and that’s true for whether they’re Republicans, Democrats or independents,” said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.","Democrats have an early lead in next year’s battle for control of Congress amid an ongoing government shutdown, as more voters say President Donald Trump has not lived up to their expectations on several major issues that propelled him back to the White House in 2024, according to a new national NBC News poll.

Around two-thirds of registered voters say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy and the cost of living, and a majority say he’s fallen short on changing business as usual in Washington. At the same time, the Democratic Party continues to suffer from low ratings from voters as it seeks to offer an alternative.

Meanwhile, the issue of protecting democracy and constitutional rights are top issues to voters, alongside costs, as Trump continues an expansive agenda of executive actions on immigration and other key policy areas. And a majority of voters believe he’s done more to undermine the Constitution than defend it.

The president’s overall approval rating in the survey sits at 43%, a 4-point decrease since March, while 55% disapprove of his job performance.

And one year before the 2026 midterm elections, Democrats lead Republicans in the fight for Congress by 8 points, 50%-42%, the largest lead for either party on the congressional ballot in the NBC News poll since the 2018 midterms. Democrats had a negligible 1-point edge, 48%-47%, in the March survey.

“We will learn a lot in just a few days’ time in New Jersey and Virginia, among other elections, and what impact these results may have on the government shutdown,” said Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the poll along with the Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies.

“What we know is that this is an electorate that remains deeply unhappy with the status quo,” Horwitt said.

Democrats’ lead on the congressional ballot is among the larger advantages they have enjoyed in any public polling in 2025. This poll was conducted Oct. 24-28, with a majority of respondents (52%) blaming Trump and congressional Republicans for the monthslong government shutdown — but historically high numbers blaming congressional Democrats, too (42%).

One key question that has arisen during past government shutdowns is whether the politics of the moment persist throughout an election cycle, once a funding impasse has been resolved.

Shutdowns can produce “unstable” moments in politics, McInturff said. “And in our experience, they tend to fade away,” he continued.

A majority of voters still have negative views of the Democratic Party, and just 28% say they have positive views, essentially unchanged from a record-low rating in March. And Republicans retain strong advantages with voters on key issues including border security and crime, though Democrats have caught up on the economy.

Voters, particularly Democrats, are also fired up about the next election. Asked to rate their interest in the 2026 elections on a 10-point scale, 66% of voters responded “9” or “10” — higher interest one year out than voters registered in the weeks preceding four of the five recent midterm elections.

For Democrats, 74% rate their interest at “9” or “10,” while 67% of Republicans and 50% of independents say the same. That 7-point enthusiasm edge in the survey is on par with the 9-point enthusiasm edge Democrats enjoyed in the 2018 midterms.

All together, it’s clear Trump is shaping up to be a major factor in next year’s midterm elections, with 70% saying they want their vote to send a message about support for or opposition to the president — the highest number in NBC News polling dating back nearly 30 years. A plurality of voters (40%) say they want their vote to send a signal of opposition to Trump, while 30% say they want to send a signal of support for Trump.

The high election interest and focus on Trump also come as millions of Americans have participated in “No Kings” protests against the Trump administration. In this survey, 43% say they consider themselves supporters of the No Kings protest movement — with the group largely composed of Democrats but also including around 4 in 10 independents.

Economic warning signs

Speaking on NBC News’ “Meet the Press” last December, before he took office, Trump distilled his 2024 victory down to two key factors: “I won on the border, and I won on groceries.”

The new poll numbers show some warning signs for the president on both issues, especially the economy — as well as on a top voter issue of protecting democracy and constitutional rights, too.

On economic issues, sizable majorities of registered voters say Trump and his administration have fallen short of their expectations on the cost of living (66%), looking out for the middle class (65%) and the economy (63%), with approximately one-third saying he has lived up to their expectations.

Majorities of independents, as well as voters across ethnicities, age groups and economic circumstances, all say the Trump administration has fallen short on the economy. A chunk of Republicans also agree, concentrated among those who don’t view themselves as “MAGA Republicans.”

The October 2025 results mirror NBC News’ polling in August 2010, months before midterm elections that were seen as a repudiation of President Barack Obama. At that time, two-thirds of Americans said Obama and his administration had fallen short of their expectations on the economy, as the country struggled through the aftermath of the Great Recession.

Today, 61% say that their family’s income is falling behind the cost of living, while 31% say it’s staying even and only 6% say it’s going up faster than the cost of living — about in line with NBC News polling from the last four years.

How the parties handle different issues

The poll also found voters essentially split on the question of whether Democrats or Republicans would do a better job handling the economy, with 38% backing Republicans and 37% backing Democrats.

That’s the smallest lead Republicans have had on this question in NBC News polling since December 2017, which was the last time Democrats registered an advantage. In September 2023, around the same period in the last election cycle, Republicans had a 21-point edge.

Republicans posted sizable leads on three core issues: border security (a 31-point edge over Democrats), crime (+22 points) and immigration (+18 points), maintaining key advantages they’ve enjoyed in recent elections.

Democrats have an 8-point edge on protecting constitutional rights and an 11-point edge on protecting democracy. That’s a turnaround from 2023, when Republicans had an 8-point lead on the issue of protecting constitutional rights and a 1-point edge on democracy.

And Democrats’ 23-point lead over Republicans on handling health care is tied for their highest mark on the issue since July 2008.

Divides on immigration

While Trump’s Republican Party enjoys significant advantages over Democrats on immigration-related issues, the president’s deportation program — and his administration’s tactics and use of executive power for that program and other goals — have sparked some public dissent.

A narrow majority, 51%, say that Trump has lived up to expectations on border security and immigration.

Yet 54% say that the Trump administration’s “deployment of federal agents and National Guard troops to various cities around the country to fight crime and immigration” are largely not justified, while 44% said that the deployments were justified.

The poll also tests voter sentiment about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, whose agents are on the front lines of the administration’s deportation program. Thirty-nine percent of registered voters view ICE positively and 50% view it negatively. White voters are split in their view of ICE, while two-thirds of Black and Hispanic voters view the agency negatively.

The share that feels positively about ICE is roughly in line with previous NBC News polls from 2020 and 2018. But the share with negative views has spiked, with those who view the agency “very” negatively nearly doubling since 2020, from 22% then to 40% now.

Constitutional rights and democracy

The issues of protecting constitutional rights and democracy also show up in the poll as top concerns among voters.

The survey asked respondents to rank their most important issues, offering other choices including overall cost of living, electricity and health care costs, political violence, immigration and border security and abortion.

About a quarter of voters said that protecting democracy or constitutional rights was the single most important issue in deciding their congressional vote next year. But costs also loomed large, with 16% choosing cost of living, 10% choosing the cost of health care premiums and 4% choosing the cost of electricity.

Another 10% said immigration and border security are their top issue, while 9% said dealing with political violence and 7% said abortion.

“The fundamentals of our country and democracy, the Constitution, normally these are theoretical things that people don’t think about and take for granted. And it’s pretty clear that Americans are not taking them for granted these days, and that’s true for whether they’re Republicans, Democrats or independents,” said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.

Fifty-two percent of voters said Trump has done more than previous presidents to undermine the U.S. Constitution than to protect it, while 31% say he’s done more to protect the Constitution.

Dim views of both parties

There are clear opportunities for Democrats in Trump’s polling struggles. But even as they hold leads over Republicans on the congressional ballot and on some key issues, the party’s overall standing hasn’t improved fromrecord lows.

Just 28% of registered voters say they have a positive view of the party, compared to 27% in March, while 53% view the party negatively. The Republican Party has higher marks: 37% view it positively and 46% view it negatively.

As in March, one big difference between the two parties — and one reason why the Democrats have lower marks overall — comes from how voters view their own parties.

Seventy-eight percent of Republicans say they view their party positively and just 8% say they view it negatively. But for Democrats, 59% view their party positively and 22% view it negatively.

Independents, meanwhile, have dim views of both parties, with less than a quarter of those voters holding positive views of either the Democratic or Republican parties.

Gaza peace efforts

The poll also tested views on one of Trump’s major foreign policy efforts: his attempts to broker peace in Gaza, where Israel and Hamas have spent two years at war.

Voters are split on Trump’s handling of the war in general: 47% approve, 48% disapprove. That’s a dramatic improvement from how voters judged then-President Joe Biden’s handling of the war, which was at 34% approval in November 2023 and 27% in April 2024.

But U.S. voters are deeply skeptical that Palestinians and Israelis will be able to form a lasting peace agreement. A previous ceasefire negotiated at the end of the Biden administration fell apart earlier this year, and Israel conducted strikes in Gaza soon after the poll concluded, with Israel and Hamas trading accusations of breaking the current ceasefire.

Just 21% say they think Palestinians and Israelis will form a lasting peace, while 69% say they won’t — as high as that number has been in five instances of this poll question stretching back to 1993. Another 10% are unsure.

When asked about whether U.S. troops should participate in any peacekeeping force in Gaza, 41% say they favor the use of those American boots on the ground while 54% disapprove.

Contrasting ICE with Border Patrol, McNulty said, “Their mode of operation, generally, is based on targeting.
Border Patrol is based on trying to stop anybody trying to cross the border.","Cameras rolling, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino sailed down the Chicago River in a convoy of government boats. His men held rifles as videographers filmed the stunt later posted to their social media.

The Trump administration had just launched an operation in the city to pursue “the worst of the worst” criminal undocumented immigrants. Homeland Security used the footage for a music video set to Alice in Chains’ “Rooster” ending with Bovino smiling into the distance.

In Chicago, the Sept. 25 moment was widely mocked. Would the federal government be hunting migrants at Navy Pier? Boarding boat tours to find undocumented architecture enthusiasts? Patrolling the Riverwalk?

But more than a month after Bovino and the crew of camouflaged agents he calls the “green machine” arrived in Chicago to assist Trump’s immigration crackdown dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, the scene signaled a profound shift in how the federal government arrests undocumented immigrants far from the border.

Instead of carefully targeted arrests long practiced by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, President Donald Trump’s administration has deployed roving groups of masked Border Patrol agents, who work within U.S. Customs and Border Protection. These agents have roamed throughout Chicago and its suburbs with the mission of arresting as many undocumented immigrants as possible, often while camera operators film for future government promotional videos.

Allegations have mounted that Border Patrol agents under Bovino’s command are indiscriminately throwing tear gas in Chicago neighborhoods and using inappropriate force against residents during protests over the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration enforcement push, leading to a federal judge requesting Bovino to debrief her daily on his agents’ actions.

“What we’re seeing now is what the rest of the nation can expect,” said Fred Tsao, senior policy counsel at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. “This is the new model.”

Since Bovino and his agents arrived, the number of arrests has risen sharply, but so have reports of excessive force and unlawful detentions, including of U.S. citizens. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday while speaking in Gary that agents have arrested 3,000 people in the operation, which began in early September.

While the agency’s actions have generated significant legal challenges for the government and public pushback from angry residents, the Trump administration is doubling down on the approach.

Trump is reassigning at least half the top leadership at Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices around the country in a major shake-up of the agency responsible for carrying out the president’s vision for mass deportations, The Associated Press reported.

The Trump administration’s move to sack ICE middle managers around the country and potentially replace some of them with Border Patrol officials suggests White House support for the aggressive mass deportation raids.

“This is one team, one fight,” said U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. “This operation is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago. ICE and Border Patrol have already arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members.”

Historically, ICE handles the government’s deportation efforts within the country’s interior while Border Patrol works along the border and ports of entry. While ICE has its own legacy of alleged human rights abuses and constitutional violations, its operations tend to be more targeted and focused, experts told the Tribune.

While ICE has its own legacy of alleged human rights abuses and constitutional violations, its operations tend to be more targeted and focused, experts told the Tribune.

Border Patrol by contrast is known for aggressive pursuits of immigrants far from the big-city spotlight, along the rural Mexican border, where drug cartels and harsh desert conditions generate danger — conditions that are in stark contrast to Chicago’s neighborhoods, where homes are adorned with Halloween decorations and schools hosting fall festivals.

The Border Patrol’s arrival in Chicago drew confusion from some residents who noted the city is hundreds of miles from Canada and more than 1,000 away from the Rio Grande. But McLaughlin says, “While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 air miles of the border, the legal framework provided by the Immigration and Nationality Act … and other laws allows them to operate anywhere in the United States.”

But unlike ICE’s once-targeted operations, Border Patrol’s arrests now appear arbitrary. Agents drive up and down residential streets and stop mostly brown people seemingly at random — landscapers, pedestrians, construction workers — demanding to know, “Where were you born?” or “Are you a U.S. citizen?”

Experts warn that this aggressive approach will likely fuel greater abuses of civil and human rights, heighten public anger and lead to more warrantless arrests, straying far from the previous stated focus on “the worst of the worst.”

For weeks, residents have reported the presence of heavily armed federal agents conducting high-profile sweeps across neighborhoods from Little Village to the western suburbs. Videos show officers in military-style gear confronting pedestrians, blocking intersections and deploying tear gas in confrontations spanning eight different neighborhoods.

Within the Department of Homeland Security, ICE and Border Patrol have a long-standing rivalry with different cultures and approaches around immigration enforcement, experts told the Tribune.

“I think of Border Patrol and ICE as two siblings that don’t always like each other,” said Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former top official at ICE.

Border Patrol historically has a far bigger budget and a bigger staff. ICE officers often wear suits and deal more with longer-term case management, while Border Patrol are uniformed officers who often patrol dark roads in the countryside along the border.

Contrasting ICE with Border Patrol, McNulty said, “Their mode of operation, generally, is based on targeting. Border Patrol is based on trying to stop anybody trying to cross the border. It’s just a wider-net approach.”

Katherine Hawkins, a legal analyst with the Project on Government Oversight, explained more differences between ICE and Border Patrol.

“ICE officers are very on board with deporting people, but they usually do it in a certain way where it’s focused on people who have come into contact with the criminal justice system,” Hawkins said. “It tends to be focused on going after particular individuals. They might stake out someone’s house.”

But that isn’t what the Trump administration wants, Hawkins said.

“I think they’ve realized that Border Patrol gives them extra manpower and probably less pushback when they’re told to just go round up everyone,” she said.

Trump campaigned for president on a platform pledging mass deportations of immigrants while restricting future influxes into the country. How to best implement his desire is a logistical challenge due to limited detention space, manpower and constitutional safeguards that slow down government officials’ wishes.

Scott Shuchart, a former high-ranking ICE official, said immigration enforcement has always focused on a debate over how to best use the government’s manpower.

“Are the resources going to be deployed to get people who are dangerous or are they going to be deployed to get the easiest people?” Shuchart said. “I think what we’re seeing is one side finally winning that argument.”

A recent Supreme Court decision allowing agents to take the ethnic background of a person into consideration in some circumstances has cleared the way for more aggressive patrolling, Shuchart said, referring to what some are calling “Kavanaugh stops.”

In September, the conservative majority on the Supreme Court lifted a restraining order from a judge who found that roving patrols were conducting indiscriminate stops in and around Los Angeles. The order had barred immigration agents from stopping people solely based on their race, language, job or location.

The majority did not explain its reasoning, as is typical on the court’s emergency docket. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the lower-court judge had gone too far in restricting how federal immigration agents can carry out brief stops for questioning, The Associated Press reported.

“A lot of what Border Patrol was doing was illegal until a couple months ago. It was racial profiling,” Shuchart said. “Then the Supreme Court decided racial profiling doesn’t count if they’re working-class Latinos.”

A significant part of the Trump administration’s approach to immigration revolves around using social media to claim undocumented immigrants are driving crime in big cities even though statistics show they are less likely to commit violent crimes than U.S. citizens.

Dan Herman, a former senior adviser to the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said much of the current approach favored by Bovino and the White House is more about sending a political message.

“What we are seeing is, when you put law enforcement in a role that is not what they’ve been trained or equipped or have the appropriate authorities for, you can have mistakes and improper behavior, unprofessional behavior,” Herman said. “It’s really about the theater of these things.”

Bovino himself is an example, Herman said.

In the first week of January, before Trump’s inauguration, Bovino sent 60 agents hundreds of miles to Bakersfield, California, to make 78 arrests at farms and businesses. His staff acknowledged congratulatory comments on social media and posted photos of an encounter with someone whose car window was shattered after refusing to open it, The Associated Press reported.

“He was trying to get the attention of the new administration and show he was interested in spectacle, not security,” Herman said. “I think the administration is trying to reward that attitude, and there’s a reason they’ve used him as their incident commander in these high-profile operations.”

Border Patrol’s presence has consequences far beyond the immigrants being targeted. Local restaurants and businesses in Latino areas and their neighboring communities are experiencing deep financial woes as customers stay home.

Chicago’s rapid-response volunteers, who monitor enforcement operations and document abuses, have become targets. Many have been arrested for recording agents, following agents or alerting people of federal agents in a neighborhood.

Residents have angrily confronted Border Patrol agents throughout the city in several confrontations, leading the feds to deploy tear gas in neighborhoods from working-class East Side to wealthy Lakeview.

“What immigration enforcement looks like now is not just arrests,” Tsao said. “It’s public intimidation.”

Tsao noted that U.S. citizens are not required to carry proof of citizenship, but many people of color have begun doing so anyway out of fear. “I know people who carry their passports everywhere or keep photos of them on their phones,” he said. “That’s what this climate has created.”

For Tsao and others, the concern extends beyond one city. “Chicago is showing the rest of the country what this new era of immigration enforcement looks like,” he said. “The border has come to the interior. The border has come to Chicago.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-L-border-patrol-chicago15_239722112.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-11-02 09:17:01.336159

Finucane was the War Powers Resolution lawyer at the State Department in the Obama and first Trump administrations.
In both cases, he said, the actions were considered hostilities activating the War Powers Resolution.
In the Sept. 4 notice, President Donald Trump said he was submitting it “to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution.” As the deadline approaches, there is no sign that the administration is curtailing its strikes.
On Friday, Warner and other leading Democrats who focus on national security demanded that the administration brief the full Senate on the strikes.","A top Justice Department lawyer has told lawmakers that the Trump administration can continue its lethal strikes against alleged drug traffickers in Latin America — and is not bound by a decades-old law requiring Congress to give approval for ongoing hostilities.

T. Elliot Gaiser, head of the Trump administration’s Office of Legal Counsel, made his remarks to a small group of lawmakers this week amid signs that the president may be planning to escalate the military campaign in the region, including potentially hitting targets within Venezuela.

The president needs lawmakers’ approval for sustained military action under the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which was passed in the wake of the Vietnam War to prevent another drawn-out, undeclared conflict.

A 60-day clock started ticking after the administration informed Congress on Sept. 4 that it had conducted a strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean two days earlier. It has followed that with other strikes and has killed dozens of people.

The 60-day window closes Monday, and until now it had been unclear what the administration would do.

Gaiser said the administration did not believe the strikes met the definition of hostilities under the law and did not intend to seek an extension of the deadline nor Congress’s approval of ongoing action, according to three people familiar with the matter, who, like others interviewed for this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

“The administration appears to be blowing through the 60-day limit,” a senior congressional aide said.

Asked for comment, a senior administration official said the War Powers Resolution did not pertain to the current situation, because, “even at its broadest … [it] has been understood to apply to placing U.S. service-members in harm’s way.”

The official said the administration does not believe U.S. troops are in danger in the ongoing operation, so the law did not apply. “The operation comprises precise strikes conducted largely by unmanned aerial vehicles launched from naval vessels in international waters at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,” the official said in an email.

In essence, the official said, “the kinetic operations underway do not rise to the level of ‘hostilities.’”

National security experts challenged the administration’s interpretation.

“What they’re saying is anytime the president uses drones or any standoff weapon against someone who cannot shoot back, it’s not hostilities‚” said Brian Finucane, a former legal adviser to the State Department who is now a senior adviser for the U.S. program at the International Crisis Group. “It’s a wild claim of executive authority.”

If the government ignores the Monday deadline, he said, “it is usurping Congress’s authority over the use of military force.” Under the Constitution, only Congress can declare war.

Finucane was the War Powers Resolution lawyer at the State Department in the Obama and first Trump administrations. During that time, standoff strikes were carried out on Houthis in Yemen in 2016, as well as against Syrian military facilities in 2017 and 2018 in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons against civilians. In both cases, he said, the actions were considered hostilities activating the War Powers Resolution.

Both Democratic and Republican administrations over the years have “used creative interpretations of the law to skirt the deadline,” Finucane said, but they were not targeting civilians who are not at war with the United States. “When the U.S. was bombing Libya in 2011, there was an armed conflict,” he said. “That’s not the case here.”

Finucane noted that by notifying Congress on Sept. 4 that it had conducted a strike on an alleged drug smugglers’ vessel, the administration appeared to have taken the position that the strike triggered the 1973 law and that Congress’s approval would be needed to continue action beyond 60 days.

In the Sept. 4 notice, President Donald Trump said he was submitting it “to keep the Congress fully informed, consistent with the War Powers Resolution.”

As the deadline approaches, there is no sign that the administration is curtailing its strikes. It has carried out more than a dozen strikes on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean, and has surged an array of military assets into the region.

The Navy has eight warships in the Caribbean, about 10 percent of its deployed fleet. That includes several destroyers and two amphibious ships. A submarine and a Special Operations vessel carrying helicopters also are in the region, and an aircraft carrier and several more destroyers are on the way. The military has flown helicopters and bombers close to Venezuela multiple times and moved F-35s and other aircraft to Puerto Rico.

Trump has said repeatedly that the boat strikes may expand to include targets on land, at times suggesting he may hit Venezuelan territory. “We are certainly looking at land now, because we’ve got the sea very well under control,” he said.

On Friday, however, when asked whether he was considering strikes within Venezuela, he told reporters, “No, it’s not true.”

The assertion that the administration is not bound by the War Powers Resolution or obliged to seek Congress’s permission to continue its campaign is consistent with Trump’s aggressive expansion of powers at the expense of the other two branches of government, observers said.

Separately, in a classified Office of Legal Counsel opinion, considered binding by the executive branch, the administration has argued that the strikes advance an important national interest and do not rise to the level of war under the Constitution and, therefore, do not require congressional approval, according to one U.S. official.

This week, top administration officials excluded senior Democrats when they briefed a handful of Republican senators who are considering whether to support a bipartisan measure that would block direct attacks on Venezuelan territory.

“In any normal administration, somebody would be fired for this kind of abuse,” Sen. Mark R. Warner (Virginia), the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a news conference.

On Friday, Warner and other leading Democrats who focus on national security demanded that the administration brief the full Senate on the strikes.

Sen. Roger Wicker (Mississippi), the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, joined in a rare bipartisan rebuke the same day. He and his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Jack Reed (Rhode Island), made public two letters they had sent to the Pentagon weeks before, requesting legal documents, attack orders and a list of targets. The Defense Department, they wrote, had exceeded the amount of time required by law to provide some of the materials.

House members were visibly frustrated after a separate classified briefing on Thursday, arguing that administration officials failed to answer basic questions about the legal basis and intelligence supporting the attacks. Pentagon lawyers had been scheduled to attend the meeting, multiple lawmakers said, but were abruptly pulled back without explanation.

“The administration is, I believe, doing an illegal act and anything that it can to avoid Congress,” said Rep. Gregory W. Meeks (New York), the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who attended the briefing.

Several lawmakers said Thursday that the Pentagon relayed that it did not need to know the identities of those being targeted in the attacks or whether those killed had been trafficking drugs.

“What they told us is they have to show a connection to a designated terrorist organization or their affiliate, and as long as they can show that connection, they believe they are authorized to strike,” Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Calif.) said in an interview.

But such connections could be as much as “three hops away” from a known drug trafficker, Jacobs told reporters after the briefing.

Lawmakers said the military official leading the House briefing, Rear Adm. Brian Bennett, rejected Democrats’ observation that the way the administration was selecting targets resembled “signature strikes.” That is a practice the CIA used for years in Afghanistan and Pakistan when it launched drone attacks on individuals or groups whose identities were unknown but who were targeted based on a pattern of behavior or other characteristics associated with terrorist activity.

Jacobs also said that the administration privately acknowledged that cocaine was the primary drug trafficked in this part of the world — contradicting Trump’s claims that the strikes are protecting U.S. citizens from the spread of fentanyl.

“They tried to make a very convoluted argument about why cocaine was facilitating drug trafficking,” she said. “It seems to me they don’t actually understand how fentanyl works.”

Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.) told reporters after the briefing that he warned the administration about its expansive use of military force.

“The last word that I gave to the admiral is I hope you recognize the constitutional peril that you are in, and the peril you are putting our troops in,” Moulton said.

According to the press release, when his father was naturalized and given sole custody, Souvannarath legally acquired U.S. citizenship.

Despite a federal court ruling recognizing Souvannarath’s claim to citizenship, he is now detained in Laos.

On Oct. 23, Chief Judge Shelly D. Dick of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana authorized a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from removing Souvannarath from the United States. Nevertheless, ICE proceeded with his deportation to Laos, according to a press release.

Souvannarath was born in a refugee camp in Thailand. After entering the United States before his first birthday, he obtained permanent residence. According to the press release, when his father was naturalized and given sole custody, Souvannarath legally acquired U.S. citizenship.

Despite being a U.S. citizen, ICE detained Souvannarath at Camp 57, a detention facility inside a maximum-security prison. Representing himself, Souvannarath filed a habeas petition with federal court seeking recognition of his U.S. citizenship and release, the press release stated.

“This should shock the nation,” said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “The deportation of an individual with a substantial claim to U.S. citizenship represents a catastrophic failure of the immigration system and a flagrant violation of constitutional rights.”

Bridget Pranzatelli, staff attorney at the National Immigration Project, emphasized the violation of judicial authority. “This should alarm everyone. Federal agencies cannot simply ignore the other branches of government. ICE—like every other federal and state enforcement agency—is bound by the orders of the court,” she said. “We call for the immediate return of Mr. Souvannarath and for ICE to be held accountable for his flagrantly illegal removal.”

The ACLU of Louisiana, RFK Human Rights, and the National Immigration Project are jointly investigating legal options to challenge ICE’s actions and secure Souvannarath’s return.

Observing and recording what my government does — which is what I was doing when I got arrested — is my business.

But I’m grateful that on Oct. 16, jurors saw through what our government was trying to do to me and quickly acquitted me.","I’m a law-abiding citizen who never thought I’d be of such interest that the U.S. government would use my tax dollars and yours to try to send me to prison, but there I was in Washington, D.C., at the end of July being manhandled by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent trying to remove my phone from my hand.

And there I was in court last month being tried — and quickly acquitted by a jury of my peers — on the false charge that I’d “forcefully pushed” an FBI agent’s hand against a cement wall and “caused lacerations.” All I’d done that night in July was stand outside the D.C. jail so the families of the men being detained for possible deportation would know what had happened to them. I wanted those men and their families to be treated fairly in this unjust time we are living in.

Observing and recording what my government does is my business.

But as he threw me against a wall and handcuffed me, the agent who arrested me said, “If you just minded your own f---ing business, this wouldn’t happen.”

If I had minded my own business. Observing and recording what my government does — which is what I was doing when I got arrested — is my business.

Here’s what sticks out about my experience: being put in the back of an unmarked SUV and with handcuffs that were put on so tight, I have permanently lost feeling in my thumb; not being read my rights or being told what I was being charged with beyond not minding my business.

Shortly before my arrest, I had just gotten a new job working at an animal hospital and moved into a new apartment in a part of the city I’ve always wanted to live in. Things were going great. But would I even have a job to go back to now?

I’m glad I did. My supervisor actually thanked me for doing what I did, for standing up for a group of people being targeted in this country. And I cried. I believe that filming what federal agents were doing that day counted as basic human decency.

After days of not knowing why I was being held, my public defender, Tezira Abe, told me the government wanted to charge me with felony assault of a federal agent, a crime that carried up to eight years in prison. I was dumbfounded.

Three grand juries refused to indict me after the government presented its case against me. That should have been the end of it. But then U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro’s office decided to charge me with a misdemeanor, which doesn’t require a grand jury. I don’t know which was greater, my fear or my disbelief. I was still facing a year in the county jail.

But I’m grateful that on Oct. 16, jurors saw through what our government was trying to do to me and quickly acquitted me.

As I said in a statement that day, “Knowing that I can stand in front of 12 of my fellow citizens and be found not guilty for standing up for basic human rights makes me feel like, despite the scary times we live in, we have hope for the future.”

My attorneys, Tezira Abe and Eugene Ohm, added, “We are pleased with the verdict but this is a trial that should never have happened. Twelve D.C. residents, numerous taxpayer-paid court staff and public defenders had to spend time and resources on trying a case that has no place in a free democracy.” They also said: “The Department of Justice can continue to take these cases to trial to suppress dissent and to try and intimidate the people. But in the end, as long as we have a jury system, our citizens will continue to rebuke the DOJ through speedy acquittals.”

Though I was ultimately acquitted, I should never have been arrested and should never have been charged. The government’s unfair prosecution of me caused my life to be at a standstill for three months. I stopped unpacking my apartment and closed myself off from everything. Why would I keep on unpacking my apartment if I would have to empty it back out? How could I overcome the sadness I felt toward my country and enjoy my life? I kept my head down and worked. That was the only escape I had.

I was taught that you don’t have to make a scene or shout to be heard and that sometimes the quiet actions speak for themselves. This is not one of those times. We should all be screaming. We should all be taking action. This is our country. We are greater and stronger than this administration.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251031-federal-agents-zz-233e5d.jpg",N,,2025-11-02 09:17:09.235611

Albany Park:

Five illegal immigrants from Guatemala, India, Ecuador, and Mexico were arrested by U.S. Border Patrol, according to federal officials.

One of the individuals had previously been ordered to leave the country by an immigration judge. This person will stay in ICE custody and receive full due process pending immigration proceedings, according to federal officials.

Evanston & Skokie:

According to Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, U.S. Border Patrol agents were being aggressively tailgated by a red car, during an operation at Oakton Street and Ashbury Avenue in Evanston. Agents tried to make a U-turn to deter the vehicle, but the car crashed into the agents' vehicle. Next, a crowd surrounded agents and their vehicle, ""verbally abusing and spitting on them.""

One person was arrested. In a statement, McLaughlin said the individual was actively resisting arrest and pepper spray was used ""to deter the agitator and disperse the crowd.""

President Johnson privately predicted that empowering Black voters would spark a mass migration of white Southern Democrats to the G.O.P., which is precisely what happened.","Sixty years ago, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed two pieces of legislation that are, to a remarkable degree, animating forces in the most volatile aspects of the current political moment. In August, 1965, Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, a crowning achievement of the civil-rights movement which paved the way for the election of thousands of African Americans to political office in states where, previously, they were not even allowed to vote. Two months later, he signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, overturning the Immigration Act of 1924, which, by way of eugenics, had sought to curate an immigrant stock of white Europeans. Taken together, the laws democratized the idea of who could be an American, and also which Americans could freely exercise their rights at the ballot box. The Trump Administration and its Republican allies are now engaged in a concerted effort to return the United States to the landscape that preceded them.

The G.O.P. under Donald Trump, like many reactionary nationalist movements, is disproportionately concerned with demographics. Trump’s anti-immigrant crusade has reached a point where masked federal troops are snatching people from their homes—including an instantly infamous ice raid on Chicago’s South Side that involved a Black Hawk helicopter—their cars, their workplaces, courthouses, and public streets. Further demonstrating the nature of the President’s exclusionary vision, on Thursday the Administration announced that it will slash the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. next year to seventy-five hundred, with priority given to white Afrikaners. In addition, the Administration is insisting that universities accept fewer international students, recognizing that admission to such institutions is often the first step toward citizenship.

The President’s goals were made plain on the first day of his second term, when he issued an executive order defying the Fourteenth Amendment’s birthright-citizenship clause. The clause was written after the Civil War to affirm that emancipated native-born Black people were citizens, as was virtually anyone born in this country. But it has been targeted as a means of insuring that children born here without a parent who is either a citizen or a permanent resident are not automatically granted citizenship themselves. Courts blocked the executive order, so, in September, the Department of Justice asked the Supreme Court to take up the question of its legality. The attorneys general of twenty-four Republican-led states have urged the Court to act in Trump’s favor.

At the same time, the President’s desire to control which Americans’ votes will count has been manifested in the battle over congressional maps. The maps are typically revised every ten years, after the census. But three states—Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina—have redrawn their maps at Trump’s behest, creating potentially six more G.O.P.-held seats, and several others, including Louisiana, have taken steps to do the same. This is a transparent attempt to move the goalposts ahead of the 2026 midterms, when a three-seat shift would give Democrats control of the House of Representatives.

In response, at least five states with Democratic majorities are considering redrawing their maps. To counter Texas’s move, California put redistricting on its November ballot, which could give the Democrats five more seats, and voters appear set to approve the measure. In a perverse mirroring of a provision of the Voting Rights Act, the Justice Department is dispatching federal election monitors to some California districts.

But the potential impact of state efforts would likely pale in comparison with the one presented last month at the oral arguments in the Supreme Court case Louisiana v. Callais. In January, 2024, following court orders, Louisiana—which is allotted six seats in the House of Representatives, and where African Americans make up a third of the population—passed a map that created a second majority-Black district. In March, after a legal challenge, the state attorney general defended the map before the Supreme Court, asserting that it was consistent with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits drawing districts in a way that minimizes minority voters’ ability to elect their candidates of choice. (Strategically drawn districts were key in preventing African Americans from gaining political power prior to the civil-rights movement.) But a group identifying itself as “non-African American voters” has claimed that the protections enshrined in Section 2 are themselves discriminatory, in that they offer Black voters an entitlement not offered to non-Black voters. And Louisiana has effectively switched sides, arguing that the map it defended just last year should now be struck down.

Should the non-African American voters prevail, the ruling would set off a gerrymandering battle across the country. The case follows a Court ruling from last year, in Alexander v. South Carolina State Conference of the N.A.A.C.P., which held that gerrymandering for partisan gain is permissible even when it diminishes the voting power of minority populations. In the oral arguments in Louisiana v. Callais, Janai Nelson, of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund, noted that referring to gerrymandering as partisan rather than as racial offered a distinction without a difference, given that roughly ninety per cent of African Americans in Louisiana are Democrats. The Court’s conservative majority appeared skeptical, but accepting the distinction ignores a crucial part of American political history; namely, that Black enfranchisement has always had partisan implications.

The Fifteenth Amendment, ratified in 1870, which gave Black men the right to vote, was driven by Republican considerations that the newly enfranchised population would offset the political power of Southern Democrats, who had just nearly succeeded in tearing the country apart. Those considerations were central to the extralegal and violent tactics that subsequently disenfranchised Black people throughout the South for most of the twentieth century. The concern was not simply that Black suffrage implied a civic equality among the races but that Black people were not likely to vote for the segregation-friendly Democrats who then held power throughout the region. President Johnson privately predicted that empowering Black voters would spark a mass migration of white Southern Democrats to the G.O.P., which is precisely what happened.

Estimates of the net partisan effect of the current efforts vary, but what seems clear is that striking down Section 2 will almost certainly result in a landscape in which minority voters, particularly African Americans in the South, wield less political power than they have at any point since 1965. And it would bring Trump closer to shaping a nation that would look very familiar to those Americans who risked their lives to enshrine the very rights that he is trying to upend. ♦","https://media.newyorker.com/photos/69052696eff43bf5d070077c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/r47829.png",N,,2025-11-02 09:17:15.095200

The United States was founded as a nation of immigrants—a place where people from every corner of the world sought refuge, dignity, and opportunity. Apart from the Native Americans, everyone who calls America home today descends from immigrants who crossed oceans and deserts to rebuild their lives on its soil. From the earliest settlers of England, Ireland, and Germany to the waves of Italians, Poles, and Jews who followed, immigration was never just a demographic process—it was America’s identity, its heartbeat, and its greatest strength.

For more than two centuries, immigration fueled the growth of the American economy, populated its vast frontiers, and shaped its unmatched diversity. Yet, the same nation that once prided itself on being a beacon for the oppressed has gradually turned hostile toward the very idea of immigration itself—especially when the immigrants come with darker skin, foreign tongues, or unfamiliar faiths.

Historically, the earliest immigrants were Europeans—white, Christian, and culturally similar to the Anglo founders. Assimilation was easy because whiteness acted as a passport to belonging. By 1900, nearly 80 percent of America’s foreign-born population came from Europe. Even then, there were prejudices against Italians, Irish, and Eastern Europeans, but time erased their differences. Within a generation, the children of Polish or German immigrants were “simply American.”

But the narrative changed after the U.S. began military and political interventions in non-white regions—from Vietnam to Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Afghanistan. These wars displaced millions, many of whom sought refuge in the very country that had destabilized their homelands. Asylum seekers from the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa arrived not out of choice, but desperation. Unlike their European predecessors, their darker skin and unfamiliar cultures became barriers to assimilation.

According to the Migration Policy Institute, nearly 45 million immigrants now live in the United States—making up about 13.7 percent of the total population. Yet, attitudes toward them remain deeply divided along racial lines. Surveys by Pew Research (2024) show that over 60 percent of white conservatives believe immigrants “burden the nation,” while 70 percent of non-white Americans view them as vital contributors to the economy.

Under the Trump administration’s second term, America is witnessing an unprecedented tightening of immigration laws. The new Senate immigration bill, reportedly enjoying bipartisan momentum, seeks to cut off federal and state benefits to all immigrants, regardless of legal status—permanent residents, work-visa holders, or even those who have contributed taxes for years. It is a striking shift from the nation’s foundational promise that anyone who works hard and abides by the law can earn both livelihood and dignity.

Simultaneously, federal and transport departments are enforcing regulations that restrict immigrant participation in key industries such as trucking, logistics, and services. Commercial driving licenses for immigrants are being rescinded, and companies employing non-citizen drivers face heavy penalties. The crackdown extends beyond the workplace: ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) has intensified raids and detentions across states, with reports of overcrowded detention centers and deportations even of long-time green-card holders.

These policies have drawn resistance from governors, business owners, and human-rights groups, who argue that the U.S. economy relies heavily on immigrant labor. In healthcare alone, foreign-born workers constitute nearly 17 percent of the workforce, including 28 percent of physicians and surgeons. In hospitality, agriculture, and construction, immigrants represent between 30 and 50 percent of employees. The restaurant and hotel sectors—worth over $1.1 trillion annually—would collapse without them.

America’s anti-immigration wave is not rooted in economics but politics. The irony is that while immigrants are blamed for “stealing jobs,” unemployment in 2025 remains near 3.9 percent, and companies are desperate for workers. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there are 9 million unfilled jobs, many in sectors shunned by native-born Americans due to low wages or high physical demands.

Historically, immigrants have powered America’s economic rise. More than 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children—names like Google, Tesla, Pfizer, and Apple. Collectively, these companies contribute over $8 trillion to the U.S. economy each year. Yet, today, the same immigrants who sustain the economy are vilified as threats to national security and social order.

Social-media platforms echo with xenophobic calls to “deport them all,” forgetting that the nation’s wealth was built not only on the labor of immigrants but also on the exploitation of other nations. The United States and its NATO allies waged decades of wars in resource-rich regions—extracting oil, minerals, and trade routes—and then turned away the refugees of those same wars. Libya’s collapse, Syria’s civil war, and Afghanistan’s disintegration are all painful reminders that Western intervention created chaos whose human cost now knocks at their own doors.

America’s short political memory compounds the tragedy. Each administration rewrites the moral code of migration. Obama expanded DACA and refugee resettlement; Trump dismantled both. Biden restored limited protections, but the political pendulum swung back again with renewed hostility. The result is a system that treats immigrants as expendable assets—welcomed when needed, discarded when convenient.

Even worse, detention centers have multiplied, with National Guard units deployed in several states to assist ICE. Civil-rights lawyers document cases of long-time residents deported without trial, separating families and traumatizing children. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) reports over 200,000 deportations in 2025 alone—many involving individuals who have lived in the U.S. for more than a decade.

The roots of this crisis are moral and structural. America cannot destabilize other nations through wars, sanctions, and regime change, then demonize those who flee the wreckage. Immigration is the mirror of foreign policy. Every missile dropped abroad creates another migrant seeking safety.

If the United States wishes to curb immigration sustainably, it must let other nations live with dignity—free from exploitation of their oil, minerals, and industries. Let their people build prosperity at home instead of being forced to cross borders for survival. China’s model offers an instructive contrast: by investing in its own citizens through education, infrastructure, and industry, it has sharply reduced outward migration.

America, too, must return to its founding promise—one that values people not by color or country, but by character and contribution. Instead of walls and bans, it needs reforms that regularize honest workers, integrate them through civic education, and penalize employers who exploit them.

The world once admired the United States for its open arms, not its closed borders. The Statue of Liberty still stands in New York Harbor, holding a torch once meant to light the path for the “huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” But today, that light flickers. A nation that rose from the dreams of immigrants risks collapsing under the weight of its own fear and hypocrisy.

To preserve its greatness, America must remember its origin story. It was not whiteness, wealth, or weapons that built this country—it was human hope. And hope knows no color, no visa, and no border.",https://www.dailyindependent.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Qamar-Bashir1730755260-0-405x300-4.webp,N,,2025-11-02 09:17:29.235245

“A prolonged lapse of funding,” the labor department stated in a notice, “will exacerbate processing delays … especially” for the H-2A program.
While farmers are dealing with roadblocks to one labor source, the Trump administration continues to crack down on another.
Differing views of agriculture labor source The labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, said during a June speech the H-2A program will help solve farmers’ labor concerns, according to The Packer.
While the House stands at recess, no reforms to the H-2A program can be debated or voted on.","President Trump’s deportation of more than half a million people, along with his ending of several programs that allowed immigrants to work in the country legally, has created labor issues across the agriculture sector, including for farmers, an important political constituency.

While experts warned mass deportation would result in agricultural labor shortages, which could then lead to food shortages, Trump officials predicted U.S.-born workers would happily fill those vacant jobs. So far, that hasn’t happened.

There has also been a lack of movement by the Trump administration and his congressional allies toward creating a viable, long-term solution for the immigration system.

Corporate agriculture has often pursued lax safety standards, few labor protections and low wages. In many cases, only immigrants and undocumented workers are willing to toil long hours in extremely hot fields and to cut animal carcasses in hazardous meatpacking plants.

In recent months, to increase the number of farmworkers in the country, the administration has tinkered with the H-2A visa program, which allows some agricultural employers to hire foreign nationals for months at a time. The administration said it has streamlined the process to apply to bring workers to the U.S., and it’s trying to allow farmers to pay foreign visa workers less.

But full-scale reforms — the kind industry groups say are necessary — have not yet materialized, even as the administration ramps up immigration enforcement. Also, some agricultural industries, such as dairy, are not eligible to hire through the program.

“The H-2A program is not the sustainable solution, but it is a short-term solution,” said John Walt Boatright, the director of government affairs at the American Farm Bureau Federation, the leading farmer advocacy group. “I do foresee the H-2A program continuing to increase in use, but by no means is that a measure of its popularity.”

While the Trump administration is relying on the H-2A program to help a vital voting bloc, its approach to government funding has also created problems for those who need it.

As Trump and his congressional allies battled over federal funding with Democrats, the government shut down Oct. 1. That day, the U.S. Department of Labor, which oversees the H-2A program, said a funding lapse resulted in the program’s suspension.

“A prolonged lapse of funding,” the labor department stated in a notice, “will exacerbate processing delays … especially” for the H-2A program.

In mid-October, more than two weeks into the shutdown, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins saying the delays “imminently threaten agricultural production,” according to Civil Eats.

While farmers are dealing with roadblocks to one labor source, the Trump administration continues to crack down on another.

Out of about 2 million farmworkers in the U.S., government surveys show about 44 percent are undocumented. Hundreds of thousands of others in the food supply chain — meatpacking plants, grocery stores, restaurants — are also undocumented.

Trump’s policies have also created more undocumented immigrants in the country. He ended humanitarian parole programs that allowed immigrants escaping unsafe environments to work in the U.S. The move left some meatpacking plants without a reliable labor pool.

Immigration raids, or the threat of them, have led to worker shortages across the country. In Pennsylvania, some dairy farmers, who often have to rely on undocumented laborers, have sold off their herds because they could not find any interested workers, according to Politico. In California this summer, some fields were not harvested because many workers stayed home, according to Reuters. In Idaho, similar concerns pervade farm country.

It’s difficult to know exactly how many undocumented farmworkers have left the labor force, but the country has seen a decline in immigrant workers overall. About 750,000 immigrants have left the labor force since January, the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan organization, estimated in August. The decline in the immigrant workforce is likely to reduce the overall labor force, which could harm the country’s economy, according to CNBC.

The cumulative effect of the Trump administration’s actions will likely lead to fewer small farms and a trend toward larger industrial-sized farms, which will have the ability to access visa workers and explore options for mechanization, said Mary Jo Dudley, former director of the Cornell Farmworker Program and current director of Migrant Advocacy and Support.

“As more people are detained, farms are going to lose workers,” she said. “Dairy producers who don’t have access to H-2A workers are faced with hard decisions: Should they just sell their cows if their workers are going to disappear any day? The possibilities for small family farms are quickly slipping away.”

Despite farmer concerns, immigration raids continue

For months, Trump has said a solution is in the works. During a July 4 speech, he said, “We have some great stuff being written.”

However, Trump’s main goal and the platform he ran on — mass deportation — has always taken precedence.

Over the summer, Rollins pushed Trump to pause enforcement on farms, citing farmers’ concerns, according to the New York Times. A few days later, raids resumed. Stephen Miller, a top Trump aide, has told the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the home of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, it needs to arrest 3,000 people a day, according to Axios.

In mid-September, Tom Homan, Trump’s border czar, told local TV station WWNY that “there are discussions going on now” about raids affecting farm labor. But he made clear the increased enforcement would continue.

“President has said there won’t be amnesty,” Homan said. “But he is looking at options for farms.”

In early October, the administration itself acknowledged its immigration crackdown was causing worker shortages and, potentially, food shortages.

The acknowledgment is tied to how visa workers are paid. Farmers employing H-2A workers are supposed to pay what’s called the “adverse effect wage rate,” or AEWR. The rate is purposefully set above a state’s minimum wage to incentivize farmers to hire U.S. residents, not foreign nationals.

But in a proposed rule filed Oct. 2, the labor department argued the rate needs to be cut. That’s because the “current and imminent labor shortage exacerbated by the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens, increased enforcement of existing immigration law, and global competitiveness pressures … presents a sufficient risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”

The labor department did not respond to a request for comment on the statement in the proposed rule. When a spokeswoman was contacted via email, she said she’d have to wait to respond until the government shutdown was over.

Differing views of agriculture labor source

The labor secretary, Lori Chavez-DeRemer, said during a June speech the H-2A program will help solve farmers’ labor concerns, according to The Packer.

“I would love for Americans to want to do those jobs,” she said over the summer to the Western Governors Association. “I can just tell you, none of the Americans I know want to do some of these jobs.”

Her comment stands in contrast to other Trump officials, who have consistently said the objective is to replace immigrant farmworkers with U.S.-born workers. About two weeks after Chavez-DeRemer’s comments, Rollins contradicted her.

She said Medicaid participants, who often physically cannot work but now face expanded work requirements under a new Trump policy, would fill the gap left by immigrants.

“The mass deportations continue, but in a strategic way, and we move the workforce towards automation and 100 percent American participation,” Rollins said, according to Politico. “With 34 million people, able-bodied adults on Medicaid, we should be able to do that fairly quickly.” (Before Rollins became agriculture secretary, she told Congress that labor shortages from increased enforcement were a “ hypothetical” issue.)

When asked whether Rollins’ position had changed, given the Labor Department’s stance on the immigration crackdown, the USDA, in an unattributed comment, said Trump was “strengthening the farm workforce and streamlining” the H-2A program.

With Congress in recess, no deliberation on possible labor solutions

The agriculture committee in the U.S. House of Representatives has studied the H-2A program, and last year it offered a template for reforms.

Currently, employers — or specialty firms that employers hire — must file paperwork with three federal departments to bring foreign farmworkers to the U.S. The committee recommended creating a single portal for employers to use. It also suggested lowering how much employers spend on wages and housing.

This summer, a bill was introduced based on the template, but it has not received a committee hearing.

The House has not convened since Sept. 19, and it’s unclear when it will resume. U.S. Rep. Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican and the body’s speaker, has faced criticism from his own party for the long delay, according to The Hill. While the House stands at recess, no reforms to the H-2A program can be debated or voted on.

With Republicans controlling both houses of Congress and the White House, Investigate Midwest contacted all 30 Republicans on the House agriculture committee to understand their perspective on how the shutdown is affecting a possible labor solution for farmers hurt by increased immigration enforcement.

However, most did not respond, and a few said they would not comment. The chair of the agriculture committee, Glenn “GT” Thompson, a Pennsylvania Republican, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

DOL creates new office, unclear if old issues addressed

The Trump administration has sought to curtail other visas and legal statuses in its effort to severely limit the number of immigrants in the country, but it has backed expanding the H-2A program, which is only for agricultural employers.

In addition to ending humanitarian parole programs, the administration has proposed requiring employers who hire through the H-1B program to pay a $100,000 fee per application. H-1B holders are considered “highly skilled” immigrants who work in high-paying industries, such as tech. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued over the fee.

On the other hand, H-2A farmworkers are typically paid slightly more than minimum wage for jobs that don’t last long, and wage theft is a well-documented problem.

The Trump administration could be attempting to replace many undocumented farmworkers with foreigners who spend just months at a time in the U.S., said Daniel Costa, a lead immigration researcher at the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute.

“Basically, they’re saying, ‘We want workers, but we don’t want people,’” he said.

This summer, the DOL created a new office it said would help increase the number of farmers participating in the H-2A program. However, it’s unclear how the office is addressing issues created by the program’s popularity.

During the June speech to governors of western states, Chavez-DeRemer, the labor secretary, said she was creating a “one-stop shop” for the H-2A program. The new office would help address a backlog of applications, as well as speed up approvals for farmers who need workers quickly, she said, according to The Packer.

“We’re finally going to lean in,” she said, “and then we’ll work with Congress on the longer-term issues of immigration reform as it needs to be addressed.”

The new office, named the Office of Immigration Policy, will set “strategic oversight,” “strategic management” and “strategic priority” for visa programs, according to Chavez-DeRemer’s memo.

Download: Memorandum-Office-of-Immigration-Policy.pdf

The man tapped to run the office, Brian Pasternak, has worked as a civil servant at the labor department for more than 20 years. Most recently, he oversaw the Office of Foreign Labor Certification, which processes and approves H-2A visa applications submitted by employers.

Even before the current shutdown, the labor certification office struggled to keep pace with the increasingly high demand for H-2A workers, according to a 2024 Government Accountability Office report.

Staff members were shifted from their regular responsibilities to processing H-2A applications, which led to longer processing times for other visas. As the number of applications increased, regulators also dinged employers for fewer infractions, such as lacking proof of adequate housing, a longtime problem for farmworkers on visas.

Having enough staff was an issue before Trump assumed office, and it’s unclear if staffing cuts by Elon Musk’s DOGE affected the processing of H-2A applications.

The labor department lost about 1 percent of its workforce in DOGE’s initial purge, according to The New York Times, and more cuts could be coming during the government shutdown.

The labor department did not respond to a question about how many staffers handling H-2A applications were fired or took early retirement since January. It also did not respond when asked how it plans to handle the issues the Government Accountability Office identified.

The new office “will support President Trump’s efforts to prevent illegal immigration by helping employers access and navigate these programs — supporting legal pathways to work,” said Courtney Parella, a labor department spokeswoman. “By establishing the (Office of Immigration Policy), which reports directly to the Secretary, the Department is cutting red tape and streamlining its ability to execute immigration-related policy priorities and administer foreign labor certification programs.”

Boatright, with the American Farm Bureau, said the labor department’s new office holds a lot of promise. However, at least so far, little has changed on the ground.

“No news yet,” he said, “but we’re anxious to see what this Office of Immigration Policy can do.”",https://imengine.public.prod.cdr.navigacloud.com?uuid=ac403c07-ca95-5568-94de-e3c8ef772499&function=cropresize&type=preview&source=false&q=60&crop_w=0.99999&crop_h=0.93111&width=1200&height=630&x=1.0E-5&y=0.03556,N,,2025-11-02 08:57:00.876371

Once President Calvin Coolidge signed the bill, known as the Johnson-Reed Act, immigration effectively collapsed.","The New York Times recently reported that the Trump administration is ""considering a radical overhaul"" of the refugee system in the U.S. that would, in the publication's estimation, ""favor white people"" by restricting immigration to English speakers, Europeans and white South Africans.

At first glance, this may seem like just another provocation on par with President Donald Trump's profane rant against Haiti and African countries; his stated preference for immigrants from Norway, Denmark and Switzerland; his bizarre comments about immigrants carrying ""bad genes,"" and other invective.

But it's more likely we're witnessing an escalation from random rhetoric to the implementation of concrete restrictions. The shift arguably began with Trump's travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, but what he is now considering looks like the revival of a discredited policy from the 1920s that left a lasting humanitarian stain on the country. Back then, the U.S. imposed quotas that largely ended immigration from many countries, even as it left the door open to the same groups that Trump now elevates.

Understanding how it happened then is essential to seeing how easily, a century later, it could happen again.

It's hard to believe now, but until World War I, the U.S. did little to regulate immigration, with the notable exception of bans on Chinese immigrants. There were no passports, no visas, no green cards, and basically no restrictions. By one estimate, only 2 percent of the arrivals at Ellis Island got turned away, mostly for health reasons.

While many immigrants originally hailed from Ireland, Germany, and other countries in northern and western Europe, the end of the 19th century saw a decisive shift toward newcomers from places in eastern Europe and southern Europe, including Jews, Slavs and Italians. Descendants of these immigrants are viewed as ""white"" today, but that wasn't the case 100 years ago.

Significant opposition to these groups came from the nation's self-described white Anglo-Saxon Protestant (WASP) elite. Members of this ruling class feared that the immigrants would soon displace them, particularly because their birth rates trailed the new arrivals. They spoke nervously of ""race suicide""--forerunner of the ""Great Replacement Theory"" now peddled by antisemites and racists.

These fears got their most thorough and consequential airing in Madison Grant's polemic ""The Passing of the Great Race,"" first published in 1916. (Grant's family arrived in America in the 1620s.) A prominent eugenicist, he would later attract the admiration of Adolf Hitler, who described the book as his ""bible.""

Grant's basic argument was that the U.S. belonged to the ""Nordic"" race, a group that included the English. He warned that ""if the valuable elements in the Nordic race mix with inferior strains or die out through race suicide, then the citadel of civilization will fall for mere lack of defenders.""

His book was one of those works that crystallized anxiety about immigration into something far more potent and toxic. After its publication, prominent native-born politicians began echoing his arguments, warning that newcomers would pollute the nation's bloodline. As the language grew more strident, calls for actual restrictions moved to the fore. Rhetoric became reality.

The battle then moved to Congress. Grant's allies included fellow eugenics enthusiast Rep. Albert Johnson, who held all manner of noxious views, including supporting forcible sterilization of the mentally disabled and bans on interracial marriage.

Beginning in 1917, Johnson and anti-immigrant forces, many of them quoting from Grant's book, began advancing a series of increasingly restrictive acts that curtailed immigration. Legislation passed in that year effectively halted all immigration from Asia while simultaneously imposing literacy restrictions.

Congress followed up in 1921 with a new law that set immigration quotas by country, limiting arrivals to 3 percent of each nationality's U.S. population recorded in the 1910 census. This wasn't enough for the likes of Johnson and his allies, including Sen. David Reed of Pennsylvania. In 1924, they advanced a far more sweeping anti-immigration bill in coordination with Grant.

Politicians debating the legislation said the quiet part out loud. Sen. Ellison Durant Smith of South Carolina cited Grant, and then declared: ""Thank God we have in America perhaps the largest percentage of any country in the world of the pure, unadulterated Anglo-Saxon stock."" He begged his fellow senators to ""shut the door"" and ""breed pure American citizens.""

The final version of the law, much of it effectively structured and framed by Grant, limited immigration from any given country to 2 percent of the population as of 1890, before the arrival of most immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. In practice, this effectively boosted the number of potential ""Nordic"" immigrants and curtailed everyone else.

For example, Italy sent on average more than 100,000 people a year to the U.S. between 1910 and 1920. Under the 1924 law, though, that number was capped at 3,854. Russia, which supplied over 90,000 immigrants a year during that same period, was capped at 2,248. Once President Calvin Coolidge signed the bill, known as the Johnson-Reed Act, immigration effectively collapsed.

These restrictions would prove tragic. During the Holocaust, the U.S. remained wedded to the quotas, effectively guaranteeing that the millions of Jews seeking to escape the Nazis could not take refuge in the U.S., a country that had, until the 1920s, welcomed them.

It wasn't until 40 years later, when Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1965, that the U.S. retreated from the extremism of the Johnson-Reed Act. The country has become far more diverse and tolerant since then. Yet the influx of immigrants over the past 60 years, which closely mirrors that earlier wave, has produced its own backlash, one that has brought us full circle.

We can only hope that Trump's reported plans, which would be a way to revive Grant and company, will end in failure. If not, history suggests that the consequences could long outlive the creators of these misguided policies.

We commit to mobilize our faith communities and our collective resources toward these important truths.
We invite faith institutions and people of faith across the region to join with us by visiting www.lovethyneighborwnc.org.","As pastors, rabbis and leaders of faith-based organizations rooted here in Western North Carolina, we represent a diversity of religious traditions and beliefs. We are united in our commitment to God’s teaching to Love Thy Neighbor. Today we call on our wider community to put these intentions into action by prioritizing the ethic of love for ALL our neighbors, and in particular, our immigrant neighbors.

As a policy matter, immigration is a complex issue, on which neighbors may disagree. As people of faith, however, we agree to basic tenets that unite us across our diverse traditions, across any politics. We believe that all people are Beloved Children of God, important and vital members of our community, and deserving of the full enjoyment of human rights and human dignity, regardless of race, nationality, language, or immigration status. We believe in welcoming the stranger, providing asylum for those fleeing violence in their own countries, caring for the vulnerable among us, and standing against injustice. In short, we believe in loving one’s neighbor, regardless of homeland or address.

The devastation of Hurricane Helene showed us that despite all of our differences and the diversity in these mountains, we know how to show up for our neighbors. We know how to come together to care for one another, to make sure everyone has their basic needs met, to ensure that everyone feels safe and is treated with dignity. In the bold and beautiful acts of love following Helene, no one asked for anyone’s ID or immigration papers before extending a hand. Many of our immigrant neighbors became community heroes both during the pandemic and post Helene, supporting rapid response and rebuilding.

Today, many in our community are once again at risk and living in fear. The danger is not coming as damaging winds, but as a narrative that seeks to divide our communities by demonizing and dehumanizing our immigrant neighbors. The danger is not unbridled floodwaters, but overreaching policies that terrorize communities and separate families from their loved ones. The danger is not failing dams and bridges, but unaccountable and failing institutions that are bending to strip away basic protections from all of us — citizens and non-citizens alike.

Parents are afraid to leave for work, fearing they may not see their families again. Children are afraid to go to school, fearing they may be taken by masked men while walking to football practice. Our faith in our democratic ideals and institutions, in the rule of law, in the humanity of every person is being tested.

Now is the time when we lean on our faith traditions to embolden us to rise to this test. Today we invite faith leaders and people of faith across our region to come together to shift the narratives that are harming immigrant families in our region and beyond. The time to speak up and use our voices is now.

We seek first, to make a clear visible commitment to love thy neighbor — ALL our neighbors. We offer a collective public statement for institutions to consider in defense of immigrant rights, and you will see “Love Thy Neighbor — Defend Immigrant Rights” banners and yard signs outside many of our places of worship and outside our homes.

We also seek to breathe life into our faith through concrete action. Our sacred texts call us to love our neighbors. We do this through the care of foreigners as if they were native-born, through provisions of hospitality for strangers, and by seeing the imprint of God on every person before us and in need. We commit to mobilize our faith communities and our collective resources toward these important truths.

We will stand with our immigrant neighbors through advocacy, accompaniment, and mutual aid. We commit to do this work in coordination with and following the leadership of local immigrant organizations and communities, and rooted always in our shared values of love, justice and beloved community.

Our faith calls us to Love our Neighbors. We have seen WNC stand together with ALL our neighbors; we know what is possible.

“This was terrifying to community members,” Harned said.","Police in a Chicago suburb are collecting videos and other evidence to send to the Illinois attorney general’s office after a car crash involving a U.S. Border Patrol vehicle led to a violent arrest caught on video showing an agent repeatedly punching a man in the head while pinned to the ground.

Immigration agents arrested three people after a sedan collided with the rear of the U.S. Border Patrol vehicle around noon Friday in the city of Evanston. The episode drew a crowd of onlookers and quickly escalated.

Videos posted to social media show some in the crowd appearing to try to interfere with the arrests. Federal agents are seen at times deploying pepper spray, punching a man who approaches the officers, and pointing a gun in the direction of another woman who opened the agents' vehicle door, where a detainee had been placed.

Federal agents have been spreading throughout Evanston in recent days as part of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement activities in the Chicago region. In response some Evanston community members have set up “rapid response” teams, organizing to warn residents when federal agents are spotted and working to slow the agents as they travel through the region.

One agent who was restraining a man on the ground Friday appeared to punch him in the head as it was pressed against the asphalt. The Department of Homeland Security later said the officer delivered “defensive strikes” after the man “grabbed the agent’s genitals and squeezed.”

Some witnesses claimed online that the agents caused the crash by suddenly braking in front of the sedan, though federal officials disputed that account. City leaders swiftly condemned the agents’ actions.

In a news conference shortly after the episode, Mayor Daniel Biss said immigration agents had “beaten people up” and “abducted them.""

""It is an outrage,” Biss said. “Our message for ICE is simple: Get the hell out of Evanston.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agents were being “aggressively tailgated” and the sedan hit them as they tried to make a U-turn.

“A hostile crowd then surrounded agents and their vehicle, verbally abusing and spitting on them,” the agency said. “One physically assaulted a Border Patrol agent and kicked an agent. As he was being arrested, he grabbed the agent’s genitals and squeezed them. The agent delivered several defensive strikes to free himself.”

The mayor has urged more people to join the rapid response team, and city officials have passed ordinances declaring city property to be “No ICE Zones.” This week the Evanston Police Department began sending a supervisor to any reported immigration enforcement scene to document what happens and collect evidence for the Illinois attorney general’s Civil Rights Division, Police Cmdr. Ryan Glew said.

Glew said officers received calls from both federal agents and bystanders. A supervisor arrived after the arrests were made, and several people were treated by paramedics for exposure to pepper spray.

“When we responded those efforts were focused on stabilizing the situation and preventing further conflict between ICE agents and community members,” he said.

Allie Harned, a social worker at Chute Middle School, was part of the crowd that formed after the collision.

“This was awful. There were ICE agents and CBP agents pointing guns at community members, spraying pepper spray in the face of community members,” she said at the news conference.

“This was terrifying to community members,” Harned said. “It was horrifying to a student who happened to be in a car and witnessed it. It is not OK.”

LaMonica McIver of New Jersey and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka have also been targeted for protesting at ICE facilities.
But you're not the only person who's been in the spotlight for the DOJ coming after them.

DK: Do you think that the administration is afraid of you, afraid of people who are protesting?
Abughazaleh: What I want people to know is this is not left or right, and it never has been.","Kat Abughazaleh is in the crosshairs of the Department of Justice.

The 26-year-old Democratic candidate for a seat in Congress has been indicted for allegedly conspiring with others to impede on an ICE officer’s work while protesting outside of an immigration facility in Broadview, Illinois .

Abughazaleh was named alongside five other defendants. Among them are Brian Straw and Cat Sharp, who are also Democratic politicians in Illinois.

According tothe federal indictment, an unidentified ICE agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators.”

Protesters including former journalist Abughazaleh have gathered on public property outside of the processing facility for more than a month to bring attention to the horrific conditions within the building, where detainees are held without proper beds, food, or medical care.

And while the DOJ believes that Abughazaleh’s actions are grounds for prosecution, critics find such claims highly doubtful.

“Not to downplay the seriousness of this indictment but the federal government is claiming that kat abughazaleh, a labubu-sized woman, impeded the movement of an SUV,” one user wrote via BlueSky.

But to Abughazaleh, this goes way beyond accusations of blocking a vehicle. She believes this is a targeted attempt to silence opposing views—and she isn’t the only Democratic politician to face the Trump administration’s legal wrath for protesting.

Sen. Alex Padilla of California was arrested for calling out Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as the National Guard infiltrated Los Angeles. Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka have also been targeted for protesting at ICE facilities.

“This is a pattern of political prosecution of anyone who criticizes this administration's immigration policy, of its overreach, and of the mass, lawless secret police that Trump is siccing on particularly blue cities,” Abughazaleh told Daily Kos Friday.

Chicago has been a hot spot of unrest in recent months. ICE and Border Patrol agents have used aggressive tactics—including the tear gas and Black Hawk helicopters—to target immigrants in the Windy City.

And the man in charge, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino, has been the subject of his own legal case because of the heavy-handed approach.

As for Abughazaleh, this is the Gen-Z politician’s first legal battle. Speaking to Daily Kos from her campaign office while dressed in a Snorlax onesie—which she says is fitting because she has narcolepsy—she said that she’s been searching for a lawyer and researching how to approach the case against her.

But that’s not going to stop her from campaigning and promoting a blood and bone marrow drive hosted by her campaign office.

Read Daily Kos’ full conversation with Abughazaleh below.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Daily Kos: You've recently been federally indicted. What was your reaction to when you first heard about this?

Abughazaleh: You know, I've covered the right. That was my career, covering the right as a journalist and a researcher and fighting back, talking about misinformation narratives. It's not surprising. It is surreal to see my name on the indictment and my full name, which has so many letters. But the only thing that's been surprising about some of the most heinous acts of this administration is just how fast they've happened.

You know, I spent, alongside my colleagues, the last year warning about Project 2025 and the last five years, trying to tell Democrats about the threat of the far right. We told them about Jan. 6 ahead of time, about COVID misinformation, about where the DEI-CRT-trans panic would lead to. And it happened anyway. No one heeded our warnings. And even with this, even knowing what was going to happen. None of us expected it to happen so fast, and I did not expect my name to be on an indictment so fast.

DK: You have been showing up to Broadview. You've really spoken out about immigration issues and standing up for what you believe in. But you're not the only person who's been in the spotlight for the DOJ coming after them. There was Rep. McIver in New Jersey. There's Mayor Baraka of Newark, Judge Dugan in Wisconsin, Sen. Alex Padilla. This seems to be a trend.

Abughazaleh: The reason it seems like a trend is because that's exactly what it is. This is a pattern of political prosecution of anyone who criticizes this administration's immigration policy, of its overreach, and of the mass, lawless secret police that Trump is siccing on particularly blue cities. The reason I was protesting in the first place—the thing that Trump is trying to criminalize—is because of the conditions at the Broadview processing center where ICE headquarters its operations in the Chicago area, and because of the terror campaign that ICE has waged on Chicago. Broadview, for instance, is a processing center. So people aren't supposed to be held for more than 12 hours, but they're held for days or weeks at a time without beds or hot meals or hygienic facilities. This is what we heard months ago, and now we've recently heard even more eyewitness accounts of people who, despite fearing for their own safety, their family safety, have spoken out, describing people being denied water of going into cardiac arrest, being carried out on stretchers, being given fake translators so they will sign their own deportation notices.

And you know, in the city proper, we're seeing a terror campaign. That's what it is. A Halloween parade being tear gassed. Children being tear gassed so that way ICE can abduct our neighbors. Going into businesses, going into homes, rappelling from Black Hawk helicopters in the middle of the night to zip tie children and throw them in the back of a van. What are we doing here? These are things that should be criticized, and the administration wants to continue doing it, and that's why they are trying to use the federal justice system to attack.

DK: But this is the thing, right? You've been targeted for allegedly, what I, what the internet is saying, slowing down a vehicle. But then there's Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino in Chicago right now, who seems to be dodging judge’s orders. The DOJ is fighting against judges in Chicago because he threw tear gas into crowds, and he's taking an extremely aggressive approach. Do you have any response to that? Have you heard people talk about that disconnect of how they're treating protesters versus how they're treating their own people who seem to be harassing the community?

Abughazaleh: This is a pattern of unaccountability. ICE and federal agents are not being held accountable for their crimes. The entire time I protested at Broadview, I've seen two batch numbers on nonlocal police. That means that anyone that is abusing, anyone in masks, abusing the public, throwing tear gas at the press—we don't know who they are. They could genuinely just be some guy that woke up and went to an Army surplus store. The approach by this administration of sheer hypocrisy and terror is so stark. I've never seen anything like it in the United States. If any other administration had people throwing tear gas out of a car into residential neighborhoods, I can't imagine that it would fly, much less happen multiple times. And I think the longer this lack of accountability goes on, the worse it will get.

DK: Do you think that the administration is afraid of you, afraid of people who are protesting?

Abughazaleh: Yes, this administration is afraid. They want to scare us. That's why they have waged a terror campaign in Chicago. They thought that would be enough, and it wasn't. People are defiant. They're scared, but they are defiant. In my neighborhood, in Rogers Park, we have ICE watch going on all hours of the day. School watches—people with whistles that just patrol the neighborhood. And if they see ICE, they blow it, and they make sure people are aware. And the community comes out and there is witness. And ICE is scared of witnesses. This administration is scared that they can't seem to crush our hope, our solidarity, our belief and commitment to the First Amendment, and that is why they are now using the legal system against us, and they are hoping that this will be enough to scare us.

And don't get me wrong, this is scary, just like every time I've been thrown to the ground by ICE, every time I've been tear gassed, every time I've been shot with pepper balls, that's been scary. But standing up for what you believe isn't about doing it without fear. It's doing it despite the fear. And that's what so many people across the country and especially right here in Chicago, have been doing. That's really what the far right is. At its core, it's fear of being irrelevant, of things that are different, fear of losing control, losing power. That is why their messaging depends on fear. It depends on pitting us against each other to distract us from billionaires and oligarchs that are trying to hold this country ransom for their own profit.

No matter how scared I or anyone else feels, I think we can take some comfort knowing that they are more scared. They are more afraid, and they know that they are on the wrong side of history.

DK: Do you think that this is going to stop you in any way from protesting, from speaking out, and from supporting the immigrant community?

Abughazaleh: Nothing will stop me from speaking out and supporting the immigrant community. You know, this is my first and hopefully only time being federally indicted, so I'm learning the process of getting a lawyer and going through all of these motions, but I believe in the First Amendment. It's one of the most precious things we have. I have believed in my values since I was a child. I truly believe that if you don't stand by your values, even to your own detriment, then you have nothing at all. And so there is no unconstitutional attack that can make me stop talking about what is right and stop standing up for others. That's why I'm running for Congress, and that's why I'm going to win on Election Day and in court.

DK: Do you have any advice for the people who either have been protesting or want to get involved who have seen your indictment, and they're like,” Oh, I don't, want to be attacked.”

Abughazaleh: Look, I get it. I think it's misleading to say that you wouldn't understand that. At the same time, the reason they were freaking out about No Kings Day is because there's safety in numbers. There is safety when we are all standing up for what we believe, and when we show that even if we're afraid, we're less afraid together. Nonviolent action is what triggered Donald Trump into posting a video of him spraying the country with diarrhea, which I've never seen a president do before.

If they're triggered by the people that they claim to represent, what do you think they'll do to you if you don't stand up to them? Now, I encourage people to understand their own risk situation.

Everyone has different situations. Everyone has different strengths and weaknesses, and we all have a part to play right now in fighting authoritarianism. And whether that is protesting, whether that's checking on your neighbor, whether that's helping distribute mutual aid, whether that is patrolling for ICE, whether that is taking care of yourself—we all have something we can do right now, and we need to actually do it.

DK: [In regards to] people who are maybe unsure of how they feel about people being arrested when it comes to protesting. There are people saying, “Oh, they should let them do their jobs. They should not impede. They should expect this.” I see those comments online a lot. How do you explain to people who have this differing opinion where you're coming from?

Abughazaleh: What I want people to know is this is not left or right, and it never has been. This is a state terror campaign that is meant to attack the people they have spent years prepping the public to accept as “other.” And this has happened in every authoritarian regime we've seen. First they go after visible minorities and especially queer people, often Jewish people, and then it slides down from there to communists or socialists or anti capitalists, and then it goes to anyone who disagrees with what anything the administration is doing. And if there's anything that you have seen this president do and you've thought, I don't know if I agree with that, just know it will eventually come for you.

Norms and inaction have been used to justify some of humanity's greatest injustices, worst crimes.

In a news conference shortly after the episode, Mayor Daniel Biss said immigration agents had “beaten people up” and “abducted them.” “It is an outrage,” Biss said.
Glew said officers received calls from both federal agents and bystanders.
“When we responded those efforts were focused on stabilizing the situation and preventing further conflict between ICE agents and community members,” he said.

Immigration agents arrested three people after a sedan collided with the rear of the U.S. Border Patrol vehicle around noon Friday in the city of Evanston. The episode drew a crowd of onlookers and quickly escalated.

Videos posted to social media show some in the crowd appearing to try to interfere with the arrests. Federal agents are seen at times deploying pepper spray, punching a man who approaches the officers, and pointing a gun in the direction of another woman who opened the agents’ vehicle door, where a detainee had been placed.

Federal agents have been spreading throughout Evanston in recent days as part of President Donald Trump’s immigration enforcement activities in the Chicago region. In response some Evanston community members have set up “rapid response” teams, organizing to warn residents when federal agents are spotted and working to slow the agents as they travel through the region.

One agent who was restraining a man on the ground Friday appeared to punch him in the head as it was pressed against the asphalt. The Department of Homeland Security later said the officer delivered “defensive strikes” after the man “grabbed the agent’s genitals and squeezed.”

Some witnesses claimed online that the agents caused the crash by suddenly braking in front of the sedan, though federal officials disputed that account. City leaders swiftly condemned the agents’ actions.

In a news conference shortly after the episode, Mayor Daniel Biss said immigration agents had “beaten people up” and “abducted them.”

“It is an outrage,” Biss said. “Our message for ICE is simple: Get the hell out of Evanston.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agents were being “aggressively tailgated” and the sedan hit them as they tried to make a U-turn.

“A hostile crowd then surrounded agents and their vehicle, verbally abusing and spitting on them,” the agency said. “One physically assaulted a Border Patrol agent and kicked an agent. As he was being arrested, he grabbed the agent’s genitals and squeezed them. The agent delivered several defensive strikes to free himself.”

The mayor has urged more people to join the rapid response team, and city officials have passed ordinances declaring city property to be “No ICE Zones.” This week the Evanston Police Department began sending a supervisor to any reported immigration enforcement scene to document what happens and collect evidence for the Illinois attorney general’s Civil Rights Division, Police Cmdr. Ryan Glew said.

Glew said officers received calls from both federal agents and bystanders. A supervisor arrived after the arrests were made, and several people were treated by paramedics for exposure to pepper spray.

“When we responded those efforts were focused on stabilizing the situation and preventing further conflict between ICE agents and community members,” he said.

Allie Harned, a social worker at Chute Middle School, was part of the crowd that formed after the collision.

“This was awful. There were ICE agents and CBP agents pointing guns at community members, spraying pepper spray in the face of community members,” she said at the news conference.

“This was terrifying to community members,” Harned said. “It was horrifying to a student who happened to be in a car and witnessed it. It is not OK.”

Four people who were targets in an FBI gambling investigation were arrested that day, and a fifth was arrested the day after.
Of the 105 people arrested, the Idaho Statesman has confirmed the names of only 21.
At the raid, Arteaga-Solchaga told officers that he was a Mexican citizen, and he was taken to the Boise ICE office.
The effect is that people often just stop fighting their deportation rather than sit in detention in the U.S., Parsons said.","An Idaho immigrant who entered the U.S. lawfully 10 years ago but overstayed his visa was among the many people swept up in the FBI and ICE raid on a racetrack this month in Wilder, according to Neal Dougherty, a Nampa lawyer and partner at Ramirez-Smith Law.

The man had no criminal history, but Dougherty said agents told him and another immigrant in a similar situation that they could be imprisoned for decades here, and weren’t allowed to talk to family or an attorney until they agreed to deportation.

The two signed up to be deported, he said.

The second immigrant who overstayed his visa is engaged to a U.S. citizen, Dougherty said, and could have been eligible for a green card after their marriage.

ICE took 105 immigrants into custody after the raid, where roughly 200 members of law enforcement from 10 agencies arrived at the final horse race of the season at La Catedral Arena. Many people were detained for hours, and some children were zip-tied. Four people who were targets in an FBI gambling investigation were arrested that day, and a fifth was arrested the day after. All five pleaded not guilty this week to the charges against them.

The Elmore County Jail provided the names of 48 immigrants ICE wanted to get booked into local jails on Oct. 20, the day after the raid, but it’s unclear whether all of them were from the federal operation in Wilder.

Of the 105 people arrested, the Idaho Statesman has confirmed the names of only 21.

One of those is facing a criminal immigration charge, and 19 of them are trying to secure their release from detention, according to lawyers and court documents. The other’s status is not known.

Hernan Arteaga-Solchaga was at La Catedral on Oct. 19 during the raid, according to a criminal complaint filed by Mitch Bierle, a special agent with ICE and Homeland Security Investigations. Arteaga-Solchaga was sentenced in 2015 to 30 months in prison for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, according to a judgment filed against him in U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho.

At the raid, Arteaga-Solchaga told officers that he was a Mexican citizen, and he was taken to the Boise ICE office. No information is available about his location on ICE’s detainee locator.

However, he was previously deported in September 2017, according to the criminal complaint. He was indicted this month with the charge of deported alien found in the U.S.

The others have all filed habeas corpus petitions, which argues that there’s no lawful basis to keep them detained, according to immigration attorney Casey Parsons. Two of the petitions were filed from Nevada and Wyoming.

The Trump administration has been expanding mandatory detention for many immigrants, despite that policy’s legal losses in court. The effect is that people often just stop fighting their deportation rather than sit in detention in the U.S., Parsons said. In the past, many immigrants in the U.S. have been given a bond hearing and released if they weren’t deemed to be dangerous or a flight risk, Parsons told the Statesman by phone.

A lot of the immigrants she’s working with have minimal criminal histories, Parsons said. One of her clients, for example, has two Idaho convictions — in 2007 for not having a driver’s license and in 2017 for speeding in a school zone.

Some have more than one conviction, but the vast majority are related to traffic and driving issues, the attorney said.

“The fallout for the families is obviously a mess,” Parsons said.

Masked immigration enforcement agents have arrested people in and outside of public institutions — including hospitals, schools and courthouses — on multiple occasions.","Amanda Trebach, an intensive care nurse who has been trying to keep her migrant patients safe from immigration raids, never expected American law enforcement to use the same kind of violence against her, a U.S. citizen.

But video filmed and posted by fellow organizers during one confrontation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August shows Trebach forced to the pavement and roughhoused by federal agents, who violently arrest and detain her.

""You don't know who they are. They don't identify themselves. There's no due process,” she told CBC News.

The incident occurred as Trebach and other members of a Los Angeles activist group called Harbor Area Peace Patrols had been circulating images of licence plates on nondescript vehicles to alert migrant communities to their presence.

On Aug. 8, volunteers were photographing ICE agents leaving a staging site for raids on Terminal Island, whose Japanese residents were the first in America to be displaced and forcibly detained in internment camps during the Second World War.

Shortly after, the officers stopped their vehicle and jumped out; Trebach says they knelt on her head, handcuffed her and threw her into the back of a black van.

She says ICE “kidnapped” her and told her to stop taking photos.

“I just said, ‘Let me go. We're here. It's our right to monitor you,’” said Trebach. “I'm a citizen.”

Trebach was released without charge hours later.

“As is her constitutional right, Amanda was documenting the movements of the masked kidnappers,” Harbor Area Peace Patrols’ parent organization, Union del Barrio, wrote in a social media post detailing Trebach’s detainment.

ICE officers themselves have leaned into characterizations of their arrests as abductions. In an incident two weeks later, agents were videotaped taunting Peace Patrol activists from their van saying, “Good morning ladies! A-kidnapping we will go.”

Trebach is hardly the only U.S. citizen arrested and detained without charge. In a recent investigation, ProPublica found that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by immigration enforcement as of Oct. 5.

University of California in Los Angeles law professor Jonathan Zasloff says ICE has effectively been operating with “impunity” despite the growing cases of U.S. citizens and legal immigrants getting caught up in their raids.

“They could break all these constitutional rights and nothing could happen to them,” he said.

'The constitution is right there'

Even citizens not actively involved in advocacy have been swept up in violent immigration raids.

George Retes, a U.S. army veteran, was on his way to work as a security guard at a legal marijuana grow operation called Glass House Farms in Ventura County, Calif., when he got caught between an active ICE raid and an organized protest.

In a FOX 11 Los Angeles livestream, Retes is seen driving up to a wall of federal officers in military gear. Within two minutes, dozens of agents advance across the road, unleashing tear gas on the crowd of demonstrators.

After smoke from the tear gas can be seen engulfing his car, Retes, in an account of his arrest, writes that despite having identified himself as a citizen, ICE agents ""smashed my driver-side window, and pepper-sprayed my face"" as ""others stood by and watched.""

“Even though I’m just complying, an agent puts his knee on my back and ano ther agent puts his knee on my neck. And as they’re doing that I’m just telling them I can’t breathe,” Retes, 25, told CBC News.

WATCH | George Retes says he was choked, arrested by ICE:

Retes said this kind of behaviour seems to contravene U.S. laws.

“The constitution is right there,"" he said. ""I mean, that’s everything we stand for.”

In a statement, ICE claimed Retes was “violent and refused to comply with law enforcement,” and blocked agents by “refusing to move his vehicle out of the road.” But ICE did not address why agents escalated the matter so quickly.

During the marijuana farm raids, federal authorities arrested more than 360 people — one of the largest ICE operations since Donald Trump became U.S. president for a second time in January. Among those arrested were four U.S. citizens, charged with assaulting or resisting officers.

Retes was held for three days before being released. He was in such a state of distress over what happened that the detention facility put him on suicide watch, he told The Associated Press.

Retes missed his daughter’s third birthday while locked up, he said, a nd is now suing the federal government for unconstitutional detention. He has not been charged.

“It's just crazy that all this can happen,"" he said. ""But it doesn't change what the flag stands for or what it means to be an American.”

ICE operating with 'impunity'

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said ramped-up immigration enforcement is removing the worst kind of “criminal illegal aliens” off U.S. streets and sending a message: “Self-deport or we will arrest and deport you.”

Survey data from February 2024 to March 2025 shows about one-third of Americans agree that immigrants in the country illegally should be deported — though most believe arrests should not happen in places like schools and hospitals.

Masked immigration enforcement agents have arrested people in and outside of public institutions — including hospitals, schools and courthouses — on multiple occasions. This has caused some migrants to avoid medical care out of fears they’ll be detained, including at the hospital in South Los Angeles where Trebach works.

“What Trump is doing is placing fear in the communities,” Trebach said. “They're trying to make us fearful so they can take over more power.”

There is also an explicit mandate for ICE officers to arrest as many people as possible to meet Trump’s mass deportation quota of 3,000 people a day, or over a million a year.

In June, California Gov. Gavin Newsom decried the “chaotic federal sweeps” across his state to meet an “arbitrary arrest quota” that is “reckless” and “cruel.”

Based on government figures from last year showing the number of immigrants with criminal convictions and pending charges being tracked by ICE, the administration is about 350,000 “illegal aliens” short of its target.

Social media accounts, websites and even dedicated apps have documented sightings of immigration agents across the country, including a widely used phone app called ICEBlock.

Under pressure from the administration, Apple and Google removed ICEBlock from the app store earlier this month. Apple told the app’s creator it had violated the company’s policies because “its purpose is to provide location information about law enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.”

In September, the U.S. Supreme Court paused an injunction by a California district court to block “roving” immigration patrols on the basis that ICE was stopping people based on their race, language, employment or location.

In her dissenting opinion, Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the Fourth Amendment “prohibits exactly what the government is attempting to do here: seize individuals based solely on a set of facts that ‘describe[s] a very large category of presumably innocent people.’”

The American Civil Liberties Union called the Supreme Court ruling “outrageous,” saying it normalizes a culture of fear for anyone perceived as Latino who are subjected to increased racial profiling, arbitrary inspections and detentions.

Zasloff, the UCLA law professor, told CBC News this is an effort to return America from “a modern, more diverse” country to “what it might have been in the 1830s.”

Al Muratsuchi, a California state assemblymember who represents the South Bay region of Los Angeles, says his constituents, many of whom are working-class immigrants in industries like landscaping and construction, are being systematically victimized.

“We're seeing similar themes of immigrants being a threat and being targeted based on their race,” Muratsuchi, who is a son of Japanese American immigrants, t old CBC News.

U.S. not a police state 'yet'

ICE routinely promotes its activities on social media, including its use of force against migrants whom Trump has repeatedly described as “vermin.” One shows ICE agents dragging away a Portland protester on a cart. Officers tackle a man in another action-packed arrest compilation.

Rock video-style clips posted by Greg Bovino, commander and nearly 30-year veteran of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), depict everything from clashes with protesters to an alternative take on Star Wars that likens his agency to Darth Vader.

CBC News made detailed requests for an interview with Bovino through CBP. Three weeks later, the agency has still not responded.

Despite the risks, a growing number of Americans like Trebach — millions in recent weeks — are fighting for what they believe the nation represents.

In Illinois, the latest epicentre of Trump’s crackdown on immigration and “domestic terrorism,” demonstrators sued law enforcement, accusing them of violating their constitutional rights through excessive crowd control tactics like tear gas.

Two National Guard members recently told As It Happens they are refusing orders to deploy to Chicago.

Zasloff doesn't think America is a police state “yet,” though he believes the Trump administration is trying to turn it into one.

“But that’s always the case with any competitive authoritarian system,” said Zasloff, pointing to Trump’s declining approval ratings and the growing movement to stop his administration.

“For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.”

Meanwhile, the raids and deportations continue.

On Thursday afternoon, ICE boasted on X about having deported “over 5,300 criminal aliens throughout the Los Angeles area.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/cd7e40d9-3742-4a36-8009-ccacb0615bc1,1761930960169/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C1920%2C1080%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-01 18:17:14.777738

The White House also recently hired Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who worked on cases seeking to overturn the 2020 election results to work on voting issues.

The law requires records be retained for 22 months after a federal election – a period that has long elapsed since the 2020 contest.","The justice department on Thursday asked election officials in Fulton county, Georgia, to turn over records related to the 2020 election, a request that underscores how the administration is trying to revive one of the president’s biggest falsehoods about the election he lost five years ago.

Investigators have cleared Fulton county of malfeasance in 2020. Nonetheless, a Republican majority on the board voted to reopen the investigation last year. On the night of the 2024 presidential election, the board voted to subpoena a slew of documents. This summer, the board passed a resolution asking the justice department to intervene and help them get the documents. The subpoenas issued last year seek records related to voter lists, chain of custody forms, ballot images, security seals and ballot scanner paperwork.

The 30 October letter from the department’s civil rights division, obtained by the Guardian, asks Fulton county to turn over a slew of records that were subpoenaed by the state election board. The letter’s existence was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

“Transparency seems to have been frustrated at multiple turns in Georgia,” Harmeet Dhillon, a Trump ally who leads the civil rights division, wrote in the letter. She also said the voting section had received correspondence from “voter transparency advocates” of “multiple instances of government obstruction of transparency requests, including high-resolution ballot scans, signature verification documentation, and various metadata requests”. She asked the county to turn over the records within 15 days.

A spokesperson for the Fulton county elections board did not immediately return a request for comment. A justice department spokesperson declined to comment beyond what was in the letter.

The department’s request comes as the justice department has asked 40 states to turn over voter roll information and has sued eight states that have refused. The White House also recently hired Kurt Olsen, a lawyer who worked on cases seeking to overturn the 2020 election results to work on voting issues. Heather Honey, another prominent election denier whose misleading research was used to sow doubt about the 2020 election results, has also been appointed to an election-related role in the Department of Homeland Security.

To justify its request, the justice department cited a provision of the Civil Rights Act that requires election officials to retain election records and gives the attorney general the right to request them. The law requires records be retained for 22 months after a federal election – a period that has long elapsed since the 2020 contest.

The letter also said the department also needed the records to comply with two federal statutes, the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.

Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said the federal statute that allows Department of Justice to request election records requires the department to provide a “basis” for requesting them. That was absent in Dhillon’s letter, he said.

“In DoJ’s letter, I see a purpose: we want to check up on what you did,” he said. “But the letter just cites a general swath of federal statutes without saying anything about why there’s a basis to believe that the records they’re seeking will shed light on a federal statutory violation. [The] DoJ doesn’t just get to go fishing because it’s curious.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f3df85990b7ec4081507632a72cd5a8a1bde5c/375_0_3750_3000/master/3750.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=299fbf7909d126aa8b0d527c35e7de91",N,,2025-11-01 16:16:56.607553

The Flock camera systems are automated license plate readers from the Flock Safety company.

According to a report from the University of Washington Center for Human Rights, through public records requests, it learned that federal agencies involved in immigration enforcement accessed various Washington state police departments’ automated license plate readers.

According to the report, Auburn enabled one-to-one sharing of its Flock Network with border patrol at some point during 2025.

In an Oct. 20 press release from the City of Auburn, the city reports it did not intentionally grant any immigration enforcement agencies access to its Flock system, but through the “National Lookup” feature on Flock, it may have inadvertently allowed such access.

“After learning via the report that Flock’s ‘National Lookup’ feature may have allowed unintended access through a shared national network, Auburn Police leadership immediately acted and has since turned off that feature, effectively closing any potential backdoor that could have connected federal agencies to Auburn’s cameras,” the release stated. “Additionally, the Auburn Police Department has implemented enhanced monitoring protocols.”

According to the release, Auburn did not allow, and will not allow, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Border Patrol, or any other federal immigration enforcement agency direct access to its Flock system.

According to the city, Auburn’s Flock cameras are used only for legitimate criminal law enforcement and public safety purposes. The city reports that Flock’s national network allows agencies across the country to share information, but that Auburn has not intentionally or knowingly granted any agency directly affiliated with the Department of Homeland Security or engaged in immigration enforcement activities access.

The city reports that now the police department conducts a comprehensive review of usage data exported directly from the Flock system every month. If any agency is found to be using Auburn’s flock data for immigration enforcement purposes, its access would be permanently revoked.

ICE had not initially shared why agents arrested the family in the first place, but our partners at The Denver Post reported Friday the agency had mistaken the father for somebody else.

Though there has been no official statement from ICE on the man’s arrest, reporting from the Post was corroborated by Enrique Arturo Orozco-Perez, the co-executive director of Compañeros: Four Corners Immigration Resource Center, who told Denver7 ICE agents were looking for a drug trafficking suspect at the time of the Jaramillo-Solano’s arrest.

News of the operation spread quickly through social media, sparking several protests in the small city after residents learned the family was going to be separated and transferred elsewhere.

On Friday, Denver7 learned more about the conditions inside the ICE field office from Orozco-Perez, who claimed the family endured 36 hours inside what they called “a dungeon.”

Based on accounts from the family, Orozco-Perez told Denver7 Jaramillo-Solano and his two children were held in a small windowless room where the lights remained on at all times. The family did not see sunlight for three days, he claimed.

Orozco-Perez said the family did not have access to a private toilet and were only fed potato chips and water for the 36 hours they remained detained in Durango.

“They did not put us in a holding room,” the father of two reportedly told Orozco-Perez. “They put us in a dungeon. There was no daylight. There was no air. There was no rest.”

The immigrant rights advocate also claimed the 12-year-old suffered abuse at the hands of ICE agents at the Durango field office, calling their treatment in the 36 hours they were housed there “violent.”

“We know that the ICE agents pushed around [the 12-year-old] whenever she asked for something and that her father and her brother have scrapes and bruises across their body because they wanted to protect her,” Orozco-Perez said.

While those claims cannot be fully corroborated, City of Durango officials said Wednesday its police department “received a report that one of the children may have been in distress and potentially experiencing abuse,” and added that officers tried to conduct a welfare check on the children and to bring food. “Unfortunately, federal agents denied officers entry to the facility.""

Though the family was never separated while in Durango and all three have since been transferred to an ICE facility in Dilley, Texas, which is located about 72 miles southwest of San Antonio, the kids remain without their mother, the immigrant rights advocate said.

“They are not safe. Their conditions are still harsh. Their future remains uncertain,” he said.

Orozco-Perez called on Colorado Republican lawmakers, including Rep. Rep. Jeff Hurd, Rep. Gabe Evans, and State Sen. Cleave Simpson to use their political power to bring the family back home.

“The father and his two children pose no danger to society, and we are confident they do not intend to flee from the authorities,” he said. “You have the power to help reunite this family in safety. We ask you to use it.”",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9692ac1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/720x378+0+14/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F52%2F98%2Ff54e62194d9b833f55e5f66c508a%2Ffernando-jaramillo-solano.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 18:17:18.345898

Several elected officials and community leaders spoke passionately about sending a message to the masked agents as well as to their bosses in Washington, DC, a message that immigrants are welcome here.

Mayor Biss called the raids a “reign of terror,” and said “every time we slow these monsters down it’s one less person getting abducted.”

Speakers urged the community to join neighborhood watch groups, to get out word as quickly as possible if ICE agents were in the area.

County Commissioner Josina Morita said “we will protect our neighbors from terrorism and fear-mongering.”

Allie Harned, a social worker at Chute, said “our children and families are terrified. I witnessed horror today a block away,” with federal agents “pointing guns” and using pepper spray.

“Our student should not be afraid to come to school,” Harned added.

“They are our babies.”

A District 65 parent and military veteran, Christopher Whitaker, said that there was an immigration raid in Skokie earlier in the week.

ICE, he said, was “going after landscapers, not drug dealers.”

Those arrested, he said, “were not those bringing weapons of war onto our streets.”

And the Rev. Michael Nabors, pastor of the Second Baptist Church and head of the local NAACP chapter, led the crowd in a chant of “down with deportation, up with liberation.”

Nabors and several others referred to the Evanston raid coming on Halloween, a day where children should feel safe and free to walk in their communities.

“We saw ghosts and goblins … today,” Nabors said. Not little children dressed up, but large men toting guns.

“But we can fight the evil in our world,” Nabors stated.

Earlier, at the scene of the incident, Ald. Juan Geracaris (9th) said “people have human rights and the right to due process. For something like this to happen in my neighborhood is deeply disconcerting.”

You will recall from prior editions of this column that Trump issued an executive order trying to seize power over American elections.
Of course, Trump also had another major legal collapse this week.
The AGs and governors filed their lawsuit in Massachusetts federal court explaining that the failure to disperse the funds was a violation of the law.
YOU Contrarians have supported over 200 of these legal cases and matters through your paid subscriptions, including our legal work on SNAP.","It was already a catastrophic week for Donald Trump in the courts over his effort to starve Americans by illegally blocking SNAP benefits. Then Friday afternoon brought him another defeat—this one in the election arena. And both were thanks to you Contrarians.

Let’s start with the breaking news from late Friday. You will recall from prior editions of this column that Trump issued an executive order trying to seize power over American elections. I went to court with wonderful colleagues on behalf of clients such as LULAC to stop it. Under the Constitution, states run elections, with some role for Congress, not the president.

Previously, we had won preliminary relief, temporarily stopping this misconduct while the judge considered a permanent injunction. On Friday, we won summary judgment in the case—that is a permanent bar to this wrongdoing. Of course, Trump can appeal, but the decision is strong, and he will fail.

Because at the Contrarian we are owned by no one, all profits from your paid subscriptions go to support my democracy litigation, like this case—and over 200 other legal matters.

Of course, Trump also had another major legal collapse this week. That was the courts’ rebuke of Trump’s effort to use hunger as a political tool in the form of cutting off SNAP benefits in a misguided attempt to pressure Democrats to end the government shutdown. The pushback came courtesy of state attorneys general, governors, nonprofits, and private plaintiffs—and the federal judges to whom they turned for help. Here, too, you Contrarians made your voices heard.

To back up a bit, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food aid to almost 42 million Americans every month. About 1 in 8 Americans would not be able to eat if this program were halted. The Department of Agriculture has the money to pay for SNAP—and the legal obligation to spend it. The Trump administration claims it is not allowed to disperse the funds because of the shutdown. In fact, it is flouting the law by refusing to do so.

That was the subject of an administrative complaint that my litigation colleagues and I filed this week. As we explained, “USDA is not only authorized to use the SNAP contingency fund in the event of a lapse in normal appropriations, it is legally obligated to do so. Congress has directed USDA to reserve SNAP funding for use ‘as may become necessary to carry out program operations.’ By law, individuals who are eligible for SNAP are entitled to receive those benefits.”

If the money and statutory command are there, why are Trump, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins, and others in the administration withholding it, with backing from congressional enablers? They are transparently doing so for political reasons to try to exact pain over the government shutdown and pressure Democratic senators who are unwilling to provide their votes for another heartless initiative: tearing health care away from millions of Americans.

You’re probably asking yourself how they are getting away with this flagrant illegality. That’s why an armada of support—including 23 state AGs and three governors in one lawsuit and a coalition of individual plaintiffs and nonprofit organizations in another—came in to make sure that they couldn’t. The AGs and governors filed their lawsuit in Massachusetts federal court explaining that the failure to disperse the funds was a violation of the law. Then, plaintiffs—including individuals from red states, such as a grocery store owner in South Carolina, who are bravely speaking out while their state governments do nothing to fight back—sued in Rhode Island.

By Friday, the plaintiffs scored significant victories against Trump, securing this vital assistance for Americans across the country. In a hearing on Thursday, federal Judge Indira Talwani in Massachusetts said, “Congress has put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency.” On Friday, Chief Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the federal government from cutting off SNAP benefits nationwide; and Judge Talwani in Massachusetts, in a scathing opinion, stated that the federal government was wrong on the relevant law and required it to inform the court as to whether it will authorize paying out benefits by Monday.

The fact that the private plaintiffs, AGs, and governors went to court—and that the courts responded strongly—is magnificent. (To be clear, these were separate from my administrative complaint. Credit where credit is due!) It’s another example of how the legal resistance is working as the front line of defending the Constitution and human decency. YOU Contrarians have supported over 200 of these legal cases and matters through your paid subscriptions, including our legal work on SNAP.

Polling shows that Americans dislike these kinds of autocratic shenanigans by Trump. We see that in polls, with Trump at historic lows of under 40% in poll after poll. And we’ve also seen it at the polls. In 46 out of 47 special elections this year, Democrats have won or outperformed by an average of 16 points.

Now we are about to get the biggest referendum yet on Trumpism when voters go to the polls Tuesday in California, New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. California’s Prop 50 is, of course, a direct response to Trump’s effort to steal congressional seats through redistricting in Texas by triggering reciprocal redistricting in the Golden State. And the other elections also are a reflection on Trump: GOP candidates Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia and Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey have enthusiastically embraced the president and his agenda.

Contrarians, that brings us to you once more. If you are a voter in one of these states or if you have friends or family who are, you have the opportunity to make your voice heard— whatever your views might be. It’s perhaps the most fundamental right in our democracy—and that’s why our authoritarian in chief fears it so much—evinced, for example, by his shameless efforts to encourage gerrymandering nationwide to deprive voters of their choice. On Tuesday, voters in multiple states will get to say what they think, and I believe they will repudiate Trumpism.

Of course, another element of a strong democracy is the free press, and we like to think we exemplify that here at The Contrarian. I hope you’ll agree when you look at the extraordinary lineup of content we offered this week—like my democracy litigation, also made possible by our paid subscribers. See for yourself….

Trying to break SNAP

The MAGA GOP Doesn’t Care If You Starve: Sen. Rosen on SNAP, Shutdown, and Senate.

Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) joined Jen from her D.C. office to expose Republican hypocrisy, as the “family first” party withholds funds that enable millions of Americans to feed their families. “Many of my Republican colleagues are like, ‘well, if they want to eat, they should get a job and work hard’.… Will you tell that to the disabled veteran or to the senior, or to the children, or to the people who work really hard but just don’t make enough?”

Dispatch from Chicago: Countdown to SNAP cuts

Lorraine Forte reported from Chicago, where SNAP cuts would deal another blow to a city already reeling from the abuses of ICE and Customs and Border Patrol. “November threatens to be just the start of a downward spiral.”

The ICE Invasion

The Border Isn’t Where You Think It Is

In his first piece for The Contrarian, Tim Dickinson reported on how and why the infamously brutal Border Patrol is taking a central role in Trump’s immigration crackdowns—far from any international border crossing. “Is the Border Patrol now in Chicago as part of its routine authority? Or is there something darker going on?”

The Forgotten Status in the Immigration Narrative: Dreamers

A 13-year DACA recipient, anonymized for fear of personal retribution from ICE, gave us an incisive, courageous essay on what it takes to live under the ever-less-stable contingencies of a government that has always treated her like a pawn and increasingly like a pariah.

ICE Escalation in Chicago: Looped In with Lynn Sweet

Lynn Sweet spoke with Jen Rubin about the latest on ICE in Chicago: Children teargassed during Halloween celebrations. Women thrown to the ground and arrested. Journalists targeted and obstructed from doing their jobs. “This is happening in a time where everyone has a camera.”

Checks and Imbalances

Calling This Court “Supreme” Is Obeying in Advance

Michael Podhorzer gave us a searing condemnation of how the Roberts Court is passing off tyranny in robes as the rule of law. “When legal and media elites don’t name the partisan stakes, and when even progressive critics keep referring to the Roberts Court’s legal Calvinball as ‘Supreme Court’ rulings, they are conditioning all of us to accept what we never would otherwise.”

Sen. Schmitt’s hearing on political violence was a sham

Tom Joscelyn, Susan Corke, and I wrote on Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt’s baseless belief that only the left commits political violence—an absurd exercise in projection that he and his fellow Republicans have given a veneer of congressional due process.

Flying blind economically, thanks to the shutdown

Dan Koh looked ahead to Nov. 7, when America will likely wake up to yet another month without a jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, because “the federal shutdown has silenced the agency responsible for the most basic economic truth-telling we have.” When the data mirror is shattered even temporarily, he argued, the public loses one of its few checks on narrative and power.

The Latest in Hate

The Young Republicans chat echoes the Citizens Councils of the 1950s and 60s

Michael Franklin linked the Young Republicans’ debased, revealing group chat—“the casual cruelty, the smirking slurs, the need to dress violence as irony”—to an older tradition, alive and all too well. “The Young Republicans have become what the Citizens’ Councils once were: the finishing school for a politics that calls prejudice principle and cruelty conviction.”

The Cost of Silence: The Erasure of Black Progress Threatens Our Democracy

Onyx Impact CEO Esosa Osa and Kam Middlebrooks reported the findings of their organization’s new analysis detailing exactly how Black history—and Black futures—are being threatened under the Trump administration’s coordinated attack.

Kamala Harris was right about everything

Shalise Manza Young reflected on just how much Kamala Harris foresaw, spelled out in her forceful campaign trail warnings of Project 2025’s racist, xenophobic, misogynistic, un-American goals. “As we approach the one-year mark of the presidential election that gave us whatever all of this madness is, it is even clearer that Vice President Kamala Harris was right about pretty much everything.”

A minimalist documentary with maximum impact

Meredith Blake wrote on The Perfect Neighbor, a harrowing true-crime documentary now on Netflix that uses body-cam footage to reconstruct a horrific 2023 Florida shooting in which a mother was killed for protecting her kids while Black. “A devastating indictment of Stand Your Ground laws.”

Essential Elections Ahead

Trump is too much of a narcissist to call off elections

Austin Sarat explains that Trump would rather rig than suspend elections to ensure he gets the adulation he craves. That includes Trump already making plays to influence the 2026 midterms. Voting has never been more critical.

Firewall for Freedom: ACLU PA Executive Director Mike Lee on Pennsylvania Elections and State Protection

As Pennsylvania’s State Supreme Court elections approach, Mike Lee, executive director of the ACLU’s Pennsylvania branch, joined Jen to explain how Republicans are trying to flip the Democratic majority. “Federal law is the floor, not the ceiling.”

Equal Voting Rights are under attack in the courts and in North Carolina [podcast]

“North Carolina really is emblematic of what we’ve been deeply concerned about, and that is, this rush to try to seize control on a partisan basis.”

Republicans are Rigging Maps for More Congressional Seats. Ari Berman explained Republicans’ redistricting strategy. “Even in red states, all the polling shows that voters don’t like this effort.” Republicans are in a race to see how many states they can strip representation from—and they’re targeting Black lawmakers to do it.

Seeing Clearly & Fighting Back

Don’t Lose Hope: Steve Vladeck On Why the Trump Administration Is Always In Court

Legal expert Steve Vladeck joined Jen to break down how Portland and Chicago are fighting back against Trump’s National Guard deployment. “The lower courts are still doing a heck of a lot to at least try to constrain what the government’s doing.”

Authoritarians don’t get the last word

Democracy Defenders Action Executive Director Susan Corke explained how Americans are fighting back on every front against Trump’s autocratic aspirations. “When authoritarian leaders destroy the symbols of democracy, they are preparing to destroy its substance. Their goal is to raise doubts about who this country belongs to, and make us believe that it doesn’t belong to us.”

Culture, Cartoons & Fun Stuff

This week our cartoonists covered some of the many ways Trump is haunting our highest office, from bulldozing the White House (Tom the Dancing Bug, Ruben Bolling), to rewriting history (As Reagan would have it, Michael de Adder), to elevating the soulless (Don’t call us fascists, Nick Anderson), to zombifying the federal workforce (Spooky season, RJ Matson), to bringing in new goons to scare adults and kids alike (Only the best people, Nick Anderson).

Culture recs: Frankenstein (and Mary Shelley) Through the Ages

Meredith Blake recommended Guillermo del Toro’s new spin on the Gothic classic and other interpretations of its timeless themes. “Never underestimate the cruelty that can be waged by neglected, vengeful monsters. Stay spooky, Contrarians.”

Last but not least, Jamie Schler offered cocoa molasses chews for helping us figure out how we go on, and your pets were the treat this Halloween.

Two immigration agents were seen leaving an ICE staging area in unmarked cars on Tuesday, Oct. 28. Both were wearing horror masks: one of Chucky and the other of Momo, the outlets reported.

The person wearing the Momo mask was seen at an immigration raid on Oct. 28, a Harbor Area Peace Patrol activist told NBC News.

When asked by NBC News about the incident, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, “Happy Halloween!” the outlet reported.

PEOPLE reached out to McLaughlin for comment.

McLaughlin did not say whether ICE officers or Border Patrol agents were wearing the masks, according to NBC News.

The agency also took to X to share a clip of a Newsmax report announcing ICE's arrest of five people on Halloween.

""Forget ghosts or ghouls—the true horror is the violent criminal illegal aliens, who sanctuary politicians protect, putting the safety of Americans at risk,"" the Oct. 31 post reads. ""Halloween is a little less scary this year with these monsters off American streets.""

The reports follow President Donald Trump’s threats to send a ""surge"" of immigration enforcement agents to San Francisco. Trump ultimately backed down on those threats after speaking with ""friends of mine who live in the area"" and Mayor Daniel Lurie.

""Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress,"" he wrote in a Truth Social post on Wednesday, Oct. 23. ""I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around.""

Earlier that week, Bay Area residents protested the ICE raids and violent arrests that have been executed in other cities like Chicago, Portland and Washington, D.C.

As the raids in Chicago continue, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson have condemned the federal intervention.

On Wednesday, Oct. 29, Pritzker asked DHS to pause immigration arrests until after Halloween. He noted that Border Patrol agents used tear gas on Saturday, Oct. 25, and there were children present who were on their way to a Halloween parade.

However, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem denied Pritzker's request, and said in an Oct. 30 press conference that the agency was ""absolutely not willing to put on pause any work that we will do to keep communities safe,"" according to C-SPAN.",https://people.com/thmb/3FMNLkkzVeyPxJOuO4v2gCuR0Bg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/police-ice-shirt-042225-1-65b32faea22043968c1b2e0f161649d3.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 16:17:14.142492

Such was the reply from the Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin when asked about the presence of ICE agents seen patrolling areas of Los Angeles in spooky masks on October 31.

Reports of the federal agents in costume were shared by local outlets including L.A. Taco. The story showed the officials in unmarked cars wearing scary masks, some of whom had been verified by local activists as being part of previous immigration raids.

McLaughlin’s somewhat nonchalant response to The Independent’s request for comment about the agents was not accompanied by any further statement.

She also did not respond to a further query on whether the use of holiday masks may increase the rates of assaults on ICE agents, or whether those who did retaliate would be penalized despite not knowing that they were being arrested by federal agents in costume.

The Department of Homeland Security has previously claimed that attacks on ICE agents were up 1,000 percent, while threats to officers were up 8,000 percent. The agency has not provided evidence to back this up.

In its report on the masked agents, L.A. Taco cited volunteers from Harbor Area Peace Patrollers, which monitors federal activity at Terminal Island harbor, around 25 miles south of central Los Angeles.

One volunteer reported seeing one agent wearing a mask of haunted doll Chucky, and another wearing a mask of Momo – a viral internet hoax involving a creepy chicken lady. The agents were both seen in the area and also conducting raids in the Van Nuys area of Los Angeles county.

The distasteful use of holiday masks by agents in California comes as Illinois Governor JB Pritzker appealed to ICE officials to briefly cease operations in Chicago over Halloween to allow children and families to have “a break” while celebrating.

Pritzker, who has been consistently pushing back against the administration’s federal presence in Illinois, told reporters that he asked Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and the Department of Homeland Security to “pause all of their federal agents’ operations for the entirety of the Halloween weekend.”

“The Department of Homeland Security claims their highest priority is to protect children, so today I have to ask them, please live up to those ideals,” Pritzker said in a press conference.

But in a scathing response Noem said the department was “absolutely not willing” to pause any enforcement, claiming it was keeping cities and children safer, describing the request as “shameful.”

She told Fox News that not only would the activities continue, but they would “increase.” “The fact that Governor Pritzker is asking for that is shameful and I think unfortunate that he does not recognize how important the work that we do is,” Noem said.

Far away from trick-or-treating families fearful of arrest by ICE agents in scary masks, Donald Trump was enjoying his Halloween, hosting a lavish party at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida.

Fernando Jaramillo-Solano and his children, ages 12 and 15, were then transferred together to a unit in Dilley, Texas, where they are still being held, according to Compañeros: Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center, which connected with the family.

The family, who were detained while on their way to school Monday, have an active asylum case, which means they have the legal right to remain in the country while the case proceeds, and they have complied with every requirement of the process, according to immigration advocates who have been assisting the family with the legal process.

Masked federal agents pulled them over after mistaking Jaramillo-Solano for someone else, but arrested him and his two children anyway, advocates said.

Gregory Davies, Denver’s third-ranking official with ICE corroborated that account in federal court Friday, testifying that the agents did not know Jaramillo-Solano was the person driving the car before they stopped him, the Denver Post reported. Davies took the stand during a hearing in a lawsuit challenging the agency’s arrest practices in Colorado.

There was no active warrant for Jaramillo-Solano, according to Compañeros, who has been assisting the Colombian family.

The family’s arrest sparked demonstrations in the southwestern Colorado town. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the facility in Durango and blocked the entrance in an attempt to prevent the family from being separated. The protest erupted as federal agents dragged demonstrators and fired rubber bullets and used pepper spray at close range.

Meanwhile, the family said they were not allowed to leave the small cell, where the lights remained on at all times. The only available toilet was in the room, offering no privacy, advocates said.

No female agent was available to help the 12-year-old girl, the family told advocates. Jaramillo-Solano likened their detention to torture, and alleged that both he and his son were physically assaulted.

“Every time I asked what would happen to my children, or if they could have something to eat, they hit us. They told me I did not matter. They told me my children did not matter,” Jaramillo-Solano told the resource center.

An ICE spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment Friday.

The 15-year-old son said his hands were bruised and swollen from the handcuffs agents placed on him, advocates said.

The family was never separated, Compañeros said.

The family told immigration advocates that in Texas they received food and water and agents loosened their handcuffs.

A bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers is working together to free the family from ICE custody. During a meeting in Durango Thursday evening, representatives for Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet and Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd said they are working to get Jaramillo-Solano and his children released from the center in Texas and returned to Durango, where they have lived for 18 months.

Some privacy lawyers called DHS’ move to add driver’s license information more evidence of federal overreach.","The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver’s license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship.

The plan, outlined in a public notice posted Thursday, is the latest step in an unprecedented Trump administration initiative to pool confidential data from varied sources that it claims will help identify noncitizens on voter rolls, tighten immigration enforcement and expose public benefit fraud.

According to emails obtained by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, DHS approached Texas officials in June about a pilot program to add the state’s driver license data, but it’s not clear if the state participated.

Earlier this year, DHS added millions of Americans’ Social Security data to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, system, allowing officials to use the tool to conduct bulk searches of voter rolls for the first time. According to the document filed Thursday, SAVE also recently expanded to include passport and visa information.

Incorporating driver’s license information would allow election officials whose rolls don’t include voters’ Social Security numbers to conduct bulk searches by driver’s license number. Ultimately, the system would link these two crucial identifiers for the purpose of citizenship checks, said Michael Morse, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

“It is the key that unlocks everything,” Morse said.

State driver’s license databases often include a variety of sensitive information on drivers, including place of birth, passport number, biometrics, address, email and employment information, said Claire Jeffrey, a spokesperson for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.

Beyond the privacy concerns this creates, using driver’s license numbers in SAVE could lead to citizens being wrongly flagged as noncitizens, said Rachel Orey, director of the elections project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Driver’s license numbers are sometimes reused and people can have licenses in multiple states. Also, if SAVE isn’t linked to live versions of state driver’s license databases, the information in the system will be outdated.

“This could have far-reaching consequences for voter access and public trust if inaccurate data were used to question eligibility or citizenship,” Orey said.

DHS says in the notice that linking to driver’s license data, which it calls the most widely used form of identification, “will allow SAVE to match against other sources to verify immigration status and U.S. citizenship, which will improve accuracy and efficiency for SAVE user agencies.”

The department did not respond to questions about the expansion.

Up until this year, SAVE was mostly used to check individual immigrants’ citizenship status when they applied for public benefits. DHS has said the aim in expanding the system was to enable election officials to check voter rolls en masse. But the agency’s data-sharing agreement with the Social Security Administration as well as Thursday’s disclosure make clear that DHS and other agencies can use SAVE for other purposes, including for immigration enforcement investigations.

Information uploaded into the system by state and local election officials and other users will be saved and may be “shared with other DHS Components that have a need to know of the information to carry out their national security, law enforcement, immigration, intelligence, or other homeland security functions,” the notice explains.

Advocacy groups have sued the federal government claiming the pooling of data in SAVE violates the Privacy Act, which is meant to prevent misuse of private data. In filings, the government has said that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 explicitly allows information sharing to verify citizenship status and that DHS would exercise caution in flagging voters as potential noncitizens.

Some privacy lawyers called DHS’ move to add driver’s license information more evidence of federal overreach. “The administration wants to get as much data as it can, however it can, whenever it can,” said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.

The DHS notice, known as a system of records notice, allows for public comment on several aspects of SAVE’s expansion, including some already completed. Typically, such notices are filed when agencies propose changes to federal systems, and the comments are meant to inform how officials go forward. That didn’t happen in this case.

In June, email records show, DHS asked the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver’s licenses and ID cards, to partner on a pilot program to add its data into SAVE.

Timothy Benz of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the branch of DHS that oversees SAVE, wrote that the planned expansion was part of the “evolution” of SAVE into a “one-stop shop for all election agency verification needs.”

“That would require collaboration with each states’ DL agency in order for us to query those DL records in order to provide that information to the querying elections agency,” Benz wrote.

Rebekah Hibbs, a supervisor in the Texas Department of Public Safety’s driver’s license division, replied that DPS is “always happy” to support the SAVE tool and agreed to talk again with USCIS.

It’s not clear what happened next. In response to questions from ProPublica and the Tribune, DPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen said the “department does not have any ongoing projects with USCIS related to driver record information for registered voters, nor have we been asked to provide that information.”

She did not answer questions about whether DPS has given any data to USCIS. DHS did not respond to questions about whether the partnership moved forward.

Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson announced Oct. 20 that her office had run the state’s entire voter roll through SAVE. Alicia Pierce, Nelson’s spokesperson, said the office did the check using full Social Security numbers, which it routinely obtains from the Department of Public Safety to match with registered voters.

The results showed that around 0.015% of Texas voters, or 2,724 people, are potentially noncitizens.

At least one Texas official is concerned that those initial SAVE results may not be accurate. In a court filing submitted Wednesday as part of the Privacy Act litigation, Travis County voter registration director Christopher Davis wrote that state data shows about 25% of the voters that SAVE flagged as potential noncitizens in the county had provided proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

“I am concerned that the list Travis County received from the Secretary of State is flawed and worry about the potential for voters to be improperly cancelled from the voter rolls and possibly disenfranchised as a result,” Davis’ filing says.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1203787221.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 15:16:49.151831

Juana Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen, said law enforcement agents zip-tied her hands behind her back for almost four hours while her 3-year-old son clung to her legs.","BOISE, Idaho (AP) — The first sign something was amiss was the thwack of helicopter rotors overhead, followed by screams. Within moments, Anabel Romero was on the ground with her hands restrained behind her, she said, as law enforcement officers brandishing guns removed her 14-year-old daughter from a nearby truck and zip-tied the teen while her young siblings looked on.

Romero and her daughter, both U.S. citizens, were among about 400 people detained for hours at a privately owned race track about an hour west of Boise as part an FBI-led investigation into illegal gambling that resulted in more than 100 arrests, nearly all for immigration violations.

Romero isn't sure what agency the officers who zip-tied her daughter were from. More than 200 officers from at least 14 agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Border Patrol, as well as local police, participated in the raid at La Catedral Arena.

The Oct. 19 operation is a striking example of how immigration has become a major driver across federal law enforcement, demonstrating a previously unheard of level of coordination to address President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. It also shows how immigration dragnets marked by a heavy use of force have entangled U.S. citizens and legal residents.

The raid on La Catedral Arena struck nerves in Canyon County, which has the most Hispanic residents in Idaho and where Trump got 72% of the vote last year.

Five families interviewed by The Associated Press said officers zip-tied children as young as 11. They said an 8-year-old boy got glass in his mouth as he screamed while officers broke his car window. Several children were separated from family members for hours.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees Border Patrol and ICE, denied that children were zip-tied. FBI spokesperson Sandra Barker initially said no restraints or rubber bullets were used on children but later amended that statement, replacing “children” with “young children.”

Four people at the track, and a fifth the next day, were arrested on gambling charges, while 105 others were detained on immigration violations.

John Carter, a track security guard, said he was placed in zip ties and lost circulation in his hands before an FBI agent loosened them. Carter said officers used flash-bang devices, pointed guns at people, and deployed a pepper bomb in a vehicle where someone tried to hide.

“It’s OK to take your family to a public event. Just because there’s 10 people in a crowd doing something illegal, that doesn’t make everyone in that crowd illegal,” Carter said. “Yes, I voted for Trump, I’m not ashamed to say it. But I don’t like the way this was handled and the claims they are making.”

The gambling charges

FBI Special Agent Jacob Sheridan said in court documents that the people charged worked on a pari-mutuel betting operation, although the track did not have a state license for that, only for horse racing.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokeswoman, said, “ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation.” However, court documents make no mention of animal fighting. She later added that ICE did not restrain or arrest children.

Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said in a joint statement that it was “completely false” and “deeply misleading” for ICE to take credit, noting the FBI's leadership and the involvement of a local task force.

Other examples of how immigration has become a focus in anti-crime operations include a sting involving the FBI in October that targeted illegal street vending in Manhattan’s Chinatown, as well as recent efforts in Memphis, Tennessee. During Trump's law enforcement surge in Washington, D.C., touted as focusing on crime, about 40% of the first 2,300 arrests were immigration-related.

Allegations of excessive force

During the Idaho operation, many officers did not appear to have any identifying marks or department names on their uniforms. Some wore masks. State and local agencies either denied restraining children or did not return calls seeking comment.

Several people told the AP that ICE officers removed their restraints once they were put in line for immigration processing, and court documents say ICE was brought in after the initial search warrant was executed.

Romero said that when she was unnerved about being separated from her children for hours, an agent laughed and said, “We’re taking better care of them.”

Several days later, Romero said her daughter’s bruises were still visible. Her 6- and 8-year-old woke up screaming each night. When the family drove past a police cruiser, her youngest “freaked out.”

“They don’t even see law enforcement anymore with respect,” she said. “They’re pretty shook up.”

Jehidi Perez, 21, of Nampa, was in her truck with her 5-year-old son, watching as authorities tried to break a window of a separate vehicle her parents and 8-year-old brother were in. Her parents started to drive away, and an officer shot at their car.

“It was a rubber bullet, but at the time everybody was panicking. We were thinking that it was actual bullets,” Perez said. “My mother covered my brother with her body.”

Her parents stopped their car, and officers shattered a window. Glass covered her brother — some went into his mouth, Perez said. A rubber bullet struck her father's chest.

ICE arrested her father, and Jehidi Perez was ordered to appear in immigration court in November.

Her son and her brother, both U.S. citizens, are struggling, she said.

“They can’t really get much sleep at night. They are not doing good at all,” she said. “My brother cries every day. This is the first birthday he’s spending without his dad.”

Few answers from law enforcement

When an officer zip-tied Jasim Duran-Villa’s 11- and 15-year-old brothers, she urged him to double-check with his superiors.

“We did tell them that we didn’t think that was something that they should be doing to minors,” she said. The officer told her other children had been restrained.

Duran-Villa wasn't zip-tied because she was carrying her 14-month-old child. The baby was hungry and needed a diaper change, but the milk and diapers were in her car.

“Already like 2 1/2 hours had passed, and that’s why I was asking so many times, ‘Can I go get my diaper bag to get my baby some milk?’ They kept ignoring me, or saying to ask another officer,” she said. “The baby was crying the whole time.”

After more than three hours, they were identified as citizens and allowed to leave. Duran-Villa’s father was arrested and charged with an immigration violation.

Juana Rodriguez, a U.S. citizen, said law enforcement agents zip-tied her hands behind her back for almost four hours while her 3-year-old son clung to her legs.

“They would just tell him, ‘You need to hold your mom’s shirt.’ When he would go a little away from me, they would push him back to me and say, ‘Keep him with you!’” Rodriguez said.

She was eventually allowed to leave, and ICE arrested her father.

“I told him not to sign anything because I’m working to get him out,” she said.

In a Friday afternoon email to residents, the city confirmed that federal immigration agents were present at several locations across Evanston.
The crash and subsequent confrontation was the latest in a series of verified federal immigration reports on Oakton Street and near Evanston schools.","A crowd of about 200 gathered outside Chute Middle School around 2:15 p.m. Friday for an impromptu news conference, with many decked out in festive Halloween apparel. But between skeleton earrings, themed t-shirts and full-fledged costumes, a sea of brightly-colored whistles stood out from the crowd.

Students peered out from the school’s windows to get a good view of the conference — one student held up a handmade sign reading, “Get Rid of ICE.”

The news conference came in response to widespread activity by federal immigration agents in Evanston on Friday. The Department of Homeland Security made several arrests across Evanston and Skokie, including of protesting citizens and those it said lacked legal status, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to The Daily.

Demian Kogan, the Illinois Coalition for Immigration and Refugee Rights’ senior director of organizing, called Friday’s immigration operations “disgusting” and “morally reprehensible.” He added that rather than being an isolated incident, federal immigration enforcement has become a “daily reality in Illinois.”

“Today is supposed to be a day where families go out in the community, connect with their neighbors, enjoy themselves and build relationships with one another,” Kogan said. “The message that (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) was trying to send in Evanston, in Skokie and Albany Park and in these other areas, is that they will not allow the residents of these areas to be able to live lives peacefully, regardless of where they come from or who they are.”

City sees day of widespread immigration enforcement

In a text alert around 11 a.m., ICIRR wrote that ICE and Border Patrol had a “large presence” in the city and Skokie. Agents in the area also had support from helicopters flying over Crawford Avenue and Church Street in Skokie, the alert read.

In an emailed statement to The Daily, a DHS spokesperson said that the U.S. Border Patrol conducted immigration enforcement operations in Evanston and Skokie on Friday, which they said culminated in the arrest of five Mexican immigrants lacking permanent status. The spokesperson claimed the immigrants’ criminal histories included “criminal trespass and multiple illegal entries into the country.”

Around noon, at least 10 federal immigration agents were present at Oakton Street and Asbury Avenue when a civilian vehicle rear-ended an agent’s vehicle. Agents pulled the driver out and detained them as several community members gathered at the scene, multiple sources confirmed to The Daily.

Evanston/Skokie School District 65 board member Andrew Wymer said he joined a “caravan” of around five cars following the Border Patrol vehicle five minutes before the crash. About 20 people gathered in the immediate aftermath, and the crowd grew as the situation escalated, Wymer said. In the emailed statement, the DHS spokesperson said a vehicle crashed into a Border Patrol vehicle after “aggressive tailgating.”

In a news release, the Evanston Police Department said officers arrived at the scene after pepper spray appeared to have been deployed. DHS confirmed the arrest of three U.S. citizens and said pepper spray was deployed against an individual who resisted arrest. Federal immigration agents also punched people and sat on someone’s neck, Mayor Daniel Biss said. In a 2:10 p.m. X post, EPD said the incident was clear.

Responding officers were not able to get any information from the federal agents present at the scene, Biss told The Daily. Earlier in the week, at a Monday council meeting, EPD announced its new policy to have a supervisor at every immigration enforcement scene in an effort to obtain information about the federal agencies conducting the enforcement activity.

In the Friday X post, EPD wrote that it is responding to several reports of federal activity around the city. The incidents will be reviewed and more information will be sent out at a later time, EPD wrote.

In a Friday afternoon email to residents, the city confirmed that federal immigration agents were present at several locations across Evanston. In another email later that day, the city advised families to exercise additional caution during trick-or-treating activities — the city’s trick-or-treating hours were from 4-7 p.m.

Border Patrol Cmdr. Gregory Bovino was also present throughout operations in Evanston on Friday, Biss confirmed.

Evanston schools respond with soft lockdowns

Evanston/Skokie School District 65 schools held recess indoors Friday morning to keep students and staff safe, Superintendent Angel Turner wrote to parents in an email shortly before noon. She added that there has not been ICE presence on District 65 school grounds, but recent activity near several schools has led to heightened concerns in the school community.

“Our schools are and will remain safe and welcoming spaces for all, regardless of immigration status,” Turner wrote.

Evanston Township High School also implemented its closed campus protocol due to “federal activity” in the area, Superintendent Marcus Campbell wrote in an email to parents at 11:45 a.m. Friday.

Campbell emphasized that there was no threat to the campus and no federal activity on school grounds.

Students remained on campus for lunch and free blocks, and dismissal took place as regularly scheduled at 3:35 p.m. In a follow-up email sent at 2:45 p.m., Campbell wrote that the district is working with city officials and EPD to coordinate safety measures. Students who did not feel comfortable leaving campus were advised to gather in the school’s South Cafeteria after dismissal, the email said.

Campbell encouraged families to be present at dismissal to “support the sense of safety for all students.”

The Friday crash at Oakton Street and Asbury Avenue occurred near Chute. District 65 staff and Superintendent Angel Turner also spoke at the news conference Friday afternoon, addressing the implications of federal activity on students and families.

Allie Harned, a social worker at Chute, said the district spent 10 months preparing for “the worst of the worst” and called the situation “worse than that.”

“I’ve witnessed some horror today, a block away from Chute Middle School,” Harned said.

The crash and subsequent confrontation was the latest in a series of verified federal immigration reports on Oakton Street and near Evanston schools.

Earlier Friday morning around 9:30 a.m., agents detained one person in a landscaping crew at Oakton Street and Sherman Avenue, according to an ICIRR alert sent at 10:18 a.m. It was the fifth ICIRR-verified sighting of federal agents on Oakton Street in October.

“Unfortunately, this is getting normal down here on the south side (of Evanston),” Wymer said at the scene of the crash. “Our kids shouldn’t be experiencing terror, and our neighbors shouldn’t be experiencing this.”

Local leaders speak out, call for community action

Prominent elected officials and community leaders also spoke at the conference, including Biss, U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Evanston), Cook County Commissioner Josina Morita and Skokie Mayor Ann Tennes.

“Our message for ICE is simple: Get the hell out of Evanston,” Biss said. “I cannot thank enough the incredible group of people standing behind me, people patrolling the streets of Evanston right now, rising up together, arm in arm, to keep our neighbors safe.”

ICIRR’s Kogan said he thought the escalated enforcement was partly in response to the Illinois General Assembly’s newest bill Friday limiting immigration enforcement across the state. The bill includes banning civil arrests at and near courthouses, protecting those receiving hospital care and safeguarding student data at public universities. ICIRR was a driving force in advocating for the bill.

Tennes also addressed the crowd, expressing gratitude for volunteer groups and relating the experience of parents in Evanston to that of parents in Skokie. She encouraged attendees to look out for their neighbors by contributing to legal aid funds and making sure they “are taken care of in every way that we can.”

Second Baptist Church Pastor Michael Nabors, representing the interfaith community of Evanston and the Evanston/North Shore branch of the NAACP, led the crowd in a chant of “Up with liberation. Down with deportation.”

“Justice is not in America today,” Nabors said. “Justice is not in Washington, D.C. Justice is not on the Supreme Court today. Justice is not in the executive branch. Justice is not in the house or in the Senate. But I want you to know that justice is in the Evanston community.”

“There are no legal pathways to come to the United States for people that are escaping violence.","EL PASO, Texas (Border Report) – Day of the Dead is a Mexican tradition – often observed in U.S. Latino communities – of remembering and honoring deceased loved ones.

It involves prayer, setting up a small altar with candles and pictures of the departed, or visiting their graves at cemeteries. This weekend, one community group in El Paso is asking border residents to save a prayer for migrants who died on the way to the United States and to speak up against immigration policies it alleges force them to turn to unscrupulous smugglers.

“The (U.S.-Mexico) border for a long time has been a place with deterrence policies that are fueling the death of people,” said Alan Lizarraga, a spokesman for Border Network for Human Rights.

The El Paso-based group is co-hosting a 5:30 p.m. migrant remembrance vigil this Saturday at Armijo Park, 710 E 7th Ave.

According to the UN’s International Organization for Migration, at least 1,233 migrants died in the Americas in 2024. That includes 174 who perished in the jungle and ravines of the Darien Gap in Panama and 341 for whom the Caribbean Sea became their final resting place. Along the U.S.-Mexico border, at least 560 migrant remains were recovered that year, one of the deadliest on record.

“We want to offer our community a space of remembrance but also make an urgent call to action to our government that it is time to build a humane policy, it is time to really care about the safety of individuals and work together to find a way forward that guarantees people aren’t losing their lives,” Lizarraga said.

On Oct. 12 in El Paso, a man from Mexico and a citizen of Guatemala were killed in a vehicle crash as their smuggler was attempting to flee the Border Patrol. A few days earlier, first responders recovered the body of a migrant who spent six hours inside a storm drain after he and eight other people were abandoned by smugglers.

The Trump administration for the past eight months has been posting online messages discouraging migrants from coming to the United States illegally and placing their lives in the hands of smugglers who will lead them through dangerous places or abandon them.

Lizarraga said people fleeing death threats from gangs or are targeted by government officials or police forces in their countries don’t have much of a choice.

“There are no legal pathways to come to the United States for people that are escaping violence. Asylum is limited under this administration and that is forcing people to take alternative routes,” Lizarraga said. “These are preventable deaths and our policies should reflect the values of our country.”

This story was written by Beth Hundsdorfer with Capitol News Illinois and Janelle O'Dea with Illinois Answers Project.","CARLYLE, Ill. -- When Jose Jeronimo Guardian showed up at a Spanish language traffic court this week, he didn't expect to be detained and face expulsion from a country he'd lived in for more than two decades.

Guardian, 48, was scheduled to appear Monday in a courtroom where a county-provided translator would aid communication with about a dozen Spanish-speaking defendants who face charges from traffic infractions like his - two charges of driving under the influence of alcohol - to serious felony charges.

Guardian never made it into the courtroom.

Instead, an agent who said he was from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement questioned him in a lobby of the Clinton County Courthouse, handcuffed him, then loaded him into the back of an unmarked car and drove him to a Missouri detention center where he would await deportation.

Detentions at state and county courthouses would be banned under legislation passed early Friday morning. The state legislature approved a bill barring immigration arrests in and around county courthouses, and nearby parking lots and sidewalks. House Bill 1312, which would also allow Illinois residents to sue for civil rights violations, still must be signed by Gov. JB Pritzker.

Though instances of ICE detentions in Illinois have been centered on Chicago since President Donald Trump began ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in September, Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday there has been an uptick recently in ICE activity in central and southern Illinois.

""They are literally targeting people who are brown and Black, whether you are undocumented or not, and they are tackling people, detaining people for hours, zip-tying people who are U.S. citizens. So, they're indiscriminately grabbing people who don't look like the ICE agents, typically, and holding them or mistreating them,"" Pritzker said.

Clinton County, where Guardian was detained, is a rural area 45 miles east of St. Louis. It is overwhelmingly white with just 4% of the population reporting they are Latino, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

ICE says he was deported three times

Guardian was detained in a lobby outside the Clinton County Circuit Clerk's Office as he headed up the stairs to the courtroom when he was approached by four men who said they were ICE agents. They asked his name, then put handcuffs on him. One of the men who identified himself as an immigration agent said Guardian has been deported three times before - an allegation his daughter refuted.

As a reporter captured Guardian's detention on video, one of the men asked a court bailiff to get the reporter to stop recording. The bailiff declined, saying video recording was allowed in public areas outside of the courtroom.

The purported federal agents walked out of the courthouse with Guardian, tailed by his daughter, Isabel, who was holding her baby. Guardian was placed in the back of one of the cars. Isabel Guardian asked for her father's phone, then asked where they were taking him.

One of the men responded that her father was facing deportation and would be taken to St. Louis.

As they were leaving, the four ignored requests from a reporter for them to identify themselves, then got into their unmarked cars parked nearby and left.

""This is the first instance we have heard of an apprehension taking place at a Spanish- language docket. The targeting of a Spanish-language docket in a broad way would be troubling, as it might suggest that ICE officials - as we saw in Los Angeles and heard directly from their leadership in Chicago - are targeting people for the language they speak,"" said Ed Yohnka, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Guardian, 48, came to the U.S. from Mexico 25 years ago, according to his daughter. He worked in the orchards and fields around Clinton County as a picker and a rancher.

Guardian began drinking after recent stressors - a move, financial troubles and a family member's health issues, his daughter said. He was arrested in July for drinking and driving and went to in-patient treatment but was discharged after a couple of days, she said. He was arrested again a week later, again for drinking and driving.

After the second arrest, Isabel Guardian said her father, who is undocumented, gave up drinking and wanted to address the DUI charges, understanding that convictions on those charges could jeopardize his ability to get a Green Card.

His public defender advised Guardian to turn himself in to ICE, Isabel Guardian said, but her father wanted to deal with his traffic cases so that if he was deported, he could return to his family someday. That's why he showed up to court on Monday, his daughter said.

""He said he was willing to cooperate,"" Isabel Guardian said. ""He wasn't fighting them.""

All of Guardian's children have legal status, his daughter said, and his wife just received her Green Card, but Guardian remained undocumented. He was beginning the process of being documented after the rest of the family because it was expensive, Isabel Guardian said.

ICE activity seen elsewhere in Illinois

In the Metro East, Fairmont City is a village that for decades has been heavily populated by Latino immigrants - citizens, those with legal status and undocumented. ICE has been active in the area. Earlier this year, Marleen Suarez, a Fairmont City attorney, began offering free conditional guardianships for parents who are undocumented.

Suarez, who also practices criminal law, said she had three defendants scheduled to appear at Clinton County's Spanish-speaking docket, but had rescheduled them due to a scheduling conflict on Monday morning. She said she was shocked but not surprised that ICE was targeting downstate courthouses.

""I am going to advise my clients to be much more conscientious from now on,"" Suarez said. ""I will work with the staff and judiciary there to ensure the safety of my clients so we can adjudicate their cases. It's disheartening because our courthouses should be a refuge for those seeking justice.""

Yohnka, the ACLU spokesperson, said it's not just traffic dockets drawing ICE. After reports of apprehensions at Chicago's domestic violence courts, victims were failing to appear and complaints were being dropped, Yohnka said.

In Cook County, a judge issued an order two weeks ago barring the civil arrest of any ""party, witness, or potential witness"" while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and surrounding parking lots, sidewalks and entryways.

""The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,"" the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it ""common sense.""

The newly passed legislation would address immigration arrests at courthouses around the state.

In Macoupin County, Ismael Sandoval Ayuzo, owner of Caldera Bar and Grill on Main Street in Staunton located about 35 miles northeast of St. Louis, was detained by ICE this week. A message on the restaurant's front door and on their social media stated that the eatery would be closed on Wednesday.

The day before, Ayuzo, a husband and father of two who has lived in the U.S. for two decades, was delivering a computer cord to his children's school in Staunton when he was stopped and detained, his brother said. Now, his family worries he will face deportation to Mexico.

""His home is here. His daughters are here,"" said Ismael Ayuzo's brother, Rafael Ayuzo.

Ayuzo's detention launched an outcry in his hometown, planning a community event: ""We stand with Ismael."" Chelsa Pruden, co-founder of Macoupin County Indivisible and event organizer, said the restaurateur was very involved with the community and the school, including hosting a recent fundraiser for the high school band.

""This community loves him. We are a small town and this has rocked us,"" Pruden said. ""I don't think that anyone thought that ICE would come here.""

Isabel Guardian said she talked to her father on Tuesday. He was in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, awaiting deportation. His DUI cases were postponed to November but remain pending.

In Springfield, Democratic House members held a press conference at the Statehouse on Tuesday, suggesting legislative fixes such as safe zones around childcare centers, hospitals and courthouses.

""We are a nation built on liberty and due process, not fear and disappearance. No one should be taken from their family, from their home, from our courthouse, from the store or their job without cause or compassion, said Rep. Nicolle Grasse, D-Arlington Heights. ""Our community deserves real safety, the kind that comes from justice, not intimidation.""

Immigration rights groups are urging Daca recipients to wait for Hanen’s decision about the program’s future before taking any action.","A federal judge could soon decide whether tens of thousands of so-called “Dreamers” in Texas could lose their ability to work in the US legally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) immigration program – prompting fears of upheaval and heartbreak.

As part of the years-long legal battle over Daca, US district court judge Andrew Hanen is set to rule on competing proposals for the future of the Obama-era program. One of those proposals, submitted by the Trump administration, would make Daca recipients in Texas, in particular, ineligible for the work permits typically offered by the policy.

Created in 2012, Daca currently provides deportation protections and work permits to more than 500,000 immigrants who, as children, entered the US without permission or overstayed their visas. To qualify, they all had to have arrived before 2007, attend an American high school or enlist in the military, and pass background checks.

The average age of those enrolled in Daca is now 31. After California, Texas is the home to the second largest Daca population in the country, with 86,000 recipients living there.

But what has remained a lifeline for an entire generation of young adults – in the absence of Congress being willing to pass legislation to embed the protections in law – many of whom are now raising families and building professional careers, continues to be in legal peril, especially in Texas.

If Hanen approves the federal government’s plan, Daca recipients in Texas would lose their income, career opportunities and financial support, pushing them towards the shadows or out of the state. And those who move to Texas from other states could also see their Daca work permits revoked.

“It would be heartbreaking having to leave my family’s dream, my dream, everything I worked for,” said Laura Alguera, who was born in Mexico City in 1990 and came to the US at four.

“Thanks to Daca I’m a licensed cosmetologist and was able to open my own salon. How am I going to explain it to my clients, whom I have built relationships with? If I have to go to another state it would feel like I’m escaping.”

The Daca program has survived years of uncertainty. During Donald Trump’s first term, his administration tried to terminate Daca, declaring it an illegal program. But its effort was blocked, ultimately by the US supreme court, which in 2020 halted the termination on technical grounds.

But it’s currently threatened by a lawsuit filed by Republican-led states, led by Texas, that argue the policy is an overreach of executive authority.

Hanen, a federal judge in Texas, and the fifth circuit court of appeals have sided with the GOP-controlled states in recent years, finding that Daca is unlawful. The courts have so far allowed the program to continue for current recipients, closing it only to new applicants.

In its latest ruling in January, the fifth circuit agreed with Hanen that Daca is unlawful, but narrowed the impact of the order to Texas, saying the state proved it was harmed by the policy due to the costs of providing services to Dreamers.

To comply with the circuit’s order, the Trump administration submitted a proposal saying US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had developed plans to reopen Daca to new applicants in all states except Texas.

Daca has been closed to new applications since 2021 due to litigation, but those enrolled continued to renew their two-year work authorizations.

The administration’s proposal also calls for the revocation of Daca work permits in Texas, where the program’s recipients would only be eligible for deportation deferrals.

The federal government and attorneys defending Daca had opportunities to file responses to the proposal until late October.

Hanen is now reviewing the proposals submitted by the parties, which also include a request from nine Republican-led states for Daca to be completely shut down over a certain period. Hanen’s final decision is expected to be announced soon.

Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is representing Daca recipients in the federal court case, said in an interview with the Guardian that the potential termination of work permits for those in Texas would, far from saving the state money, hurt the state’s economy.

“Texas would suffer because all their highly qualified Daca recipients would choose to move elsewhere,” said Saenz, adding: “But those are the consequences of Texas deciding to entertain a challenge to Daca when, in reality, it benefits from it.”

According to a report by the American Immigration Council, more than 221,000 Texans are eligible for Daca and 97% of them are employed. Nearly 19,000 are described as entrepreneurs.

Alguera, a 32-year old mother, is a salon owner in Houston, where she lives. She and all Daca recipients in Texas pay more than $830m in state and local taxes each year, according to the American Immigration Council.

“How many years have we been following the rules, paying our taxes and we are still in this limbo? Every two years it feels like someone is playing with our feelings,” she said.

At the national level, as employers and employees, Daca recipients have contributed nearly $2.1bn each year to social security and Medicare, programs that benefit all Americans, according to a recent survey.

Since the turn of the century, lawmakers have introduced at least 20 versions of the “Dream Act”, which would place Dreamers on a path to US citizenship. Despite garnering bipartisan support, the proposals have all died in Congress.

In 2001, under Republican governance, Texas became the first state to give undocumented immigrants access to in-state tuition places at public colleges and universities, through the Texas Dream Act.

Half the states in the nation followed suit. However, the Texas law those measures were modeled on is no longer in effect.

In June, the Trump administration sued Texas over the Texas Dream Act and state officials, instead of defending it, joined the justice department in asking a federal judge to strike down the law. The federal judge agreed.

The Texas department of public safety recently suspended the issuance of commercial driver’s licenses to non-citizens, including Daca recipients. The agency then enforced English proficiency requirements for commercial drivers.

“Every commercial driver license operator on Texas roadways must be able to communicate clearly in English to ensure compliance with traffic laws, follow safety directions, and prevent accidents,” said the state governor, Greg Abbott.

Immigration rights groups are urging Daca recipients to wait for Hanen’s decision about the program’s future before taking any action.

Beyond the more than half a million people across America already enrolled in Daca, about 1.1 million people may be eligible for the policy, according to the Migration Policy Institute, including an estimated 221,000 Texans.

Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has aggressively expanded immigration raids across the country, granting deportation agents a broad mandate to target those in the country without proper documents.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f69f4f49ebba72b242bf56f65a141657ee319ea/299_0_4201_3360/master/4201.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=29f90f1bb0c9d9bc8c2b8cce055bbdc5",N,,2025-11-01 12:02:33.355993

Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center say US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have denied people being held at the Broadview facility private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from entering the building.

Such actions have created essentially a “black box” they say has allowed authorities to act “with impunity”.

Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don’t understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and face deportation, according to the lawsuit.

Alexa Van Brunt, the director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office and lead attorney for the lawsuit, said members of the public are “being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights”.

“Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” she said.

Attorneys accuse ICE, US Customs and Border Protection and their parent agency the Department of Homeland Security of violating detainees’ fifth amendment right to due process and first amendment right to legal counsel, and have asked the court to force the agencies to improve the facility’s conditions.

Advocates have for months raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Conditions in ICE holding cells across the US have proved highly controversial.

Lawyers and relatives of people held at the facility have called it a de facto detention center, where up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.

DHS previously dismissed the claims, saying those held at the facility have proper meals, medical treatment and access to communication with family members and lawyers.

The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, which have led to the arrests of numerous protesters amid an aggressive crackdown. The protests are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their first amendment rights by repeatedly using teargas and other weapons on them.

2025 has become the deadliest year for detained immigrants in federal immigration custody in two decades. EL PAÍS reported this month that at least 22 individuals have died while in ICE custody in the current fiscal year, making this the deadliest year for detained immigrants since 2005.

They have been as young as 27-years-old. Brayan Garzón-Rayo, a Colombian immigrant who died by suicide in April, “did not receive a mental health evaluation due to staffing shortages,” KCUR reported. “Jail staff found Garzón-Rayo unresponsive in his cell with a blanket wrapped around his neck on April 7, according to the ICE report.” Isidro Pérez, a 75-year-old Cuban man, died while in immigration custody after six decades in the U.S. The fishing aficionado “lived on a boat anchored near a park in Key Largo, south of Miami, and spent his days sitting on a bench in a coastal park, his family says,” EL PAÍS reported in July.

“The families of some of the deceased have denounced the fact that the victims had no prior condition that would have predicted a tragic end,” EL PAÍS noted in its October report.

One grieving mom said that she was not aware of her 39-year-old son suffering any health difficulties when he suddenly died after being jailed at Adelanto ICE Processing Center, a privately-operated detention facility in southern California. “Her son, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, died on September 22 at Victor Valley Hospital, where he was transferred from the Adelanto Detention Center in California. Ayala-Uribe was arrested on August 17 while working at a car wash in Huntington Beach, where he had been employed for 15 years.”

“The family maintains that his health was good and that they have not received an explanation as to how, in just over a month, the 39-year-old Mexican died in detention,” EL PAÍS reported in July.

And, these deaths have been coming with alarming frequency. Just two weeks after Ayala-Uribe’s death, Huabing Xie, a Chinese immigrant of unreported age, died after being detained at Imperial Regional Detention Facility, another privately-operated site in southern California, L.A. Taco reported. Detention staff “reported Xie having a seizure. He became unresponsive at 2:13 p.m. CPR was given and a defibrillator was used, administered by medical personnel on site. Xie was transported to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.” The outlet further stated that federal immigration officials actually violated their own policies on how quickly they must publicly report in-custody deaths.

“The record for deaths in ICE custody was set in 2004, a year after the immigration agency’s creation,” EL PAÍS continued in its October report. “There were 32 reported deaths that year. The following year there were 20, a figure not surpassed again until 2020, during the Covid pandemic, when 21 deaths were recorded, according to government data.” But as researchers at the American Immigration Council note, the current administration has been “deadlier for ICE detainees than COVID-19 pandemic.”

These alarming statistics, lack of transparency, and failure to follow internal guidelines come “as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years,” NPR reported. According to data from TRAC Immigration, the overwhelming majority of immigrants in federal immigration detention, 71.5%, have no criminal convictions at all. “Former agency officials are warning that increased detention population, decreased oversight, an increase in street and community arrests and continued difficulties staffing medical teams will result in more deaths,” NPR continued.

An ongoing Congressional investigation has already uncovered hundreds of credible reports of shocking human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities, including dozens of allegations of physical and sexual abuse and the mistreatment of pregnant women and children as young as two, including U.S. citizens. This includes 41 reports of physical and sexual abuse, 32 reports of abuses against pregnant women and kids, reports of denial of health care and legal representation at facilities in more than two dozen states, Puerto Rico, and even U.S. military bases in Cuba and as far away as Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.

The ongoing probe has even alleged that detention facility staffers have used solitary confinement – which is considered torture by many experts – to punish detained individuals for reporting allegations.

Following a series of complaints and lawsuits, “ICE is scrambling to hire doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers” for positions “ranging from dental hygienists through psychiatric nurse practitioners to medical risk managers and data scientists,” The Independent reported. But whether the approximately 45 new positions will make any significant impact as federal immigration officials detain an unprecedented number of immigrants remains to be seen.

ICE’s death reporting page also does not show the at least three individuals who’ve tragically lost their lives while apparently trying to flee immigration agents. Just last week in Virginia, Josué Castro Rivera was heading to a gardening job when he tried to flee ICE on foot and was hit by a vehicle on the interstate. “He had a very good heart,” his brother said. “He didn’t deserve anything that happened to him.”

As families grieve and continue to press for answers, the Disappeared In America campaign said that immigrant community members who’ve lost their lives while in ICE custody will be remembered during Day of the Dead vigils set to take place this weekend.

“These cultural and creative events uplift the sanctity of life,” said the campaign’s Disappeared In America Weekend of Action website, “and affirm that our communities will not be erased or forgotten.” Day of the Dead, or Día de Muertos, is observed from Nov. 1 to Nov. 2 and is a traditional “day of celebration, particularly for the people in Mexico and Central America, and for many Mexican Americans in the United States,” said the National Museum of the American Latino. “It is a day to honor and commemorate the lives of the dearly departed and to welcome the return of their spirits.” These celebrations typically include an ofrenda, or altar, that features photos of deceased loved ones, candles, marigolds, and even favorite food items.

Advocates erected one such ofrenda outside the privately-operated Otay Mesa Detention Center in southern California on Wednesday, Fox 5 San Diego reported. “Groups like the American Friends Service Committee, Detention Resistance, Free Them All-SD and more organized the vigil. Director of the American Friends Service Committee Pedro Rios said they want to make sure those who died in custody are not forgotten.”

“Rios said they gathered ‘to honor them and to recognize them as important because they have names, they have families that likely did not have to be under detention, we want to make sure they are not forgotten,’” the report continued. In Los Angeles, Venice Bakery’s ofrenda similarly remembers individuals who’ve died while under ICE watch.

“They were part of our community, and our community is being targeted, and they needed to be remembered,” said the bakery’s operator. “Sorry, it’s emotional because it’s my community. It’s the people I grew up with. It’s the people I see day in, day out. It’s family members. It’s my son’s friends and their family members. And that can happen to any one of us because we all look Latino. It doesn’t matter if I was born here, if I wasn’t born here, if I have papers. I look Hispanic, I look Latina. So it can happen to me, and that’s scary.”",http://americasvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-8.13.38-AM-scaled.png,N,,2025-11-01 13:01:21.308006

A federal judge on Friday ordered theTrump administration to continue to fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the ongoing government shutdown, delivering near-term relief to roughly 42 million Americans who received the aid just hours before the funding was slated to dry up.

The emergency order from U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said the Trump administration must resume SNAP benefits, which were slated to expire Nov. 1, ruling that plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit are likely to succeed on their claims that the suspension of the benefits is unlawful. She ordered the government to provide the court no later than Monday, Nov. 3, with additional details on how it plans to keep the program funded, and whether the appropriated benefits must be distributed in full or in part.

Moments later, a separate federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to continue paying for food stamps during the shutdown.

U.S. District Judge John McConnell said the administration must tap its emergency funds to pay for the SNAP benefits ""as soon as possible"" next month. He issued the emergency order from the bench Friday during an emergency court hearing in Providence.

STATES SUE TRUMP ADMIN OVER BILLIONS IN LOOMING CUTS TO SNAP, FOOD STAMPS

Talwani heard arguments Thursday from the Trump administration and from a coalition of 25 Democratic governors and state attorneys general, who sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture over its refusal to keep SNAP benefits funded during the ongoing government shutdown.

The benefits were slated to expire Nov. 1, marking the first time in 60 years that the program lapsed because of a government shutdown.

Talwani seemed sympathetic to the states’ arguments on Thursday. ""It’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people need their SNAP benefits,"" she said in court, vowing to rule as soon as possible on the matter.

She also agreed with the argument that the cuts to SNAP would be ""devastating.""

State leaders said in the lawsuit that suspending the aid would disproportionately harm some tens of millions of vulnerable and low-income Americans in their states. ""Because of USDA’s actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,"" they said in the lawsuit, filed Tuesday.

""Worse still, USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits,"" they added.

The lawsuit was filed several days after the Trump administration said last week that it would not use the Agriculture Department's roughly $5 billion contingency fund to cover the food stamp benefits provided by SNAP for the month of November.

Instead, officials said, the agency is planning to keep it on hand to respond to natural disasters.

In the near-term, the states asked Talwani to order the Trump administration to release the USDA contingency funds to help ensure there is not a lapse in SNAP program benefits beginning Nov. 1.

""Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,"" they said in the lawsuit.

The USDA, for its part, had not yet shared details on the policy decision or decision not to funnel the contingency funds to SNAP beneficiaries.

A note on its website stated simply that, ""[T]he well has run dry.""

Led by Cook County Commissioner Josina Morita, speakers addressed reporters in front of a large crowd of residents holding signs, many of which displayed the phone number for the Family Support Network hotline run by the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR).

Morita said the impromptu conference came together “in about 20 minutes,” and thanked everyone for showing up to “protect our neighbors from this terrorism and fearmongering” just hours before Halloween trick-or-treating began.

The community was already on alert after widespread reports of immigration officials in the area. Both District 65 and District 202 campuses were closed Friday to outside visitors. However, the city’s Trunk-or-Treat event at Robert Crown Community Center went on and trick-or-treating hours were not adjusted, though the city urged caution.

“Immigrants are welcome here, ICE is not,” Morita said. “I’m proud to be part of a community that has so many different people at all different levels … who are standing together to say no more, no more, no more fear, no more attacks on our neighbors.”

Other speakers included Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, who said the city’s message to ICE is to “get the hell out of Evanston,” District 65 Superintendent Angel Turner, District 65 social worker Allie Harned, Skokie parent Christopher Whitaker, Skokie Mayor Ann Tennes, the Rev. Michael Nabors, ICIRR Senior Director of Organizing Demian Kogan and U.S. Rep Jan Schakowsky (9th District). A RoundTable livestream of the full conference can be viewed here.

During his remarks, Kogan encouraged residents to seek out and join any rapid response teams active in their neighborhoods, “and if you are in an area where one does not exist, start one.”

“Anywhere ICE agents go, they need to see the people that are watching them and documenting their illegal activity,” Kogan said. “We know that when they go to another neighborhood, we’ll be there too, while also building community here.”

A couple hours earlier, two vehicles driven by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents; and man and woman in a red sedan crashed at Oakton and Asbury, after which the agents pulled the driver out and arrested her and at least two others. A crowd of residents and rapid responders confronted the agents before Evanston Police arrived on scene.

People here are concerned about suburban issues like traffic, rapid development and gas prices.

It's a red area represented by a Republican in Congress. But an election Tuesday will determine whether the state redraws congressional lines and divides people here into districts likely to elect Democrats to the U.S. House.

""We want to keep our communities that are alike together, right? And so if we get sucked into Sacramento or, you know, somewhere, we don't share the same needs, right?"" says Amanda Cortez, a Republican who serves on the Loomis Town Council.

The result of the election in California on Tuesday could determine not only who represents Cortez and her neighbors in Loomis, but who controls the U.S. House after the midterm elections next year.

California's ballot question was a reaction to Trump's redistricting push

This summer President Trump set off a national redistricting race, starting in Texas, to boost chances for GOP candidates in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina Republicans also redistricted and Trump is urging leaders in Indiana, Kansas and other states to follow. Democrats say the GOP is gerrymandering in ways that dilute the votes of Black and Latino communities.

California's redistricting proposal, Proposition 50, would redraw the state's congressional map to help yield up to five new seats for Democrats. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom set it in motion after Texas Republicans moved to get the edge in five seats in their state.

Republicans in California could pay the price. Mike Murray, another Republican voter in the third Congressional district that Loomis is in, says the ballot proposal will dilute his community's voice by splitting the county into three separate districts.

""If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would. But we choose to live here. And when we choose to live here, we hope that somebody will represent us in our way of life,"" Murray said.

Eric Schickler, co-director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, says opponents of California's redistricting plan are concerned it will sideline the state's independent citizens redistricting commission, which has helped give their communities a voice.

""The basic argument made by opponents of Prop 50 is that the non-partisan process that was set up in 2008 for the legislature and 2010 for Congress has worked well for the state. It's giving rise to more competitive elections,"" Schickler said.

Democrats see a chance to counter Trump's national agenda

But for proponents, mainly Democrats, California's special election is all about Congress and the Trump administration.

""To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump, well, you need a Democratic House to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making,"" Schickler added.

Cyan Samone lives in Truckee, California near Lake Tahoe, a blue dot in the same Republican congressional district as the town of Loomis.

At a recent gathering of local Democrats organizing to support Prop 50, Samone said the redistricting is a chance to push back on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

""I have a lot of friends who are immigrants from different countries who have left authoritarian regimes,"" said Samone. ""You see the patterns and you just don't want to see that happen here and I don't want to have to see people who fled terrible situations having to run again.""

Samone's husband, Ben Woodard, says redistricting could mean Democrats here are able to elect a representative that'll pay more attention to what his community needs.

""The Democratic Party representative would do that,"" Woodard said. ""Look over our interests like, you know, the cuts to Medicare definitely impact rural health care.""

CARLYLE, Ill. — When Jose Jeronimo Guardian showed up at a Spanish language traffic court this week, he didn’t expect to be detained and face expulsion from a country he’d lived in for more than two decades.

Guardian, 48, was scheduled to appear Monday in a courtroom where a county-provided translator would aid communication with about a dozen Spanish-speaking defendants who face charges from traffic infractions like his — two charges of driving under the influence of alcohol — to serious felony charges.

Guardian never made it into the courtroom.

Instead, an agent who said he was from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement questioned him in a lobby of the Clinton County Courthouse, handcuffed him, then loaded him into the back of an unmarked car and drove him to a Missouri detention center where he would await deportation.

Detentions at state and county courthouses would be banned under legislation passed early Friday morning. The state legislature approved a bill barring immigration arrests in and around county courthouses, and nearby parking lots and sidewalks. House Bill 1312, which would also allow Illinois residents to sue for civil rights violations, still must be signed by Gov. JB Pritzker.

Though instances of ICE detentions in Illinois have been centered on Chicago since President Donald Trump began “Operation Midway Blitz” in September, Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday there has been an uptick recently in ICE activity in central and southern Illinois.

“They are literally targeting people who are brown and Black, whether you are undocumented or not, and they are tackling people, detaining people for hours, zip-tying people who are U.S. citizens. So, they’re indiscriminately grabbing people who don’t look like the ICE agents, typically, and holding them or mistreating them,” Pritzker said.

Clinton County, where Guardian was detained, is a rural area 45 miles east of St. Louis. It is overwhelmingly white with just 4% of the population reporting they are Latino, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

ICE says he was deported three times

Guardian was detained in a lobby outside the Clinton County Circuit Clerk’s Office as he headed up the stairs to the courtroom when he was approached by four men who said they were ICE agents. They asked his name, then put handcuffs on him. One of the men who identified himself as an immigration agent said Guardian has been deported three times before — an allegation his daughter refuted.

As a reporter captured Guardian’s detention on video, one of the men asked a court bailiff to get the reporter to stop recording. The bailiff declined, saying video recording was allowed in public areas outside of the courtroom.

The purported federal agents walked out of the courthouse with Guardian, tailed by his daughter, Isabel, who was holding her baby. Guardian was placed in the back of one of the cars. Isabel Guardian asked for her father’s phone, then asked where they were taking him.

One of the men responded that her father was facing deportation and would be taken to St. Louis.

As they were leaving, the four ignored requests from a reporter for them to identify themselves, then got into their unmarked cars parked nearby and left.

“This is the first instance we have heard of an apprehension taking place at a Spanish- language docket. The targeting of a Spanish-language docket in a broad way would be troubling, as it might suggest that ICE officials — as we saw in Los Angeles and heard directly from their leadership in Chicago — are targeting people for the language they speak,” said Ed Yohnka, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Guardian, 48, came to the U.S. from Mexico 25 years ago, according to his daughter. He worked in the orchards and fields around Clinton County as a picker and a rancher.

Guardian began drinking after recent stressors — a move, financial troubles and a family member’s health issues, his daughter said. He was arrested in July for drinking and driving and went to in-patient treatment but was discharged after a couple of days, she said. He was arrested again a week later, again for drinking and driving.

After the second arrest, Isabel Guardian said her father, who is undocumented, gave up drinking and wanted to address the DUI charges, understanding that convictions on those charges could jeopardize his ability to get a Green Card.

His public defender advised Guardian to turn himself in to ICE, Isabel Guardian said, but her father wanted to deal with his traffic cases so that if he was deported, he could return to his family someday. That’s why he showed up to court on Monday, his daughter said.

“He said he was willing to cooperate,” Isabel Guardian said. “He wasn’t fighting them.”

All of Guardian’s children have legal status, his daughter said, and his wife just received her Green Card, but Guardian remained undocumented. He was beginning the process of being documented after the rest of the family because it was expensive, Isabel Guardian said.

ICE activity seen elsewhere in Illinois

In the Metro East, Fairmont City is a village that for decades has been heavily populated by Latino immigrants — citizens, those with legal status and undocumented. ICE has been active in the area. Earlier this year, Marleen Suarez, a Fairmont City attorney, began offering free conditional guardianships for parents who are undocumented.

Suarez, who also practices criminal law, said she had three defendants scheduled to appear at Clinton County’s Spanish-speaking docket, but had rescheduled them due to a scheduling conflict on Monday morning. She said she was shocked but not surprised that ICE was targeting downstate courthouses.

“I am going to advise my clients to be much more conscientious from now on,” Suarez said. “I will work with the staff and judiciary there to ensure the safety of my clients so we can adjudicate their cases. It’s disheartening because our courthouses should be a refuge for those seeking justice.”

Yohnka, the ACLU spokesperson, said it’s not just traffic dockets drawing ICE. After reports of apprehensions at Chicago’s domestic violence courts, victims were failing to appear and complaints were being dropped, Yohnka said.

In Cook County, a judge issued an order two weeks ago barring the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and surrounding parking lots, sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

The newly passed legislation would address immigration arrests at courthouses around the state.

In Macoupin County, Ismael Sandoval Ayuzo, owner of Caldera Bar and Grill on Main Street in Staunton located about 35 miles northeast of St. Louis, was detained by ICE this week. A message on the restaurant’s front door and on their social media stated that the eatery would be closed on Wednesday.

The day before, Ayuzo, a husband and father of two who has lived in the U.S. for two decades, was delivering a computer cord to his children’s school in Staunton when he was stopped and detained, his brother said. Now, his family worries he will face deportation to Mexico.

“His home is here. His daughters are here,” said Ismael Ayuzo’s brother, Rafael Ayuzo.

Ayuzo’s detention launched an outcry in his hometown, planning a community event: “We stand with Ismael.” Chelsa Pruden, co-founder of Macoupin County Indivisible and event organizer, said the restaurateur was very involved with the community and the school, including hosting a recent fundraiser for the high school band.

“This community loves him. We are a small town and this has rocked us,” Pruden said. “I don’t think that anyone thought that ICE would come here.”

Isabel Guardian said she talked to her father on Tuesday. He was in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, awaiting deportation. His DUI cases were postponed to November but remain pending.

In Springfield, Democratic House members held a press conference at the Statehouse on Tuesday, suggesting legislative fixes such as safe zones around childcare centers, hospitals and courthouses.

“We are a nation built on liberty and due process, not fear and disappearance. No one should be taken from their family, from their home, from our courthouse, from the store or their job without cause or compassion, said Rep. Nicolle Grasse, D-Arlington Heights. “Our community deserves real safety, the kind that comes from justice, not intimidation.”

Soon, according to the newly published procurement document, private sector ICE contractors will surveil and confirm the home or work addresses of tens of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. and then report their locations back to the government.

Under the plan, bounty hunters may receive “monetary bonuses” depending on how successfully they track down their targets — and how many immigrants they then report to ICE.

According to the document, which solicits information from interested contractors for a potentially forthcoming contract opportunity, companies hired by ICE will be given bundles of information on 10,000 immigrants at a time to locate, with further assignments provided in “increments of 10,000 up to 1,000,000.”

The solicitation says ICE is considering “monetary bonuses” paid out based on performance.

The solicitation says ICE is “exploring an incentive based pricing structure” to encourage quick results, with “monetary bonuses” paid out based on performance. For example, ICE says contractors might get paid a bonus for identifying a person’s correct address on the first try or finding 90 percent of its targets within a set timeframe. (ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

The document closely resembles a plan reportedly circulated by a group of military contractors, including former Blackwater CEO and Trump ally Erik Prince.

In February, Politico reported that Prince and other were pushing for the formation of a private efforts to locate immigrants and a “bounty program which provides a cash reward for each illegal alien held by a state or local law enforcement officer,” according pitch materials obtained by the outlet.

The proposal called for “skip-tracing,” a method of using available information to locate people — something ICE is already handing out multimillion-dollar contracts for, according to a recent report in The Lever.

Soon, according to the newly published procurement document, private sector ICE contractors will surveil and confirm the home or work addresses of tens of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. and then report their locations back to the government.

“DHS ICE has an immediate need for Skip Tracing and Process Serving Services using Government furnished case data with identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation services, to verify alien address information, investigate alternative alien address information, confirm the new location of aliens, and deliver materials/documents to aliens as appropriate,” according to the October 31 request for information.

Data provided by ICE will include “case data” provided by the government, location data, social media information, as well as “photos and documents” showing where a person lives or works. With this in hand, contractors will surveil their target to confirm the accuracy of their home address, including “time-stamped photographs of the location,” before reporting back to ICE.

“The vendor should prioritize the alien’s residence,” the document notes, “but failing that will attempt to verify place of employment.”

The plan entails not just on-the-ground monitoring but the use of digital surveillance. ICE says contractors can use off-the-shelf surveillance technology to confirm immigrants’ addresses, including “Enhanced location research, which entails automated and manual real-time skip tracing.”

Surveillance tools that ingest and track mobile phone location data are widely available on the private market, many of them already used by ICE.

“Multiple verification sources are recommended to achieve a high confidence level,” the document says, encouraging potential vendors to use “all technology systems available.”

The new procurement document notes that “the Government is contemplating awarding contracts to multiple vendors” due to the large number of immigrants whose whereabouts it seeks to confirm.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2195569259-1-e1761954223923.jpg?fit=4000%2C2000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-11-01 12:02:20.277495

Brooke Jackson, lawyers tried to show a pattern and a practice since President Trump took office of ICE not following the law.
The federal government argued there wasn’t “standing” in this case, which means it wasn’t appropriate to bring to a federal court for relief.
But Judge Jackson seemed skeptical of that argument and asked why they didn’t just stipulate that ICE follows the law that is in the books.
At one point, Jackson said it appeared Davies didn’t understand the law he purports to follow every day.
Under oath, Davies mangled the two reasons a person should be detained without a warrant nationally.","A top-ranking Colorado Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervisor testified Friday that the man and two children stopped and detained in Durango earlier this week were initially mistaken for someone ICE was targeting — but were grabbed and detained by the agency anyway.

Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, 45, and his two children, identified in court as J, a 12-year-old girl in middle school in Durango and K, a 15-year-old boy, were picked up en route to school on Monday and now they are now in Dilley Detention Center in Texas. That’s the only ICE holding facility nationally that accommodates families.

ICE Supervisor Gregory Davies told a judge on Friday in a separate civil case on warrantless detentions that his understanding was that Jaramillo-Solano is what ICE called a “collateral arrest” and that they didn’t have a warrant for him, but they took him in anyway.

It actually played into the hand of the argument made over the past two days in court by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado in their newest federal lawsuit against the Trump administration. The ACLU has filed suit arguing ICE fails to assess whether people are at risk of fleeing before detaining them for weeks and sometimes months.

Their four plaintiffs had similar circumstances before they were detained by ICE: they were all in the country without status, they had no criminal records, they had long ties to their respective communities and families and they didn’t pose any known public safety risk.

In a two-day hearing in front of the federal U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson, lawyers tried to show a pattern and a practice since President Trump took office of ICE not following the law. That has already resulted in a consent decree imposed by a federal judge in Illinois, where ICE was failing to properly document why someone is a flight risk and therefore should be detained. That’s the same complaint being made against the agency in Colorado.

In court on Friday, plaintiffs lawyer Kenzo Kawanabe showed a number of I-213 forms, which are filled out at the time of arresting an undocumented immigrant, to the judge. Those forms were supposed to show why the various people were considered a flight risk. The forms entered into evidence didn’t have that information.

The federal government argued there wasn’t “standing” in this case, which means it wasn’t appropriate to bring to a federal court for relief. Department of Justice lawyer Logan Brown said the four plaintiffs in the lawsuit would have a “vanishingly small” chance of being arrested again without a warrant and the plaintiffs’ lawyers couldn’t prove future injury.

But Judge Jackson seemed skeptical of that argument and asked why they didn’t just stipulate that ICE follows the law that is in the books.

“They’re not challenging the actual policy,” Brown said, of the plaintiffs’ attorneys.

“They want you to follow your own policy,” Jackson said.

One of the plaintiffs who testified, Caroline Dias Goncalves, was stopped in Mesa County this summer. Goncalves is a University of Utah student and was brought here as a child by her parents from Brazil. Her flight risk or her individual life circumstances did not appear to be assessed by immigration officials before she was detained for two weeks.

Brown, who was representing ICE, said that Goncalves was driving in Colorado, which is out of state from her home and that ICE knew she was a “visa overstayer,” which was enough for a warrantless arrest.

“That’s what your client thinks is enough,” Jackson said. “That’s not what this court thinks is enough.”

While Jackson didn’t rule immediately after the two-day hearing, at times he was openly skeptical of the government’s defense that they already follow the law. At one point, Jackson said it appeared Davies didn’t understand the law he purports to follow every day. Under oath, Davies mangled the two reasons a person should be detained without a warrant nationally.

“There is a policy and these guys don’t follow it, they may just not know what it is,” Jackson said. “I think it’s reasonable that the policy they’re really following is what the supervisors are telling them to do, and the supervisors are saying go arrest people, as many as you can get!”

When she asked Bovino how many officers involved in the immigration enforcement crackdown in the Chicago area wore body cameras, he told her most of them.","CHICAGO (CN) — The Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday overturned a federal judge’s order requiring border boss Greg Bovino to give daily immigration enforcement reports, calling it an infringement on the separation of powers.

After grilling the border commander on Tuesday over repeated violations of her previous temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis had ordered Bovino to appear in her courtroom daily at 5:45 p.m.

The order had prohibited Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from using tear gas or other non-lethal munitions on peaceful protestors, religious leaders and journalists.

Department of Justice attorneys appeared frazzled in court Tuesday after Ellis issued her order and swiftly appealed it to the Seventh Circuit, which initially stayed the order.

In an order granting the Justice Department’s petition for a writ of mandamus, the Seventh Circuit said Friday that Ellis’ order “puts the court in the position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator of the parties’ adversarial presentations.”

“It sets the court up as a supervisor of Chief Bovino’s activities, intruding into personnel management decisions of the Executive Branch. These two problems are related and lead us to conclude that the order infringes on the separation of powers. Review by appeal at the end of the case would not solve the problems created in the interim, which justifies review by a prerogative writ,” the court continued in its brief order.

The Seventh Circuit only ruled on Ellis’ requirement that Bovino provide her with daily reports of his immigration enforcement activities, but not the underlying temporary restraining order, which is also up for review by the court.

The Barack Obama appointee’s Tuesday order came after an hour of her chiding Bovino for multiple instances of excessive force, including one where federal immigration authorities tear gassed an Old Irving Park residential street, just moments before a children’s Halloween parade, which was subsequently cancelled.

“Kids dressed in Halloween costumes walking to a parade do not elicit an immediate threat to the safety of a law enforcement officer,"" Ellis said to Bovino in court Tuesday. “They just don’t.”

Ellis had spent much of Tuesday’s hearing reiterating the terms of her temporary restraining order, which she issued after multiple faith leaders, journalists and peaceful protestors were tear gassed at the Broadview immigration processing facility.

Federal immigration authorities also fired rubber bullets, at reporters and directly at the head of a priest at the facility, which has been at the center of much of the conflict between protestors and law enforcement since the start of “Operation Midway Blitz.”

She also highlighted that officers haven’t been wearing identification or body cameras. When she asked Bovino how many officers involved in the immigration enforcement crackdown in the Chicago area wore body cameras, he told her most of them. But when she asked him if he had a body camera, he said he did not. She ordered Bovino to get a body camera and its commensurate training by Friday.

Attorneys on behalf of the protestors, journalists and religious leaders on Tuesday also asked Ellis to prohibit federal immigration authorities from using tear gas until the full preliminary injunction hearing on Nov. 5, which she declined. She said she can’t see agents deploying a whole lot of tear gas considering the talk she had with Bovino.

“I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed or pepper balls are being deployed,” she said. “Alright? I expect everybody to act reasonably.”","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/bovino-with-officers.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-11-01 18:17:26.385803

Immigration and Border Patrol officers have arrested more than 3,000 people who authorities say were in the U.S. illegally and in some cases wanted for serious crimes, all in the seven weeks since feds intensified their efforts in the state.

Attorneys consulted by NBC Chicago, however, say federal authorities have refused — or are unable — to disclose where many of those detainees are being held or whether they have already been deported.

""It is quite dire,"" said Mark Fleming of the National Immigrant Justice Center, which is suing federal authorities. ""These are folks that have been here for decades, have long standing ties to the community, family members, employment, businesses that are all being torn apart.""

Fleming said he believes the government is arresting people, placing them into ""unlawful mandatory detention,"" then pressuring them into so-called voluntary departure — in which detainees waive legal rights and return to their home countries. Homeland Security officials have not released a full list of arrestees or deportations.

Separately, attorneys filed new motions Monday to block federal agents from using tear gas in Chicago, citing repeated alleged violations of an existing restraining order. ABC7 Chicago reported that complaints have come from multiple neighborhoods, with residents — including a pregnant woman — expressing concern about health impacts.

The filings reference Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has overseen Midway Blitz operations. In a recent ABC News interview, Bovino confirmed nearly 3,000 arrests since the crackdown began and defended the use of chemical agents as ""the least amount of force necessary.""

Bovino is scheduled to appear before Judge Sarah Ellis to explain his actions as court filings accuse him of violating restrictions by deploying chemical agents without audible warning. DHS has said Bovino was struck by an object thrown by protesters, though plaintiffs dispute that account.

Additional court documents describe multiple recent incidents in which agents allegedly used force, including during a neighborhood Halloween parade. Plaintiffs say federal officers tackled residents and repeatedly deployed tear gas without warning. DHS said in a statement that ""rioters and terrorists"" have attacked officers and that ICE and CBP personnel ""use the minimum amount of force necessary.""

The court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers.

Ellis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order before further freezing it Friday.

Meanwhile, Illinois advocates in a different case Friday sued federal authorities for what they described as “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.

Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have denied people being held at the Broadview facility private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from entering the building, creating a “black box” they say has allowed authorities to act “with impunity.”

Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don’t understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and face deportation, according to the lawsuit.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office and lead attorney for the lawsuit, said community members are “being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights.”

“Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” she said.

Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the assertions and said such allegations have contributed to an increase in death threats against immigration officers. She said people are held only briefly before being transferred to detention facilities.

“Any claims there are subprime conditions at the Broadview ICE facility are false. All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers,” the statement said. “No one is denied access to proper medical care. There is a privacy wall around the toilet for detainees.”

Attorneys accuse ICE, DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection of violating detainees’ constitutional rights to due process and access to a lawyer and have asked the court to force the agencies to improve the facility’s conditions.

The 76-page lawsuit paints a bleak picture of the facility, which attorneys say is “extremely cramped” and “smells strongly of feces, urine, and body odor,” while insects were found in the sinks and clogged toilets led to urine on the floor. One man described people lying on top of each other and in the bathroom, unable to find space to sleep.

“They treated us like animals, or worse than animals, because no one treats their pets like that,” one woman said in the lawsuit.

Several people said they were detained at the processing center for durations ranging from a couple days to three weeks.

Advocates have for months raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.

The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, which have led to the arrests of numerous protesters. The protests are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them.

Ellis sided with the coalition earlier this month, requiring federal agents in the Chicago area to wear badges and banning them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. Later, Ellis also required body cameras for agents who have them after raising concerns about her initial order not being followed.

Will it survive a legal challenge?,"Jenny Jarvie, www.latimes.com, jenny-jarvie",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-01/why-prop-50-likely-to-survive-legal-challenge-despite-disenfranchising-some-california-voters,"Experts say opponents of Proposition 50 have no viable federal legal challenge against the new maps on the basis that they disenfranchise a large chunk of California Republicans.
Even since the 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision Rucho vs. Common Cause, complaints of partisan gerrymandering have no path in federal court.
One route would be to claim that Proposition 50 violates the California Constitution.
David A. Carrillo, executive director of the California Constitution Center at Berkeley Law, said that if Proposition 50 passes, he expects a barrage of “see what sticks” lawsuits raising California constitutional claims.
Another option is a narrower bill proposed this summer by Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe and could lose his seat if Proposition 50 passes.","Six years ago, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld highly partisan state election maps in North Carolina and Maryland — ruling that federal courts cannot block states from drawing up maps that favor one party over the other — one of the court’s liberal justices issued a warning.

“If left unchecked, gerrymanders like the ones here may irreparably damage our system of government,” Associate Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissent.

Kagan argued that Republicans in North Carolina and Democrats in Maryland — the two examples before the court — had rigged elections in a way that “deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights,” “debased and dishonored our democracy” and turned “upside-down the core American idea that all governmental power derives from the people.”

“Ask yourself,” Kagan said as she recounted what had happened in each state: “Is this how American democracy is supposed to work?”

That’s the question Californians are now weighing as they decide how, or whether, to vote on Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to scrap congressional maps drawn by the state’s independent redistricting commission and replace them with maps drawn by legislators to favor Democrats through 2030.

Democrats don’t deny that the measure is a deliberate attempt to dilute GOP voting power.

From the start, they’ve argued that the point of redistricting is to weaken Republicans’ voting power in California — a move they justify on the grounds that it is a temporary fix to offset similar partisan gerrymandering by Texas Republicans. This summer, President Trump upped the ante, pressing Texas to rejigger maps to shore up the GOP’s narrow House majority ahead of the 2026 election.

Experts say opponents of Proposition 50 have no viable federal legal challenge against the new maps on the basis that they disenfranchise a large chunk of California Republicans. Even since the 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision Rucho vs. Common Cause, complaints of partisan gerrymandering have no path in federal court.

Already, Proposition 50 has survived challenges in state court and is unlikely to be successfully challenged if passed, said Richard L. Hasen, professor of law and director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA School of Law.

“If you’re a Republican in California, or you’re a Democrat in Texas, you’re about to get a lot less representation in Congress,” Hasen said. “I don’t think there’s anything you can do about that.”

If Californians vote in favor of the measure on Tuesday, the number of Republicans in the state’s House — nine of 52 total members — would likely be reduced by five. That could mean Republicans have less than 10% of California’s congressional representation even though Trump won 38% of the 2024 vote.

“All of this is unconstitutional, but the federal courts aren’t available to help,” said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School.

“Every time you redraw a district specifically to protect some candidates and punish others,” Levitt said, “what you’re basically saying is it shouldn’t be up to the voters to weigh in on whether they think the candidates are doing a good job or not.”

Possible legal avenues

But even if the issue of partisan gerrymandering is blocked in federal courts, there are other potential legal avenues to challenge California’s new legislative maps.

One route would be to claim that Proposition 50 violates the California Constitution.

David A. Carrillo, executive director of the California Constitution Center at Berkeley Law, said that if Proposition 50 passes, he expects a barrage of “see what sticks” lawsuits raising California constitutional claims. They stand little chance of success, he said.

“Voters created the redistricting commission,” he said. “What the voters created they can change or abolish.”

Attorneys might also bring racial discrimination claims in federal court alleging California lawmakers used partisan affiliation as a pretext for race in drawing the maps to disenfranchise one racial group or another, Carrillo said. Under current law, he said, such claims are very fact-dependent.

Attorneys are already poised to file complaints if the referendum passes.

Mark Meuser, a conservative attorney who filed a state complaint this summer seeking to block Proposition 50, said he is ready to file a federal lawsuit on the grounds that the new maps violate the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

“We’re saying that race was a predominant factor in drawing the lines,” Meuser said. “When race is a predominant factor in drawing the lines without a compelling interest, strict scrutiny will mandate the maps be stricken.”

Some legal experts believe that would be a tricky case to prove.

“It sure seems like the new map was oriented predominantly around politics, not race,” Levitt argued. “And though they’d be saying that race was a predominant factor in drawing the lines, that’s very, very, very different from proving it. That’s an uphill mountain to climb on these facts.”

Some experts think the new maps are unlikely to raise strong Voting Rights Act challenges.

Eric McGhee, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California who specializes in elections, said the new districts appeared to have been carefully carved to preserve Latino- or Black-majority districts.

A successful challenge is possible, McGhee said, noting there are always novel legal arguments. “It’s just the big ones that you would think about that are the most obvious and the most traditional are pretty closed,” he said.

Supreme Court looms large

Ultimately, legal experts agree the fate of California maps — and other maps in Texas and across the nation — would depend on the Supreme Court’s upcoming ruling on a redistricting case from Louisiana.

Last month, conservative Supreme Court justices suggested in a hearing that they were considering reining in a key part of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act that prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.

“Whatever happens with Proposition 50 — pass or fail — almost doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things,” Carrillo said, noting that the Supreme Court could use the Louisiana case to strike Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. “There’s a big litigation storm coming in almost any scenario.”

Levitt agreed that the Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act, which could come any time between now and June, could change current law. But he stressed it is impossible to predict how broad the ruling could be.

“Whether that leaves any of California’s districts vulnerable — either in the current map or in the map if Prop. 50 passes — depends entirely on what Scotus says,” Levitt argued. “There are only nine people who know what they’ll actually say, and there are a lot of possibilities, some of which might affect California’s map pretty substantially, and some of which are unlikely to affect California’s map at all.”

Will Congress intervene?

As the redistricting battle spreads across the country and Democratic and Republican states look to follow Texas and California, Democrats could ultimately end up at a disadvantage. If the overall tilt favors Republicans, Democrats would have to win more than 50% of the vote to get a majority of seats.

Congress has the power to block partisan gerrymandering in congressional map drawing. But attempts so far to pass redistricting reform have been unsuccessful.

In 2022, the House passed the Freedom to Vote Act, which would have prohibited mid-decade redistricting and blocked partisan gerrymandering of congressional maps. But Republicans were able to block the bill in the Senate, even though it had majority support, due to that chamber’s filibuster rules.

Another option is a narrower bill proposed this summer by Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe and could lose his seat if Proposition 50 passes. Kiley’s bill, along with similar legislation introduced by California Democratic representatives, would ban mid-decade redistricting.

“That would be the cleanest way of addressing this particular scenario we’re in right now, because all of these new plans that have been drawn would become null and void,” McGhee said.

But in a heavily deadlocked Congress, Kiley’s bill has little prospect of moving.

“It may have to get worse before it gets better,” Hasen said.

If the redistricting war doesn’t get resolved, Hasen said, there will be a continued race to the bottom, particularly if the Supreme Court weakens or strikes down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Another scenario, Hasen argued, is Democrats regain control of Congress and the presidency, overcome the filibuster rule and pass redistricting reform.

If that doesn’t happen, Levitt said, the ultimate power rests with the people.

“If we want to tell our representatives that we’re sick of this, we can,” Levitt said. “There’s a lot that’s competing for voters’ attention. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t have agency here.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/37b56fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7779x4084+0+623/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2Fa1%2F0fe3f51744dd80938758ad78c79a%2F1523944-me-human-chain-standalone-cmh-04.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 06:56:25.262007

The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a U.N. organization.

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk's office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: ""These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.""

She said Türk believed ""airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.""

President Trump has justified the attacks on what his administration calls ""narco-trafficking vessels"" as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S., but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign on Wednesday. He said it targeted a boat carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Four people on board the vessel were killed. It was the 14th strike and the 15th boat destroyed since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.

In some but not all of the strikes, U.S. officials have said the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a terrorist organization.

The administration announced just weeks ago that it had determined the U.S. is in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aargua.

The administration announced that determination in a notification to Congress in September, after the first couple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Mediterranean. That notice referred to three individuals killed in a Sept. 15 strike as ""unlawful combatants,"" which is the same term former President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks.

After Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force against the terrorist organizations responsible for the terrorist attacks carried out that day. Congress has not yet authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels, and many details of the operations remain unclear, including which U.S. forces are carrying out the strikes, based on what specific intelligence, and with what weapons.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has been among the most vocal critics of the strikes, questioning their legality under international law, and their efficacy in combating the gangs that traffic narcotics during an interview with CBS News. The Trump administration sanctioned Petro last week, saying he had allowed ""drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.""

Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by ""careful limits"" placed on the use of lethal force.

Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing ""an imminent threat to life,"" she said. ""Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.""

The strikes are taking place ""outside the context"" of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/03/c9624818-4187-4cd5-90f2-3daf629661fc/thumbnail/1200x630/d868188413fb260dbe1bae195f978fb6/venezuela-screenshot-2025-10-03-130743.png,N,,2025-11-01 07:16:50.639904

During the week of March 27, 2023, a prolific Canadian smuggler contacted Square to smuggle a Romanian family of four across the St. Lawrence River into the United States. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Square is alleged to have recruited multiple co-conspirators to assist with the smuggling of the family, though one refused to assist due to the high winds on the St. Lawrence River that night. Undeterred by the dangerous weather conditions, as alleged, Square enlisted one of her regular drivers, Dakota Montour, to transport the family via automobile to Timothy Oakes’ residence on Cornwall Island, a notorious staging area for cross-border smuggling operations.

The family of four arrived at the Oakes’ residence on March 29, 2023, at approximately 3:35AM, and stayed there until evening. On March 29, 2023, at approximately 9:29PM, Timothy Oakes’ vehicle with a light blue boat in tow, is recorded traveling eastbound away from the Oakes’ residence towards a public boat launch.

On March 29, 2023, between 10:09PM and 10:50PM, the Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service (AMPS) received multiple calls from citizens on Cornwall Island reporting hearing cries for help on the St. Lawrence River. The callers also reported the terrible weather conditions. At the same time, Square instructed Montour to search the banks of the St. Lawrence River for the missing family. On March 30, 2023, at approximately 3:36AM, Square instructed Montour to delete all their messages.

Between March 30 and 31, 2023, AMPS conducted a riverine search and recovered the bodies of the Romanian family of four, including two small children. AMPS also recovered Oakes’ light blue boat. The body of the boat captain, Case Oakes, was found eight months later.

HSI Massena engaged in an extensive years-long investigation of the case, with assistance from the U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C., CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force, New York State Police, Canada Border Services Agency, Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service, St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Police Department, Ontario Provincial Police, Sûreté du Québec, St. Lawrence County Sheriff’s Department, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Cornwall Police Service. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant support with foreign legal assistance requests.

The investigation is a result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and other transnational criminal organizations and eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating within the Americas that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the border, including the Northern District of New York. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 420 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 370 U.S. convictions; more than 315 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

Democrats--We will acquiesce on woke, pronouns, gay rights, human rights, voting rights, fair taxation, economic security, health-care issues, reasonable immigration laws, protections for the poor, the hungry, and the homeless. And, oh yeah, reasonable gun legislation.

It shouldn't happen

Many Americans have never thought they would be food insecure, but some 500,000 federal workers will not be getting the paychecks they were promised. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) serves about 40 million parents with children, the elderly, and non-elderly disabled people. Today, these benefits could stop. Combine the federal workers with the SNAP recipients, add the people who were already food insecure, then add all the federal workers who were fired by the current administration for no apparent reason, and we have a lot of people who will be hungry. Food banks nationwide will be overwhelmed. Thousands of first-time users will be lining up. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom will deploy the National Guard to stand watch at food banks to protect the volunteers.

What a shame this is! In a country with so much, this should not be happening. What can we all do to help? If you have the means, give generously to local food banks. If your church runs a food bank, make your weekly offering substantial and designate it to go to the food bank. Do not keep blinders on and hope this situation will resolve itself quickly. Do whatever you can to help lessen the impact of Donald Trump's policies. Per John Wesley, ""Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.""

Immigrants pay taxes

Charles Vermont of Bentonville wrote that Democrats had let ""tens of millions of unvetted immigrants into the country with no thought of the cost."" I guess he never read that in 2022, those immigrants that he seems to abhor paid $25.7 billion into Social Security and $6.4 billion into Medicare, programs from which they can never draw. Actually, those immigrants' money is ""propping up"" both. In addition to those two amounts, they paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state, and local taxes. This information came from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP). If you doubt it, check it.

Now, look at it like this, Mr. Vermont: All those billions that federal, state, and local entities rely on and those billions that were helping old folks who depend on both Social Security and Medicare for income and health care are now lost because the immigrants who were paying them have been sent out of the country. You think that is a smart move?

Inviting fear and hate

America is in the midst of deeply unsettling societal change. Globalization and AI-driven automation have created significant economic insecurity. Malignant political polarization has enticed many news outlets to emphasize ""red or blue"" versions of truth. The Russian president is boasting about his country's nuclear capabilities. Existential fear is rising.

Laboratory animals exposed to random mild electrical shocks will soon begin to attack one another, mistakenly viewing the ""other"" as the cause of their discomfort. We humans are not immune to blaming others. Increasingly politicians exploit our fears and exaggerate our differences for political gain. Social media algorithms aim to capture and monetize our attention and ignore the damage of leading us down rabbit holes of anger and division. Cultural cohesion is being shattered by our willingness to join the ""red or blue army"" and ignore our common values.

""They"" too have sleepless nights when their children are ill. ""They"" don't ask about political leanings when an injured person needs help. ""They"" too have deep anxiety when their job security is threatened. We share many more values than we take the time to realize.

Our politicians hone their performative skills in a self-defeating tragicomedy of ""blaming"" others. They too are human, caught in the storm of political division and trying to survive. If we fail to awaken from this soulless, nation-destroying battle, a crushing tragedy will befall our children.

Fear and anger can cloud our basic goodness and bring forth our darkest and most dangerous emotion: hate. Any politician that invites us to feel fear and hate toward other citizens clearly lacks moral clarity and is attempting to exploit us for political purposes. If seduced by hate, lurking in that darkness is the potential for unimaginable cruelty. Being mean and coldhearted reveals underlying cowardice; being kind requires confidence and courage.

California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017.","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Illinois lawmakers have sent Gov. JB Pritzker legislation prohibiting federal authorities from making immigration arrests near courthouses, but even one of the measure's top sponsors questions whether it can survive a court challenge.

The proposal adopted early Friday also allows lawsuits when people believe their constitutional rights have been violated during civil immigration arrests.

The legislation imposes civil damages for false imprisonment when someone attending a court hearing or appearing as a party or witness to a legal proceeding is arrested. Proponents say courts must be accessible to everyone to pursue remedies to violations of their rights.

Democratic Senate President Don Harmon, a lead sponsor, acknowledged the measure will face a court challenge.

“It’s not just about the constitutionality of the law, which I think is sound, but it’s the reality that the courts are stacked against us,” Harmon said. “The federal government can try to remove it from state courts to federal courts. They can try to substitute the government itself for the individual defendants, but that’s not a reason not to try.”

Pritzker, a Democrat, supports the idea and will review the plan when it reaches his desk, spokesperson Matt Hill said.

Two weeks ago, the top judge in Cook County, home to Chicago, issued an order with the same prohibition . It's unclear whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has followed the dictum, but at the time, federal officials dismissed it, saying “there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.”

The Trump administration's immigration enforcement, which began two months ago in Chicago and its suburbs, is intended to round up migrants living in the country illegally, particularly those with criminal records. But witnesses have reported repeated incidents in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detain people regardless of citizenship or legal status.

“No one should have to choose between seeking justice and risking their freedom,” said co-sponsoring Sen. Celina Villanueva. “Courthouses must be places where people can resolve disputes, testify and support loved ones, not sites of fear or intimidation.""

The legislation, approved largely along party lines, also requires hospitals, day care centers and higher education institutions to create policies delineating how they would handle immigration agents inside their facilities.

Other states have taken similar action or otherwise adopted practices to protect immigrants . California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017. Guidance published by California Attorney General Rob Bonta says the state can't control federal immigration action, but “the state has a responsibility to provide safe and secure access to court facilities to all residents regardless of immigration status.”

In September, Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins issued a policy prohibiting warrantless arrests inside state courts, as well as banning the use in judicial buildings of face coverings, routinely worn by ICE officers.

“Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public, they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption,"" Mullins said.",https://assets.lasvegassun.com/media/assets/images/icons/favicon-app.png,N,,2025-11-01 17:00:55.699369

One man said ICE arrested him while looking for someone else.
Goncalves, a University of Utah student, was arrested by ICE in June and then held in detention for nearly three weeks.
Jaramillo-Solano’s wife told Hamilton that ICE agents had “beaten” her husband and children and kept them in a “dungeon”-like room in Durango, where the adolescents — a boy and girl — had to share a urinal with their father.","Immigration authorities mistakenly identified a Durango father when they pulled him over earlier this week, a senior enforcement official said Friday, but agents still arrested the father and his two children in an incident that quickly sparked protests in the Colorado mountain town.

Gregory Davies, Denver’s third-ranking official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified about the incident in court Friday morning during a hearing in a lawsuit challenging ICE’s arrest practices in Colorado. He had previously said ICE officials research and surveil their targets using multi-agent teams before they try to arrest them.

But he acknowledged that the ICE agents didn’t know they were pulling over Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, who is Colombian, when they stopped him and his 12- and 15-year-old children on their way to their Durango school Monday morning.

“It’s my understanding that the father was mistaken for somebody else when (ICE) encountered him,” he said during the federal court hearing in Denver.

He said Jaramillo-Solano and his children were then arrested anyway, without warrants. While that is allowed in certain circumstances, the lawsuit asserts that ICE has done that too often as part of a broader policy and without meeting legal requirements.

Agents have to determine that the person is in the country illegally and that they’re likely to flee if they’re not arrested. Four people detained by ICE in Colorado this year filed the lawsuit at issue in Friday’s hearing, alleging that ICE arrested them and others without first determining if they were likely to flee.

They’ve argued that the arrests are part of the Trump administration’s broader efforts to mass-deport immigrants without proper legal status.

The plaintiffs have asked a judge to intervene and declare ICE’s alleged arrest practices illegal, and they pointed to Jaramillo-Solano’s arrest as evidence that ICE’s alleged pattern has escalated in real time. All four testified this week, describing spending weeks in detention and having their lives upended after ICE arrested them. One man, identified only by his initials JST, said he lost “everything” after he was arrested near Aurora’s Whisping Pines apartments in February.

“I lost my apartment. I lost all the things I had, my clothing. I was left with nothing. I started from zero,” the man said through an interpreter.

Davies served as a government witness to defend against that lawsuit, as part of a two-day hearing seeking a prohibition on the allegedly illegal arrests. Lawyers representing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, have argued that standing federal policy — reiterated in an Oct. 22 memo — requires officers to follow certain procedures to ensure their arrests are lawful.

Because of that policy, they said this week, U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson doesn’t need to enter an order prohibiting a practice that ICE already regulates. The memo was issued in part because of similar litigation in Illinois.

Seeking an order restricting arrests

But the attorneys who filed the lawsuit have argued that ICE agents have consistently ignored that policy and continue to do so, even after the recent memo from ICE’s top legal advisor.

Kenzo Kawanabe, one of the attorneys on the case, pointed to the arrests in Durango, along with the immigration arrest of a Douglas County teacher and her family last week, to allege that ICE still wasn’t following its own policy.

During the hearing, Jackson repeatedly asked the Homeland Security Department’s attorneys if they would agree to a court order — requiring ICE agents in Colorado to follow the policy — and end the suit. But the attorneys refused because, they argued, the Colorado lawsuit was baseless and they shouldn’t be subjected to a court order to end litigation they believed was doomed.

The department’s lawyers argued that the four plaintiffs were unlikely to be arrested again and that ICE had no policy of arresting any undocumented immigrant unlawfully. Nor does the agency pursue every immigrant without legal status, they said — an assertion that contrasts with comments in interviews by both Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide, and Denver’s now-former top ICE official, both of whom told reporters that ICE did indeed intend to arrest anyone in the country illegally.

“What (plaintiffs) have done is take several instances of supposedly unlawful behavior, asserted there’s a policy underneath all of them, and said that they’re challenging that policy,” said Logan Brown, an attorney for the department.

Davies testified that the agency targets “criminal aliens” and “terrorists.” While its agents may arrest other people, he and another ICE official said, those arrests are “collateral” and aren’t the type of case that ICE prioritizes.

But the accounts of the four plaintiffs — a college student, a grocer and two men who work in construction — as well as testimony from two immigration attorneys and the incident in Durango painted a much different picture of ICE’s practices than those described by the agency’s lawyers and supervisors.

One man said ICE arrested him while looking for someone else. The college student, Caroline Dias Goncalves, was arrested only by chance, after a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy pulled her over in a traffic stop and then alerted ICE. The other two men were arrested in large-scale raids in Aurora and Colorado Springs and were later released.

Judge expresses skepticism of ICE

Jackson, who declined to immediately issue an order Friday, said the plaintiffs’ arrests all appeared to have been unlawful, and he seemed inclined to agree that ICE was operating under a policy of mass arrests, regardless of the circumstances.

While Davies testified that his office had let two people go in recent days because they didn’t pose a flight risk, Jackson pointed to the Durango arrests and the Douglas County teacher’s detention. He also noted that Davies — a near-20-year veteran of the agency — didn’t appear to know the details of the policy, either.

“There’s a policy,” Jackson said of the ICE memo. “These guys just don’t follow it. They might not even know what it is. I think it’s at least reasonable that the policy they really follow is what supervisors tell them to do, and what supervisors are telling them is, ‘Go arrest people, as many as you can get.’ ”

He also questioned how Goncalves could’ve posed a flight risk or represented one of the “criminal aliens” that ICE purports to pursue. Goncalves, a University of Utah student, was arrested by ICE in June and then held in detention for nearly three weeks. The Brazilian came to the U.S. with her family when she was 7 and has a pending asylum application, the Salt Lake Tribune has reported.

She testified Thursday that she now lives at home, no longer has a driver’s license and is taking a significantly reduced course load because of the arrest.

The immigrants are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado and local attorneys. To the lawyers, the Durango detentions represented a clear example that ICE was neither making targeted arrests nor following its own purported policy of only detaining those who pose a flight risk.

The incident spurred demonstrations in the southwestern Colorado city earlier this week and clashes with federal authorities. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation announced Thursday that it would investigate an incident in which a federal agent threw a protester’s phone and pushed her to the ground outside the local ICE field office.

On Friday, attorney Carly Hamilton testified that she’d spoken to Jaramillo-Solano’s wife, who wasn’t in the car and wasn’t detained; she was referred to using her initials to protect her privacy. The family had been seeking asylum because the woman had been tortured in Colombia and her previous husband was assassinated, Hamilton said.

Jaramillo-Solano’s wife told Hamilton that ICE agents had “beaten” her husband and children and kept them in a “dungeon”-like room in Durango, where the adolescents — a boy and girl — had to share a urinal with their father.

The man and children have been transported to a family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The Denver Post located the father using ICE’s detainee locator, which does not provide information on minors. Davies testified that the family members were all transported to Texas.

The Douglas County teacher, who was arrested with her family, is also detained in the same facility, ICE’s database shows.

Jackson said he would decide soon whether to issue an injunction against ICE to restrict its arrest practices.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-Z-durango-ice-protest-002.jpg?w=1024&h=738,N,,2025-11-01 09:57:17.870842

Along with ordering the federal government to use emergency reserves to backfill SNAP benefits, McConnell ruled that all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored.

___ Mulvihill reported from Haddonfield, New Jersey; and Kruesi from Providence, Rhode Island.","BOSTON (AP) — Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to pay for SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using emergency reserve funds during the government shutdown.

The judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November. That also brings uncertainty about how things will unfold and will delay payments for many beneficiaries whose cards would normally be recharged early in the month.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program starting Nov. 1 because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. It costs about $8 billion per month nationally.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said Friday’s rulings from judges nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama confirm what Democrats have been saying: “The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.”

Trump posted on social media Friday blasting congressional Democrats for the shutdown and suggesting the government would comply with the rulings but also that it needed more clarity first: “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.”

Judges agree at least one fund must go toward SNAP

Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states and the District of Columbia challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.

The administration said it wasn’t allowed to use a contingency fund of about $5 billion for the program, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep SNAP running. The Democratic officials said not only could that money be used, but that it must be. They also said a separate fund with around $23 billion is available for the cause.

In Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case filed by cities and nonprofits that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds. He asked for an update on progress by Monday.

Along with ordering the federal government to use emergency reserves to backfill SNAP benefits, McConnell ruled that all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. The USDA during the shutdown has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others.

There were similar elements in the Boston case, where U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled in a written opinion that the USDA has to pay for SNAP, calling the suspension “unlawful.” She ordered the federal government to advise the court by Monday as to whether they will use the emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program “using both contingency funds and additional available funds.

“Defendants’ suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments,” she wrote. “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program.”

For many, benefits will still be delayed after the ruling

No matter how the rulings came down, the benefits for millions of people will be delayed in November because the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states.

The administration did not immediately say whether it would appeal the rulings.

States, food banks and SNAP recipients have been bracing for an abrupt shift in how low-income people can get groceries. Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills.

Most states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards.

Across the U.S., advocates who had been sounding the alarm for weeks about the pending SNAP benefits cut off let out a small sigh of relief as the rulings came down Friday, while acknowledging the win is temporary and possibly not complete.

“Thousands of nonprofit food banks, pantries and other organizations across the country can avoid the impossible burden that would have resulted if SNAP benefits had been halted,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, one of the plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case.

The possibility of reduced benefits also means uncertainty

Cynthia Kirkhart, CEO of Facing Hunger Food Bank in Huntington, West Virginia, said her organization and the pantries it serves in Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia will keep their extra hours this weekend, knowing that the people whose benefits usually arrive at the start of the month won’t see them.

“What we know, unless the administration is magical, is nothing is going to happen tomorrow,” she said.

Kristle Johnson, a full-time nursing student and mother of three in Florida, is concerned about the possibility of reduced benefits.

Despite buying meat in bulk, careful meal planning and not buying junk food, she said, her $994 a month benefit doesn’t buy a full month’s groceries.

“Now I have to deal with someone who wants to get rid of everything I have to keep my family afloat until I can better myself,” Johnson said of Trump.

The ruling doesn’t resolve partisan tussles

At a Washington news conference earlier Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department runs SNAP, said the contingency funds in question would not cover the cost of the program for long. Speaking at a press conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol, she blamed Democrats for conducting a “disgusting dereliction of duty” by refusing to end their Senate filibuster as they hold out for an extension of health care funds.

A push this week to continue SNAP funding during the shutdown failed in Congress.

To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four’s net income after certain expenses can’t exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $31,000 per year. Last year, SNAP provided assistance to 41 million people, nearly two-thirds of whom were families with children.

“The court’s ruling protects millions of families, seniors, and veterans from being used as leverage in a political fight and upholds the principle that no one in America should go hungry,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said of the Rhode Island decision.

California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017.","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Illinois lawmakers have sent Gov. JB Pritzker legislation prohibiting federal authorities from making immigration arrests near courthouses, but even one of the measure's top sponsors questions whether it can survive a court challenge.

The proposal adopted early Friday also allows lawsuits when people believe their constitutional rights have been violated during civil immigration arrests.

The legislation imposes civil damages for false imprisonment when someone attending a court hearing or appearing as a party or witness to a legal proceeding is arrested. Proponents say courts must be accessible to everyone to pursue remedies to violations of their rights.

Democratic Senate President Don Harmon, a lead sponsor, acknowledged the measure will face a court challenge.

“It’s not just about the constitutionality of the law, which I think is sound, but it’s the reality that the courts are stacked against us,” Harmon said. “The federal government can try to remove it from state courts to federal courts. They can try to substitute the government itself for the individual defendants, but that’s not a reason not to try.”

Pritzker, a Democrat, supports the idea and will review the plan when it reaches his desk, spokesperson Matt Hill said.

Two weeks ago, the top judge in Cook County, home to Chicago, issued an order with the same prohibition. It's unclear whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has followed the dictum, but at the time, federal officials dismissed it, saying “there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.”

The Trump administration's immigration enforcement, which began two months ago in Chicago and its suburbs, is intended to round up migrants living in the country illegally, particularly those with criminal records. But witnesses have reported repeated incidents in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detain people regardless of citizenship or legal status.

“No one should have to choose between seeking justice and risking their freedom,” said co-sponsoring Sen. Celina Villanueva. “Courthouses must be places where people can resolve disputes, testify and support loved ones, not sites of fear or intimidation.""

The legislation, approved largely along party lines, also requires hospitals, day care centers and higher education institutions to create policies delineating how they would handle immigration agents inside their facilities.

Other states have taken similar action or otherwise adopted practices to protect immigrants. California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017. Guidance published by California Attorney General Rob Bonta says the state can't control federal immigration action, but “the state has a responsibility to provide safe and secure access to court facilities to all residents regardless of immigration status.”

In September, Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins issued a policy prohibiting warrantless arrests inside state courts, as well as banning the use in judicial buildings of face coverings, routinely worn by ICE officers.

“Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public, they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption,"" Mullins said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2o3Oym59n1wtDiFfYDJfEA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/f7e6e951d6851f580f789f45d0cfd3d9,N,,2025-11-01 06:56:29.798229

He said he attempted to file a police report on Monday accusing the federal agents of trespassing, breaking and entering, burglary, battery and assault and kidnapping.

That parking lot is city property; the Johnson administration has responded to the immigration raids there by installing signage and security to keep the feds out, but they aren’t working.","CHICAGO — Leo Feler’s message to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Friday began with him quoting the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Standing at a downtown news conference with local elected leaders, the 45-year-old Lakeview resident then said masked federal agents violated that foundational language that sets warrant requirements and prohibits illegal searches by bursting into his property last week and leaving a bloody scene in his garage while trying to arrest construction workers who were installing windows on his building.

“I think many of you and many of the viewers who are watching this will have similar experiences as me,” Feler said. “Across the United States, these types of jobs are done disproportionately by Hispanic and Latino workers. So I have a question for all of you and for all of the viewers: Should the U.S. government be allowed to invade your property, to jump over a locked fence, to come on to your home?”

Feler, an economist, showed the Chicago Tribune security footage timestamped to Oct. 24 that featured what appeared to be federal agents, faces shielded with bandanas, running through a gangway and struggling to pull down a man who was straddling a fence mid-escape.

One worker was detained inside his garage, Feler said, adding that the agents did not appear to have a warrant at any point.

“I spent most of last weekend cleaning up blood at my property,” Feler said. “Every now and then, I’ll still be walking around and there will be a spot of blood I failed to clean up, and I will clean that up.”

Neighbors blowing whistles — as well as Feler yelling, “ICE, you are not allowed on my property. Get off my property. This is the United States. You are going into people’s homes” — dominated much of the audio in his security camera footage.

In one video, an agent hops over a fence and a voice off-camera then remarks, “You made me cut myself, and when I cut myself, I get mad.”

DHS spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

However, Feler also had gripes with local leadership in Chicago.

He said he attempted to file a police report on Monday accusing the federal agents of trespassing, breaking and entering, burglary, battery and assault and kidnapping. But after being rebuffed at his local Chicago Police Department precinct, and then filing a criminal damage to property report with CPD’s detective bureau, he got disappointing news.

“I later got a call from a sergeant saying they would not be able to continue with that police report because his higher-ups told him not to pursue it,” Feler said, before addressing the media gaggle directly. “So I am asking you to come with me to the police precinct after this press conference to help me get a police report filed.”

Chicago is bound by a sanctuary city ordinance that prohibits local police from cooperating with federal immigration officials. And as President Donald Trump’s unpopular deportation campaign in the nation’s third-largest city progresses, residents have grown increasingly emboldened to confront federal agents directly and try to physically block them from carrying out raids.

Mayor Brandon Johnson has nodded to that sentiment, signing a flurry of executive orders banning immigration agents from using city land or private property to carry out their deportation operations. He has even called for criminal charges against federal officers who violate his municipal decrees, and bristled at the notion that they were merely “symbolic.”

But the mayor has yet to offer specifics on how he thinks enforcement against such agents should work. At the time Johnson signed the orders, Chicago police Superintendent Larry Snelling said that cops will not and cannot arrest federal agents “because someone deems what they are doing is illegal.”

CPD spokespeople didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday about Feler’s complaint. His alderman, Bennett Lawson, walked out with him after the news conference and promised to contact police district leadership on his behalf.

Friday’s news conference at the Cook County Building was convened by U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, a Chicago Democrat who called for DHS’s Office of the Inspector General to investigate abuses by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection during their operations in the Chicago area.

Quigley stopped short of saying federal agents should be prosecuted under a future Democratic president but noted that “documentation” was a good first step.

“ICE and CBP have blatantly violated the rights of Chicago and since they arrived in our city,” Quigley said. “They have racially profiled citizens.”

Another speaker the congressman brought up was Vanessa Aguirre-Avalos, the owner of the Luna y Cielo Play Cafe in Logan Square. She choked back tears as she laid out the lasting effects of the tear gas deployment from early this month outside her business as well as Funston Elementary School.

“My business has suffered deeply because our families are too afraid to go out. I am behind on rent, and may soon have to close my business, a space built to keep our culture and our language and our children’s joy alive,” Aguirre-Avalos said.

Aguirre-Avalos said one 3-year-old girl who has attended her day care since she was an infant clung tightly to her mother that afternoon and asked, “Mommy, what happened?”

“Now whenever she sees police lights, she freezes, reliving that trauma from Oct. 3,” Aguirre-Avalos said. “I’m deeply worried about the trauma this is causing our children.”

All the while, arrests by federal immigration officers mount — including at O’Hare International Airport, where a waiting area for rideshare drivers has been the grounds for more than 50 arrests. That parking lot is city property; the Johnson administration has responded to the immigration raids there by installing signage and security to keep the feds out, but they aren’t working.

Johnson, asked by the Tribune this week what he will do about immigration officers flouting his executive orders, said “we’ll have to look at every single tool to hold this administration accountable.”

Asked how soon, the mayor said: “Soon. As soon as possible.”

“President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections,” she said.
“The Court pauses to note a conspicuous absence from the legal and historical context thus far provided,” Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote.
Democrats and the voting rights groups hailed the decision as a major breakthrough.
“The court not only stopped the executive order on its own terms, but also delineated the constitutional parameters that bar the president from pursuing these false conspiracy theories in the electoral arena,” he said.","A federal judge in Washington permanently barred the Trump administration on Friday from requiring proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms, a change dictated in an executive order President Trump signed in March.

The ruling definitively halted the effort to compel the Elections Assistance Commission, an independent body, to adopt nationwide changes to voting procedures at a time when the president has also called for requiring voter identification in elections and ending mail-in voting. For months, voting rights groups have warned that those changes, in tandem with the deployment of the national guard to the streets of Democratic-led cities, resembled steps of a voter-suppression strategy.

In a firm 81-page opinion, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote that Mr. Trump’s order clearly violated the separation of powers, claiming authority over the voting process not afforded by the Constitution.

“Congress has never assigned any responsibility for the content of the federal form to the president or to any other individual in the executive branch with the power to act unilaterally,” she wrote. “The power to alter the federal form is — and always has been — delegated solely to a bipartisan, independent commission.”

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesman, said the government would appeal Judge Kollar-Kotelly’s latest ruling. “President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections,” she said.

The opinion also traced American history back to the country’s founding, repeatedly noting that besides the small role of the Elections Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress in 2002 to assist with elections, the Elections Clause of the Constitution grants authority over elections to the states.

“The Court pauses to note a conspicuous absence from the legal and historical context thus far provided,” Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “The states have initial authority to regulate elections. Congress has supervisory authority over those regulations. The President does not feature at all.”

The decision settled the question raised in a trio of lawsuits brought by a broad coalition Democrats and voting rights groups including the League of United Latin American Voters and the League of Women Voters Education Fund.

Judge Kollar-Kotelly, who was appointed to her current post by President Bill Clinton, had previously sided with the groups that filed the suits, temporarily blocking the proof of citizenship provision in a decision in April. In a related case brought by a coalition of attorneys general from Democratic states, a judge in Massachusetts in June temporarily blocked the executive order more broadly, including a provision imposing on states for counting mail-in ballots.

Democrats and the voting rights groups hailed the decision as a major breakthrough.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, celebrated the ruling on X, calling the executive order an attempt at “disenfranchising Americans” and “voter suppression.”

Throughout his political career, Mr. Trump has repeatedly made claims about significant noncitizen voting, which have been repeatedly debunked. More recently, the president has also enlisted the Justice Department in an effort to build a national voter roll database over the objections of many states, seeking to substantiate the false claims.

Norm Eisen, the executive chair of the Democracy Defenders Fund, which helped represent one of the groups that sued, said the executive order “represented the intersection of two of President Trump’s obsessions” — bringing together false premises about noncitizens’ voting with more general alarmism about immigration.

“The court not only stopped the executive order on its own terms, but also delineated the constitutional parameters that bar the president from pursuing these false conspiracy theories in the electoral arena,” he said.

In other statements on Friday, leaders of the groups behind the suit said the requirement to prove citizenship would have likely fallen hardest on women, service members and the poor, among other groups that statistically tend not to have such proof readily available.

Around 21.3 million people do not have government-issued proof of citizenship on hand, according to a 2023 study by the Brennan Center for Justice, a voting rights and democracy group, and the University of Maryland.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/31/multimedia/31trump-news-voting-citizenship-proof-qtcp/31trump-news-voting-citizenship-proof-qtcp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 02:56:39.191792

Dig deeper: The lawsuit was brought by two Illinois men who are originally from Mexico.
He was arrested by federal immigration officials on Oct. 30 in Wheeling, where he was working as a delivery driver.
Both men were detained at the Broadview ICE processing facility until Friday morning, when they were transferred to another out-of-state facility.","Disturbing allegations are surfacing about the conditions inside the Broadview ICE Processing Center.

The facility has served as the Department of Homeland Security’s main hub during ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

What we know:

A class action lawsuit now claims federal agents are treating men and women detained at the facility like ""animals"" — describing the site as a ""black box"" and alleging that immigrants taken there are being stripped of their right to an attorney.

""It's supposed to be a holding facility, where people are housed for about 12 hours and they go somewhere else, but that's not how it's being used and that's the core of the problem,"" said Samuel Cole, chief immigration litigation counsel for the ACLU of Illinois. ""It's being used as a detention facility to keep people day after day after day.""

The 76-page lawsuit names DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, and others as defendants. It shines a spotlight on allegations of ""degrading"" and ""inhumane"" treatment.

""There's not enough food given to the people who are detained there, there's not enough water given to the people who are detained there, there is very little medical care, no mental healthcare. There are no beds to sleep in, no pillows — people are using toilet paper as pillows,"" Cole said.

The lawsuit also claims detainees are watched when using the restroom — something that's ""especially distressing for the women"" as most of the federal agents there are men, the lawsuit stated.

Cole said there are very few photos of the described conditions because the detainees allegedly have limited or no access to their cellphones. He added that those being held have also been stripped of a key constitutional right.

""Absolutely no access to attorneys, and that's outrageous. Because they are being told, and asked, and cajoled to sign immigration forms that waive their rights to appear in immigration court before an immigration judge and return to their country, and they're being asked to sign forms in English, and many of them don't speak English,"" Cole said.

The lawsuit describes one instance where a federal immigration officer allowed detainee Willian Giménez González to call his wife using his cellphone. His wife was with an immigration attorney at the time, and ""when the officer heard [the lawyer's] voice and learned that he was an attorney, the officer told Giménez González to end the call. The officer then reached for the phone and hung up the call himself.""

Dig deeper:

The lawsuit was brought by two Illinois men who are originally from Mexico. Pablo Moreno Gonzalez has lived in the U.S. for about 32 years, according to court documents. He is married with four children.

Attorneys say he was taken by federal agents on Oct. 29 near West Foster Avenue and North Pulaski Road in Chicago.

Felipe Agustin Zamacona is also a lead plaintiff in the case. He was arrested by federal immigration officials on Oct. 30 in Wheeling, where he was working as a delivery driver.

Both men were detained at the Broadview ICE processing facility until Friday morning, when they were transferred to another out-of-state facility.

During a scheduling conference with Judge Robert W. Gettleman on Friday afternoon, their attorneys — from the ACLU of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center — demanded the men be returned to Illinois.

On the same call, a U.S. attorney said he has not been able to reach his clients, and it has not yet been determined who in the Department of Justice will be assigned to handle the case. For that reason, he asked the judge if they could postpone the hearing until next week.

Judge Gettleman said he was ""not happy"" to have to wait, but in fairness to both parties, he agreed.

In a brief statement on Friday, Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the panel, and Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat, made public two letters that they jointly sent to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the past several weeks requesting the information.

“To date, these documents have not been submitted,” Mr. Wicker and Mr. Reed wrote.

The senators’ decision to publicize their requests and Mr. Hegseth’s failure to meet them reflected growing bipartisan alarm on Capitol Hill about President Trump’s expanding and open-ended military campaign, undertaken without consultation with or approval by Congress. It also reflected deepening frustration with the administration’s lack of transparency about an operation whose legal justification is in question.

The senators shared two separate requests made to the Pentagon. In one letter, in late September, they asked for a copy of the president’s orders to carry out the military strikes. By law, that letter noted, the Pentagon is required to provide Congress with copies of “execute orders” within 15 days of the president’s issuing of them, a deadline the senators said the Trump administration had missed.

In a second letter, in early October, they again sought the execute orders, as well as the Justice Department’s legal justification for the attacks and a “complete list” of designated terrorist organizations and drug trafficking organizations “with whom the president has determined the United States is in a noninternational armed conflict and against whom lethal military force may be used.” Top House Democrats sent a similar request earlier this month for the list of targets but have not received any information from the White House.

Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said on Friday that House Republicans were also concerned about the lack of transparency around the legal justification for the strikes, even if they were not saying so broadly or publicly.

The immigration activity on Friday impacted more than just schools.","A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent was caught on video Friday repeatedly striking a man in the head after having pinned the man down during an arrest in Evanston, Illinois.

Witnesses posted video of agents holding a man down on Friday near the intersection of Oakton and Asbury in Evanston, about a block away from Chute Middle School.

Video recorded by witness Kerry Littel shows an agent pinning the man down on the street, and repeatedly hitting him in the head as the man and witnesses tell agents he can't breathe.

In the video, witnesses can be heard asking, ""Why did you do that?""

U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said agents ""were being aggressively tailgated by a red vehicle,"" which crashed into the agents' SUV as they made a U-turn.

""A hostile crowd surrounded agents and their vehicle, and began verbally abusing them and spitting on them. As Border patrol arrested one individual, who actively resisted arrest, pepper spray was deployed spray to deter the agitator and disperse the crowd,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

Three citizens were arrested during that incident. It was not immediately clear if the man seen being punched in the video was involved in the crash that sparked the incident.

Meantime, DHS said five immigrants from Mexico were arrested on Friday in Evanston and neighboring Skokie. All five were in the U.S. illegally, and had criminal histories, including trespassing charges and multiple illegal entries into the U.S.

The flurry of immigration enforcement activity in Chicago's northern suburbs on Halloween left neighbors angry about the presence of federal agents.

Not far from the incident near Chute Middle School, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino was spotted at the Home Depot.

The sighting of federal agents, including Bovino, was not what people living in Evanston and the North Side of Chicago wanted to see.

Federal immigration activity so close to schools had community members asking, ""where is the humanity?"" when and if children witness such aggressive arrests.

""Our children are terrified, and our families are terrified, and some are not sending their kids to school. They're missing school. They're missing their education. It's not okay. This is not okay,"" said Allie Harned, of Evanston.

Demian Kogan, director of organizing for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said ""What happened today was disgusting.""

""It was morally reprehensible, and the only thing that's more disgusting about what happened today is that it is not an isolated incident. What happened today is our daily reality in Illinois,"" he said.

Meantime, a woman was taken into custody after she dropped off a student believed to be her child at Volta Elementary School in Chicago's Albany Park neighborhood, officials there confirmed. CBS News Chicago was told the child was able to get into the school safely.

Schools in Evanston and neighboring Skokie took precautions to protect students from immigration operations on Friday.

Evanston Township High School was placed under a ""closed campus protocol,"" meaning students were required to remain on campus during lunch and free blocks.

""There is currently no threat to our school community, and federal authorities are not present on school grounds,"" ETHS officials said in an alert to the school community. ""While we currently have no indication that federal activity will occur on our campus, we are implementing this proactive measure to help ensure the safety and well-being of all students.""

A Cook County commissioner said some Skokie schools were also taking steps to lock down buildings.

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss confirmed immigration enforcement activity was reported multiple times in Evanston on Friday.

""Our message for ICE is simple, get the hell out of Evanston."" Biss said. ""Enough is enough, and so I would say to every Evanston resident: sign up, get trained, join a rapid response team, be a part of the effort to keep our neighbors safe.""

The immigration activity on Friday impacted more than just schools.

This work is part of a broad global movement advancing justice for victims and survivors of the human rights abuses.","When the world emerged from the horrors of World War II and vowed “never again,” nations laid the foundation for the system of international justice that now exists to address the planet’s worst crimes. Today, the United States is actively trying to dismantle it.

The Trump administration on Sept. 4 imposed sanctions on three leading Palestinian human rights organizations: Al Haq, founded in 1979 and a pioneer in documenting violations in occupied Gaza and the West Bank; Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, which for more than two decades has meticulously chronicled laws of war violations in Gaza; and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, which has long provided legal aid to victims, particularly from Gaza.

In June, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on another leading Palestinian rights group, Addameer, under a different set of measures.

This is part of a broader Trump administration effort aimed at those who support justice for Palestinians. The stated reason for the September sanctions was that the three groups had helped the International Criminal Court in its investigation of Israel “without Israel’s consent.” But the U.S. government has also gone after officials of the court, which has taken on an investigation that covers allegations of grave crimes by Israeli forces in Gaza; it has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The administration has placed sanctions on the I.C.C. prosecutor, deputy prosecutors and six of the court’s judges, as well as Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Gaza and the West Bank.

Beyond what has been done to the Palestinians, the Trump administration has undermined the rule of law, protection of human rights and international justice, which all lie at the heart of a rules-based global order. The administration has slashed funding to the United Nations and threatened more cuts while disengaging from the U.N. Human Rights Council. It abruptly terminated nearly all U.S. foreign aid, which had supported human rights defenders and provided lifesaving humanitarian assistance around the world. Cuts to grants by the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and offices on refugees, women and global justice further downgraded America’s commitment to human rights.

Al Haq, Al Mezan and the Palestinian Center are award-winning organizations that in extraordinarily difficult circumstances have exposed violations of human rights and environmental law by Israeli and Palestinian authorities, armed groups and businesses. They are the voice of Palestinian victims, amplifying stories of injustice that would otherwise remain unheard.

The groups have continued their courageous work in Gaza over nearly two years. Al Mezan and the Palestinian Center are based in Gaza, and Al Haq, based in Ramallah in the West Bank, has staff there as well. They have faced bombardment that has resulted in the killings or wounding of staff members and hundreds of their relatives as well as starvation and forced displacement. On Sept. 7, Israeli bombings flattened the high-rise building that housed the Palestinian Center’s headquarters. The offices of Al Mezan across Gaza were damaged and destroyed in 2024.

The U.S. sanctions will not only disrupt the critical work that they are still able to do but also send a chilling signal to human rights defenders whose work implicates powerful actors or their allies. The Palestinian groups have been vocal in their support of the I.C.C.’s investigation into Israeli conduct and have made submissions to the court’s prosecutor.

Our organizations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have worked closely with these groups for decades and, consistent with our longstanding and independent mandates to speak out in protecting human rights, we can attest that their work is indispensable to the human rights community not only in the region but internationally.

This work is part of a broad global movement advancing justice for victims and survivors of the human rights abuses. A credible system of international justice that addresses genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity is an essential element of building respect for human rights.

The International Criminal Court is a central pillar of this system. Created through a treaty in 1998, the court is a forum of last resort. Governments intended to deliver on the post-World War II promise of “never again” by establishing such a permanent institution. The system is not perfect, but its capacity to seek to hold accountable even those in the highest positions of power can help end cycles of abuses. This power of the law is now at risk.

Further sanctions or other actions by the United States, including extending sanctions to the court as a whole, would jeopardize the rights of victims across the globe. Governments should rise to the occasion to protect the system they created.

When Israel designated leading Palestinian human rights groups including Addameer and Al Haq as “terrorist organizations” in 2021, nine European Union member states rejected the allegations as unsubstantiated. That pushback was likely a major reason Israel did not go further.

So far, other governments have carefully balanced their reactions to the U.S. sanctions for fear of provoking the Trump administration. This is a flawed strategy and out of step with the urgency the situation demands.

Governments need to condemn efforts to undermine the I.C.C.’s independence and to silence those who are documenting abuses. They should use regional and national laws, like the European Union Blocking Statute, which can be employed to nullify external laws in the union, to mitigate the impact of U.S. sanctions on those working with the court. Those who helped establish the international court and claim to uphold the values underpinning it must step up to defend them.

He still believe in the system of the United States and policies of the immigration.","William Brangham:

The Trump administration's immigration agenda has included efforts to cut back on both illegal and legal pathways into the country.

Yesterday, the president set the lowest ever cap on refugee entries, 7,500 per year. And at the same time, more than 2.2 million migrants are awaiting asylum hearings here in the United States.

Amna Nawaz sat down with the family member of one asylum seeker caught up in these immigration restrictions.

Amna Nawaz:

Officials carrying out President Trump's immigration crackdown have detained and deported thousands of undocumented people with criminal records. But many with no criminal history who were following legal pathways to remain are also being detained.

One of them is 31-year-old Ali Sajad Faqirzada from Afghanistan, who crossed the U.S. southern border in 2022 without authorization to make an asylum claim, which he and his family did, turning themselves into Border Patrol. As their asylum cases moved through the courts, Ali went to a routine immigration check-in earlier this month and was detained by ICE.

For more on his case, we're joined now by his sister, Saida Faqirzada, and their family lawyer Anwen Hughes.

Welcome to you both, and thank you for joining us.

And, Saida, I will just begin with you, because you and other members of your family have been through this asylum process. What did you expect to happen the day that Ali went in for this routine check-in?

Saida Faqirzada, Sister of Detained Asylum Seeker: We were expecting the process to be the same as the rest of the family member who already seek their asylum for him as well to be a smooth process.

And, actually, it was. So he went in for his interview and he actually answered all the questions that he was asked. And he was texting me and said: ""Yes, Saida, I passed the interview and I'm so happy.""

Then he also, like, immediately texted me saying that: ""They are taking me.""

Amna Nawaz:

And was that the last time you heard from him?

Saida Faqirzada:

Yes, when they detain him, yes.

Amna Nawaz:

So, Anwen, let me turn to you here because I do want to put to you what the Department of Homeland Security said in response to our request for more information about the case.

They sent us a statement confirming that Ali did enter the U.S. in February of 2022, and they also said, back, then he ""was arrested by Border Patrol, released by the Biden administration into the country. This poses serious national security risk for the United States and his citizens.""

Anwen, what is your understanding of their statement there, why they believe he's a national security risk or why he was detained?

Anwen Hughes, Attorney For Detained Asylum Seeker:

Well, it's unclear to me from that statement whether the — what DHS is saying is that Ali poses a national security risk or that simply they disagree with the Biden administration's approach to arriving asylum seekers.

With respect to Ali himself, obviously, he doesn't pose a threat to the United States. If we did, we would know by now. He's been here for 3.5 years. Ali as an asylum seeker is not responsible for these differences in policies, any more than he was responsible for the U.S. decision to withdraw from Afghanistan.

He has been trying to cope with these various policy changes and abide by the instructions that he was given. And so — and, as a result, he's now been detained.

Amna Nawaz:

Anwen, do you know why he was detained? Have you been given a reason by the government?

Anwen Hughes:

The government's general explanation as to why it has been detaining most people is that they — essentially, that they lack lasting immigration status in the United States. I haven't seen any articulation of any person-specific reason for them to do that.

Amna Nawaz:

Saida, let me back it up here so people can sort of understand how we arrived at this point, because, after the Taliban reclaimed power in 2021 in Afghanistan, we increasingly saw people from Afghanistan making their way to the United States through South America, Central America, arriving at the U.S. southern border.

Tell me why you and your family left and what that journey was like.

Saida Faqirzada:

So, my family, due to the reasons that they had at that time or we still have, that we believe in human rights and woman rights and democracy and freedom, my family couldn't stay and live under Taliban control and to live in Afghanistan.

So they left the country, and they arrived to the United States hoping that they will rebuild the life that they really wanted from the day first. And they really worked on it. Specifically, Sajad was also working towards that and follow the laws of this country, and gave it back to the community that gave us safety and hope in the United States.

Amna Nawaz:

Was it a general sense of not being able to stay in Afghanistan? Had you been specifically targeted in any way?

Saida Faqirzada:

Due to our ethnicity and minorities that we are coming from, we are one of those minorities in Afghanistan, and also due to our activities, my mom's job with the government and my job with the government and also Ali's job with the government.

And we faced discrimination. We faced life-threatening messages, phone calls. We received all these phone calls and messages. It was not only opposing to me. It was always opposing to the whole family, mentioning their names, mentioning our names.

So this was difficult for us to remain in Afghanistan and live our — the rest of our life there.

Amna Nawaz:

Saida, people will also wonder, was there another way that Ali could have entered the United States? Could he have presented at a legal port of entry, for example, to make an asylum claim?

Saida Faqirzada:

As far as my family concern is, or Ali's, I can clearly say, Amna, when you are running away from something, when you are in search of safety and you are just looking for something — so let me just give you an example.

If our kid is really, like, seriously injured, are we going to the doctor's appointment and calling the secretary to book an appointment with a specific doctor regarding that situation, or we just run to the emergency?

For asylum seekers, I can compare that with that situation as well, specifically for Afghans who were running away from something and to save their life. So they had to run and they had to seek asylum.

Amna Nawaz:

Anwen, let me bring you in here, because there's obviously been a number of reports of other people from Afghanistan in not dissimilar circumstances who have been deported to a number of other countries, to Panama and to Costa Rica and to the United Arab Emirates. What happens now in Ali's case?

Anwen Hughes:

His lawyers have made a request for parole to the ICE field office responsible for his case. And this is basically asking ICE to release him while his case goes on.

Given that he has passed this credible fear interview, what happens from here is going to be the same procedurally, regardless of whether or not he's released, which is to say that he's going to have a series of hearings in front of the immigration court and an immigration judge is then going to make a decision on his asylum claim.

After suffering already the upheaval of forced migration from Afghanistan to the United States and now the additional trauma of detention, we very much hope that he can be released, so that his case can move forward before the immigration court.

Amna Nawaz:

Since he was taken into detention into custody, have you been able to speak with him? Do you know anything about where he's being held or how he's doing?

Saida Faqirzada:

Yes. Yes. We are in contact with him. He can call us and we can also visit him.

Amna Nawaz:

And what can you tell us about how he's doing? What has he shared with you?

Saida Faqirzada:

He's still hopeful. He still believe in the system of the United States and policies of the immigration. And, also, he still believe, our family still believe in justice. And we are hopeful.

Amna Nawaz:

Saida Faqirzada and family lawyer Anwen Hughes, thank you so much for taking the time to speak with us. We appreciate it.

Anwen Hughes:

Thank you.

Saida Faqirzada:

“This is not crowd control but a campaign of intimidation and a clear message that dissent will be punished,” the report says.
The federal crackdown in Chicago comes just months after the Trump administration deployed the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles during demonstrations against ICE raids in June.
Like in Chicago, HRW accused federal agents in Los Angeles of “brutal, excessive, and unnecessary force.” In Chicago, agents from the Department of Homeland Security “repeatedly used excessive force against small groups of protesters who appeared to pose no threat to the agents or to public security, and against clearly identifiable journalists, legal observers, and volunteer street medics,” the new report explains.
“The federal government is not just violating the human rights of protestors here,” said Belkis Wille, HRW’s associate crisis and conflict director.","The global watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW) has published a new report that details reportedly widespread and alarming abuses that have marked the federal law enforcement deployment in Chicago, Illinois, since mid-September.

“There is no rhyme or reason to the violence agents are resorting to.” – Raven Geary

Drawing on interviews with 18 people and analysis of video footage, the report details federal agents’ “firing of projects” and their use of “chemical irritants” during the demonstrations.

On Sept. 26, for instance, journalist Raven Geary was struck in the face by a pepper-spray projectile outside the detention facility. “I have never seen anything like this response in my life,” she told HRW. “There is no rhyme or reason to the violence agents are resorting to.”

Agents also fired pepper balls at a protester named Ashley Vaughn, who relies on the use of a cane, on Sept. 12, an incident the demonstrator said caused them to black out. A week later, in an incident that gained national media attention, a federal agent fired a pepper ball that hit Reverend David Black in the skull while he was conducting a prayer outside the ICE facility.

For its part, DHS has defended its agents’ conduct during the protests. In a Sept. 19 statement, DHS claimed that “rioters assaulted law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property,” though demonstrators who spoke with HRW denied those allegations.

In response to the crackdown, media groups, reporters, and demonstrators have filed a class action lawsuit “against President Donald Trump and senior officials from DHS, ICE, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Justice, and other federal agencies, citing the use of excessive force, suppression of free speech and religious expression, and unlawful arrests.”

HRW has called on congressional DHS oversight committees to host public hearings in order to investigate federal agents’ conduct in Chicago. The watchdog also pointed to the need for stronger legislation to protect against federal abuses and increased accountability for immigration authorities.

“The federal government is not just violating the human rights of protestors here,” said Belkis Wille, HRW’s associate crisis and conflict director. “These violent abuses are part of a broader assault on US democratic norms and institutions.”",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/Anti-ICE_protest_at_Broadview_10_11_2025_20251011_4219_54849799818-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 07:17:04.448807

The measure also allows lawsuits when people believe their constitutional rights were violated during civil immigration arrests.

The legislation, approved largely along party lines, was sent to Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker's desk. His office said he supports the idea and will review the proposal when it reaches his desk.

According to the bill, civil damages for false imprisonment could be imposed when a migrant attending a court hearing or appearing as a party or witness to a legal proceeding is arrested.

BLUE CITY JUDGE CITES 'FEAR OR OBSTRUCTION' IN BLOCKING ICE COURTHOUSE ARRESTS DURING COURT PROCEEDINGS

Supporters of the bill say courts must be accessible to everyone to seek resolutions to violations of their rights, but even one of the measure's top sponsors acknowledges it will face an uphill battle in court.

""It’s not just about the constitutionality of the law, which I think is sound, but it’s the reality that the courts are stacked against us,"" Democrat Senate President Don Harmon said. ""The federal government can try to remove it from state courts to federal courts. They can try to substitute the government itself for the individual defendants, but that’s not a reason not to try.""

Earlier this month, a judge in Cook County, which includes Chicago, issued an order blocking immigration arrests at county courthouses, citing concerns about ""fear or obstruction"" while migrants attend court proceedings. The order prohibits immigration authorities from making civil arrests of any ""party, witness, or potential witness"" during court appearances.

The federal government, however, contended that ""there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.""

The Trump administration's immigration agenda aims to detain suspected illegal migrants as part of the president's mass deportation policies. But witnesses have reported numerous incidents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detaining people regardless of citizenship or legal status.

""No one should have to choose between seeking justice and risking their freedom,"" said Democrat state Sen. Celina Villanueva, who is co-sponsoring the bill. ""Courthouses must be places where people can resolve disputes, testify and support loved ones, not sites of fear or intimidation.""

The measure also requires hospitals, day care centers and higher education institutions to create policies detailing how they would handle immigration agents inside their facilities.

Earlier this year, the federal government reversed a Biden administration policy prohibiting immigration arrests in sensitive locations such as hospitals, schools and churches.

Other states have made similar efforts to protect migrants against federal raids.

FEDERAL JUDGE LIMITS ICE ARRESTS WITHOUT WARRANT, PROBABLE CAUSE

California has restricted immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state cannot control federal immigration action, but ""the state has a responsibility to provide safe and secure access to court facilities to all residents regardless of immigration status.""

In Connecticut, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins issued a policy in September banning warrantless arrests inside state courts, and prohibited the use of face coverings, often worn by ICE officers to shield their identities, in judicial buildings.

But to hardliners in the Trump administration bent on carrying out mass deportation, ICE has actually been something of a disappointment.

So they’re increasingly turning to another agency that they view as willing to go faster and harder: the Border Patrol.

Border Patrol agents have already played a major role in the administration’s highly visible and controversial operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago over the summer and fall, patrolling residential areas in militarized fashion, and using tactics like tear gas. “A majority of the viral videos you see online are Border Patrol agents,” rather than ICE agents, Fox News reporter Bill Melugin posted on X.

Administration hardliners evidently like what they’ve seen. In a late October “purge,” several leaders of ICE field offices were removed from their posts, with some to be replaced by Border Patrol officials instead.

Some ICE officials, and others sympathetic to their perspective, aren’t thrilled about this, and their anonymously-sourced grievances have spilled out in the press. “Since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,” one official complained to Fox News. Another said that “ICE is arresting criminal aliens,” while Border Patrol is “hitting Home Depots and car washes.”

Rise of the cowboys

Behind the tension is a fundamental difference in the two agencies’ approaches — one that has major implications for what will unfold in cities going forward.

The typical ICE approach is to have some idea of who is being targeted in advance of an enforcement operation — say, particular names, or a workplace. They get specific information that someone is in the country illegally, or that a workplace is employing people illegally, and then they try to make arrests.

By contrast, the approach of the Border Patrol — stemming from their work at the border — is more akin to going in and trying to impose order on a hostile area. It often involves spotting and questioning people they deem suspicious, or people they inevitably have little information about. (The term “cowboy” frequently comes up when Border Patrol is discussed.)

What we’ve seen in Los Angeles and Chicago in recent months is the Trump administration increasingly using these Border Patrol tactics in American cities. Rather than acting on specific information about targets in advance, they just go to places where they think unauthorized immigrants are and question people they deem suspicious.

This is being done because White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and other hardliners think the typical ICE approach of figuring out who you’re targeting in advance takes too long and isn’t producing enough arrests. They want their crackdown, and they want it now. And the apparent effort to bring a Border Patrol mindset to ICE means we should expect many more scenes of chaos and aggression on city streets going forward.

The internal Trump administration tensions that have led to the Border Patrol’s empowerment

Miller wants to make mass deportation happen, and he’s obsessed with the numbers. He said on Fox News in May that “we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day,” which would mean over 1 million arrests a year.

DOJ lawyers have since claimed in court that this quota is not official administration policy, but the stories of Miller berating officials to make ever more arrests are legion.

One such grilling occurred in May, when Miller summoned ICE officials to Washington and posed them a question that would prove extremely consequential.

Why, he asked, aren’t you at Home Depot?

Miller was voicing frustration with the ICE approach of first, identifying people or businesses to target, and then going to arrest them. That took too long and wasn’t achieving the numbers he wanted. He wanted them, instead, to basically go to where unauthorized immigrants work, live, or congregate — and just go try to grab people.

There’s a tension between this approach and the desire expressed by Trump and others to prioritize deporting the “worst of the worst” — unauthorized immigrants who have committed crimes. Investigating, identifying, and apprehending dangerous criminals takes time. Grabbing brown-skinned Spanish-speaking people off the street, by contrast, is a quicker way to get arrest numbers up, even if it looks a lot like racial profiling.

Miller’s new priorities have been carried out by ICE and Border Patrol, as well as personnel from other agencies who have been reassigned to work on immigration enforcement.

But Border Patrol took to them with a particular flair, especially in the Los Angeles and Chicago operations overseen by Gregory Bovino. In dealing with protesters and carrying out operations, Bovino embraced tools like tear gas — including, in at least one recent case, throwing a tear gas canister personally. His militarized exploits have been heavily featured in the administration’s social media propaganda videos, often set to peppy music, that the online MAGA base eats up.

In early October, Bovino’s teams conducted what may be the most shocking and controversial operation yet: a nighttime raid of an apartment building in Chicago’s South Shore, in which what seemed to be everyone in the building — including US citizens — was detained for hours. (They have claimed they had information that members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua used the building.)

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her top adviser Corey Lewandowski have reportedly become enamored of the Bovino and Border Patrol approach. At the same time, they’ve soured on White House Border Czar Tom Homan, who is more aligned with ICE’s way of thinking. Homan has faced criticism after an August report that he accepted $50,000 in cash in a Cava bag last year, but according to New York magazine, Noem’s relationship with him had already deteriorated because she thought he was going on TV more than her.

Meanwhile, Border Patrol was making arrest after arrest — by October, it had made more arrests during the Chicago operation than ICE had, per CBS News. All this appears to have convinced administration higher-ups that ICE needs more of what Border Patrol has. So we should expect more and more scenes of tense, militarized confrontations in American cities going forward.

Can the Border Patrol approach make mass deportation happen?

Yet whether all this will meaningfully increase deportations is a different question.

Mass deportation is an immense logistical challenge with three main stages. At each stage, there are resource constraints, practical difficulties, and legal roadblocks that the Trump administration is trying to surmount.

The first stage is arresting unauthorized immigrants. The administration has been expanding the number of personnel who can make arrests (through hiring new people and reassigning people from other agencies), while trying to get existing personnel to arrest more (including with these Border Patrol operations in cities).

The second stage is detention — the arrested people must be held somewhere. But detention capacity is limited, so conditions have been overcrowded, and some arrested people have been released out of necessity. (The GOP’s “big, beautiful bill” devoted billions to expanding detention capacity, but implementation has not been so easy, The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff reports.)

The final stage is deportation, and getting there often requires approval from backlogged immigration courts, as well as diplomatic consent from another country to accept the deportee — oh, and you need a plane too.

This is the most challenging bottleneck to surmount, but the administration has been trying to do it in various ways, including by circumventing the court system in some cases, or by threatening people that if they don’t agree to be deported, they’ll be sent to some country where they’ve never been.

Border Patrol’s tactics can arrest more people, but by themselves, they won’t necessarily speed up deportations. Then again, they might have at least some impact — by sending the message that the US has become an ugly, unwelcoming, and dangerous place to immigrants, and therefore scaring people enough to leave.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-2243386663.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.746068936881%2C100%2C78.507862126237&w=1200,N,,2025-10-31 22:20:52.510737

Little progress on shutdown Trump’s demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to become the longest in history.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Back from a week abroad, President Donald Trump threw himself into the shutdown debate, calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster and reopen the government, an idea swiftly rejected Friday by Republican leaders who have long opposed such a move.

Trump pushed his Republican Party to get rid of the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. In the chamber that’s currently split, 53-47, Democrats have had enough votes to keep the government closed while they demand an extension of health care subsidies. Neither party has seriously wanted to nuke the rule.

“THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,” Trump said in a late night social media post Thursday.

Trump’s sudden decision to assert himself into the shutdown now in its 31st day — with his highly charged demand to end the filibuster — is certain to set the Senate on edge. It could spur senators toward their own compromise or send the chamber spiraling toward a new sense of crisis. Or, it might be ignored.

Republican leaders responded quickly, and unequivocally, setting themselves at odds with Trump, a president few have dared to publicly counter.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules to end the shutdown, arguing that it is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.

The leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.

A spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged. And former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who firmly opposed Trump’s filibuster pleas in his first term, remains in the Senate.

House Speaker Mike Johnson also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call,” from his chamber across the Capitol.

“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.”

Broad GOP support for filibuster

Even if Thune wanted to change the filibuster, he would not currently have the votes to do so in the divided Senate.

“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate,” Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah posted on X Friday morning, responding to Trump’s comments and echoing the sentiments of many of his Senate Republican colleagues. “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it.”

Debate has swirled around the legislative filibuster for years. Many Democrats pushed to eliminate it when they had full power in Washington, as the Republicans do now, four years ago. But ultimately, enough Democratic senators opposed the move, predicting such an action would come back to haunt them.

Little progress on shutdown

Trump’s demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to become the longest in history.

He said in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to his choice on his flight home from Asia and that one question that kept coming up during his trip was why “powerful Republicans allow” the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.

But later Friday, he did not mention the filibuster again as he spoke to reporters departing Washington and arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home.

While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, Trump has not been seriously involved. Democrats refuse to vote to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate an extension to the health care subsidies. The Republicans say they won’t negotiate until the government is reopened.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on CNN that Trump needs to start negotiating with Democrats, arguing the president has spent more time with global leaders than dealing with the shutdown back home.

From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of the shuttered federal government is hitting home. SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Flights are being delayed. Workers are going without paychecks.

And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate.

“People are stressing,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.

“We are well past time to have this behind us.”

Money for military, but not food aid

The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Friday the agency cannot release contingency funds to keep SNAP running, but two judges ruled nearly simultaneously Friday that the administration must continue to fund the food aid program. How quickly that might happen remains to be seen, as further consultation with the courts is expected on Monday.

Trump, in a social media post, said administration lawyers will be asking the courts “to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.”

“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding,” Trump said.

“We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,” said Rev. Ryan Stoess during a prayer with religious leaders earlier this week at the U.S. Capitol.

“God help us,” he said, “when the cruelty is the point.”

Deadlines shift to next week

The House remains closed under Johnson with no plans to resume the session, and senators left for the weekend and are due back Monday.

The next inflection point comes after Tuesday’s off-year elections — the New York City mayor’s race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states’ governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal.

If the shutdown continues into next week, it could surpass the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump’s first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

The rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.

It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.

New York Attorney General Letitia James seeks to block Trump administration’s subpoenas

The challenge comes as James pushes back against the administration’s investigation of cases she brought against the president and the National Rifle Association, according to court documents unsealed Friday.

James filed a motion in August to block subpoenas issued by acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone for records related to the legal actions, claiming the Justice Department’s probe of the cases was retaliatory.

She also argued that Sarcone was improperly appointed and therefore lacked legitimate authority to authorize the subpoenas.

Dozens of court documents in the case have been filed under seal since August. Late Friday a federal judge in Manhattan granted James’ motion to unseal most of them, over the objection of the Justice Department.

Judge Lorna Schofield, however, has not yet ruled on the motion to quash the subpoenas.

An email seeking comment was sent to Sarcone’s office. A phone message was not immediately returned late Friday.

SNAP has provided grocery help for 60-plus years. Here’s how it works

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is a major piece of the social safety net used by nearly 42 million, or about 1 in 8 Americans, to help buy groceries.

Originally known as the food stamp program, it has existed since 1964, serving low-income people, many of whom have jobs but don’t make enough to cover all basic costs.

There are income limits based on family size, expenses and whether households include someone who is elderly or has a disability.

Most participants are families with children, and more than 1 in 3 include older adults or someone with a disability.

Nearly 2 in 5 recipients are households where someone is employed.

Most participants have incomes below the poverty line, about $32,000 for a family of four, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The Agriculture Department, which administers SNAP, says nearly 16 million children received benefits in 2023.

Air traffic controller shortages lead to broader US flight delays as shutdown nears 1-month mark

The Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages that were causing flight delays Friday at a number of airports, including in Boston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Nashville, Houston, Dallas and the Washington, D.C., area. Airports serving the New York City area — John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were also experiencing delays averaging around two hours, according to the FAA.

Staffing shortages can occur both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don’t always lead to flight disruptions. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, flight data showed strong on-time performance at most major airports for the month of October despite isolated staffing problems throughout the month.

But Cirium said the data also showed a “broader slowdown” Thursday across the nation’s aviation system for the first time since the shutdown began Oct. 1, suggesting staffing-related disruptions may be spreading.

Instacart, DoorDash, Gopuff among companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients

Instacart said Friday that it will offer customers who receive SNAP benefits 50% on their next grocery order to ease strain as the government prepares to cut off food aid payments.

the company said any customer who placed an order in October using a SNAP/EBT card will be eligible for the discount, which will be available even if the government makes payments as planned on Nov. 1. Instacart said it is also expanding the number of food banks it supports through online food drives from 100 to 300.

The San Francisco-based grocery delivery company said both programs amount to $5 million in direct relief.

Instacart is one of several big companies reacting to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown.

Trump back on ’60 Minutes’ for the first time after settling lawsuit

The president is returning to the weekly newsmagazine this weekend for the first time since the suit, which centered on its interview with Kamala Harris, was settled in the summer.

Trump was interviewed by CBS’ Norah O’Donnell on Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air Sunday.

The president has a checkered history with television’s most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.

Trump says he’ll fund SNAP if the courts give more clarity

The president suggested on social media that the government would comply with court rulings to pay for food aid during the government shutdown but said more clarity is needed first.

“Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump said. Federal funds for the program are expected to be frozen starting Saturday.

“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.”

He sought to blame Democrats for the delay and urged SNAP recipients to call Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

New Pentagon policy undercuts trans troops’ ability to ask to stay in the military, AP learns

The policy will severely undercut the ability of transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to peer boards to argue for their right to stay, according to a memo obtained by AP.

If military separation boards decide to allow transgender service members to remain in uniform, commanders can override those decisions, according to an Oct. 8 memo to all services from the Pentagon’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness. That breaks with longstanding policy that boards act independently.

It is the Pentagon’s latest step to drive transgender troops out of the armed forces following a presidential executive order. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.

The new memo also requires that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth. If they do not, their absence can be used against them.

Court says Border Patrol official won’t have to brief judge on Chicago-area immigration sweeps

An appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump administration and stopped a judge from trying to get daily updates from a Border Patrol official about the government’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.

The court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers.

Ellis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order, before going further and freezing it Friday.

Also Friday, advocates in a different case sued over what they called “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.

Senate Democrats urge top Trump national security officials to brief lawmakers on Venezuela strikes

The renewed request came in a letter Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

“We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,” the senators said in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

Signatories included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.

The letter said the administration so far “has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information” with some members “while excluding others.”

Democrats and some Republicans have complained that the administration has failed to provide basic information about lethal strikes that U.S. forces have carried out against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific the last two months.

Trump opens the door for sanctions on Nigeria over alleged persecution of Christians

The president announced Friday that he would designate the West African nation “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that has been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers.

The designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is a step ahead of that.

“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” Trump said via social media. “Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a ‘COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.’”

Nigeria vehemently rejects such claims about persecution of Christians. Analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.

Trump said he would ask lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be.

Union president for air traffic controllers says ‘end this shutdown’

The president of the union representing air traffic controllers is calling on Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, make sure federal workers get paid and then engage in bipartisan negotiation on other pressing issues.

Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the workers the union represents got no paycheck on Tuesday after receiving a partial check two weeks earlier. He said going without a full month’s pay or more would be unsustainable.

Daniels also said the situation is creating substantial distractions for individuals already engaged in extremely stressful work.

“The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown,” Daniels said in a statement.

Top Senate Judiciary Democrat challenges YouTube’s claims of Biden censorship

Attorneys for YouTube’s parent company Alphabet last month sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter claiming the Biden administration pressed the social media site to delete content during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But Sen. Jamie Raskin, the committee’s Democratic ranking member, on Friday publicly questioned that assessment in his own letter to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.

Raskin wrote that the sworn testimony of 20 Alphabet employees contradicted the claims the company had made. He questioned whether YouTube was coerced to claim censorship by the Trump administration.

“What was Alphabet promised or threatened with in order to dance to this new MAGA tune?” Raskin asked in Friday’s letter.

Republicans argue the Biden administration illegally censored Americans through coercion to tech companies. Democrats dispute that narrative.

Judge sides with Democratic groups that sued over Trump’s proof-of-citizenship directive

The federal judge ruled that Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.

The ruling deals a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections.

“Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., wrote in her opinion.

Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue.

Senators press Hegseth for more information on boat strikes

The Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee have asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide the legal rationale for the U.S. military’s fatal attacks on alleged drug boats off the South American coast.

The senators also requested the directives Hegseth approved for the military strikes, which have killed at least 61 people in 14 attacks since early September. They also want the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.

The requests were made in two letters from late September and early October that were released Friday by Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.

Lawmakers in both parties have raised questions about the use of military force without congressional approval. The Trump administration has shown no evidence to support its claims about the boats that have been attacked, their connection to drug cartels, or even the identity of the people killed in the strikes.

Top Democrat says Trump administration must release SNAP funds after judge’s ruling

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said the court’s decision “confirms what we have said all week: The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.”

The district court’s decision leaves “no excuse to withhold food assistance from Americans,” she said.

If the administration decides not to issue SNAP funds, she said, “it is purely a cruel political decision, not a legal one. They should immediately act — as the court has required — to ensure food assistance continues to go to families in need.”

Judges in the SNAP payment lawsuits expect updates by Monday

A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from the bench that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds — and asked for an update on progress by Monday.

A Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.

It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling.

That process often takes one to two weeks.

The rulings are likely to face appeals.

Senate Republicans reject Trump’s call to eliminate the filibuster

Trump has long pushed Senate Republicans to get rid of the rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. He posted on social media late Thursday that the Senate should “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!”

But Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules even as he seeks to end the shutdown, arguing that the filibuster is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.

The leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.

A spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call.”

“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.”

Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must to continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.

The rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.

The program costs around $8 billion per month nationally.

Trump says he’s renovated the Lincoln Bathroom

The president announced the renovation and posted side-by-side photos of the before and after of the rehab of the bathroom attached to one of the most famous rooms in the White House.

“It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump added. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”

White House set to resume public tours in December, after interruption for ballroom construction

The White House says tours will restart Dec. 2, following their suspension for months due to the construction of Trump’s $300 million ballroom.

The East Wing was once part of tour routes, but has been demolished as part of the project.

The White House says it’ll now offer “an updated route offering guests the opportunity to experience the history and beauty of the People’s House.”

To mark the holidays, December tours feature Christmas decorations curated by first lady Melania Trump on the State Floor.

Congressional offices can begin submitting tour requests for their constituents on Monday. Such requests had been paused since the summer for ballroom construction.

Several people, including at least one woman who said that she was a U.S. citizen, were arrested after appearing to interfere with immigration operations. In Evanston, a suburb north of Chicago, Border Patrol agents detained at least one additional person after a car rear-ended the agents’ vehicle on Friday, according to the Evanston police.

Evanston police officers responded to the scene as dozens of people shouted and jeered at the agents while demanding that the people detained be released.

In Albany Park, on Chicago’s Northwest Side, Border Patrol agents on Friday morning arrested at least two people who had physically confronted them, witnesses said.

The chaotic day of arrests came more than seven weeks into President Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration in Chicago. Earlier this week, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois made a plea to the Trump administration: Leave Halloween alone.

“Illinois families deserve to spend Halloween weekend without fear,” Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, wrote in a letter to federal officials. “No child should be forced to inhale tear gas or other chemical agents while trick-or-treating in their own neighborhood.”

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, said on Thursday that the operation would not be temporarily halted. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the episodes in Evanston and Albany Park.

Families across Chicago have been bracing for Halloween, fearful that immigration agents would target and arrest people on the streets during trick-or-treating. Neighborhoods set up watch groups for Friday evening, with volunteers to be stationed on corners with whistles, ready to alert neighbors if immigration agents were seen.

Evanston was especially roiled by the presence of Border Patrol agents on Friday.

Bystanders said that a motorist had been following federal agents along a major street when the agents stopped short, causing the car to crash into it.

Videos shared with the The New York Times show the agents tackling the driver, a woman, to the ground.

Allie Harned, a social worker at Chute Middle School a block away, said she heard the crash and came running.

“When I came upon her, they were tearing her out of the car,” Ms. Harned said. “She was on the ground. Her shoes fell off.”

After bystanders began yelling and blowing whistles, the agents detained at least one person in the group, according to the Evanston police.

One officer briefly pulled a weapon and aimed it at the crowd, one of the videos shows. Ms. Harned said she screamed and ran. It was uncertain exactly what type of weapon the officer was holding.

The incident happened near the middle school and an elementary school, just a few hours before children were set to go door to door for holiday candy. Nearby schools locked down because of the heightened federal activity, keeping students inside for recess.

At a news conference held in front of Chute Middle School later in the day, children peered out of open windows to listen to local officials denounce the federal government’s actions.

“Just today, ICE agents have assaulted Evanston residents, beaten people up, grabbed them, abducted them, taken people off the street,” said Daniel Biss, the Democratic mayor of Evanston, who is also running for Congress. “It is an outrage,” he added.

Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official who has been leading the immigration crackdown in Chicago, was admonished by a federal judge earlier this week for his agency’s use of force and tear gas in recent weeks.

The judge ordered Mr. Bovino to appear in her courtroom each weeknight to answer questions about that day’s enforcement activities and agents’ compliance with restrictions that the judge imposed. But the federal government objected, and an appellate court on Friday blocked the requirement for Mr. Bovino to make those daily appearances.

The Trump administration's immigration enforcement, which began two months ago in Chicago and its suburbs, is intended to round up migrants living in the country illegally, particularly those with criminal records.
California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017.","Illinois lawmakers have sent Gov. JB Pritzker legislation prohibiting federal authorities from making immigration arrests near courthouses, but even one of the measure's top sponsors questions whether it can survive a court challenge.

The proposal adopted early Friday also allows lawsuits when people believe their constitutional rights have been violated during civil immigration arrests.

The legislation imposes civil damages for false imprisonment when someone attending a court hearing or appearing as a party or witness to a legal proceeding is arrested. Proponents say courts must be accessible to everyone to pursue remedies to violations of their rights.

Democratic Senate President Don Harmon, a lead sponsor, acknowledged the measure will face a court challenge.

""It's not just about the constitutionality of the law, which I think is sound, but it's the reality that the courts are stacked against us,"" Harmon said. ""The federal government can try to remove it from state courts to federal courts. They can try to substitute the government itself for the individual defendants, but that's not a reason not to try.""

Pritzker, a Democrat, supports the idea and will review the plan when it reaches his desk, spokesperson Matt Hill said.

Two weeks ago, the top judge in Cook County, home to Chicago, issued an order with the same prohibition. It's unclear whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has followed the dictum, but at the time, federal officials dismissed it, saying ""there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.""

The Trump administration's immigration enforcement, which began two months ago in Chicago and its suburbs, is intended to round up migrants living in the country illegally, particularly those with criminal records. But witnesses have reported repeated incidents in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detain people regardless of citizenship or legal status.

""No one should have to choose between seeking justice and risking their freedom,"" said co-sponsoring Sen. Celina Villanueva. ""Courthouses must be places where people can resolve disputes, testify and support loved ones, not sites of fear or intimidation.""

The legislation, approved largely along party lines, also requires hospitals, day care centers and higher education institutions to create policies delineating how they would handle immigration agents inside their facilities.

Other states have taken similar action or otherwise adopted practices to protect immigrants. California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017. Guidance published by California Attorney General Rob Bonta says the state can't control federal immigration action, but ""the state has a responsibility to provide safe and secure access to court facilities to all residents regardless of immigration status.""

In September, Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins issued a policy prohibiting warrantless arrests inside state courts, as well as banning the use in judicial buildings of face coverings, routinely worn by ICE officers.

""Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public, they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption,"" Mullins said.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/10/07/b5a6caac-780d-417f-8876-760410fd8779/thumbnail/1200x630/c002d2d976544b3bed76f6bab2ef0d58/screenshot-2022-10-07-144245.png,N,,2025-11-01 09:16:46.525992

A ProPublica investigation documented 170 cases of federal immigration officers detaining U.S. citizens nationwide under the Trump administration.","During a press conference about a Midwestern immigration enforcement operation, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents have not detained U.S. citizens.

Chicago, the center of the effort dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, is the latest target in the Trump administration’s nationwide immigration crackdown. Agents have arrested more than 3,000 people during the operation. Noem said the effort covers the area ""that the field office is covering,"" and local news outlets reported that the Chicago Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office also includes Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky and Kansas.

""There’s no American citizens have been arrested or detained. We focus on those that are here illegally"" Noem said during the Oct. 30 press conference in Gary, Indiana. ""And anything that you would hear or report that would be different than that is simply not true and false reporting.""

Noem didn’t say whether she was referring to Operation Midway Blitz specifically or the nationwide immigration crackdown more broadly, and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to our questions about her statement.

By either measure, Noem’s wrong. News reports and lawsuits show that U.S. citizens have been detained during Operation Midway Blitz, and a ProPublica investigation documented 170 cases of U.S. citizens who have been arrested by immigration agents across the country since Trump started his second term.

Homeland Security addressed such reports in an Oct. 1 statement: ""We have said it a million times: ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens.""

But DHS has also released several statements and posted on social media explaining why U.S. citizens have been detained or arrested.

Here are some examples.

Several U.S. citizens in Chicago say they’ve been arrested by immigration agents

The detentions and arrests of U.S. citizens during Operation Midway Blitz have included people who DHS said were obstructing law enforcement, and people who were released after showing proof of U.S. citizenship.

Journalists in Chicago sued the Trump administration saying federal agents have illegally stopped, detained and ""arrested hundreds of people, including many citizens.""

The suit names Steve Held, a U.S. citizen who the lawsuit says was arrested and later released without charges.

Another lawsuit details the detention of U.S. citizen Julio Noriega, who said he was taken into custody by federal immigration agents and held overnight in an ICE processing facility. Immigration officers released Noriega after looking in his wallet and seeing his identification.

Noriega is among 22 people the American Civil Liberties Union is representing against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful arrests and detentions by ICE. Immigration agents failed to properly verify Noriega’s citizenship and did not document his arrest, the lawsuit says.

Federal immigration agents also detained Debbie Brockman, a U.S. citizen who works for a Chicago TV station, before releasing her.

""Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol’s car,"" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN after video of Brockman’s arrest went viral. Brockman was released without charges and denies wrongdoing, and witnesses have disputed the DHS account.

ICE has arrested U.S. citizens across the country

The detention of U.S. citizens hasn’t been restricted to Operation Midway Blitz.

In New Mexico, Border Patrol arrested Jose Hermosillo in April and kept him in custody for about 10 days. DHS said Hermosillo answered ""yes"" when officers asked if he was in the U.S. illegally.

Agents released Hermosilo after his family produced a birth certificate and Social Security documentation and a federal judge dismissed a criminal case against him. Hermosillo’s parents told CBS News that their son has an intellectual disability and can’t read or write.

In Florida, Juan Carlos Lopez Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, was arrested after a traffic stop and briefly held on charges tied to a Florida immigration law. The charges were dismissed after his mother presented his birth certificate, state ID and Social Security card.

During an immigration raid in Hawthorne, California, ICE agents detained pregnant citizen Cary López Alvarado, releasing her later that day.

""Cary Lopez was arrested because she obstructed federal law enforcement by blocking access to a car that had two Guatemalan illegal aliens in it,"" McLaughlin told NBC News.

In Alabama, Leonardo Garcia Venegas said he was working at a construction site when masked agents entered the area, according to ProPublica. When his undocumented brother asked to see a warrant, Garcia Venegas started recording on his phone.

He kept filming until officers turned on him. In the footage, agents try to take him down as he shouts, ""I’m a citizen!"" They pulled out his Alabama REAL ID — which is issued only to legal residents — but dismissed it as fake, according to ProPublica.

Garcia Venegas was handcuffed and held for more than an hour before being released. His brother, who is not a U.S. citizen, was later deported.

Our ruling

Noem said ""No American citizens have been arrested or detained"" during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns.

That’s wrong.

Lawsuits, news reports and DHS statements show that numerous U.S. citizens have been detained or arrested by immigration agents in and around Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz. A ProPublica investigation documented 170 cases of federal immigration officers detaining U.S. citizens nationwide under the Trump administration.

The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July.
Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.","EDITOR’S NOTE: This article was updated on Oct. 31, 2025, to include social media comments from Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, that he posted after publication.

The Trump administration has ordered states to investigate certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid to determine whether they are ineligible because of their immigration status, with five states reporting they’ve together received more than 170,000 names collectively — an “unprecedented” step by the federal government that ensnares the state-federal health program in the president’s immigration crackdown.

Advocates say the push burdens states with duplicative verification checks and could lead people to lose coverage just for missing paperwork deadlines. But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.

Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.

It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.

Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

At least one state said it disagreed with Oz’s comments.

“Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”

He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”

In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.

KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.

Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.

Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.

“We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”

Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.

The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.

All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.

In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill began posting pictures on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.

O’Neill could not be reached for comment.

“We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.

As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.

In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.

In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to stop sharing the information with immigration authorities.

State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.

If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.

“I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.

Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.

“Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.

In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.

He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.

“CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.

Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”

The states Oz mentioned all run their own such programs.

The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.

“I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”

Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”

Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.

However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”

Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.

If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.

Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.

“Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.

Here, we summarize some of the most important recent developments in immigration policy on the federal, legal, state, and local levels.

Federal

Trump Administration Slashes Refugee Program to Lowest Level

President Trump set the refugee admissions ceiling at 7,500 for fiscal year 2026, the lowest cap since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980, according to a Federal Register notice dated September 30 and published on October 31. The determination states that admissions will “primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa” and “other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.” President Trump suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program on his first day in office, later creating an exemption for white South Africans whom his administration claims face racial persecution, despite denials from the South African government. The administration stated the 7,500 level is “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.” The cap contrasts sharply with historical averages of around 95,000 refugee admissions under both Democratic and Republican administrations.

Lawmakers condemned the decision as “morally indefensible” and “illegal,” arguing the president failed to conduct required Congressional consultations before setting the refugee cap. Refugee resettlement organizations criticized the policy for undermining the program’s purpose, with Global Refuge President Krish O’Mara Vignarajah stating it “lowers our moral standing” at a time of global crises in Afghanistan, Venezuela, and Sudan. A senior administration official blamed the government shutdown for delayed Congressional consultation, saying no refugees will be admitted until those discussions occur.

Trump Administration Reassigns ICE Leadership in Major Overhaul

The Trump administration is reassigning at least a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office directors and replacing most with Border Patrol officials in an unprecedented leadership overhaul affecting roughly half of ICE’s 25 field offices nationwide. Directors in Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, El Paso, Seattle/Portland, and New Orleans have been reassigned to other positions. The replacements are being vetted by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and White House adviser Corey Lewandowski.

The changes stem from frustration that ICE has not met the White House target of 3,000 arrests per day, averaging approximately 1,178 daily arrests as of late September. Senior administration officials expressed preference for Border Patrol’s tactics, including helicopter deployments to residential buildings and retail parking lot operations, amid dissatisfaction with ICE’s performance. Meanwhile, internal tensions have emerged within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with one official telling reporters that “we’re arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes,” referring to Border Patrol operations.

DHS Eliminates Automatic Work Permit Extensions for Renewal Applicants

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a rule on October 30 eliminating automatic work authorization extensions for most renewal applicants who previously received up to 540 days of continued employment authorization while their applications were pending. Under the new policy, applicants who file renewals on or after October 30 will lose work authorization when their current documents expire, even if their renewal is pending, and must wait until immigration officials approve the renewal and issue a new card before resuming employment. Limited exceptions remain for Temporary Protected Status holders and certain students.

The policy is expected to disrupt businesses and force employers to remove workers from payroll due to processing delays, affecting hundreds of thousands of workers including those seeking green cards, spouses of visa holders, and applicants under humanitarian programs. Immigration attorneys warned that workers who have lived in the U.S. for years and consistently renewed their work permits will face termination because processing times frequently exceed six months.

USCIS Implements Electronic-Only Payment Policy

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began requiring electronic payments for all paper-filed immigration forms on October 28, ending acceptance of checks and money orders. Applicants must now pay fees by credit or debit card or through direct bank account transfers from U.S. banks. USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser stated the change aims to reduce processing delays and risks associated with fraud, lost payments, and theft, noting that checks and money orders previously comprised over 90% of payments. The policy aligns with Executive Order 14247, which requires government-wide electronic payment systems.

USCIS said it will allow exemptions for applicants who lack access to banking services or electronic payment systems, though exemption requests must be submitted using a separate form. The agency also said it will reject applications without valid payment of the correct fee amount. Forms filed through USCIS online accounts continue to accept electronic payments as before, with the agency encouraging applicants to file online.

Legal

Portland and Chicago National Guard Cases Advance Through Federal Courts

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals voted on October 28 to rehear the case over President Trump’s National Guard deployment to Portland, vacating a previous 2-1 ruling that had sided with the Trump administration and reinstating a lower court’s temporary restraining order blocking the deployment. The full appeals court will now reconsider the case with an 11-judge panel after a judge requested the review, writing in her earlier dissent that colleagues should “act swiftly to vacate the majority’s order before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur.” The decision maintains the current status quo in which 200 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control but cannot be deployed to Portland while litigation continues. A federal judge is simultaneously presiding over a three-day trial that began October 29 to determine whether Trump’s deployment plans violate federal law and state sovereignty.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court requested additional briefing on October 29 in the administration’s bid to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, asking both parties to clarify whether “regular forces” in federal law refers specifically to U.S. military forces and how that interpretation affects the deployment authority. The justices set a November 10 deadline for initial briefs and November 17 for replies, indicating no decision will come before mid-November and suggesting the Court wants more information before ruling on the administration’s emergency request to lift a lower court’s temporary restraining order blocking Illinois deployment. The Trump administration has argued that protests against immigration enforcement in Chicago constitute a “rebellion or danger of rebellion,” while Illinois and Chicago officials maintain the deployment is unnecessary and violates state sovereignty.

Federal Judge Intensifies Oversight of Immigration Agents in Chicago

A federal judge ordered Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino on October 28 to appear in her courtroom daily at 6 p.m. until November 5 to report on immigration enforcement operations after agents deployed tear gas in residential neighborhoods for three consecutive days. The judge also required Bovino to obtain a body camera and training by October 31 after he testified he does not wear one despite leading approximately 200 Border Patrol agents during “Operation Midway Blitz.” Subsequently, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay on October 29 pausing the daily appearance requirement while the court considers the Justice Department’s argument that the order “significantly interferes” with enforcing immigration laws.

The increased oversight stemmed from alleged violations of the judge’s October 9 temporary restraining order restricting agents’ use of force against protesters, journalists, and clergy. Video evidence showed Bovino throwing tear gas canisters at protesters on October 24 without giving required warnings. The judge expressed particular concern about an October 26 incident where agents deployed tear gas in the Old Irving Park neighborhood while children were walking to a Halloween parade, stating that “these kids, their sense of safety was shattered.”

Justice Department Hires Immigration Judges Following Layoffs

The Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) hired 36 new judges on October 27. Of the judges hired, 11 are permanent hires and 25 are temporary hires, and they will be placed in courts across 16 states. States that have seen significant losses of immigration judges, such as Massachusetts and Chicago, have also seen judges hired into their respective courts. These Department of Justice (DOJ) described the hires as part of an “immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law.” The hired judges come from an array of backgrounds, from different branches of the U.S. Military to federal government branches such as the Department of Homeland Security.

This hiring phase comes after losing more than 125 judges from “firings and voluntary resignations” over the past 10 months, and down from 700 total judges from the start of 2025. The firing of immigration judges continues throughout the country, and 24 immigration judges were fired this past September alone, including an immigration judge in Seattle hired during the Biden Administration who had less than “favorable” rulings towards immigrants. A DOJ August memo stated that judges will face punishment if they do not comply and have their rulings align with the administration.

State and Local

Governor DeSantis Directs Florida Universities to End the Use of H-1B Visas

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a directive for state universities to cease hiring foreign workers under H-1B visa programs. The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring theoretical or technical expertise. Universities have traditionally used these visas to hire international faculty, researchers, and specialized staff members across various academic departments and research programs. Governor DeSantis’s directive applies to Florida’s state university system, which includes major institutions such as the University of Florida, Florida State University, and Florida International University. Nearly 400 foreign nationals are currently employed at Florida’s public universities under the H-1B visa program.

LEGISLATIVE FLOOR CALENDAR

The U.S. Senate will be in session from Monday, November 3, through Friday, November 7. The U.S. House of Representatives will be in session from Tuesday, November 4, through Thursday, November 6.

Terry Gerton And so how can organizations, especially grantees, grant recipients, prepare for this on the front end of a grant application?
And the practical reality is, challenges probably have to go to the Court of Federal Claims, at least until certainty prevails.
Terry Gerton What does this mean longer term for the future of federal grant making?
Terry Gerton And is the Court of Federal Claims prepared for this onslaught of cases?","Terry Gerton This administration has sort of turned the world of grants on its head. It’s been very disruptive. What is the big news now, eight months in?

David Robbins Well, I agree with you, it’s been very disruptive, and the big news now is that the courts are weighing in, including the Supreme Court, forcing grant recipients who want to recover for money they’re otherwise owed into a specialized court called the Court of Federal Claims.

Terry Gerton This is a new process for grantees, right? They’ve had other paths that they’ve followed in the past.

David Robbins They have had other paths. They could have used normal district court, Article III courts, to enjoin a termination or wrongful action and get their grant restarted. This is different. You have to sue for monetary damages. For recoveries, you let the grant get terminated and then sue in the Court of Federal Claims to recover what you can.

Terry Gerton This seems like a real change in both judicial philosophy and administrative processing. What’s driving that change?

David Robbins I’m not entirely sure what’s driving the change; I focus more on the effects. The effects really are you have to give up on restarting the grant, which is a truly unfortunate development for a lot of the tremendous organizations out there doing great things — or they used to be doing great things — with federal grant dollars.

Terry Gerton And so what kind of cases fall into this new process?

David Robbins Anyone seeking to recover from the fund freeze. If you recall, the administration just stopped paying any money on grants for a while, and many didn’t restart. That’s blatantly unlawful, and it’s a breach of the grant itself. They’re entitled to recover for that money, and they’re entitled to recover forward termination costs, things like that, driving a lot of this need to recover and need for redress. But that’s all up to the Court of Federal Claims now.

Terry Gerton But they used to begin to process these through district court, is that correct?

David Robbins If they could have processed through district court, there was a choice. If you wanted to bring a breach of contract claim — because a grant at its core is a contract: We agree to do certain things, the federal government agrees to give us certain money — that could theoretically have gone to the court of federal claims, but that takes a while. So you could go to normal district court and try and restart things much faster.

Terry Gerton Well, now that everybody is being pushed into the Court of Federal Claims, what does that mean in terms of reasonable amount of time for resolution?

David Robbins There’s still just one bit of nuance. There’s an ability to go to district court, but you’re gonna face a motion to dismiss. You’re gonna to face uncertain judicial precedent. Do you actually get to recover? That’s probably a lot of lost time and a lot lost money. The Court of Federal Claims is a longer process. It’s a multi-year process, generally, before you finally recover. It’s much longer.

Terry Gerton So does this have the effect of dissuading even applying for grants, if you know that this is going to be a very complicated and expensive resolution process should your grant be terminated?

David Robbins I’m not sure that termination rules and where to sue will dissuade people from applying. But the risks of not seeing the money at all, the actual fear of real terminations, which have been happening in great numbers, is probably going to dissuade organizations from applying.

Terry Gerton And so how can organizations, especially grantees, grant recipients, prepare for this on the front end of a grant application?

David Robbins I think the important part for grant applicants is to watch their spending. Don’t get ahead of themselves. Make sure they’re spending in line with actual receipts from the government. The challenge is, let’s say they take on a lease that’s overly long, because they’re expecting the full course of their government grant to play out. I’m not sure that’s a reasonable assumption, at least in these times. So the best preparation is a little bit smarter fiscal management

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with David Robbins. He’s a partner at Jenner and Block. So we’re in an odd period of time right now. We’ve just finished a fiscal year. We’re in a lapse of funding, at least for a while. How should grantees be thinking about future opportunities?

David Robbins It’s still worth looking out on grants.gov or the normal funding sources for new opportunities because if they can get government money and that’s important to their organization, it’s worth doing. But I would view it less as a lifeline and more of opportunities that arise once in a while.

Terry Gerton And how is this administration defending this new approach to grants and its terminations? Are those holding up in court?

David Robbins We haven’t seen challenges in the Court of Federal Claims yet. We have seen some courts giving injunctions, Article 3 normal district courts giving injunctions, but then the appellate courts are saying, there’s no jurisdiction here. Go talk to the Court Of Federal Claims. So I don’t know if it’s holding up in court, and that’s part of the problem. That’s why we have such uncertainty. And the practical reality is, challenges probably have to go to the Court of Federal Claims, at least until certainty prevails.

Terry Gerton And the way this is playing out if you’re a grantee, if your grant was terminated, you used to be able, if you filed a case, the grant payment or process would continue until the case was resolved. That doesn’t seem to be playing out here now.

David Robbins There was an ability in normal district court to get an injunction, stopping the government from terminating, basically forcing them to pay until the case resolves. You’re right. That’s not happening anymore because the Court of Federal Claims can’t enjoin the government. It’s not that kind of court. They can only award monetary damages at the end of a sometimes lengthy process.

Terry Gerton So now if you’re terminated, you’re just terminated and the best you can do is sort of fight for the leftovers.

David Robbins It’s still worth looking at whether it’s worth trying in district court. I just view the odds as pretty long, so I think your statement is right.

Terry Gerton What does this mean longer term for the future of federal grant making? Does this chill the application process? What do you think the atmosphere will be going forward?

David Robbins I think in the near term, it will suppress the process. I think there will be fewer applicants. I think there will be fewer awards, social policies being engineered through government funds, of course. But this is administration by administration. New administrations can have new priorities. So I’m not sure what the medium or long term holds, but for the short term, it will have a chilling effect.

Terry Gerton And is the Court of Federal Claims prepared for this onslaught of cases?

David Robbins The Court of Federal Claims has a full load of judges for the first time in a while, which is great, but no, they’re still busy just like every other court. And at this stage of my career, I’ve got a lot of friends who are judges. I am projecting that they are a little bit worried about what might be a bow wave of potential inbound cases that they will have to decide.

Terry Gerton So if you’re a federal grant maker, a program manager, for example, what do you need to know about this change in process?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404226899-e1740078272495.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 21:03:16.902762

Therefore, even in a prolonged and painful war, there is an obligation to investigate suspicions of unlawful acts,” she wrote.
Media reports later found that the abuse was so severe that the prisoner was hospitalized and unable to walk afterwards.
Their arrest sparked riots from hundreds of Israelis, who clashed with soldiers at Sde Teiman and broke into the camp.
The protesters and several Israeli ministers called for the soldiers to be released, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling them “heroic warriors.”","Israel’s top military lawyer has resigned after taking responsibility for the leak of a horrific video showing the sexual abuse of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli guards, after the military launched a investigation into the leak this week.

The military announced on Wednesday that it was opening a criminal probe into the leak in order to seek out and punish those responsible, after receiving newly obtained information on the leak from last year. Israeli ministers have long called for the prosecution of the leaker.

Military Advocate General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was placed on leave amid the investigation. She resigned on Friday, and said in a letter that she approved the release of the video because she felt it was her duty to shine a light on illegal actions and abuses within the military in order to maintain Israel’s credibility on the world stage.

“The [Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)] is a moral and law-abiding army. Therefore, even in a prolonged and painful war, there is an obligation to investigate suspicions of unlawful acts,” she wrote. “This is our legal and ethical duty. It does not weaken or harm the IDF. On the contrary. It is a source of strength.”

Tomer-Yerushalmi said that she hoped the release of the video could also push back on efforts by top Israeli leaders who say that allegations of abuses in prisons are fabricated, including “severe allegations suggesting that we favor terrorists over our own troops.”

She said that, while the people detained in Israeli prisons are “terror operatives of the worst kind,” (ignoring that Israel’s detainees are often Palestinians imprisoned for arbitrary reasons), she still feels they deserve to be treated within the bounds of the law. “Unfortunately, this basic understanding — that there are actions which must never be taken even against the vilest of detainees — no longer convinces everyone,” she said.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz welcomed her resignation and nonsensically likened the video to “blood libel.”

“Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army’s uniform,” he said.

The video, originally shown on Israel’s Channel 12 in August of 2024, showed Israeli guards at the notorious Sde Teiman torture camp picking out an imprisoned Palestinian from a group and leading him to a wall. Using shields to cover what they were doing, they gang rape the prisoner. Media reports later found that the abuse was so severe that the prisoner was hospitalized and unable to walk afterwards.

Several soldiers were arrested for the incident, with five soldiers ultimately facing charges. Their arrest sparked riots from hundreds of Israelis, who clashed with soldiers at Sde Teiman and broke into the camp. The protesters and several Israeli ministers called for the soldiers to be released, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling them “heroic warriors.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_10-31-sde-teiman-prison.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 20:02:13.962438

In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the cutoff would be effective for November benefits.
“Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds,” Talwani wrote.
“I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,” Trump wrote.
The plan called for SNAP benefits to continue during a shutdown because the contingency fund existed.","WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Boston ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause a food assistance program for 42 million people was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.

At nearly the same time Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge in a similar case brought by cities and nonprofit groups ordered USDA to continue payments and granted a request for a temporary restraining order.

However, experts and a key member of Congress said that some SNAP recipients still may see delays in their benefits because changes in administration from the federal government to states to vendors take time.

There was also no immediate word from USDA on how it will implement the judicial orders, while the administration sought guidance from the courts.

In a social media post late Friday, President Donald Trump said administration lawyers believed the funds could not legally be paid and that he needed clarification about how to legally distribute SNAP benefits.

In Massachusetts, in a Friday afternoon order, District Court of Massachusetts Judge Indira Talwani said she would continue to take “under advisement” a coalition of Democratic states’ request to force the release of funds from a contingency account holding about $6 billion.

Her ruling came a day before a cutoff of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits to low-income households.

Because Congress is locked in a stalemate over a stopgap spending bill and did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, administration officials say the program cannot provide federal funds beginning Saturday. In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the cutoff would be effective for November benefits.

Talwani, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, called the administration’s conclusion it can’t provide SNAP funding “erroneous,” and said the reserve fund was sufficient for SNAP benefits to flow to states and the vendors that add money to debit-like cards issued to the program’s beneficiaries that are used to purchase groceries.

The law creating the program mandated that benefits continue, she said.

“Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds,” Talwani wrote.

Talwani ordered the administration to say by Monday whether it would provide at least partial benefits for November.

Trump seeks clarification

Trump on social media said that he would be happy to see the funding go out and blamed Democrats for the monthlong shutdown.

“I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,” Trump wrote. “It is already delayed enough due to the Democrats keeping the Government closed through the monthly payment date and, even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.”

The government filed a brief in the Rhode Island case asking the judge in that case to clarify how his order could legally be carried out.

Earlier Friday, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was noncommittal when asked if the department would comply with an order to resume benefits, according to CNN.

Spokespeople for the Department of Justice, which is representing the administration in the case, did not return messages seeking comment Friday.

The 25 states that sued were Massachusetts, California, Arizona, Minnesota, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state, Wisconsin Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. The District of Columbia also sued.

Contingency fund can’t flow in shutdown, USDA chief says

At a press conference with U.S. House Republicans earlier Friday, Rollins said it was “a lie” that the contingency fund could be used to provide benefits.

“There is a contingency fund at USDA, but that contingency fund, by the way, doesn't even cover, I think, half of the $9.2 billion that would be required for November SNAP,” she said. “But it is only allowed to flow if the underlying program is funded. It's called a contingency fund, and by law, a contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing.”

The judges authoring Friday’s court orders disagreed with Rollins’ argument, which was also at odds with a shutdown plan her own department published on Sept. 30 before quietly deleting it sometime in October. The plan called for SNAP benefits to continue during a shutdown because the contingency fund existed.

“Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds,” the Sept. 30 plan said.

U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, said benefit payments “will likely be delayed by several days or more” and blamed the situation on the administration’s refusal to spend from the contingency fund.

“The administration has chosen to hold hungry families hostage in their partisan political games,” she said in a statement. “It is cruel. It is shameful. And as federal judges in two states have now affirmed, it is illegal.”

Rhode Island case

In Rhode Island, where the judge granted a temporary restraining order, the advocacy group Democracy Forward, which was among those bringing the suit, praised the move.

“A federal court today granted a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump-Vance administration’s unlawful effort to halt the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the ongoing government shutdown,” the group said. “The decision ensures that millions of children, seniors, veterans, and families will continue to receive essential food assistance while the case proceeds.”

The judge in that case, John James McConnell Jr., said the administration’s actions violated a key federal administrative law against arbitrary and capricious executive action and federal spending laws “by disregarding Congress’s direction that SNAP must continue operating,” Democracy Forward said.

McConnell also was appointed by Obama.

Delays in benefits likely

Friday’s orders will likely not stop some SNAP benefits from at least being delayed, according to Lauren Kallins, a senior legislative director for state-federal affairs at the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Even if the Trump administration immediately complied with McConnell’s order that benefits must be released, the process of moving money from the U.S. Treasury to states to vendors to beneficiaries takes time.

“Under the best of circumstances… it's not a switch that can be flipped on once USDA decides to release funds,” Kallins, whose organization coordinates and advocates for bipartisan state lawmakers in every state, said.

States generally release SNAP funds to beneficiaries on a staggered basis, meaning that different beneficiaries receive their allotments on different days of the month.

With the situation unresolved a day before the new benefits month begins, some are certain to see at least delays in benefits, Kallins said.

“For people who get their allotments in the beginning of the month, there's definitely going to… be a delay here,” she said.

Additionally, if USDA were to release money only from the contingency fund, it could take states time to determine how to distribute prorated benefits.

Congress no closer to resolution

On Capitol Hill, the parties appeared no closer Friday to reaching an agreement as the government shutdown stretched into its second month.

House Republicans continued to blame Democrats for the standstill, urging Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to get his caucus behind the House-passed GOP measure to reopen the government at last fiscal year’s spending levels.

“Republicans have done our part to end the Democrat shutdown, and now it's time for Democrats to do theirs,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday morning.

“The path forward is simple — please, please, every American who is concerned about this, every American that is feeling the harm, you should call the Senate Democrats and tell them to stop the nonsense, echo the voices of the unions, of the airlines, of hardworking people everywhere, and tell them to stop doing this and open the government.”

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk’s office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”

She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”

President Donald Trump has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.

Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.

Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”

The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.

It’s one of the most thorough legal rebukes in recent memory.

More than 100 federal judges have now ruled at least 200 times that the Trump administration’s effort to systematically detain immigrants facing possible deportation appeared to violate their rights or was just flatly illegal, according to a POLITICO review.

The rulings come from judges appointed by every president since RONALD REAGAN, including 12 appointed by President DONALD TRUMP. One of those appointees took the bench just last month.

Since July 8, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement reversed 30 years of practice and determined that ICE must lock up everyone facing deportation — even if they’ve lived in the country for decades and have no criminal record — federal courts have issued increasing warnings. The new ICE policy, they note, doesn’t just subject millions more people to detention while they fight deportation, it also bars them from even asking an immigration judge to consider releasing them on bond.

“Courts around the country have since rejected the government’s new interpretation,” U.S. District Judge KYLE DUDEK, a Florida-based Trump appointee, ruled Wednesday. “This Court now joins the consensus.”

Other Trump-appointed judges who have ruled against the administration’s position include TERRY DOUGHTY in Louisiana, NANCY BRASEL in Minnesota, J.P. HANLON in Indiana and JASON PULLIAM in Texas. Pulliam ruled Oct. 21 that one ICE detainee, who had been held without any “individualized assessment” of his dangerousness, was deprived of his constitutional due process rights.

The onslaught of legal rejections has come in hundreds of individual cases, typically filed on an emergency basis after ICE’s targets are arrested at courthouses or check-ins with immigration officers. Though a handful of class action lawsuits have been filed seeking to block the administration’s expanded detention policy, they have advanced slowly and seem weeks — perhaps months — from resolution. One case broke through Thursday, however, when U.S. District Judge PATTI SARIS, a BILL CLINTON appointee, approved a statewide class for immigrants in Massachusetts who are subject to the mandatory detention policy.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson noted that the administration’s position was recently upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals, an executive branch court that sets policy for immigration judges — also appointed and overseen by the Trump administration.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” said TRICIA McLAUGHLIN, who predicted appellate courts would side with the administration.

The Justice Department echoed DHS, saying “President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda is a top national security priority that this Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend whenever challenged in court.”

But federal judges have explicitly rejected the immigration court’s position, saying it flies in the face of decades of precedent.

In recent days, the response from the courts has been deafening. The new detention policy, judges repeatedly ruled, has ripped parents from U.S. citizen spouses and children and subjected them to abrupt transfers all over the country on flimsy, untested legal grounds.

“The overwhelming majority of district courts across the country, including this Court, that have considered [the Trump administration’s] new statutory interpretation have found it incorrect and unlawful,” ruled U.S. District Judge RICHARD BOULWARE, a BARACK OBAMA appointee.

The Trump administration contends that the new detention policy is a better reading of immigration law that no administration had adopted. Anyone in the U.S. who is an “applicant for admission” to the country is subject to “mandatory detention,” ICE argues. Though previous administrations considered only those arriving at the border or seeking permission to enter as “applicants for admission,” the Trump administration says the label applies to anyone residing in the United States, no matter how long they have lived here.

But courts across the country say this is a misreading that has resulted in abuses. Those who have lived in the U.S. are not “applicants for admission” under the law and must be given an opportunity to contest their detention before an immigration judge or federal court, they say.

According to POLITICO’s analysis, the bulk of rulings against the Trump administration’s position has come from judges appointed by Democratic Presidents JOE BIDEN (50), Obama (31) and Clinton (6). But the decisions have been resoundingly adopted across political lines. Judges appointed by Republican presidents — Trump (12), GEORGE W. BUSH (12), GEORGE H.W. BUSH (1) and Reagan (2) — have reached the same conclusions.

Only two judges, meanwhile, have adopted the administration’s position: one appointed by Obama and another by Trump.

The lopsided results have outpaced another similar wave of legal rebukes by federal district courts over the administration’s decision to threaten the legal status of thousands of foreign students studying at American schools. The legal pushback led the administration to withdraw its policy.

Despite the overwhelming consensus in the detention cases, the administration is pinning its hopes on appellate courts to reverse the tide. The Justice Department, in recent days, has begun appealing many of the adverse decisions.

POTUS PUZZLER

Which former president is known to haunt the White House?

(Answer at bottom.)

The Oval

HOCUS POTUS: On Thursday, the president and first lady MELANIA TRUMP participated in this year’s annual White House Halloween celebration, greeting children of administration officials and guests dressed in their spooky best.

Our ALEX GANGITANO has the dispatch:

Some attendees came through the trick-or-treat line, including STEPHEN and KATIE MILLER and their two young children, one dressed as a ghost and the other in a skeleton ensemble matching mom’s. Press secretary KAROLINE LEAVITT, her husband, NICHOLAS RICCIO, and their baby pumpkin also got candy from Trump.

There were a few repeat Spidermans, ghosts, NASCAR drivers, HARRY POTTER and Toy Story characters, plus a variety of bugs.

Some kids went all out — one dressed as a McDonald’s drive thru with two very small employees — while others sported costumes like a Secret Service agent, a banana, a recycling workers sibling duo, an American flag firecracker and an infant in an old-school pilot outfit.

Additionally, there were twins from the STEPHEN KING classic “The Shining,” UNCLE SAM, a costume made to look like a child sitting on a toilet with “wide load” written on it (Trump seemed perplexed), a costume of a kid riding a dinosaur — and a young duo of very hungry caterpillars.

The president and first lady (not in costume) handed out large candy bars and stopped and chatted with several of the families as they came through, though it was out of earshot from the media.

And yes, Trump put another chocolate bar on a child’s head.

If anyone would like to submit their costumes for judgment, our tip line (westwingtips@politico.com) is very, very open.

LEAVING A STATEMENT: Should we be seeing pictures of the president’s personal bathroom? Well, erm, you can decide that.

But this afternoon, Trump announced on Truth Social that he has renovated the White House’s Lincoln bathroom, our FAITH WARDWELL reports. “It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump wrote in the post. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”

Out with the art deco green, in with the marble and gold.

Musk Radar

ELON CASHES IN: ELON MUSK’s SpaceX is set to receive $2 billion to develop satellites that can track missiles and aircraft under Trump’s Golden Dome defense project, WSJ’s DREW FITZGERALD and MICAH MAIDENBERG report. The funding was included in the spending megabill that Trump signed in July, but wasn’t publicly linked to a contractor. The planned “air moving target indicator” system could eventually field as many as 600 satellites, people familiar with the matter told the Journal.

SpaceX is expected to play a major role in two other Pentagon satellite networks, according to the people. One, called Milnet, would relay sensitive military communications, while the other involves satellites capable of tracking vehicles on the ground.

WHO'S IN, WHO’S OUT

STAY TUNED: EPA Administrator LEE ZELDIN said today that his agency is preparing to issue a major new round of furloughs as the shutdown heads into its second month, our ANNIE SNIDER reports. The agency’s official shutdown plan calls for 89 percent of staff to be furloughed in the absence of appropriations, but so far the administration has been taking a nontraditional approach, selectively furloughing staffers and conserving carry-over funds for “priority” staff.

“Tomorrow we will be looking at, unfortunately, having to implement that next round of furlough, and the impacts on our efforts inside our agencies are significant,” he said following the G7 Energy Ministers’ meeting in Toronto.

More than 4,000 of EPA’s roughly 15,000 workers have thus far been furloughed.

Agenda Setting

I’LL PASS: Since Trump took over the iconic Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in February, he and the executive he installed there have repeatedly bashed the center’s prior leadership for running the place into the ground — including by not selling enough tickets. “We had spent way too much on programming that doesn’t bring in any revenue,” RICHARD GRENELL, a Trump ally and former ambassador to Germany, told the Washington Reporter in March. According to Grenell, the center hadn’t been making any money.

Nearly nine months after Trump became chair of the center and more than a month into its main season, ticket sales for the Kennedy Center’s three largest performance venues are the worst they’ve been in years, according to a Washington Post analysis of ticketing data from dozens of recent shows as well as past seasons. According to the Post, tens of thousands of seats have been left empty.

The Kennedy Center did not respond to the Post for comment.

POTUS PUZZLER ANSWER

Former President ABRAHAM LINCOLN was known to haunt the White House following his death, with staff, presidents, first ladies and foreign dignitaries all claiming to have encountered him, mostly around the Lincoln Bedroom and the Yellow Oval Room, both of which were part of his old office suite.

Former first lady GRACE COOLIDGE reported seeing him standing at a window in the Oval Office, hands clasped behind his back, looking out toward the Potomac. Former British Prime Minister WINSTON CHURCHILL said he witnessed our former president’s ghost while staying in the Lincoln Bedroom during World War II.

Having just stepped out of the bath, cigar in hand, Churchill claimed he saw Lincoln leaning on the fireplace mantel. Churchill supposedly said, “Good evening, Mr. President. You seem to have me at a disadvantage,” before calmly exiting.

It was not clear whether staffing conditions would worsen throughout the afternoon and evening on Friday, normally a relatively busy time for airports as people travel for the weekend.

The growing problems, unfolding just days after the controllers missed their first full paycheck because of the shutdown, after receiving a partial paycheck two weeks ago, appeared to prompt the union representing controllers to take the rare step of endorsing one party’s preferred approach to ending the impasse.

“Congress must pass a clean continuing resolution (CR) to immediately end the government shutdown, ensure that all individuals who have not been paid during this prolonged closure receive their compensation, and then engage in bipartisan negotiations on other pressing issues facing our nation,” Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said in a statement, effectively endorsing Republicans’ approach.

Democrats have insisted that any bill to reopen the government include an extension of pandemic-era subsidies for people who purchase health insurance on public exchanges, to keep costs to consumers from rising significantly.

The F.A.A.’s work force of approximately 11,000 certified air traffic controllers has risen to uncommon prominence during the federal government shutdown, now the second-longest on record and entering its second month. Senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly highlighted the plight of controllers, who were already working overtime shifts to make up for severe staffing shortages before the shutdown began, and have gone unpaid through for weeks even as they are required to continue showing up to work. That combination, officials said, has left many strapped for cash and forced to take on side jobs to make ends meet, particularly since Tuesday, their first full missed payday.

On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that flight delays would increase and that passengers’ ability to reach their destinations would become more tenuous if the shutdown continued into November, when holiday travel picks up. Those comments came two days after the head of the air traffic controllers’ union said the stresses on his members were making the nation’s air travel system “less safe.”

The coming seasonal increase in flights and the onset of wintry weather would put additional stressors on the already overtaxed controllers at the same time as the financial crunch of the shutdown would become untenable for them, officials said. Mr. Duffy has said on multiple occasions this week that while some controllers may have enough savings to weather one missed paycheck, few would have the resources to get through a second missed check.

Controllers took their message to the public this week, fanning out over a number of major airports to distribute leaflets encouraging travelers to press their congressional representatives for an end to the impasse. Mr. Daniels, who has made joint appearances with Mr. Duffy this month, has rejected suggestions that controllers would take matters into their own hands by refusing to show up for work, stressing that such collective action would be illegal.

The F.A.A. imposes flight restrictions when air traffic facilities hit “staffing triggers” — thresholds at which the agency considers control towers to be insufficiently staffed to meet the needs of previously scheduled traffic. Because the F.A.A. currently has about 3,000 vacant controller positions, many towers operate very close to the margin of a staffing trigger. That means that any unexpected absence — whether because of illness, or a concern specific to the shutdown — can force the agency to slow or stop traffic, resulting in compound delays.

While the F.A.A. has not published a reason for Friday’s absences, experts said the spread of the delays appeared to be organic.

“The impact is growing over time with more ground delay programs due to staffing,” said Michael McCormick, a professor of air traffic management at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University. “But I do not see any signs of organized activity for a slowdown.”

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, has made preserving the legislative filibuster a central tenet of his tenure, though he has already weakened it with a rules change to speed confirmations and by stretching the reach of special filibuster-proof tax and spending bills, among other steps.

Earlier this month, Mr. Thune reiterated that he would oppose a change that would enable Republicans to bulldoze past Democratic opposition and pass a stopgap spending bill on a simple majority vote. But he has come under mounting pressure from some on the right, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia.

A Thune spokesman said on Friday that, “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.”

Even if he tried to get rid of the filibuster to appease Mr. Trump, Mr. Thune might lack the votes to do so. Multiple Senate Republicans have indicated an unwillingness to overturn the 60-vote legislative threshold using what is known as the “nuclear option,” in which the majority party changes the chamber’s rules with a simple majority, party-line vote.

Mr. Trump was adamant as he returned from his trip to Asia, urging Mr. Thune and his colleagues to act.

“It is now time for the Republicans to play their “TRUMP CARD,” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Under the current rules, at least 60 senators must agree to a final vote on any major legislation, including a spending bill that would reopen the government. Republicans hold 53 seats, and three Democratic-aligned senators have consistently joined them in voting to advance a stopgap spending bill, while one of their own, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, has repeatedly voted no. Without more defections, Republicans remain short of the 60-vote margin, prompting Mr. Trump’s push to rewrite the rules.

Advocates of doing so have argued that the change could be written narrowly to cover specific bills. But in reality, any change in the filibuster rules in the Senate, which operates according to precedent, would effectively end it for all bills. Opponents have suggested it would be a drastic move for such a limited win as a stopgap spending bill.

The president pushed multiple times during his first term to neuter the filibuster when Republicans controlled Congress. But Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who was the majority leader at the time, refused. Mr. McConnell had made deploying the filibuster against Democrats a hallmark of his career.

Senate Democrats in 2022 sought to end the 60-vote threshold on election-related measures but came up short when two of their members, Senators Joe Manchin III of West of Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, sided with Republicans against changing the rules.

“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” he said, in blunt criticism of the United States. “The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”

Mr. Türk’s statement has more symbolic power than direct influence over the actions of the United States, which is a permanent member of the U.N Security Council. But the forceful condemnation offers fodder for the criticism of the Trump administration’s policy from Democrats and civil society groups.

President Trump authorized the strikes, and his administration has told Congress that the United States was engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels that it has declared to be terrorist organizations.

But the administration has presented little evidence to support its claims, and specialists in the laws of war and executive power say he has used the military in a way that had no clear legal precedent or basis. Mr. Türk’s office said it had no credible evidence of a confrontation with the cartels that met the criteria of armed conflict under international law.

In early October, Mr. Türk wrote in a letter to the U.S. government that countering drug trafficking was a law enforcement issue and lethal force was only justified as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life.

“Based on the very sparse information provided publicly by the U.S. authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to the lives of others or otherwise justified the use of lethal armed force against them under international law,” Mr. Türk said.

But it remained unclear if or when food stamps would actually reach the roughly 42 million people who rely on monthly federal help to purchase groceries. It was also unclear the exact amounts that they would receive. Lawyers for the Trump administration had previously suggested it could take weeks to disburse benefits, and the Justice Department could still try to appeal in the case, perhaps further delaying aid.

A spokesman for the agency and a spokeswoman for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The legal wrangling concerned the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Without a last-minute intervention, the decades-old safety net program is set to run out of funds on Saturday, exacting a substantial economic toll on families more than four weeks into a shutdown seemingly without an end in sight.

Despite the imminent lapse, the Trump administration had maintained that it would not try to cover the shortfall, not even by using billions of dollars that Congress had previously set aside for SNAP to address possible emergencies. That triggered a series of lawsuits, as state and local officials, nonprofits and others argued that the White House had a legal and moral obligation to provide the benefits.

In one of the cases, Judge John J. McConnell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, ordered on Friday that the Trump administration “must distribute the contingency money timely, or as soon as possible, for the Nov. 1 payments to be made.”

His order came shortly after another federal court in Massachusetts handed an early victory to about two dozen states, which similarly had sued to force the release of food stamp funding.

In that case, Judge Indira Talwani, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, found that the decision to halt SNAP benefits was “unlawful.” She required the administration to explain by Monday how it would fund aid in November.

“Congress has put money in an emergency fund,” Judge Talwani said during a hearing in the case this week. “It’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency, when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits.”

The twin court defeats nonetheless amounted to a major rebuke of the White House, where President Trump’s leading deputies have maintained that they could do little to save SNAP — even after taking unusual steps to rearrange the budget to sustain other programs while the government remained closed.

“The American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,” Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday, insisting that Mr. Trump had “tried to do everything” in his power to make the shutdown as “unpainless as possible.”

With SNAP, the potential loss of federal aid risked severe financial distress for the roughly one in eight Americans enrolled in the program. Fearing the end of federal support, a handful of states had scrounged in recent days to provide food stamps on their own, though many said that they could only provision aid for a few days or weeks.

The SNAP benefits, which average around $187 a month per recipient, cost the federal government about $8 billion monthly, which lawmakers must regularly replenish as part of their work to fund the government. But the program also maintains a reserve in case of emergencies or shortfalls, which many Democrats and Republicans have encouraged the Trump administration to tap during the shutdown. That reserve currently stands at about $5 billion, enough to provide at least partial payments next month.

The Agriculture Department initially said it would use that money if the government remained closed, but reversed its policy in late October, saying that it could not legally drain the available reserves except in response to natural disasters. At a news conference Friday on Capitol Hill, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, argued that the emergency fund was “only allowed to flow if the underlying program is funded” by Congress.

Democrats largely rejected her interpretation of the law. The agency’s moves also prompted a series of lawsuits, including one filed by cities and nonprofit groups, who argued that the White House had “needlessly plunged SNAP into crisis.”

“Where there are appropriated funds available, benefits have to be furnished. And in this case, appropriated funds are available,” said Michael Torcello, a lawyer representing the groups that sued, during a hearing on Friday.

Officials in Arizona, California, New York, Massachusetts, Nevada and other states filed their own lawsuit earlier this week. Michelle Pascucci, a lawyer for the attorney general of Massachusetts who represented the states, told Judge Talwani at a hearing on Thursday that the loss of SNAP benefits could prove dire.

“Millions of Americans will lose the benefits they’ve had for decades,” she said.

In filings submitted ahead of the hearing, the Trump administration reaffirmed its opposition to using the emergency funds, even as it acknowledged it had ample leftover money there and in other accounts to spare millions of people from benefit cuts. Officials told the court that the law did not allow them to transfer or spend the cash absent a clear directive from Congress.

“What a sick joke,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. “The fact is: Funding exists to keep SNAP benefits flowing, and President Trump has instead chosen to force millions of Americans to go hungry.”

That means that children across the country would go to bed hungry and families will be thrown off their healthcare plans — for no reason at all.

Funding for SNAP is set to expire tomorrow.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is sitting on billions of dollars of contingency funding to maintain SNAP benefits through November. This money was appropriated by Congress to ensure SNAP benefits would continue in the event of a prolonged shutdown.

The Trump administration could stop millions of kids from going hungry. They simply refused to do so. Just this afternoon, a court ruled that the administration must use this funding.

Also starting tomorrow, millions of people will begin shopping for their health insurance plans, only to find that their premiums have surged. For many, insurance will become unaffordable, meaning they will be forced to go without healthcare.

Subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire, and the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have refused to extend them. This is the primary issue behind the ongoing shutdown.

Let’s take a step back. As FCNL’s Bridget Moix said earlier this month, the United States is facing another “moment of moral reckoning.”

In the wealthiest nation in the world, all people – all children – should have enough food to eat.

All people should be able to receive the healthcare that they need.

All people should be able to live lives of dignity and joy.

All people should be able to thrive and fulfill their potential.

What kind of country do we want to be? With the basic dignity of so many people on the line, that is the question our leaders in Washington need to answer right now.

Elsewhere

We can’t risk a nuclear arms race

In a strange social media post, President Trump announced that the U.S. will “start testing our Nuclear Weapons” for the first time in more than 30 years, falsely claiming that other nations have resumed testing. Nuclear testing is unnecessary, deeply harmful, and raises the risks of a nuclear arms race.

There are fewer than 100 days left until the end of New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. FCNL joined a week of action to urge Congress to act swiftly to make sure the world isn’t plunged into a dangerous and expensive arms race.

Dramatic cut to refugee admissions

The Trump administration announced that the U.S. would only accept 7,500 new refugees in the coming year, with a focus on Afrikaners from South Africa. As FCNL’s Bridget Moix put it, “This Presidential Determination represents a deplorable shift in American history. We will miss out on the vibrancy, resilience, and joy of our refugee brothers and sisters from all walks of life.””

Ongoing Genocide in Sudan

This week, we saw a devastating escalation in the conflict and in Sudan. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured El Fasher from the Sudanese Armed Forces. Atrocities have followed in the city, with reports of mass murders and extensive war crimes.

Congressional leaders have begun to condemn the violence and have called for accountability and safety for civilians. But the U.S. government needs to act swiftly to help stop these atrocities. That means holding the UAE accountable for arming the RSF, and surging U.S. aid to those in dire need. Join us and ask your members of Congress to speak up and to act!

Threatened attacks on military targets in Venezuela

The Trump administration may soon launch attacks at military targets within Venezuela, perhaps as a prelude to attempted regime change against the Maduro government. This comes as the U.S. government continues to murder people in boats in Latin America. The death toll is now over 60.

FCNL is lobbying Congress to assert their constitutional authority to stop this violence and reject this rush to war. Tell the Senate to stop Trump’s murder on the high seas!

(WLS) -- An emergency proposed class-action lawsuit has been filed against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over ""abusive and cruel"" conditions for people who have been detained and held inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)'s processing center in the village of Broadview.

Following a Friday afternoon court hearing, a federal judge set a hearing for Tuesday, Nov. 4 to discuss several emergency motions before the court over improving conditions at facility, noting that the allegations raised ""require immediate attention.""

ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch

The ICE processing facility has been the target of controversy and the community's ire over enhanced immigration enforcement - codenamed ""Operation Midway Blitz"" - that has resulted in thousands arrested by federal agents.

Most of those people arrested by immigration agents pass through the Broadview processing center, which attorneys say was never meant to be a ""longer-term detention facility"" but now DHS is allegedly ""warehousing people at Broadview for days on end,"" transforming it into a ""de facto detention center.""

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two people - Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona -- who were detained by ICE since Oct. 29 and were held at the Broadview facility. At a Friday court hearing in the case, an attorney representing the government said both men have already been transferred to a detention facility in Kansas.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman ordered both Gonzalez and Zamacona to be returned to the Chicago-area ""as quickly as possible,"" ahead of Tuesday's hearing.

Attorneys with the ACLU of Illinois, the MacArthur Justice Center, and the Chicago office of Eimer Stahl allege ICE agents have denied people held at the Broadview facility private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from entering the building, creating a ""black box"" they say has allowed authorities to act ""with impunity.""

Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don't understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and face deportation, according to the lawsuit.

""The conditions are horrific, and everyone is experiencing some form of degradation, just deplorable everyday conditions and lack of necessities,"" Alexa Van Brunt, lead attorney on the case with the MacArthur Justice Center, told the I-Team.

""There's not enough food; there's certainly not enough water. There's not free access to potable water,"" Van Brunt said. ""So many, many people have described just the overwhelming thirst, overwhelming hunger, and if you have a medical condition or religious practice that forbids you from eating what they offer, there's no alternative.""

Attorneys accuse ICE, DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection of violating detainees' First Amendment right to speak to an attorney, Fifth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to legal counsel.

The lawsuit included several emergency motions for a judge to consider forcing the federal agencies to improve the facility's conditions.

""It is supposed to be holding people for 12 hours or less,"" Van Brunt told the I-Team. ""It is now holding people for up to a week.""

According to the lawsuit, one person was held at the Broadview facility for three weeks.

Advocates have for months raised concerns about conditions inside the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held at the facility have called it a de facto detention center, where up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.

""There are serious privacy concerns. The holding cells are open to the people of both genders inside the facility,"" Van Brunt explained. ""So as a result, men can watch women use the restroom. Women can watch men, and the guards can watch everybody. It raises a real concern for safety and security.""

The ABC7 I-Team recently reported on allegations of deteriorating conditions inside the Broadview facility, with one attorney writing in a court declaration, ""Broadview is a black hole. When my clients are there, I am unable to speak to them or contact them.""

DHS officials have continued to vigorously dismiss these allegations surrounding the Broadview facility.

""Any claims there are subprime conditions at the Broadview ICE facility are false. All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers. No one is denied access to proper medical care. There is a privacy wall around the toilet for detainees,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, in part.

""As ICE arrests and removes criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., the agency has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding,"" McLaughlin said. ""Further, Broadview is a processing center, not a detention center. Detainees are briefly processed before being transferred to detention facilities.""

Van Brunt and other attorneys say the evidence they have gathered shows that's not the case.

At Friday's court hearing, Van Brunt called the situation at Broadview, ""a human rights emergency... a problem entirely of the defendants' own making.""

""ICE's own standards require them to have certain amount of food for people, certain sleeping facilities, certain drinking water and certainly medical care, and they are certainly not allowed to threaten or coerce people to sign documents against their will,"" Van Brunt said. ""ICE is violating all of these procedures.""

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and other lawmakers recently were turned away from the facility after requesting tours to see the conditions inside.

At a news conference on Friday, Durbin said the facility was never designed to hold people longer than a few hours.

""I never envisioned it as a detention facility. There weren't enough cells, restrooms, but that's what's happening,"" Durbin said. ""I have to tell you, my only knowledge of that is second hand. They will not let us in. They won't answer questions. They literally will not tell us who's there and how long they've been held.""

Durbin added, ""Every single day our office gets a call from people saying, 'We've lost a parent,' 'We've lost a brother,'... We spend hours and hours trying to find out [ and ] some of them are in Broadview.""

Durbin, along with a group of local Catholic nuns, would often hold prayer services for the people detained and workers at the Broadview ICE facility.

Sister JoAnn Persch told the I-Team she has provided religious counsel to people detained by ICE at Broadview for more than ten years and knowing what the inside of the facility looks like, she's concerned with how many people are being held there.

""There are no beds being a processing center. No showers, no doors,"" Persch told the I-Team. ""And there aren't that many toilets in there... I just think it's very inhumane, very disrespectful.""

""It just makes me furious to hear people say they're Christian, but they can treat human beings like they're being treated,"" Persch said.

The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver’s license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship.

The plan, outlined in a public notice posted Thursday, is the latest step in an unprecedented Trump administration initiative to pool confidential data from varied sources that it claims will help identify noncitizens on voter rolls, tighten immigration enforcement and expose public benefit fraud.

According to emails obtained by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, DHS approached Texas officials in June about a pilot program to add the state’s driver license data, but it’s not clear if the state participated.

Earlier this year, DHS added millions of Americans’ Social Security data to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, system, allowing officials to use the tool to conduct bulk searches of voter rolls for the first time. According to the document filed Thursday, SAVE also recently expanded to include passport and visa information.

Incorporating driver’s license information would allow election officials whose rolls don’t include voters’ Social Security numbers to conduct bulk searches by driver’s license number. Ultimately, the system would link these two crucial identifiers for the purpose of citizenship checks, said Michael Morse, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

“It is the key that unlocks everything,” Morse said.

State driver’s license databases often include a variety of sensitive information on drivers, including place of birth, passport number, biometrics, address, email and employment information, said Claire Jeffrey, a spokesperson for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.

Beyond the privacy concerns this creates, using driver’s license numbers in SAVE could lead to citizens being wrongly flagged as noncitizens, said Rachel Orey, director of the elections project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Driver’s license numbers are sometimes reused and people can have licenses in multiple states. Also, if SAVE isn’t linked to live versions of state driver’s license databases, the information in the system will be outdated.

“This could have far-reaching consequences for voter access and public trust if inaccurate data were used to question eligibility or citizenship,” Orey said.

DHS says in the notice that linking to driver’s license data, which it calls the most widely used form of identification, “will allow SAVE to match against other sources to verify immigration status and U.S. citizenship, which will improve accuracy and efficiency for SAVE user agencies.”

The department did not respond to questions about the expansion.

Up until this year, SAVE was mostly used to check individual immigrants’ citizenship status when they applied for public benefits. DHS has said the aim in expanding the system was to enable election officials to check voter rolls en masse. But the agency’s data-sharing agreement with the Social Security Administration as well as Thursday’s disclosure make clear that DHS and other agencies can use SAVE for other purposes, including for immigration enforcement investigations.

Information uploaded into the system by state and local election officials and other users will be saved and may be “shared with other DHS Components that have a need to know of the information to carry out their national security, law enforcement, immigration, intelligence, or other homeland security functions,” the notice explains.

Advocacy groups have sued the federal government claiming the pooling of data in SAVE violates the Privacy Act, which is meant to prevent misuse of private data. In filings, the government has said that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 explicitly allows information sharing to verify citizenship status and that DHS would exercise caution in flagging voters as potential noncitizens.

Some privacy lawyers called DHS’ move to add driver’s license information more evidence of federal overreach. “The administration wants to get as much data as it can, however it can, whenever it can,” said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.

The DHS notice, known as a system of records notice, allows for public comment on several aspects of SAVE’s expansion, including some already completed. Typically, such notices are filed when agencies propose changes to federal systems, and the comments are meant to inform how officials go forward. That didn’t happen in this case.

In June, email records show, DHS asked the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver’s licenses and ID cards, to partner on a pilot program to add its data into SAVE.

Timothy Benz of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the branch of DHS that oversees SAVE, wrote that the planned expansion was part of the “evolution” of SAVE into a “one-stop shop for all election agency verification needs.”

“That would require collaboration with each states’ DL agency in order for us to query those DL records in order to provide that information to the querying elections agency,” Benz wrote.

Rebekah Hibbs, a supervisor in the Texas Department of Public Safety’s driver’s license division, replied that DPS is “always happy” to support the SAVE tool and agreed to talk again with USCIS.

It’s not clear what happened next. In response to questions from ProPublica and the Tribune, DPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen said the “department does not have any ongoing projects with USCIS related to driver record information for registered voters, nor have we been asked to provide that information.”

She did not answer questions about whether DPS has given any data to USCIS. DHS did not respond to questions about whether the partnership moved forward.

Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson announced Oct. 20 that her office had run the state’s entire voter roll through SAVE. Alicia Pierce, Nelson’s spokesperson, said the office did the check using full Social Security numbers, which it routinely obtains from the Department of Public Safety to match with registered voters.

The results showed that around 0.015% of Texas voters, or 2,724 people, are potentially noncitizens.

At least one Texas official is concerned that those initial SAVE results may not be accurate. In a court filing submitted Wednesday as part of the Privacy Act litigation, Travis County voter registration director Christopher Davis wrote that state data shows about 25% of the voters that SAVE flagged as potential noncitizens in the county had provided proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

“I am concerned that the list Travis County received from the Secretary of State is flawed and worry about the potential for voters to be improperly cancelled from the voter rolls and possibly disenfranchised as a result,” Davis’ filing says.

CG: Well, I mean, for that money, then, what are NANA shareholders getting out of it?
So the NANA dividend is paid twice a year.","Northwest Alaska's NANA Regional Corporation is a major player in government contracts for immigration detention facilities.

As the Trump administration's immigration crackdown continues, allegations of human rights abuses have led calls from some NANA shareholders to get out of the immigrant detention business.

As an Alaska Native corporation, NANA is able to pursue the contracts as a small or disadvantaged business under what's known as the 8(a) program.

Bloomberg Businessweek, working with Kotzebue radio station KOTZ, found NANA held nearly 58.1% of ICE's 8(a) contracts over the past decade, a period during which it raked in about $1.2 billion.

As some NANA shareholders told Bloomberg reporter Polly Mosendz and KOTZ reporter Desiree Hagen, that financial payoff is not worth the human toll.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Desiree Hagen: Between the two of us, we interviewed nearly two dozen shareholders, and one of the most common things that I heard was that this goes against our Iñupiaq values, Iñupiat illitqusait, which is like 17 values that range from, you know, respect for others, cooperation, respect for elders.

Another thing that we heard was that maybe NANA was not communicating this. A few shareholders said, ""This was the first time we've heard about it,"" or, ""We're just learning about this,"" which was kind of calling into question the corporate transparency.

Polly Mosendz: Yeah, I think that's an excellent point. I think there were a lot of people who sort of asked us, ""Well, where can I find this in the shareholder report? Where has this been disclosed by the company?"" And pretty consistently, we would have to say that it's just not really been a matter of profound disclosure. If you look at the annual report, you certainly wouldn't get the impression that this is a detention center giant.

Casey Grove: There's a chart in the story that shows that NANA has a huge proportion of these type of contracts, compared to other Alaska Native corporations. Is there something about how 8(a) contracting works that lends itself to getting ICE contracts?

PM: Just to kind of give a size and scope, the value of NANA's ICE contracts this year is approaching $300 million, which is an increase of about $100 million over last year. So that is substantial for any company. And one thing to keep in mind is that regardless of how big NANA gets, it still qualifies for the set-aside contracts under 8(a), and that is unique. You know, other small businesses, disadvantaged businesses, can kind of scale out of being 8(a) contractors. That is not the case with Alaska Native corps, and that is unique. So even a multi-billion-dollar company like we're talking about here is still going to qualify for those set asides. And that is, you know, that can be really lucrative, that can be a really serious advantage.

DH: So it was like NANA is a medium-sized fish in a smaller bowl, as opposed to being in a bowl full of large fishes.

CG: Well, I mean, for that money, then, what are NANA shareholders getting out of it?

PM: Yeah, let's talk about the dividend a little bit. So the NANA dividend is paid twice a year. There was one that was about $8 (per share). There's one coming up, it's gonna be about $20 per share. And while NANA doesn't disclose the median quantity of shares that a shareholder might have, an average that we were able to deduce based on the quantity of shares outstanding, to the approximation of how many shareholders there are, would be about 117.

So for this year, you're looking at about $3,300 a person. And one shareholder who we interviewed, David Leslie, basically made the argument that he feels like the company is complicit in a human rights violation, and it's not quite enough money per dividend to pay his rent with it. So he was frustrated with the dividend.

On the flip side, there's other shareholders who we spoke with who said, you know, the dividend is helpful to them, and that they also wanted to take into account the other elements of support that NANA was providing, like, for example, fuel subsidies. That's something that came up a lot.

So I think that the dividend can be controversial. Some people think that they are being paid a fair amount, and some people feel like, no, it isn't enough. So I don't think that there is agreement. And frankly, I think any 15,000 people who you poll on such a matter would probably have natural disagreements on whether they thought that the dividend was fair.

DH: I would say that NANA does do a lot for the region. Just in the course of reporting, I'm keeping track of how much money is going to, let's say, you know, this renewable energy project, which is something that we just heard. You know, oh, there's another $5 million that Nana is contributing. So there are contributions, but echoing what Polly said, we heard a lot of different things about how people felt about their dividend and how NANA was contributing to the communities.

CG: Well, speaking of some of the things that shareholders told you that they considered to be human rights abuses and stories that we've heard coming out of these detention facilities, what did NANA say in response to these, either these allegations or questions from their own shareholders?

PM: While NANA did not respond to us in the course of reporting this story, they did send a letter earlier this summer specifically to a shareholder who had asked them about these contracts, and in that letter, they had denied some of the media reports and they felt that these contracts did uphold their community's values.

They had also made a reference to site visits. We don't know what those site visits might have consisted of, where they might have gone, or who went, or what they were allowed to see, but that was what they had said sort of privately, and we have not heard from the company since the article was publicized.

CG: Where does this go from here? The story leaves off sounding like NANA is not going to be shying away from these contracts in the future.

PM: Yeah, I think we genuinely can't know. What we do know is that the federal government has clearly made this a mission. The president campaigned on this. This is a notable campaign promise that he made. It was a landmark part of his first administration, and it seems like it's an even more committed to part of this administration the second go around.

So I think that what we do know is that the federal government is extremely focused on this, and historically, they do use contractors to hold people in these facilities. And, you know, with $45 billion released for this administration's deportation, detention plan broadly, I think we know that this is work that someone is going to do, whether NANA is going to do it, or another Alaska Native corp, we don't know. We can't know, but there is going to be a lot of money when the government eventually reopens with which to do this work.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/453838f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3456x1814+0+245/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F06%2FIMG_9260.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 18:03:12.151717

""Community members are being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights.
This is a vicious abuse of power and gross violation of basic human rights by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security.
""This lawsuit is necessary because the Trump administration has attempted to evade accountability for turning the processing center at Broadview into a de facto detention center,"" said Kevin Fee, legal director for the ACLU of Illinois, in a statement.
""We can debate immigration policy but there is no debating the denial of legal rights and holding those detained in conditions that are not only unlawful but inhumane.","Oct. 31 (UPI) -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois sued the Trump administration Friday for allegedly violating the civil rights of those detained in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Ill.

The suit, which includes lawyers for the MacArthur Justice Center, the ACLU of Illinois and the Chicago law office of Eimer Stahl, was filed in federal court in Chicago, a press release said.

The suit demands that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and ICE ""stop flouting the law inside Broadview."" The press release said the agencies ""must obey the Constitution and provide the people they detain with ready access to counsel and humane conditions of confinement.""

Since the beginning of Operation Midway Blitz on Sept. 8, in which federal agents increased actions against undocumented immigrants in and around Chicago, protests and legal battles have ensued. On Tuesday, a judge issued a temporary restraining order on Gregory Bovino, a U.S. border patrol commander, after video footage showed Bovino throwing tear gas into a crowd during public demonstrations in Chicago and outside of the Broadview detention center. Clergy members, media groups and protesters had filed a suit alleging a ""pattern of extreme brutality"" intended to ""silence the press"" and American citizens.

Judge Sara Ellis ordered all agents to wear body cameras. She also ordered Bovino to check in with her daily, but an appeals court overturned that requirement.

""Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,"" said Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center's Illinois office and lead counsel on the suit, in a statement. ""Community members are being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights. This is a vicious abuse of power and gross violation of basic human rights by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. It must end now.""

The press release said that agents at Broadview ""have treated detainees abhorrently, depriving them of sleep, privacy, menstrual products, and the ability to shower."" Agents have repeatedly denied entry for attorneys, members of Congress, and religious and faith leaders, it said.

DHS has not responded to the suit or its allegations.

""This lawsuit is necessary because the Trump administration has attempted to evade accountability for turning the processing center at Broadview into a de facto detention center,"" said Kevin Fee, legal director for the ACLU of Illinois, in a statement. ""DHS personnel have denied access to counsel, legislators and journalists so that the harsh and deteriorating conditions at the facility can be shielded from public view. These conditions are unconstitutional and threaten to coerce people into sacrificing their rights without the benefit of legal advice and a full airing of their legal defenses.""

Lawyer Nate Eimer emphasized the importance of access to a lawyer.

""Access to counsel is not a privilege. It is a right,"" Eimer, partner at Eimer Stahl and co-counsel in the lawsuit, said in a statement. ""We can debate immigration policy but there is no debating the denial of legal rights and holding those detained in conditions that are not only unlawful but inhumane.

Indeed, the U.S. maintains a different process for assessing potential Israeli violations, which is distinct from that of any other country.

According to The Washington Post, officials say that the possible violations were reported by the State Department’s watchdog, known as the Office of Inspector General. These reports would take “multiple years” to investigate, officials told the Post, as former officials have noted that the U.S. maintains a special process for potential Israeli violations to give preference to the Israeli military.

The office’s website has a page for the report, but it is listed as “Classified” and “not available for public viewing.”

The report is notable as it’s the first confirmation of the State Department’s acknowledgement of the scale of Israel’s violations in relation to the Leahy Laws. The Leahy Laws bar the U.S. from sending weapons to foreign military units credibly accused of human rights violations, and have been cited countless times by advocates for Palestinian rights calling for an arms embargo to Israel.

The report includes incidents like Israel’s bombing of a World Central Kitchen aid caravan in April 2024, which killed seven workers of international backgrounds.

It also includes the killing of 78-year-old Palestinian American Omar Assad by Israeli forces in 2022. Soldiers stopped Assad at a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank, dragged him out of his car, bound him, and left him on the ground to die overnight; Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in 2024 that the unit responsible was “remediated” and still eligible for military assistance.

However, U.S. officials familiar with the report cast doubt on the possibility of the U.S. acting upon any findings in the report “given the large backlog of incidents and the nature of the review process, which is deferential to the Israel Defense Forces,” the Post reported.

Indeed, the U.S. maintains a different process for assessing potential Israeli violations, which is distinct from that of any other country. The protocol is known as the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum, and, unlike other such processes, has burdensome requirements like in-person meetings with high-level officials in order to make assessments, in which every official must agree on the conclusion.

The protocol heavily favors Israel, with assessments also requiring a request for information from Israel directly in order to proceed — meaning that Israel could theoretically indefinitely delay the process.

This is in sharp contrast to other countries where even a single official’s objection to sending a unit arms could trigger a withholding of assistance, former State Department official Josh Paul told the Post.

Tellingly, though it has existed since 2020, the Israeli Leahy Vetting Forum has never found an Israeli unit to be ineligible for receiving U.S. assistance, former State Department officials have reported.

“What worries me is that accountability will be forgotten now that the noise of the conflict is dying down,” Charles Blaha, a former State Department official under the Biden administration, told The Washington Post. Blaha was in charge of the office that oversees Leahy Law implementation.

Blaha said that the U.S. has consistently sought to give Israel a pass across administrations, amid its genocide in Gaza. “I don’t see any difference between the Biden administration and the Trump administration on this issue.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_10-31-israeli-tank-gaza.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 15:16:54.479857

Detainees have been denied insulin, left without medical attention for days and forced to compete for clean water, the investigation found.

The report, released by Georgia Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, is the second in a series of inquiries into alleged human rights abuses within the system.

It builds on an August review detailing mistreatment of children and pregnant women, drawing on more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect between January and August.

Detainees also described meals being too small for adults, milk that was sometimes out of date and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick.

Mr Ossoff said the findings expose “a deeper failure of oversight,” adding: “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment.”

National Immigration Project regional attorney Stephanie Alvarez-Jones said one of her clients at Louisiana’s Camp J facility had been left partially paralysed after being denied a prescribed medical device and placed in segregation.

“He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance,” she said.

The governors of New York, Delaware, Oregon and Virginia have declared the looming crisis a state of emergency, while states set aside millions to help offset the lapse of federal benefits.","Two federal judges issued back-to-back rulings on Friday in separate cases ordering the Trump administration to use contingency funds to continue paying for food stamps during the government shutdown.

A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday afternoon blocked the Trump administration from suspending all food aid for millions of Americans, in a case brought by a group of US cities, non-profit organizations and a trade union.

At almost the same time, in a separate but similar case, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the government must continue to fund the program that helps low-income households stave off food insecurity, in a case brought by the Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia and three governors who sued the administration.

Without intervention, the US Department of Agriculture said it planned to suspend payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as Snap or food stamps, on Saturday, 1 November, putting millions of low-income households that rely on the benefits at risk of food insecurity and financial hardship.

John McConnell, a US district judge in Providence, issued a temporary restraining order in the Rhode Island case at the behest of those plaintiffs. They had argued that the US Department of Agriculture’s suspension of Snap benefits due to kick in on Saturday was unlawful.

Snap, the nation’s largest anti-hunger initiative, provides assistance to nearly 42 million – one in eight – low-income Americans each month. The USDA has said insufficient funds exist to pay full benefits, as issuing food stamps costs the public purse between $8.5bn and $9bn every month.

The Trump administration contends the agency lacks authority to pay them until Congress passes a spending bill that will ending the enduring government shutdown which began on 1 October.

The plaintiffs in the civil case being heard in Rhode Island are represented by the liberal legal advocacy group Democracy Forward. The group argued that the federal government’s decision to suspend the nutritional benefits was wrong and unlawful, as the USDA still had funds available to fulfill its obligation to fund the Snap program.

Such available funding includes $5.25bn in contingency funds that Congress has previously provided for the USDA to use when “necessary to carry out program operations”, the plaintiffs said.

Aside from the contingency funds, the plaintiffs argued that a separate fund with about $23bn in it could also be utilized to avoid what would be an unprecedented suspension of Snap benefits.

In the Massachusetts case, the US district judge Indira Talwani in Boston gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partly pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.

It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.

The rulings are likely to face appeals.

In their challenge, the Democratic-led states argued that the agriculture department has the legal authority – and available funds – to at least partly maintain the program during the shutdown.

“Because of [the] USDA’s actions, Snap benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,” the states said in their complaint. “Worse still, [the] USDA suspended Snap benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November Snap benefits.”

The Trump administration has maintained that the department’s contingency fund is intended for natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods, not government shutdowns. The government has acknowledged that it has billions of federal dollars left, including emergency funds especially marked for Snap, but top officials have maintained they are unable to tap into those reserve funds.

The administration warned that a court order requiring it to use emergency reserves to fund Snap would be “operationally fraught”, arguing it could take weeks to deliver benefits and might leave families with less than half their normal monthly allotment. In court filings, officials noted that such a partial payment “has never been made – and for good reason”.

The argument appears to contradict the department’s lapsed-funding plan, released in late September, which stated that Congress’s “evident” intent was for Snap operations to continue during a government shutdown and pointed to “multi-year contingency funds” that could be tapped in the event the closures dragged on. The plan has been removed from the department’s website.

The USDA’s website now carries a strikingly partisan notice, accusing Senate Democrats, incorrectly, of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants and trans Americans. “Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the notice says. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.”

The administration’s refusal to intervene underscored a broader strategy during the shutdown, now the second-longest in US history. Throughout the impasse, Trump has selectively reprogrammed federal funds to protect priorities central to his political agenda – such as paying troops and law enforcement officers, including those involved in immigration enforcement – while allowing other programs like Snap to starve.

Bracing for the loss of federal nutrition assistance, food banks and pantries, already stretched thin amid rising food prices, were bracing for a surge in demand. Officials in states such as Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, Hawaii and Minnesota have announced plans to tap state and local funds to provide food aid and assist food banks in the interim.

The governors of New York, Delaware, Oregon and Virginia have declared the looming crisis a state of emergency, while states set aside millions to help offset the lapse of federal benefits.

“Unlike Washington Republicans, I won’t sit idly by as families struggle to put food on the table,” New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced on Thursday.

In California, the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said he would deploy the California national guard under his command to support food banks and announced $80m in state support to fill the Snap gap.

The rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.

The program costs around $8 billion per month nationally.

Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.

The administration said it wasn't allowed to use a contingency fund with about $5 billion in it for the program, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep SNAP running. The Democratic officials argued that not only could that money be used, it must be. They also said a separate fund with around $23 billion is available for the cause.

A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from a bench that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds - and asked for an update on progress by Monday.

A Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds

It wasn't immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.

The rulings are likely to face appeals.

In a hearing in Boston Thursday on a legal challenge filed by the Democratic officials from 25 states, one federal judge seemed skeptical of the administration's argument that SNAP benefits could be halted.

U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani told lawyers that if the government can't afford to cover the cost, there's a process to follow rather than simply suspending all benefits. ""The steps involve finding an equitable way of reducing benefits,"" said Talwani, who was nominated to the court by former President Barack Obama.

Talwani seemed to be leaning toward requiring the government to put billions of dollars in emergency funds toward SNAP. That, she said, is her interpretation of what Congress intended when an agency's funding runs out.

""If you don't have money, you tighten your belt,"" she said in court. ""You are not going to make everyone drop dead because it's a political game someplace.""

Government lawyers say a contingency fund containing some $5 billion cannot legally be used to maintain SNAP, a program that costs about $8 billion a month. The states say it must be used for that purpose and point to more money available in a second federal account with around $23 billion.

Talwani said her ruling would apply nationwide, not just in the states that are part of the challenge. That could defy the intentions of the U.S. Supreme Court, which has limited the use of nationwide injunctions, though it hasn't prohibited them.

Meanwhile, states, food banks and recipients have been bracing for an abrupt shift in how low-income people can get groceries.

The majority of states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the debit cards used in the program.

Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills.

At a Washington news conference Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department runs SNAP, said the contingency funds in question would not cover the cost of SNAP for long. Speaking at a press conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol, she blamed Democrats for conducting a ""disgusting dereliction of duty"" by refusing to end their Senate filibuster as they hold out for an extension of health care funds.

A push this week to continue SNAP funding during the shutdown failed in Congress.

To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four's net income after certain expenses can't exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $31,000 per year. Last year, SNAP provided assistance to 41 million people, nearly two-thirds of whom were families with children, according to the lawsuit.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18095864_103125-cc-ap-snap-food-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-31 19:02:09.084826

Roughly 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to help buy food.

In a case brought by a coalition of states in federal court in Massachusetts, Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government is required by law to tap into the emergency money to make at least partial payments, and gave the administration until Monday to tell the court whether it planned to do so.

In Rhode Island, another federal judge granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of municipalities and nonprofits who sued to block the imminent funding freeze, according to attorneys for Democracy Forward, the group leading the suit. The ruling was made from the bench. An entry on the case docket said the court ""orders the USDA to distribute contingency funds"" and report back to the court by noon on Monday.

In her ruling, Talwani stopped short of ordering the administration to send SNAP payments on Saturday, but she rejected the government's argument that the $5 billion contingency fund cannot be used to fund benefits during the lapse in appropriations.

""At core, Defendants' conclusion that USDA is statutorily prohibited from funding SNAP because Congress has not enacted new appropriations for the current fiscal year is erroneous,"" Talwani wrote. ""To the contrary, Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds.""

Talwani wrote that ""the court will allow Defendants to consider whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and report back to the court no later than"" Monday.

SNAP benefits provide eligible families with an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card for food purchases. Many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. The Trump administration said money for the program was due to expire on Saturday because of the ongoing government shutdown, now on its 31st day.

The suit in Massachusetts was brought by two dozen states and the District of Columbia earlier this week. They asked the court to require the administration to tap into the emergency funds to keep SNAP money flowing to states, which administer food stamp programs. The states argued that the administration's decision to cut off payments was unlawful and threatened to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.

""Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,"" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. ""Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.""

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said in a memo last week that ""the well has run dry"" and that November benefits would not be paid without an end to the shutdown. Administration officials and Republicans in Congress have said that the roughly $5 billion in the contingency fund could not legally be used to cover the shortfall.

""By law, the contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing,"" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said at the Capitol on Friday.

Talwani, the judge in Massachusetts, rejected that argument in her ruling: ""[U]nder Defendants' statutory construction, the use of the separately appropriated contingent reserve to fund SNAP benefits is somehow predicated on Congress's annual appropriation of funds to the SNAP program. Congress placed no such restrictions in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act.""

She wrote that the suspension of SNAP payments to the states was ""based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments.""

""This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program,"" the judge wrote. ""And while these contingency funds reportedly are insufficient to cover the entire cost of SNAP for November, Defendants also may supplement the Contingency Funds by authorizing a transfer of additional funds ... to avoid any reductions.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/31/8cfbe66e-6ff6-49f2-a65e-8fc140437a5d/thumbnail/1200x630/8ff2cfa2da77a56e47538c577d3fbfc3/gettyimages-2243826120.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 16:01:17.418237

OAKLAND — California Attorney General Rob Bonta today issued a bulletin to all California healthcare providers, service plans, and contractors summarizing their new responsibilities under Senate Bill 81 (SB 81). Authored by State Senator Jesse Arreguín (D-Oakland), SB 81 amends the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) and the Health and Safety Code to designate the immigration status of patients as protected medical data and requires healthcare facilities to designate non-public areas where access for immigration enforcement purposes is limited. SB 81 was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and took effect on September 20, 2025.

“Immigrants deserve to receive the healthcare they need without fear. Thanks to legislation like SB 81, California is taking action to protect the personal information of immigrants receiving healthcare, and hospitals remain safe spaces to seek care without the threat of immigration enforcement,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Our information bulletin aims to remind healthcare providers of their new obligations under SB 81. We expect full compliance with this vital new law and will continue to support and defend the rights of California’s immigrant communities.”

The information bulletin outlines the following changes:

Restrictions on Sharing Medical Information:

SB 81 designates place of birth and current or prior immigration status as protected “medical information” under the CMIA.

SB 81 reasserts that healthcare providers, service plans, and contractors must comply with all federal and California state court orders but prohibits them from complying with court orders issued by any other court.

These provisions apply to any healthcare providers and other covered entities in California.

Restriction on Access to Private Areas of Healthcare Facilities:

Healthcare providers must designate areas at healthcare facilities where patients receive care or discuss protected health information as non-public. Facilities should designate areas as non-public through mapping, signage, or key entry.

Healthcare providers must not allow anyone access to the non-public areas of health facilities for immigration purposes, unless required by state or federal law, or unless provided with a valid judicial warrant or court order that specifically grants access to private areas of the facility.

These provisions apply to any healthcare providers that receive public funding. The law encourages all other healthcare provider entities to adopt the law’s requirements.

Provide Notice of Immigration Enforcement:

Healthcare provider personnel must notify management, administration, or legal counsel of any request for access to a patient, information, or site for immigration enforcement purposes, including requests made through a subpoena, warrant, or court order.

Healthcare provider entities must, to the extent possible, establish or amend procedures for monitoring, documenting, and receiving visitors. The law further encourages provider entities to post “notice to authorities” at facility entrances.

Attorney General Bonta is committed to protecting and defending the rights of California's immigrant communities. He previously issued guidance to help California immigrants better understand their rights and protections under the law and avoid immigration scams.

ICE has long been monitoring immigrants in Chicago using facial recognition technology.
Facial recognition ‘threatens privacy’ For years, Democrats in Washington have unsuccessfully tried to place limits on facial recognition technology.
“This is what dystopian nightmares are made of, this kind of continual expansion of surveillance without any real oversight or restrictions.” Meanwhile, the uphill battle to curtail the use of facial recognition has only gotten tougher.
“Facial recognition technology is often biased and inaccurate, especially when used against communities of color,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who signed the letter and has introduced legislation aimed at regulating facial recognition.","The Trump administration has wiped a facial recognition policy from its website while further embracing the controversial technology and securing a $9 million contract with a company barred from selling to Illinois law enforcement agencies.

The ban was the result of a lawsuit filed in Cook County that alleged Clearview AI’s massive database of photographs pulled from across the internet violated a landmark state law protecting people’s personal information.

But a settlement of the case didn’t apply to federal law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and its immigration agents. ICE has long been monitoring immigrants in Chicago using facial recognition technology.

Clearview — described by an attorney who sued the company as “one of the largest threats to personal privacy” — can be used in Chicago by federal authorities carrying out President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.

The FBI, Army, US. Marshals Service and Department of Homeland Security currently hold nearly $10 million in contracts with Clearview, whose chief executive reportedly has close ties to Trump allies.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is using the largest contract — worth up to $9.2 million — to identify victims and perpetrators of child sex crimes, as well as people suspected of “assaults against law enforcement officers,” records show.

The contract began Sept. 5, days before ICE launched its aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the Chicago area known as “Midway Blitz.” As agents fan out across the city and suburbs, there’s no federal law governing the use of facial recognition technology and apparently little to no restrictions.

A facial recognition policy implemented under former President Joe Biden was removed from the DHS website shortly after Trump took office, according to an oversight body’s report, which said it’s unclear whether the policy still applies or is being updated.

A DHS spokesperson claims the policy remains in effect, but it still can’t be found online. Web pages that mention the policy have been wiped or archived.

“In an effort to keep DHS.gov current, the archive contains outdated information that may not reflect current policy or programs,” some of the pages say.

The DHS spokesperson said the notices “simply reflect standard web-management practices to prevent outdated materials from being presented as current; they do not represent a change in policy. DHS continually reviews issuances to strengthen clarity and accuracy.”

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., raised concerns about the potential rollback of protections and oversight.

“I find it appalling that the Trump Administration is attempting to silently revoke previous guidance that was put in place to protect our privacy and due process rights,” Durbin said. “We need answers on how and why the Trump Administration is using surveillance technology, such as what is provided by Clearview AI, especially as DHS continues to ruthlessly carry out cruel, excessive immigration raids and detain both immigrants and U.S. citizens.”

The Biometric Information Privacy Act

The Cook County legal settlement barring most businesses, entities and state law enforcement agencies from using Clearview stemmed from a lawsuit filed in May 2020 by the ACLU of Illinois and other advocacy organizations.

The lawsuit claimed the company was violating the Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires people to consent to the collection and use of their personally identifying information such as fingerprints or face scans.

In March, a federal judge in Chicago approved another settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit brought by people who claimed their biometrics were illegally scraped from the internet and used without their approval.

U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman created a novel settlement structure to resolve the class-action suit for thousands of potential plaintiffs.

They could get a possible 23% stake in Clearview that would be paid out based on a variety of factors, including if the company goes public or is liquidated. The company was valued at $225 million, putting the stake at $51.75 million.

In addition to the $9.2 million Clearview is now getting from ICE, the company has these contracts:

$407,000 for the FBI to “reduce crime, fraud, and risk in order to make communities safer” in New York City

$95,000 for the U.S. Marshals Service for “apprehending fugitives” in Springfield, Virginia

$75,000 for the U.S. Army at the Fort Bragg military installation in North Carolina

$30,000 for Customs and Border Protection at the Spokane Sector in Washington state

$15,000 for Customs and Border Protection at the Yuma Sector in Arizona

A company spokesperson didn’t respond to questions.

Clearview allegedly tied to alt-right ideology

One of the cases consolidated to create the class-action suit was filed in California.

It claimed the company’s founder, Hoan Ton-That, and others associated with Manhattan-based Clearview had “longstanding ties to the alt-right, a far-right ideology based on the belief that white identity is under attack.”

Ton-That now works as chief technology officer for Architect Capital, a San Francisco-based financial firm. Reuters reported that Ton-That was replaced in February by Richard Schwartz, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s onetime adviser, and Republican megadonor Hal Lambert.

The suit was originally filed in Alameda County court in California by a group of advocates who said they didn’t consent to have their biometric information harvested. It alleged the company was tied to a “pizzagate” conspiracy theorist, a neo-Nazi hacker and a man who marched during the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

According to the lawsuit, Charles Johnson, a Holocaust denier and purported Clearview co-founder, allegedly made a Facebook post about “building algorithms to ID all the illegal immigrants for the deportation squad.”

Johnson was pushed out of Clearview and ordered to pay $71 million in July after he was sued for allegedly posing as an intelligence agent as part of an extortion scheme targeting Lambert, Clearview’s co-chief executive officer, and his investment management firm.

Facial recognition ‘threatens privacy’

For years, Democrats in Washington have unsuccessfully tried to place limits on facial recognition technology.

Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., introduced legislation in July that would bar law enforcement officials from using “facial recognition to enforce the immigration laws of the United States or share facial recognition data with other agencies for the purposes of enforcing the immigration laws of the United States.”

The legislation was referred to both the House Judiciary and Science, Space, and Technology committees, which are controlled by Republicans.

On Jan. 16, four days before Trump returned to office, DHS officials announced what they described as “the most extensive requirements” of any federal agency to ensure facial recognition was “used properly.”

The next month, the agency removed the text of the underlying policy from its website, according to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the independent agency that questioned the move in May. By then, Trump’s administration had effectively whittled the watchdog group down to a single Republican member.

Jeramie D. Scott, senior counsel at Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based nonprofit focused on civil liberties and privacy, said: “It’s very unclear what the policy is, or if there even is a policy that’s in effect with respect to DHS’ use of facial recognition technology.

“ICE is now seemingly using it without any guardrails to identify anyone they deem suspicious,” Scott said. “This is what dystopian nightmares are made of, this kind of continual expansion of surveillance without any real oversight or restrictions.”

Meanwhile, the uphill battle to curtail the use of facial recognition has only gotten tougher.

In September, nine Democrat senators wrote to acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to question him about an app known as Mobile Fortify, which they said “reportedly allows agents to point a smartphone at an individual’s face or fingerprints and identify the individual based on a biometric match against several federal databases.”

Videos of masked agents scanning people with cellphones have begun cropping up on social media.

The Mobile Fortify app is part of a growing arsenal of tools the feds have to vet whether someone is in the country without legal status, including iris scanning, the use of license plate readers, and fingerprint matches between a DHS database of immigrants removed from the United States and an FBI database containing fingerprints from arrests by the Chicago Police Department and other local law enforcement agencies.

“Facial recognition technology is often biased and inaccurate, especially when used against communities of color,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who signed the letter and has introduced legislation aimed at regulating facial recognition.

“The use of this technology against protesters and private citizens is concerning, dangerous, and is not just a threat to privacy, but foments a threat on democracy itself.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d9c2d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4226x2412+0+202/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F58%2Fad7c2e1db96d7ff2da1745180b0f%2Fmerlin-105634995.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 14:56:59.058686

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water.
Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.
Expired milk, foul water, scant food are reported The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews.","A U.S. Senate investigation has uncovered dozens of credible reports of medical neglect and poor conditions in immigration detention centers nationwide — with detainees denied insulin, left without medical attention for days and forced to compete for clean water — raising scrutiny about how the government oversees its vast detention system.

The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.

The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.

A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that “ambulances have to come almost every day,” according to the report.

Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.

“Americans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,” Ossoff told The Associated Press. “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.”

The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.

Expired milk, foul water, scant food are reported

The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.

The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report’s findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff’s first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to “score political points.”

Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they’ve seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.

Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization’s clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola’s Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,” she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn’t able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he’s been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

The Baltimore field office is examined

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization’s clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it’s much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,” Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren’t always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/preview-748.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-31 14:02:23.608152

Russia has denied it has tested nuclear weapons and criticized the U.S. as confusing its testing of a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable missile with a nuclear explosive.","President Trump’s decision to restart nuclear weapons testing as a warning to Moscow is being cheered by his Republican allies in Congress, while Democrats fume over what they describe as a dangerous and misguided retaliation.

It’s an unsurprising public divide and represents another example of how partisan positioning has Congress speaking on opposite sides of national security and foreign policy issues.

While Republicans are praising Trump for pushing back on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear saber-rattling, Democrats are questioning the utility, safety, financing and precedent of such a step.

“It would be a mistake for us to do this because we have nothing, we have very little to gain,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee with oversight of America’s nuclear arsenal.

“If we did a test and then China decided, OK, I’m going to start testing. They’ll start testing their nuclear weapons, then their strategic forces capability gets much better,” Kelly told reporters Thursday. “We have zero to gain. This would be a gift to China.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another member of the subcommittee, questioned why Republicans are not concerned over how much money is required to carry out the president’s directive if their focus is on lowering federal spending.

“The Department of Defense has a long history of understating costs and claiming shorter timelines for these giant nuclear programs. They sell Congress on a rosy picture of how it will all work out,” she said.

“As soon as Congress signs on the dotted line, the costs start going up, and the time to completion stalls, rolling further and further out … Republicans should be just as outraged as Democrats over the DOD’s lack of honesty about how this program is operating.”

But Republicans are standing resolutely with the president, who announced his decision to resume nuclear weapons testing in a Truth Social post Thursday morning in South Korea, shortly before he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and shortly after Putin boasted of testing new nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable missiles.

“This is not escalatory,” said Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, calling Putin a “mad man” trying to push Trump’s boundaries.

“Nobody believes he’s [Putin] going to use nuclear weapons … having said that, he’s been doing this all along trying to intimidate Trump. I think Trump was saying, I’m not intimidated about it.”

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) backed up Trump when asked about the president’s directive to the Pentagon to restart testing nuclear weapons, saying it sends a “strong message” to U.S. adversaries.

“The commander in chief wants us to be fully prepared. We are the last great superpower on the Earth. China intends to be a near peer-to-peer advisory to us,” Johnson told reporters Thursday morning. “But in order to maintain peace around the world, you have to show strength, and that’s what the president believes in. That’s what he’s demonstrated over and over.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a defense hawk and a close ally of the president, said Trump’s directive to the Department of Defense (DOD) was a “response” to Putin, whom Trump has been pushing to come to the negotiating table in hopes of ending the Russia-Ukraine war.

“I think Putin’s misjudging Trump,” Graham told The Hill on Thursday. “You threaten our country. You will regret it.”

But some senators acknowledged the president’s directive was short on details.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Thursday he will “have to see” what Trump means regarding testing nuclear weapons but emphasized that the U.S. has to keep its “nuclear forces modernized for sure.”

Trump said the U.S. would start testing its nuclear weapons “because of other countries testing programs” and would do so on an “equal basis.”

It’s not clear exactly what Trump wants to achieve. For opponents and arms control experts, the most concerning directive is if the president decides to resume nuclear explosive testing.

Russia has denied it has tested nuclear weapons and criticized the U.S. as confusing its testing of a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable missile with a nuclear explosive.

Russia claimed that last week it successfully tested a new nuclear-capable cruise missile, known as the Burevestnik, which purportedly flew for 8,700 miles and cannot be stopped by air defenses.

The Kremlin said Wednesday it also tested a new atomic-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone, known as the Poseidon, with Putin claiming the nuclear reactor that powers it is “100 times smaller” than those on submarines.

“As far as Russia is concerned, it recently tested delivery vehicles, not nuclear explosive devices,” Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, posted on social platform X.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a member of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee with oversight of nuclear weapons, argued during Thursday’s confirmation hearing of Vice Adm. Richard Correll — tapped to be the next commander of the U.S. Strategic Command — that the U.S. should maintain and “modernize” its nuclear arsenal.

Separately, the Arkansas senator wrote in a Thursday post on X that Russia and China have conducted “super-critical nuclear weapons tests to advance their nuclear programs.”

“The U.S. has been bound to a zero-yield test standard since 1992,” Cotton said. “It’s welcome news that President Trump is allowing us to conduct activities on par with Russia and China to advance and modernize the U.S. nuclear stockpile.”

But Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, pushed back on Cotton’s claims that Russia and China have carried out any sort of nuclear weapons testing as “unsubstantiated and highly-debatable.”

“Trump’s nuclear policy is incoherent and unclear: calling for denuclearization talks one day; threatening nuclear tests the next,” he said in a statement.

“But what is clear: U.S. resumption of nuclear testing or reckless words and actions, that trigger a nuclear testing chain reaction, harm U.S. security.”

Farhan Haq, spokesperson for the United Nations secretary-general, responded to reporters’ questions Thursday about Trump’s directive as raising the risks of nuclear conflict when tensions are “already alarmingly high.”

“All actions that could lead to miscalculation or escalation with catastrophic consequences must be avoided,” he said. “From our standpoint, from the secretary-general’s standpoint, nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.”

Iran used the opportunity to paint Trump and the U.S. as the nuclear aggressor, while the country is under sanctions for failing to comply with nuclear-safety commitments. Iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the U.S., Israel, allies and experts say Iran is intent on having the capability of building a weapon.

“Having rebranded its ‘Department of Defense’ as the ‘Department of War,’ a nuclear-armed bully is resuming testing of atomic weapons,” Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi wrote on X.

“The same bully has been demonizing Iran’s peaceful nuclear program and threatening further strikes on our safeguarded nuclear facilities, all in blatant violation of international law. Make no mistake: The U.S. is the World’s Most Dangerous Proliferation Risk.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/Putin-Trump_103025_Illo_CJ-GN-AP.png?w=1280,N,,2025-10-31 17:02:18.776903

She clocked in at Eagle Beverage in Kent, a bottling factory where she had worked for 20 years, most recently supervising a team that repairs the machinery. She’s good at fixing things.

Espinoza and G, her partner of 12 years, had dreamed about their upcoming wedding day, surrounded by the people who love them. The date was set for May 24, and they had invited friends and family to celebrate after a brief ceremony at the King County courthouse. Over the years, Espinoza had become a second mom to her partner’s teenage son — family photos show the three of them in Christmas sweaters, celebrating birthdays and school graduations.

But then Espinoza spent what would have been her wedding day in detention, after she was picked up during a workplace immigration raid on May 20. Federal agents came into Eagle Beverage with a search warrant for 41 people who appeared to have false employment papers. They made 17 arrests.

""Inside ICE Detention: A Documentary"" investigates Tacoma's immigration detention center during a time of swift policy changes under the Trump administration. Listen to the full, in-depth story by Liz Jones by clicking the audio link above, on the KUOW app, or your favorite podcast app.

These arrests came during the early months of the Trump administration’s escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. Espinoza and her coworkers soon joined a surging population of detainees at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, one of the largest immigration detention centers in the country. During Trump’s first months in office, the daily headcount at the Tacoma facility would nearly double, and at times appear to surpass the facility’s capacity of 1,575 beds.

As the facility became more crowded, new Trump administration policies also began to shift the experience for detainees inside immigration lockups, stripping away access to legal aid programs and bond hearings. As detainees like Espinoza took stock of the shifting landscape, they weighed tough choices about whether to stay in detention and fight their case. Her story opens a window into a time of rapid transition at the Tacoma ICE facility, a place often far from public view.

“When we arrived at the detention center, we started to talk to the other people,"" Espinoza said. “Some people had been there for 11 months, four months, six months...they said that there were no bail options, that nobody would be getting out — so the way out appeared to be to sign for a voluntary departure.”

Voluntary departure is a way for someone to avoid a deportation on their record, but they typically have to pay for the flight themselves.

KUOW is not using Espinoza’s full name because she is worried about potential consequences for her ongoing immigration case. But she said she is sharing her story because others are in a similar situation, often without family or legal support.

“I think the most difficult thing for me, and for everybody, was the feeling of being locked up without any communication,” she said.

In Tacoma, and nationwide, roughly half the people in detention are in ICE custody due to civil violations of immigration law. Seventy percent of detainees there have no criminal history.

A wedding postponed

Espinoza, 52, is originally from a small town in Sinaloa, Mexico. She came to Seattle 20 years ago on a tourist visa to visit her brothers and felt safe in a way that never seemed possible in Sinaloa. Because she's gay, she said she faced discrimination most of her life back home, a place known for violence and cartel activity.

Xiomara Urán, an immigration an attorney with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, took up Espinoza’s case in detention and set an idea in motion: What if Espinoza and her partner went ahead with the marriage – but in detention?

Urán was hopeful the marriage would give Espinoza a better chance for bond, to get out of detention and continue fighting her case. But she also worried about red tape and delays to get the ceremony approved in time. Guards at the Tacoma facility were telling Urán and other attorneys about staffing shortages as the center filled to capacity.

ICE and GEO Group, the contractor that operates the facility, declined multiple requests to comment for this story.

Urán has worked exclusively with detained clients in Tacoma since 2020. She and her colleagues began to notice shifts in the operations there after Trump returned to office in January.

“The speed at which we're seeing the changes now – it's insane,” Urán said. “They’ve gone so fast.”

An initial blow for attorneys like Urán came in January, when the federal government cut funds for a longstanding legal orientation program at detention centers, including in Tacoma. Urán said program cuts led to logjams where attorneys would end up waiting a full day to see a client.

“They used to reserve three rooms for us, now they don’t,” Urán said, referring to attorney rooms. “So now, if you go at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. you're probably going to wait between three and five hours before you can see anyone.”

Only about 14 percent of people in detention can find or afford an attorney, and those who do are 10 times more likely to win their case, according to government data.

With the legal orientations gone, Urán said detainees have heard discouraging messages from staff inside about access to counsel.

“They've told people that we have disappeared, [so] what's the point of fighting?"" She said. ""Because there's no one to fight for you. So just ask for your removal, or like self deport now.”

Sponsored

As Urán started to work on Espinoza’s case, sometimes Espinoza would sink into depression and talk about giving up, as conditions inside detention wore on her. Urán kept encouraging her to fight.

The detention center fills up

Inside detention, Espinoza said she slept poorly at night because some lights stayed on, and heavy doors slammed as the cleaning or kitchen crews moved through the halls. When her unit got time in the outdoor yard, sometimes she would stay in the dormitory area just for a bit of quiet or she would play basketball in a smaller courtyard.

“At the beginning, I didn’t understand why people slept a lot during the day,” she said. “Then later I understood it was a way of making sure that time went by quickly.”

Espinoza also worried about her health. She has stage four kidney disease and said she lost about seven pounds during her first weeks in detention, trying to avoid high-sodium foods. She usually felt cold.

The women who’d been detained for months told her everything was running slower than usual because there wasn’t enough staff to move them place to place. Several detainees KUOW recently interviewed also complained about a lack of outdoor time, meals that arrived hours late, and long waits for health care.

Around the country, congress members have stepped up visits to ICE detention centers and called for more transparency -- especially as places hit capacity.

“They have a number of staff openings that are unfilled that give me concern,” said U.S. Representative Emily Randall after an August visit to the Tacoma facility, which is in her district. “Lots of folks have said that they're unable to get outside, given the number of shifts for outdoor recreation.”

The daily population inside the Northwest ICE Processing Center has risen from 801 people on January 20, 2025, to slightly above its capacity of 1,575 in early June, according to ICE data analyzed by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights and the Deportation Data Project.

The August visit was Randall’s third this year. Health care is another concern she’s monitoring. She gave credit to the medical staff inside that provide care, although detainees continue to tell her about long delays.

“A lot of folks are just deciding not to keep showing up, not to keep trying not to even file complaints for a lack of access to care,” she said.

“And that demoralization, I think, can have really negative outcomes for individuals, for their physical health, for their mental health. And we're seeing more and more people who are signing to, like, self-deport because they don't have any fight left in them.”

RELATED: Washington farmworker who led union efforts talks life after ICE detention, returning to Mexico

Randall, a member of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, said she plans to keep up these visits because “it's important for the staff and detainees to know that Congress is watching.”

GEO Group has long maintained that it follows national detention standards and is committed to providing the highest quality services possible.

The immigrant advocacy group La Resistencia has been tracking some of these same concerns about healthcare and living conditions in the Tacoma facility for years. Rufina Reyes, the group’s director, said they now can receive up to 100 calls a day from detainees in Tacoma.

She flagged a pattern of detainees getting transferred farther away after publicly sharing complaints with her group, including a group of men transferred to Alaska in June. GEO Group and ICE did not respond to KUOW’s questions about transfers.

Other minor logistics can also create barriers for detainees to stay in contact with family, lawyers or support networks.

On a Saturday in July, Sister Mary Ellen Robinson, a Catholic nun, drove three hours from Wapato to visit a young man in detention from her community.

""He's part of a large family that needed to leave Mexico because their lives were in danger,” she said. ""His family are very worried about him, and they are totally afraid to come anywhere near here.”

Outside the detention gates, Sister Mary Ellen and another woman from Ethiopia with a nephew inside compared copies of the daily visiting schedule. It showed a detailed system of odd and even days for each unit, but the schedule on ICE’s website was different than the paper version at the check-in desk. Neither woman was able to do their planned visit that morning – they came at the wrong time.

Waiting to marry, as a court deadline approaches

Urán filed paperwork with ICE to get the marriage approved, with support from the office of Congressmember Pramila Jayapal, who had met Espinoza during a visit at the detention center. Urán had no idea if the response from ICE would come in days or weeks or longer.

Meanwhile, Espinoza attended her first two hearings at the court inside the detention center, where each time she asked the judge for more time to prepare her case. After the second hearing, Judge John Odell told her they would need to proceed with her case at her next hearing, in early July.

Ten days before her hearing date, Urán received the wedding approval. Espinoza and G set the date, again, for a Saturday.

Espinoza’s fiancée arrived at the detention center that morning in a white pant suit, her long brown hair down past her shoulder. G's teenage son, Espinoza’s brother and nephew, and a family friend also joined them.

The ceremony lasted about 20 minutes, then G walked out, clearly trying to keep up a smile.

“I have like two emotions, like feeling excited because it was a special day for us but also sad because it’s not the place that we wanted or the way we wanted,” G said.

Until that day, all their visits for the past seven weeks had been behind a glass window, talking through a phone on the wall.

“Just to be able to hug each other, that's the moment that my heart was like…it was very emotional,” she said, no longer able to hold back her tears.

She was also encouraged to see Espinoza in better spirits after many weeks of seeing her scared and stressed.

After they exchanged rings, it caught them both off guard when the officiant asked if they wanted to share personal vows — they didn’t think they’d have a chance to speak here.

“I said something like this is like a test for us,” G said. “And I know that after this we are going to always be together and keep going.”

Urán, their attorney, seemed hopeful this marriage would give Espinoza a better chance to be released and continue her case outside of detention.

“I can never say that things are going be smooth because immigration court is always difficult, particularly in the detainee setting, and so the plan is now to get her out through a bond,” Urán said.

But bond is just one step toward freedom because even if Espinoza gets out, she’ll still have to fight to stay in the U.S. For people in deportation proceedings, like Espinoza, there can be a higher bar to prove it’s a bonafide marriage and qualify for a green card.

New restriction to get released on bond

In the past few years, the Tacoma immigration court has become known as one of the strictest in the country for bond approvals. The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed a class-action lawsuit in March, challenging a recent practice in Tacoma that resulted in bond denials for a whole class of detainees previously eligible for release. Since 2023, the lawsuit argued, the Tacoma court adopted a “unique” and “draconian” policy to deny bond requests by noncitizens who entered the U.S. without inspection, including those who have lived here for decades.

In September, a federal judge found the Tacoma bond policy unlawful but judges there have not changed course, according to The Seattle Times. In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Tiffany Cartwright noted that Tacoma immigration judges granted only three percent of bond requests in fiscal year 2023, making its rate “the lowest among immigration courts” during that period.

RELATED: Filipina green card holder and UW worker released from Tacoma ICE

This summer, the Trump administration also implemented a national policy that follows Tacoma’s model, calling for mandatory detention for far more immigrants. This national policy change is also facing a court challenge.

ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons described the new policy to Fox News as a way to more efficiently process immigration cases.

“We saw so many people that were apprehended illegally coming through the border and then using the bond system just to go ahead and be released out into the community, to have a court date in, you know, 2037, 2035, and never show up for court,” Lyons said.

Attorney Xiomara Urán has watched all these recent shifts in detention build on each other — the access to attorneys, to bonds, detainees transferred far from home -- and she sees it all leading to a much tougher fight for anyone who wants to stay here.

On the day of Espinoza’s bond hearing, she returned to Judge Odell’s courtroom. Family members lined the wood benches behind her.

Espinoza sat in front facing the judge, wearing a yellow uniform with a sweatshirt layered underneath. Her new wife gripped a legal folder in her hand, her son close at her side. She kept her eyes trained forward, occasionally darting a worried glance at her sister-in-law or niece.

Judge Odell evaluated Espinoza’s case, including her likelihood to show up for future court dates. He also reviewed whether she posed any risk to the community, noting a conviction for driving under the influence in 2009, for which she served one day in jail since it was a first offense. Odell found she met the bar for bond and set the amount at $3,500, on the lower end. Espinoza turned to her family as she left court, pushing a tear off her cheek.

'It's difficult to think of starting over'

After 52 days in detention, Espinoza returned home to her wife and teenage son and put her focus on her health, her legal case and her family life.

“It's difficult for me to think about starting over,” she said in Spanish. “We are together the three of us always.”

Her freedom came with the unexpected burden of an electronic ankle monitor, even though Judge Odell granted her bond with no conditions, including no monitor. Perplexed, her attorney Xiomara Urán appealed the monitor to Judge Odell and he lowered the bond amount to $1,500. Urán would later realize the confusion likely stemmed from a ICE policy change in July to expand the use of these monitors.

The monitoring calls would wake Espinoza in the middle of the night, asking for her location. “I’m in bed sleeping,” she’d tell them. In public, she’d keep it hidden.

She’s happy to be married, and chafes at the question about why the couple didn’t marry years ago, as a way to protect Espinoza from deportation.

“A marriage is not just a piece of paper and that’s it,” she said. “[You] have to do it for love, not just for convenience.

Espinoza is hopeful she’ll be able to get a work permit while her immigration case is pending but that can take months to get approved. She enjoyed her two decades at Eagle Beverage, where she fixed broken machines. She sees something broken with the way ICE targets workers like her, in an economy that often relies on them.

“I think there are many good people who all they want is to get ahead,” she said. “In spite of everything that's going on, this is a hope that many people have.”

Looking back, she said the time in detention left her feeling like a different person.

“I think very much so, more than anything mentally, because basically, in reality, everything happened that I didn't want to have happen to me,” she said, her voice choked with emotion.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/16d5002df6011bf99bf9499772da31f2.png?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-10-31 14:02:29.330219

Federal funding for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program is set to extend only through Nov. 2.","The federal government shutdown has dragged into another week, and Republicans and Democrats appear no closer to ending it.

Many federal workers have missed paychecks, including air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid.

The impacts of the shutdown could soon get worse. That's because a number of federal programs are set to run out of money on Nov. 1. If that happens, tens of millions of people would lose federal food and nutrition benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps.

Also set to run out of funding are some Head Start programs, early-learning centers for low-income families, that serve more than 65,000 children nationwide.

The Agriculture Department says it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid. At the same time many American farmers say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink.

As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know.

Jump to state-specific impacts.

Why did the federal government shut down?

A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.

Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.

NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could see big premium increases unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended.

Plus, why Democrats are casting the government shutdown as a health care showdown.

What about WIC and SNAP benefits?

Of those at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November, 7 million receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC.) Nearly 42 million who rely on SNAP are also expected to lose their benefits. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will run out of money Nov. 1.

In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits ""until further notice"" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift money from its contingency fund and other places to keep SNAP at least partially funded.

As NPR's Stephen Fowler reports, a coalition of more than two dozen Democratic state leaders are suing the Trump administration over its decision to suspend federal food benefits during the government shutdown. A federal court decision in that case may come as soon as Thursday.

WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration shifted $300 million in tariff revenue to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's calling for an additional $300 million to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some states could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources.

What about Head Start?

Beginning Nov. 1, more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start, the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down.

Among the states hit hardest by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.

Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support.

Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out.

Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences.

What the shutdown means for federal workers

Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C.

Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.

The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.

By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.

The Senate has failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.

The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.

Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.

Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?

The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.

Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court; the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday indefinitely halted the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units.

How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?

The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget. The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond.

The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.

Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.

USPS is 'open for business as usual'

""U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,"" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.

IRS furloughs nearly half its staff

A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.

The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.

National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees

On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.

According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the ""Democrat shutdown.""

Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.

— Geoff Brumfiel, NPR

In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.

Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might

Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.

At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.

This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts have halted those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.

In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.

— Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.

National Parks are a mixed bag

Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.

As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails ""will generally remain accessible to visitors"" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.

Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.

The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support

WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.

Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.

Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue

Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.

But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.

In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.

Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted

Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. ""We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,"" McLaughlin said.

According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.

""More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,"" Noem posted on X last week. ""By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a ""super check"" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.""

The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to Noem; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.

If you're flying soon …

Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered ""essential workers"" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began.

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.

Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says there has been an uptick in the number of controllers who are calling in sick.

The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18, reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone. The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday.

The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country

Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.

Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:

Alaska

The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media]

About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected.

Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ]

Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]

California

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he would deploy the California National Guard to support food banks across California as the federal government shutdown drags on, threatening to delay and stall food stamp benefits for millions of residents. [KQED]

Well over 1 million people in L.A. County get food benefits from CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh, according to state data. [LAist]

The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]

Colorado

Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but ""some services may be limited or unavailable,"" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]

In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]

Court documents show almost 200 Colorado-based positions that the Interior Department wants to cut. [Colorado Public Radio]

Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio]

Connecticut

Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU]

Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [WSHU]

Georgia

For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]

Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]

Hawaii

University of Hawaiʻi is paying affected employees out of pocket during shutdown. Over 830 University of Hawaiʻi employees are at least partially paid through federal dollars, with thousands more in positions that are fully federally funded. UH has been able to pay them with internal funds, but it costs more than $20 million a pay period — every two weeks — for the system to match their salaries. [Hawaiʻi Public Radio]

Kentucky

Funding for food assistance benefits next month isn't coming, Gov. Andy Beshear said, due to the federal government shutdown. Funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program is also delayed. [LPM]

Louisiana

The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]

Maine

Nearly 170,000 Mainers, or over 12% of the state's total population, could lose food assistance if SNAP benefits are not funded for November. [Maine Public]

Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it has still been busy at the park. [Maine Public]

Maryland

Prince George's County is home to more than 60,000 federal workers. The Capital Area Food Bank has been distributing food to federal workers affected by the shutdown. But the timing is a double burden: The Capital Area Food Bank has seen some of its own federal funding slashed even as demand skyrockets. [WAMU]

Minnesota

Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [MPR News]

Missouri

Roughly 650,000 Missourians will not receive SNAP benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing government shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]

The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio]

New Hampshire

SNAP serves more than 75,000 people in New Hampshire. And while state officials say they've received extra money to keep WIC running into November, it's unclear if SNAP will also be funded. [NHPR]

On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground."" [NPR]

Tennessee

On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN]

Texas

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food purchasing support to approximately 3.5 million Texans, including more than 1.7 million children. Those benefits amount to around $617 million per month. [KUT]

U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]

Volker Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement released on Friday that there was no justification under international law for the strikes, which have killed at least 61 people since the start of September.

“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” he said, in blunt criticism of the United States. “The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”

Mr. Türk’s statement has more symbolic power than direct influence over the actions of the United States, which is a permanent member of the U.N Security Council. But the forceful condemnation offers fodder for the criticism of the Trump administration’s policy from Democrats and civil society groups.

President Trump authorized the strikes, and his administration has told Congress that the United States was engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels that it has declared to be terrorist organizations.

But the administration has presented little evidence to support its claims, and specialists in the laws of war and executive power say he has used the military in a way that had no clear legal precedent or basis. Mr. Türk’s office said it had no credible evidence of a confrontation with the cartels that met the criteria of armed conflict under international law.

In early October, Mr. Türk wrote in a letter to the U.S. government that countering drug trafficking was a law enforcement issue and lethal force was only justified as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life.

Employers who comply with the existing H-1B program requirements should not be precluded from keeping or adding H-1B workers to their workforce because of the $100,000 fee.","Many U.S. employers and H-1B workers panicked when the Trump administration issued a proclamation on September 19, 2025, that appeared to require a $100,000 payment for a noncitizen to enter the United States with an H-1B visa after 12:01 am Eastern Time on September 21. Within 24 hours, the administration clarified that the $100,000 fee would only apply prospectively. But many questions remained, and the White House and agencies were not consistent in messaging as to who would be affected.

On October 20, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted information as to how it would implement the proclamation. If subject to the proclamation, payment must be made through pay.gov before a U.S. employer files an H-1B petition with USCIS. The U.S. employer/petitioner must submit either proof of payment or evidence that it received an exception or USCIS will deny the petition.

When does the Proclamation apply?

USCIS confirmed that the proclamation does not apply to:

Petitions filed before 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on September 21, 2025. This means that a noncitizen can be issued an H-1B visa, or be admitted to the United States in H-1B status—without the fee being collected—if the approved H-1B petition was filed before this deadline.

Previously issued and currently valid H-1B visas.

The agency also resolved some questions by identifying the following situations when an H-1B petition is filed on or after 12:01 am Eastern Time on September 21, 2025:

Fee payment or exception required if the noncitizen on whose behalf the H-1B petition was filed (the beneficiary) is outside the United States and does not have a valid H-1B visa.

Fee payment or exception required if the beneficiary is in the United States but the H-1B petition requests consular, port of entry, or preflight inspection notification if USCIS approves the petition.

No fee required to file an H-1B petition if USCIS approves an amended H-1B petition, or approves a request for extension of stay in H-1B status or a request for change of status from another nonimmigrant status to H-1B. (A beneficiary must be in the United States when a U.S. employer files an H-1B petition requesting that USCIS approve either an extension or change of status in addition to approving the H-1B classification.)

No fee required for a beneficiary of an H-1B petition for which USCIS approved an amendment, extension of stay, or change of status who later travels abroad and applies for an H-1B visa based on that approved petition and/or seeks to reenter the United States on a valid H-1B visa.

But questions remain as to USCIS’ statement:

[I]f a petition filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, requests a change of status or amendment or extension of stay and USCIS determines that the noncitizen is ineligible for a change of status or an amendment or extension of stay (e.g., is not in a valid nonimmigrant visa status or if the [noncitizen] departs the United States prior to adjudication of a change of status request), the Proclamation will apply and the payment must be paid according to the instructions provided by USCIS.

These questions include:

How will payment be requested? Will USCIS issue a Notice of Intent to Deny, which would give the U.S. employer/petitioner the option of withdrawing the H-1B petition without paying the fee?

A U.S. employer/petitioner could request an amendment, which if denied, would mean the H-1B worker remains in their current situation and does not leave the United States. For example, certain changes of work site require that an amendment be filed—no extension of H-1B status is requested and the U.S. employer/petitioner intends to keep the H-1B worker at the current worksite if the petition is denied. Why would a fee be due?

What will USCIS do if it denies an extension of stay or change of status request but the U.S. employer/petitioner did not complete the section of the petition designating consular or other notification (since notification is unnecessary if USCIS approves the extension or change of status)?

National interest exception

USCIS’ description of the national interest exception is far more restrictive than the presidential proclamation indicates it should be. The proclamation gives the DHS secretary discretion to provide an exception to any noncitizen, and by category, “all [noncitizens] working for a company, or all [noncitizens] working in an industry” if the secretary determines that the hiring of such H-1B worker(s) “is in the national interest and does not pose a threat” to national security or welfare. But the DHS secretary has only provided for individual determinations.

USCIS describes the DHS secretary’s grant of a national interest exception as an “extraordinarily rare circumstance” where the secretary determines that four criteria have been met:

The noncitizen’s presence in the United States is in the national interest.

No “American worker is available to fill the role.”

The noncitizen does not pose a threat to the national security or welfare.

Requiring the U.S. employer/petitioner to pay the fee would “significantly undermine U.S. interests.”

The restrictive criteria likely will discourage many U.S. employers petitioners from applying. A U.S. employer must submit the exception request to a dedicated DHS email address before filing the H-1B petition. USCIS requires that “evidence of the exception” be submitted with an H-1B petition for which the fee otherwise would be due upon filing or the agency will deny the H-1B petition.

Lawsuits challenging the Proclamation

Two lawsuits have already been filed that challenge the H-1B proclamation.

The first, Global Nurse Force v. Trump, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, shows the range of U.S. employers and individuals affected by the proclamation. For example, one plaintiff is a union with members who are involved with medical residency training and education, advancing patient care, and expanding access to healthcare. Another plaintiff is a religious missionary order which relies on the H-1B category for religious workers with foreign language fluency.

The second lawsuit, Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Chamber and the Association of American Universities (AAU) on behalf of their members. On October 24, 2025, the Chamber and the AAU filed a motion to stop the enforcement of the proclamation against them and their members while the lawsuit is pending, or alternatively for a decision that the proclamation is unlawful and vacating it (so the proclamation would not apply to anyone). The court has given the government until November 28 to oppose the motion and the court could decide the motion any time after December 8.

In both cases, plaintiffs maintain that the president does not have the authority to create new requirements for the H-1B program, which Congress established, including what fees may be charged; that the fee is not permitted by the authority Congress gave to the president to restrict entry of certain noncitizens—in one case calling the fee an unlawful tax; and that agency implementation is unlawful.

The proclamation is vulnerable to attack because its structure and requirements are inconsistent with its stated intent to restrict entry of H-1B visa holders. The proclamation ties the $100,000 payment to the filing of an H-1B petition. But USCIS approval of an H-1B petition is not enough for entry to the United States and USCIS does not decide who gets to enter. The proclamation’s focus on claimed abuses in the H-1B program in the United States—which can be addressed by existing law and regulations—also underscores that the fee is not an entry restriction.

As illustrated by the two complaints, the fee will restrict or eliminate the use of the H-1B category by many types of U.S. employers, and noncitizens who benefit the public by their work in many different fields. Employers who comply with the existing H-1B program requirements should not be precluded from keeping or adding H-1B workers to their workforce because of the $100,000 fee.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/immigration-impact-uscis-implements-h1b-fee.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:04:16.171569

And this dispute fell outside the narrow categories of original cases the Constitution authorizes the Supreme Court to hear.

An administration pursuing the appellate void strategy will likely develop a reputation for untrustworthiness, affecting its litigation positions across all cases.
That is the whole point of the appellate void strategy—to keep a case stranded in district court.","When a federal district judge blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland on Oct. 4, U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller called the decision a “legal insurrection.” Other influential MAGA personalities demanded President Trump openly defy the courts. Though the administration ultimately appealed and obtained a stay of the decision—later thrown out by the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit—this rhetoric represented a sharp escalation from earlier in the year. Outright defiance of court orders seems increasingly plausible.

If and when that moment arrives, it could play out in several ways. The most obvious scenario—and the one that has dominated the popular imagination—is a dramatic showdown between the president and the Supreme Court. But another plausible scenario has been largely overlooked: After an adverse ruling, government defendants might simply ignore the district court’s order and decline to appeal. As the prevailing party, the plaintiffs could not appeal either. The result is what I call an “appellate void”—a jurisdictional gap in which lower federal courts lack effective tools for enforcing their decisions against a recalcitrant executive, and higher courts lack any obvious path to intervene.

This scenario is not purely hypothetical. The Trump administration has already tested variations of this strategy. After multiple district courts preliminarily enjoined the president’s executive orders targeting law firms on First Amendment grounds, the administration initially declined to appeal these decisions even as it filed interlocutory appeals in scores of other cases. During this period, it continued holding the orders over the heads of firms that chose to settle rather than litigate, while apparently complying with preliminary injunctions protecting firms that brought suit. For instance, “Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, A&O Shearman, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett each agreed to provide $125 million in pro bono or free legal work,” according to the White House. The orders thus retained much of their in terrorem effect despite being held unconstitutional by multiple judges. Eventually, the administration filed appeals in these cases.

The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. has created new opportunities for this kind of gamesmanship. By prohibiting universal injunctions in most circumstances, the Court enabled this and future administrations to comply with adverse judgments only as to named plaintiffs while continuing challenged policies against everyone else. When coupled with a refusal to appeal, this “appellate void lite” strategy could deny higher courts any vehicle to establish binding precedent on important constitutional questions, while allowing the government to maintain—truthfully—that it has fully complied with all court orders.

The appellate void strategy is most attractive when a president expects to lose on appeal. If the Supreme Court operates as a virtual rubber stamp for the administration, the expected benefits of appealing remain high and the costs low, making the appellate void strategy unnecessary. Many observers believe the Court is already taking this approach, though others argue that this conclusion is premature given that most decisions have turned on procedural rather than merits questions. But if the Court proves willing to block important presidential initiatives—or if the administration believes it will—then refusing to appeal while defying district courts might seem preferable to risking a high-profile defeat at the Supreme Court. If past is prologue, the administration will eventually push boundaries that even a sympathetic Court will not tolerate, making the appellate void strategy increasingly tempting.

The Jurisdictional Trap

The appellate void emerges from the confluence of several settled jurisdictional rules. The most fundamental is that prevailing parties generally cannot appeal. This principle flows directly from Article III of the Constitution, which limits federal courts to deciding disputes with real, concrete injuries, rather than abstract legal questions or hypothetical scenarios. Without a concrete injury that judicial relief can redress, there is no “case or controversy”—per Article III—for an appellate court to resolve. As the Supreme Court explained in Deposit Guaranty National Bank v. Roper, “a party who receives all that he has sought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief and cannot appeal from it.”

This makes intuitive sense. If plaintiffs win everything they sought in district court, why would they need to appeal? The problem arises when government defendants refuse to appeal while simultaneously defying or circumventing the district court’s order. In this case, the proper recourse for plaintiffs is to request that the district judge enforce compliance with the order through fines or other contempt sanctions. It is not to appeal the judgment in their favor. Only an injury caused by the judgment itself—not by the government’s noncompliance—creates a legal right to appeal to a higher court, whose decisions the administration might feel more compelled to respect.

Could the courts of appeals or Supreme Court step in by issuing what is called a writ of mandamus—a court order commanding an official to perform a specific duty? Not easily. When a higher court issues mandamus to a lower court—directing it to transfer a case or exercise jurisdiction, for instance—the writ operates as a form of appellate review within the judicial hierarchy. Simply put, the Supreme Court or court of appeals is correcting a mistake by a lower court.

Mandamus against executive officials works differently. When a court orders, say, the secretary of homeland security to comply with an injunction, that order is not correcting a lower court’s error. It is functionally a whole new lawsuit. In legal terms, this type of mandamus is an “original” action, rather than an appeal. The distinction dates to Marbury v. Madison. Following the presidential election of 1800, William Marbury asked the Supreme Court to order Secretary of State James Madison to deliver Marbury’s commission as justice of the peace. Chief Justice John Marshall rejected the request because Marbury was asking the Court to decide a new dispute rather than to review a lower court’s decision. And this dispute fell outside the narrow categories of original cases the Constitution authorizes the Supreme Court to hear. Courts of appeals have no original jurisdiction at all. So without a pending appeal, these higher courts cannot issue mandamus to executive officials.

Federal law does include something called the All Writs Act, a statute authorizing federal courts to issue “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.” A writ is simply a formal court order. But the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that this act does not create jurisdiction where none exists. It merely protects jurisdiction that courts already have or might soon acquire. When the government deliberately forgoes appeal and no party with standing seeks review, there is typically no appellate jurisdiction to protect and no authority to issue orders under the All Writs Act.

The Fragility of Contempt

This leaves district courts to enforce their own orders through contempt sanctions. In theory, these sanctions might include escalating civil fines or even the arrest of recalcitrant officials. But contempt has always been a fragile remedy against federal defendants.

Civil contempt aims to coerce future compliance and must be “purgeable”—that is, it must be possible for the person or official found in contempt to escape sanctions by complying with the court’s order. But when government defendants claim compliance lies beyond their authority or budget, or would violate presidential policy, courts face a dilemma. If compliance is genuinely impossible without presidential acquiescence, escalating sanctions begin to resemble criminal punishment without proper procedural protections.

Criminal contempt avoids this problem but faces even more serious difficulties. Such proceedings require proof beyond reasonable doubt—the highest standard of proof known to law—and generally entitle defendants to jury trials. Both create additional hurdles. Criminal contempt proceedings also require a prosecutor—typically a government attorney who, at the president’s direction, might well decline to pursue charges. Worse, convictions for criminal contempt are subject to the presidential pardon power, which could nullify any sanctions.

Both civil and criminal contempt enforcement ultimately depend on executive cooperation. By statute, U.S. marshals must “obey, execute, and enforce all orders” of federal courts, including contempt sanctions. But the U.S. Marshals Service reports to the attorney general, its director, and district marshals—all of whom are removable at will by the president. A president determined to defy the courts could threaten marshals with termination and direct the attorney general to choke off the operating capacity of the marshal’s office in question.

A valuable recent analysis by David Noll identifies additional enforcement tools that courts might deploy—including escalating personal fines enforceable through state-law procedures, professional sanctions against government lawyers, and the appointment of non-marshal court deputies under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. These tools operate with varying degrees of independence from executive cooperation, and Noll persuasively shows that “courts have more power to prolong conflicts over compliance with their orders” than is commonly assumed.

But this does not alter the bottom line. The best historical scholarship shows that courts have historically lacked the appetite to use the tools they already possess against the federal government. In particular, “courts hardly ever employ personal contempt fines to deal with true institution-level recalcitrance.” Additionally, most of the tools Noll identifies remain untested in modern practice and would themselves trigger formidable resistance from a defiant executive branch. It is impossible to predict with certainty how such a conflict would play out in practice. But the balance of power strongly favors a determined president over a federal district judge.

Strategic Logic

Why might a president simply forgo appeal and risk the costs of defying a court order? Confronting a single district judge is fundamentally different from defying the Supreme Court. Most Americans probably cannot name a single federal district judge. When a president resists a district court order, he can frame the conflict as pushback against overreach by a nameless, faceless judge blocking policies the American people elected him to pursue. He can emphasize the judge’s political affiliation and appointment by a president of the opposite party. What might be a constitutional crisis if the order came from the Supreme Court instead becomes a lopsided confrontation with an obscure and seemingly subordinate official.

This political calculus is reinforced by an enormous disparity in media coverage. There is only one Supreme Court, and its decisions frequently dominate news cycles for days or weeks. By contrast, there are 94 district courts, and their decisions rarely penetrate public consciousness. An administration that quietly drags its feet on compliance—claiming substantial cooperation while exploiting every ambiguity—stands a good chance of keeping the conflict below the threshold of sustained attention.

Beyond minimizing political costs, the appellate void strategy avoids creating adverse nationwide precedent. A single district court decision binds no other court. But a circuit court affirmance establishes binding precedent across multiple states, and a Supreme Court affirmance becomes supreme law of the land. For an administration advancing legally dubious policies, the benefits of avoiding this risk may exceed the uncertain prospects of prevailing on appeal.

The appellate void lite strategy offers most of these benefits at lower cost. By complying with court orders solely as to named plaintiffs while maintaining the challenged policies against everyone else, an administration can truthfully claim to be in compliance with all court orders while achieving most of its unlawful objectives.

Costs and Constraints

The appellate void strategy carries significant downsides. Most immediately, the strategy forfeits the possibility of winning on appeal. Historically, the federal government has won more than 70 percent of its appeals, and the current Supreme Court has proved especially receptive to executive power arguments. Pursuing the appellate void strategy throws away this very good chance of reversal.

The strategy also carries political risks. Even defiance of a district judge will generate media coverage, particularly if sustained. While ordinary Americans may not know the names of most district judges, they understand lawlessness, and find it unsettling. Polls consistently show that large majorities expect the executive branch to comply with court orders, and presidents generally care quite a bit about public opinion, which translates into political capital.

Perhaps most important, sustained defiance risks poisoning the administration’s relationship with the entire federal judiciary. An administration pursuing the appellate void strategy will likely develop a reputation for untrustworthiness, affecting its litigation positions across all cases. Judges who would otherwise be sympathetic may become skeptical. Close cases may start being decided against the government when it would otherwise receive the benefit of the doubt. Requests for stays or expedited relief may be denied.

This matters because every administration relies on courts in countless ways to implement its affirmative agenda—from immigration to environmental law to civil rights enforcement. Federal judges issue search warrants, approve wiretaps for criminal investigations, authorize asset freezes, and process thousands of government requests that transform executive policy directives into legally enforceable actions on the ground. No administration can realistically function without the courts.

The appellate void strategy is most attractive when several conditions align: when the administration’s legal position is weak, when the Supreme Court appears hostile, when policy stakes are high, and when courts seem more likely to be intimidated than fortified by defiance. Conversely, when the likelihood of appellate success is high, when the policy is relatively unimportant, and when the judiciary appears sympathetic or likely to react forcefully to executive defiance, the strategy is less attractive. Why poison relationships with courts that are already giving the president most of what he wants?

Reverse Marbury

The appellate void strategy bears striking resemblance to Chief Justice Marshall’s famous jujitsu maneuver in Marbury v. Madison—but in reverse. In that foundational case, Marshall faced a dilemma: If the Court ordered Madison to deliver Marbury’s justice of the peace commission, President Jefferson would almost certainly ignore the order, exposing the Court’s weakness. But dismissing the case would signal that officials could violate legal rights without any judicial remedy.

As every first-year law student learns, Marshall’s solution was ingenious. He painstakingly explained why Marbury was entitled to his commission, while holding that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to order its delivery because the statute granting that jurisdiction was unconstitutional. This established the power of judicial review of congressional legislation without issuing any order Jefferson could defy.

The appellate void flips this dynamic. Where Marshall leveraged limits on the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to avoid issuing an order the president would have ignored, a modern president could leverage the same jurisdictional limits to ignore a district court order and shield this defiance from Supreme Court review. If the government refuses to appeal, there is no case for the Supreme Court to decide. And under Marbury’s own logic, the Court cannot issue an order directing the government to comply with a district court order because that would be an exercise of original, rather than appellate, jurisdiction.

Of course, both the Supreme Court and the presidency have changed dramatically since 1803. The Court commands far greater prestige than it did then, despite recent declines in public approval. The executive branch has expanded from a few thousand federal employees to a massive administrative state. Yet the institutional balance remains delicate, and there is no modern precedent for direct defiance of the Supreme Court. This uncertainty is precisely what makes the appellate void appealing for a president determined to escape legal constraints. The result is the same—the president does what he wants—but without risking a high-profile showdown with the Court, which would be forced to watch from the sidelines.

Potential Responses

The appellate void is not inevitable. Courts and litigants have several potential responses, though all have significant limitations and drawbacks.

District courts can structure remedial orders to make defiance more visible through ongoing supervision and detailed reporting requirements, which create potential flashpoints for conflict and media coverage. They can also impose escalating contempt sanctions calibrated to maximize pressure on the government to appeal. More creatively—and controversially—they might strategically deny some requested relief to give plaintiffs something to appeal. But this would be an unorthodox and extralegal basis for decision, raising serious ethical and legal questions.

Appellate courts have limited options. The All Writs Act might permit intervention in narrow circumstances where executive noncompliance threatens to moot potential appeals. Immigration habeas cases where the government seeks to deport petitioners from U.S. territory provide one possible example. Death penalty cases are another. If left unchecked by higher courts, government defiance of an order blocking a petitioner’s deportation or execution would foreclose the possibility of any future appeals. That could be enough to trigger the All Writs Act. But most challenges to government action do not have this characteristic.

More exotic possibilities exist but are extreme long shots. The Supreme Court could grant certiorari before judgment, using its rarely invoked power to review a case before the court of appeals has ruled. Or lower courts could certify specific legal questions directly to the justices for resolution. But by statute, both of these powers extend only to cases already “in” the courts of appeals. If the government defies a district court order while refusing to appeal, the case would never get to that stage. That is the whole point of the appellate void strategy—to keep a case stranded in district court.

Sophisticated plaintiffs might engage in “reverse forum shopping”—deliberately filing some challenges in jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to the administration to increase the odds that at least one plaintiff loses. That defeated plaintiff could then appeal to the court of appeals and, ultimately, the Supreme Court. But this strategy requires significant coordination—advocacy organizations would need to recruit clients in multiple jurisdictions and file simultaneous challenges across the country. The approach also raises ethical concerns about lawyers’ duties to individual clients versus broader strategic goals. More important, reverse forum-shopping remains vulnerable to default judgments—government defeats by forfeit—and settlement offers designed to moot potential appeals. These are just different forms of voluntary surrender. Either would make plaintiffs the prevailing party and block their ability to appeal.

Perhaps most controversially, the Supreme Court might try to preempt the appellate void strategy by ruling for the administration so consistently that appeal always appears more attractive than defiance. The justices might pursue this approach for many reasons—sincere belief in expansive executive power, ideological sympathy, partisan solidarity, or general fear of confrontation. But the appellate void adds one more strategic reason for deference: discouraging the executive from circumventing Supreme Court review entirely by refusing to appeal its district-court defeats.

Like other responses, placating or appeasing the president has serious limitations. It would require sustained coordination across fractious justices on exceedingly difficult questions: How much deference is necessary to keep the president appealing? Which cases matter enough to risk confrontation? And so forth. These calculations require speculation about presidential psychology, political fallout, and the Court’s own popular support—making consensus difficult and mistakes highly probable. There is a strong prudential argument that the justices would do better by not asking these questions. There is also a legal formalist argument that these questions are legally irrelevant and should never enter the judicial calculus.

Looking Ahead

The deliberate saber-rattling of the Trump administration, combined with increasing political polarization and populist disdain for official authority, calls many previously settled norms into question. It is no longer unthinkable that the president might direct his subordinates to defy a district court judgment, rather than appeal it. The recent CASA decision has created new opportunities for plaintiff-specific compliance that allow the president to continue enforcing unlawful policies against all other parties, while keeping the Supreme Court on the sidelines.

These scenarios are speculative, not inevitable. Courts and litigants have many potential responses, which may well carry the day. But the stakes are high enough that we should not let the appellate void take us by surprise. Indeed, understanding the risk in advance may be the key to averting it.",http://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-31 13:04:20.979825

Arlington, VA — [October 31, 2025] — Today, the White House set the FY 2026 refugee admissions goal at just 7,500 refugee admissions. This number represents the lowest refugee admissions goal in the history of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) at a time of significant global resettlement need.

“USCRI is deeply disappointed that the United States’ commitment to refugees is not in step with the alarming level of forced displacement around the world,” said Eskinder Negash, President and CEO of USCRI. “We urge the Administration to maintain and strengthen its historic leadership by supporting refugees who have safely resettled in American communities and the thousands more who have already been conditionally approved for resettlement and are waiting overseas to be processed. At a time of growing instability and declining humanitarian assistance around the world, we cannot lose our conviction to protect humanity. USCRI will continue to advocate for displaced populations who urgently need safety and protection.”

Today’s announcement undermines decades of bipartisan support for the refugee program. It also disregards urgent international calls to expand durable protections for the more than 123.2 million refugees and internally displaced people worldwide who are forcibly displaced due to persecution, violence, and human rights violations.

The decision also stands in stark contrast to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 2024 Global Trends report, which highlights historic levels of displacement and identifies 2.5 million refugees in need of resettlement. Despite these figures, fewer than one percent of refugees in need are ever resettled—a sobering reminder of the gap between global commitments and pathways to protection.

The White House published the refugee admissions goal without legally required Congressional consultations, including the submission of a “Report to Congress.” The White House announcement states that admissions will “primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa pursuant to Executive Order 14204, and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.” The absence of the required Report to Congress leaves significant uncertainty about how the Administration intends to implement the program and prioritize admissions.

“USCRI has spent the past century welcoming newcomers to the United States. We know from first-hand experience that refugee resettlement strengthens communities across the country,” said Negash. “When refugees rebuild their lives here, they contribute to our shared prosperity. Refugees enrich America. They make our communities stronger. We must renew our nation’s proud humanitarian tradition.”

Background

This year’s Presidential Determination leaves thousands of refugees in limbo. Many have spent years navigating the USRAP process and were already at the final stages of screening and approval at the start of 2025. In January 2025, the Trump Administration’s indefinitely suspended refugee admissions, which abruptly deserted over 120,000 refugees in the USRAP pipeline. Despite having completed extensive interviews and security clearances, none of these individuals seem to have been prioritized for admission in FY 2026 according to the announcement published today, leaving them in uncertainty and, for some, facing impossible choices about their safety and future.

Since its founding in 1911, USCRI has helped forcibly displaced people and, since 1978, has been a formal partner of the U.S. Government in resettlement efforts. USCRI continues to welcome and support refugees and special immigrant visa (SIV) holders across its nationwide offices and network organizations, working alongside community partners to ensure newcomers can thrive and contribute to American life.

The celebration marks Dia de los Muertos, a holiday celebrated in Mexico and throughout Latin America to honour the dead.
Decatur, Alabama, for instance, called off its annual Dia De Los Muertos Festival this month, citing the threat of immigration raids.
And in California's San Francisco Bay Area, a Día de los Muertos event that had been slated for October 25 at Berkeley High School was also cancelled.
In a public statement about the Dia de los Muertos event cancellation, Garcia explained, ""Not everyone has the privilege to celebrate openly.","San Francisco, California – For 44 years, a nighttime procession has snaked through the heart of the Mission District, San Francisco's historic Latino neighbourhood.

Aztec dancers lead the way, followed by thousands of revellers, adorned in marigolds and face paint that transforms the living into a parade of colourful skulls.

The celebration marks Dia de los Muertos, a holiday celebrated in Mexico and throughout Latin America to honour the dead.

Louie Gutierrez, one of the organisers behind San Francisco's festivities, considers it a time of somber reflection but also joy and exuberance.

“There’s a compassion in the air,” said Gutierrez, who works with the cultural advocacy group El Colectivo del Rescate Cultural de la Mission.

This year, however, as Latino communities across the United States prepare to mark the holiday this weekend, many are contending with another emotion: fear.

Since taking office for a second term, President Donald Trump has pursued aggressive immigration enforcement policies, as he seeks to carry out a ""mass deportation"".

In some communities, Dia de los Muertos events have been called off due to concern that they could serve as magnets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Border Patrol agents.

Decatur, Alabama, for instance, called off its annual Dia De Los Muertos Festival this month, citing the threat of immigration raids.

""The decision comes in light of the current national climate surrounding immigration status and safety concerns, and our top priority remains the well-being of our community, attendees, and friends,"" organisers wrote on Facebook.

And in California's San Francisco Bay Area, a Día de los Muertos event that had been slated for October 25 at Berkeley High School was also cancelled.

Adriana Betti, executive director of the academic nonprofit RISE, explained that the decision was taken after parents expressed anxiety about attending the yearly event.

Even on a normal day, Betti added, some immigrant families are afraid to come to the school, for fear they might encounter law enforcement.

“We have parents who have somebody else walk their kids to school,” Betti said. Others carry their passports everywhere they go.

The last-minute cancellation was a loss for vendors who sell foods like tamales and aguas frescas at the event, according to Betti. And it's also a missed opportunity to connect families with community resources, like nutritional assistance programmes.

But the threat of immigration arrests has forced community leaders like Betti to weigh the benefits and risks.

Over the past year, the number of people in ICE detention has increased by about 59 percent, from about 37,395 in September 2024 to 59,762 last month.

Deportations have increased, too, with 527,000 removals reportedly conducted since Trump began his second term.

""The Trump Administration is on pace to shatter historic records,"" White House spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an October statement, celebrating the uptick.

California is among the states that Trump has threatened with a federal troop deployment, as he seeks to carry out his deportation drive, as well as a crackdown on crime.

Already, he sent 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in June as a response to protests against his immigration policies.

Earlier this month, he was also poised to send military forces to San Francisco, though he ultimately called off the ""surge"" for now.

About six hours south of San Francisco, the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara is among the institutions suspending this year's Calenda Día de los Muertos, a traditional procession.

In the past, the event has featured music and dances from the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, as well as an altar for the dead and Oaxacan cuisine.

But this year, Dalia Garcia, the museum’s executive director, told Al Jazeera that organisers could not guarantee that the event would be safe, given that it takes place in an open street.

Celebrating can be a form of resistance, Garcia acknowledged.

But for Black people, Indigenous people and people of colour — known collectively as the BIPOC community — Garcia believes there is an expectation that their traditions should be performed as a spectacle, regardless of the threats they face.

“The BIPOC community, we always have to show that we’re happy,” Garcia said. “And we continue to have these celebrations. But in reality, for me, it’s, like, no. I think we have to show that it’s affecting us.”

The heavily Latino farming community around Santa Barbara, she pointed out, has suffered losses in recent months.

In July, when ICE raided two cannabis farms — one in Santa Barbara County and another in neighbouring Ventura County — a farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse rooftop. More than 300 people were arrested.

In a public statement about the Dia de los Muertos event cancellation, Garcia explained, ""Not everyone has the privilege to celebrate openly. For many in our community, visibility carries risk.""

Still, in her interview with Al Jazeera, she clarified that she was not opposed to communities celebrating this year.

“By no means am I saying nobody should celebrate,” Garcia said. “It’s fine to celebrate, but how can we also bring awareness to what’s happening? How can we ignore the reality that joy is not present for everyone?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2019-Dia-de-los-Muertos-8-1761838969.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-31 12:02:59.967296

(NewsNation) — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Thursday a federal crackdown on states issuing commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally following a Department of Homeland Security operation in Indiana that resulted in 223 arrests.

The operation, conducted in northern Indiana, identified 146 truck drivers among those arrested. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said several of the arrested drivers had criminal records.

Duffy said the Transportation Department discovered multiple states have improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses designated for U.S. citizens to foreign nationals and immigrants without legal status. The licenses allow holders to operate large commercial vehicles, including fuel tankers and school buses.

The secretary threatened to withhold federal highway funding from states that fail to comply with licensing requirements. California faces losing $160 million in federal transportation funds for refusing to enforce English proficiency requirements and audit previously issued nondomiciled commercial licenses.

The Transportation Department directed states in May to enforce existing English proficiency requirements for commercial drivers. Officials also halted the issuance of nondomiciled commercial licenses nationwide and ordered states to review previously issued licenses for compliance.

Nondomiciled licenses were originally intended for U.S. citizens seeking commercial licenses in states where they don’t reside. Duffy said some states began issuing such licenses to foreign nationals, sometimes with expiration dates that extended beyond work permit expirations.

Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Administrator Derek Barrs said Indiana conducted 191 roadside inspections over 30 days that revealed commercial license violations or English proficiency issues.

Of those, 115 involved license violations, including drivers with no license, suspended licenses or disqualifications.

Duffy said the department will target commercial driver training schools that certify unqualified students and companies that hire improperly licensed drivers.

“We will stop at nothing to make sure that our roads are safe,” Duffy said, adding that states like Oklahoma are partnering with federal authorities on enforcement operations.

When asked whether removing migrant drivers would create truck driver shortages, Duffy disputed industry claims of labor scarcity. He said unlicensed drivers willing to work for lower wages have suppressed industry pay rates.

“There are enough American truck drivers to meet the demands that we have in this country,” Duffy said.

Midwest enforcement operation targets criminal migrant truckers: Noem

The Indiana operation has been included in DHS’s ongoing operation in Chicago, dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz“, but the targeted enforcement in the Hoosier State is geared specifically at making America’s roadways safer.

Much of the operation has focused on Chicago, where Noem said Thursday that more than 3,000 migrant arrests have been made. Yet, while DHS officials, including U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, have continually been met with roadblocks, Noem and Todd Lyons, the acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, have found an ally in Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.

On Thursday, Noem highlighted the arrest of Mexican and Colombian nationals who were issued truck-driving licenses from “sanctuary” states like California and Illinois. Noem said DHS agents and officers have been conducting targeted enforcement operations in Indiana.

Those arrested have previous convictions for cruelty toward a child, assault, driving under the influence of alcohol, drug offenses and other crimes, Noem said. But the DHS secretary said that migrants who were granted commercial operators’ licenses under the Biden administration have been responsible for crashes that have led to serious injuries and deaths.

Noem said in many instances, law enforcement officers have reported that these drivers are unable to communicate with troopers and cannot understand road signs, which “presents a danger many times over” and “endangers every single citizen that is on our roads.”

She added, “If you are here driving on our streets illegally and [on] our highways, you are endangering our citizens, and your days are numbered.”

The crackdown on immigrant truck drivers comes as federal immigration operations continue in Chicago, where DHS officials insist the focus remains on “the worst of the worst.” Lyons said Thursday when “Operation Midway Blitz” began, ICE was “out to rid the sanctuary status of Chicago.”

He said officials knew problems existed beyond the city’s limits, but said “ICE protected Chicago when local leadership failed.”

In response to a push by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for DHS to pause enforcement operations for Halloween, Noem said the agency would “absolutely not” pause and will continue to focus on keeping communities safe.

“The fact that Governor Pritzker is asking for that is shameful,” Noem said. “I think it’s unfortunate he doesn’t recognize how important the work that we do is to make sure we’re bringing criminals to justice.”

Yet, while citing more than 3,000 Midway Blitz arrests, Noem could not provide a specific percentage of arrests that have involved those with serious criminal convictions. Federal officials have acknowledged that U.S. citizens have been arrested and detained during enforcement operations, including during protests at an ICE processing center in suburban Broadview.

However, Noem told reporters Thursday that no American citizens have been arrested or detained during Operation Midway Blitz. She said the Trump administration is focusing on those who are in the country illegally and characterized reports that suggest otherwise as “false reporting.”

Noem said that arrests, which administration officials have characterized as “collateral” involving those without criminal charges or convictions, have led to immigration status checks. She said those found without legal immigration status are given due process and then deported.

However, as of Sept. 21, only 28% of the nearly 60,000 in federal custody have previous criminal convictions, and 25% have pending criminal charges, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The two senior DHS officials’ appearance in Indiana on Thursday came two days after Bovino, the Border Patrol commander-at-large, appeared before U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, who has expressed concerns with the use of force being utilized by federal agents.

Bovino was ordered Tuesday to meet daily with Ellis to review the daily operations of federal officers. However, on Wednesday, an Illinois appeals court issued a temporary stay on the order. Bovino told NewsNation on Wednesday evening that CBP and ICE officers have not violated a temporary restraining order that was issued by Ellis earlier this month. Bovino characterized Operation Midway Blitz as “a resounding success.”

“We’re talking all sorts of bad people and bad things off the street,” Bovino told NewsNation.

Bovino said that residents living in communities where migrants who entered the U.S. illegally are operating “have no voice” because of the presence of dangerous migrant criminals. Bovino said that his agents are being asked by local community leaders to address residents on the tactics being used in enforcement operations.

He said that residents living in these neighborhoods are asking federal agencies not to stop doing what they’re doing.

“They’re that bought-in now,” Bovino told NewsNation on Wednesday. “They see us out there, they see we’re real, they see we’re affecting a mission that no one has ever done before … we give them a voice now.”",https://www.newsnationnow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2025/10/snapshot-16-1-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-31 17:02:30.089454

1882: The Chinese Exclusion Act Signed in May 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred all Chinese labourers from entering the US for 10 years.","US President Donald Trump has announced that he will limit the number of refugees entering the US to 7,500 for the fiscal year 2026.

This is a record low since the 1980 Refugee Act when a cap on refugees entering the country was set at 50,000 per year, but could be changed. That was the same year that the US refugee resettlement programme was launched. Currently, the cap sits at 125,000, set by former President Joe Biden.

Furthermore, the Trump administration said priority will be given to white South Africans.

But while the new cap is a significant drop from the number of refugees admitted by the US in more recent years, the US has made use of highly restrictive and often racist immigration policies throughout its history.

Who will be allowed to take refuge in the US from 2026?

No more than 7,500 people will be granted refugee status and these must undergo very tough checks before they can enter. Approval by the secretaries of state and homeland security will be required.

The White House announcement reiterated that Trump also signed a proclamation in June that stipulates that foreign nationals can still be denied entry if allowing them into the country would harm the country’s interests.

Why is Trump prioritising white South Africans?

Trump claims that White Afrikaaners are at risk of “genocide” in South Africa. In February this year, he signed Executive Order 14204, titled “Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa”. The order was made in response to South Africa’s Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, which allows for land to be seized and redistributed.

The order criticised South Africa for seizing land owned by “ethnic minority” white South Africans. The US threatened to withhold aid to South Africa if the government continues with this. In May, 59 white South Africans arrived in the US as part of a special refugee programme Trump established for them.

The same month, Trump ambushed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa during a visit the White House, only to be ambushed by Trump with a video of people singing “Kill the Boer” in South Africa and allegations that a “white genocide” was taking place.

“People are fleeing South Africa for their own safety. Their land is being confiscated, and in many cases, they’re being killed,” Trump said during the meeting with Ramaphosa in May.

Do white Afrikaaners need refugee status?

Experts say not really.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the Act to right apartheid-era wrongs. However, the law allows the government to seize privately owned land from anyone, regardless of race, for public purposes with compensation, or in some cases, without compensation.

The Act replaces a previous 1975 law, which was criticised for its lack of clarity about compensation.

During apartheid, white South Africans, who are mainly Afrikaans-speaking descendants of Dutch settlers and English-speaking descendants of British colonists, held control, and often violently sidelined the Black majority.

While apartheid ended in 1994, white South Africans, who represent about 7 percent of the population, still own more than 70 percent of the land, while more than half of the Black population lives in poverty.

At his White House meeting, Ramaphosa told Trump that while South Africa does have a problem with violent crime, it was being perpetrated against all South Africans, not just white people.

Experts have also dismissed Trump’s claims of a white genocide.

“There is no merit to Trump’s fantasy claims of white genocide,” South African historian Saul Dubow, professor of Commonwealth history at the University of Cambridge, told Al Jazeera in May.

“South Africa is a violent country and, in economic terms, one of the most unequal societies in the world. The violence is criminal rather than political, though racial injustice inevitably forms part of the context.”

Dubow suggested that Trump may be more angry about South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, filed in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023 in relation to the war on Gaza.

Is this really the strictest US cap on refugees ever?

This is the lowest cap on refugees in recent history. As well as being lower than the initial 50,000 cap established by the 1980 Act, it is also lower than the previous ceiling of 17,400 the Act sought to replace.

Every year, the number of refugees allowed into the US is determined by the president in consultation with the US Congress. For the fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, a maximum of 125,000 refugees were allowed into the US.

In 1980, the US refugee resettlement programme was established to allow the US to identify, admit and resettle refugees fleeing conflict or persecution from around the world.

Prior to 1980, however, the United States did not admit significant numbers of refugees and had a history of highly restrictive laws which barred people from specific countries from entering or holding citizenship.

A history of prohibitive immigration policy in the US

Here’s a timeline of some key US citizenship and immigration policies which have affected people of specific ethnicities and nationalities.

1790: Naturalisation Act

The Naturalisation Act defined limits on who could become a naturalised citizen of the US.

According to this act, naturalisation was limited to free white people who had lived in the US for two years and demonstrated good moral character.

It excluded Native Americans, enslaved people and anyone who was not white.

1875: The Page Act

Signed in March 1875 by President Ulysses S Grant, the Page Act was the first US federal law on immigration.

The law targeted immigrants, especially women from Asia. It decreed that the US government must determine that “the immigration of any subject of China, Japan, or any Oriental country, to the United States, is free and voluntary”.

The Act was worded as if it was protecting vulnerable immigrants, as it prohibited bringing women into the US for forced labour or sex work. Anyone found to have brought an immigrant from an Asian country into the US without their consent could be imprisoned and fined.

However, critics have pointed out that, in practice, the Act was racist and sexist. It came at a time when poverty and famine in China had caused many Chinese people to seek opportunities in the US. In particular, Chinese women migrated to the US, seeking jobs, from the 1850s.

According to an article published by the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS), San Francisco officials started making efforts to deport Chinese women of “ill fame” from the 1860s. The article added that at that point, “all Chinese women were most likely stereotyped as prostitutes”.

The article highlights that one of the enduring impacts of the Page Act was the stigmatisation of Asian women. Beyond facing racial discrimination, Asian women were fetishised and sexualised culturally.

1882: The Chinese Exclusion Act

Signed in May 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred all Chinese labourers from entering the US for 10 years.

It also prevented Chinese immigrants from becoming naturalised citizens of the US.

The Act was extended by the Geary Act of 1892 and remained in place until it was repealed in 1943.

1907: The Gentlemen’s Agreement

This was not a formal law – it was, rather, an agreement between the US and Japan.

The agreement, negotiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, asked the Japanese government to restrict the migration of Japanese labourers to the US.

In exchange for this, Japanese students would be permitted to continue to attend integrated schools.

The agreement was drawn up in response to public anger about the rising number of Japanese labourers and agricultural workers who had migrated to fill the gap left by Chinese workers.

1917: Asiatic Barred Zone Act

This law created a “barred zone” from the Middle East and Southeast Asia, spanning most Asian countries.

Nationals of these countries were restricted from entering the US.

1924: The Johnson-Reed Act

This immigration act imposed strict limits on the number of people from other countries who could migrate to the US every year.

It stipulated a “national origins” quota, which decreed that only 2 percent of the number of people of any nationality living in the US in 1890 could enter the country each year.

The law also completely barred people from Asian countries from immigrating to the US.

2017: Trump’s own ‘Muslim ban’

During his first term, Trump enacted a travel ban dubbed the “Muslim ban”.

Under this ban, Trump signed an executive order banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, from entering the US for 90 days.

The order also suspended the US refugee programme for 120 days and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees.

Trump’s travel ban went through subsequent rounds of revisions. The initial version was blocked by courts for being discriminatory.

The final version, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018, affected citizens from Yemen, Syria, Iran, Libya and Somalia alongside Venezuela and North Korea.

In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order reversing the travel ban.

2025: Trump’s travel ban

While Trump did not reinstate his original travel ban during his second term, he signed a proclamation in June this year imposing a complete ban on nationals of 12 countries from travelling to the US. Many of them are African nations.

They include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

Under this proclamation, citizens from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela are subject to partial restrictions.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_69049ffb1f15-1761910779.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-31 12:02:55.613886

U.S. District Court Judge J. Michael Seabright disqualified Essayli from supervising the criminal prosecutions in three cases, siding with defense lawyers. Essayli has been unlawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Central District of California since July 29, Seabright wrote. But he may continue to serve as a First Assistant United States Attorney, Seabright ruled, effectively leaving him as the office’s top prosecutor.

“Nothing is changing,” Essayli wrote in a social media post on Oct. 28, saying he looked forward to advancing President Donald Trump’s agenda.

The decision represents another setback to the Trump administration‘s effort to extend handpicked acting U.S. attorneys beyond the 120-day limit set by federal law. A judge ruled in September that acting U.S. attorney of Nevada, Sigal Chattah, was serving in her position illegally. Another judge disqualified acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, in August.

Essayli is a former federal prosecutor turned Republican California Assemblymember, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s COVID-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against California policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.

Under federal law, if a permanent U.S. attorney is not nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate within 120 days, judges of the federal district court can appoint an interim until the vacancy is filled. Essayli has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate — something that generally requires a degree of bipartisan support. California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla have criticized Essayli’s appointment.

Essayli was appointed as interim U.S. attorney in March, several months after former President Joe Biden’s appointee to the job resigned. Just shy of the 120-day mark, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him as first assistant U.S. attorney and said he would have the authority to serve as acting U.S. attorney upon a vacancy in the role. He then resigned as interim U.S. attorney.

The government has argued that he can do so under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which Congress passed specifically to regulate the temporary filling of executive branch vacancies that require presidential appointment and Senate confirmation.

Seabright, however, said that provision of the law only applies if the previous U.S. Attorney dies, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated.

The lawsuit seeking to disqualify Essayli was brought by three men facing federal firearms charges. They sought to have their indictments dismissed. Seabright ruled the indictments can proceed.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/10/AP25281611539665-scaled-1.webp,N,,2025-10-31 10:57:18.304144

The sweep in Indiana is part of Operation Midway Blitz, a Department of Homeland Security initiative targeting criminal illegal aliens in the Chicago area.
It’s named in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a hit-and-run by a drunk driver who was an illegal alien.
So far, at least 12 illegal alien drivers and passengers arrested on Indiana highways have had criminal histories, including for DWI, drug dealing, theft, burglary, assault, child abuse, domestic battery, prostitution and fraud.","WASHINGTON — Immigration authorities have made 223 arrests along Northwest Indiana highways since mid-September as they aim to clear the state’s roadways of illegal aliens who create safety risks.

“ICE launched operation Midway Blitz to remove illegal alien threats to public safety, which is exactly what we have done in Chicago,” said acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons. “We recognized from the start that this must include protecting roadways carrying interstate traffic and cargo. Sanctuary policies like those in Illinois sadly don’t recognize borders, and ICE and the Indiana State Police have successfully arrested hundreds of illegal alien truck drivers who should not be operating on our highways. In recent weeks, we have seen illegal semi-truck drivers responsible for significant loss of life across the country. This was preventable, and that is precisely why we are working to ensure this doesn’t happen in Indiana or Illinois.”

Many of the illegal aliens’ CDLs were from states with sanctuary policies, including California, Illinois and New York. Of the 46 truck drivers detained as illegal aliens, 10 had a type of CDL that has been subject to abuse in some states. The Trump administration has pushed states to stop issuing CDLs to illegal aliens.

The results show again how neglect of the nation’s immigration laws has undermined the rule of law and made America less secure. President Donald J. Trump’s common-sense enforcement efforts are restoring the rule of law and making the U.S. safe again.

The operation in Indiana, focused on immigration enforcement, has been aimed specifically at improving safety on the Hoosier State’s busy highways, where innocent people’s lives can be put in jeopardy by drivers who aren’t properly licensed or qualified.

The sweep in Indiana is part of Operation Midway Blitz, a Department of Homeland Security initiative targeting criminal illegal aliens in the Chicago area. It’s named in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a hit-and-run by a drunk driver who was an illegal alien.

So far, at least 12 illegal alien drivers and passengers arrested on Indiana highways have had criminal histories, including for DWI, drug dealing, theft, burglary, assault, child abuse, domestic battery, prostitution and fraud.

The UN's human rights chief has condemned US military strikes on vessels allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific, saying the lethal attacks violate international law and amount to ""extrajudicial killing"".

Volker Türk said on Friday that more than 60 people have reportedly been killed in US strikes since early September.

Calling the attacks ""unacceptable"", he said Washington must halt them immediately and conduct prompt, independent and transparent investigations.

President Donald Trump has said the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US and he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters.

Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth has said strikes are being carried out on vessels operated by drug-trafficking groups designated as terrorist organisations by the US, saying this week that ""the Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans"".

Türk, while acknowledging the challenges of tackling drug trafficking, said in a statement that the circumstances for the deadly strikes ""find no justification in international law"".

""Countering the serious issue of illicit trafficking of drugs across international borders is - as has long been agreed among States - a law-enforcement matter, governed by the careful limits on lethal force set out in international human rights law.""

Under law, the intentional use of lethal force ""is only permissible as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life"", he said.

He added that based on ""very sparse information provided publicly by the US authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to lives of others"".

He called on the US to use law enforcement methods including intercepting boats and detaining suspects, and if necessary, prosecuting individuals.

Most strikes have taken place off the coast of South America in the Caribbean, though attacks in the Pacific this week killed at least 18 people, according to Hegseth.

In the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area.

The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government does not ""agree with these attacks"" and has called for meetings with the US ambassador, insisting that ""all international treaties be respected.""

The US actions have also heightened tensions between Washington and the governments of Colombia and Venezuela.

The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to ""flourish"". Petro has responded that he has been fighting drug trafficking ""for decades"".

Trump has also accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies.

Venezuela's attorney general told the BBC there is ""no doubt"" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.

The US is among many nations that do not recognise Maduro as Venezuela's legitimate leader, after the last election in 2024 was widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.

A U.S. Senate investigation has uncovered dozens of credible reports of medical neglect and poor conditions in immigration detention centers nationwide — with detainees denied insulin, left without medical attention for days and forced to compete for clean water — raising scrutiny about how the government oversees its vast detention system.

The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.

The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.

A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that “ambulances have to come almost every day,” according to the report.

Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.

“Americans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,” Ossoff told The Associated Press. “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.”

The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.

Expired milk, foul water, scant food are reported

The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.

The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report’s findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff’s first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to “score political points.”

Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they’ve seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.

Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization’s clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola’s Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,” she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn’t able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he’s been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

The Baltimore field office is examined

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization’s clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it’s much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,” Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren’t always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”",https://www.voicenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Immigration_Detention_Senate_Probe_35648.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-10-31 13:04:04.059062

What is the filibuster and why does Trump want to get rid of it?

Rachel Leingang

Donald Trump on Thursday suggested ending the filibuster to bring an end to the government shutdown, which has now passed one month with no signs of compromise on the horizon.

Both parties have previously defended or sought to dismantle the US Senate rule, depending on the moment and the contours of the debate.

“….BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the US president wrote on Truth Social.

Need a refresher on the filibuster and why it matters? My colleague Rachel Leingang has this explainer on what you need to know:

More than 40 million Americans will stop receiving food stamps on 1 November, as the US government shutdown enters its fifth week.

The Department of Agriculture says the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) will be suspended until Congress reopens the government. While the Trump administration argues the department does not have the legal authority to use a $5bn contingency fund to continue the aid, Democrats disagree, and two dozen states have sued the government to force the program to continue.

Meanwhile, Democrats are also refusing to vote to end the shutdown because health insurance costs are set to go up dramatically as insurers prepare for a lapse in subsidies. Senate Democrats are demanding that any short-term government funding deal include an extension of the enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, while Trump and the Republicans have said they will not negotiate until the government is back up and running. Extending the subsidies would require $350bn in federal spending over the coming decade.

We’d like to hear from Americans who are about to lose Snap food assistance due to the shutdown, as well as from people whose healthcare may become unaffordable due to rising premiums. Have you received any notices or paperwork that your insurance will change soon? Tell us using the link below:

Neither agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins nor House speaker Mike Johnson commented on the issue Democrats have been holding the government closed in order to address: health insurance premiums that will double, triple or more for people using healthcare insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.

Instead, Johnson attributed the shutdown to a call for a “leftwing, radical agenda”.

Mike Johnson seeks to blame Democrats for Americans losing food benefits

US House speaker Mike Johnson spoke about millions of families suffering “because of Snap benefits drying up” during the government shutdown, while offering “a word of sincere gratitude” to millions of federal workers who have showed up without pay, “not knowing when or if their next paycheck will be delivered”.

“We just want to say thank you for your diligence … even though Democrats are withholding your paycheck. They are shameless in doing so.”

Johnson laid blame for the shutdown on Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats choosing not to approve a continuing resolution on funding the government. “The pain of the people is their political lever,” he said. “Republicans have done their part.”

Mike Johnson doubles down on refusing to bring back House until shutdown ends

US House Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated this morning that he will not bring the chamber back into session until the government shutdown ends.

Speaking to Fox News on Friday, Johnson said: “We are anxious to get the house back to regular legislative session, but we have to get the lights turned back on. Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate have got to reopen the government. Again, it’s the most fundamental responsibility of congress is to have the government operate and work for the people. That’s the number one priority right now and we cannot deviate from that.”

The government is on day 31 of shutdown today. The senate adjourned on Thursday without resolving demands by Democrats to negotiate on healthcare subsidies for insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The senate won’t meet again until Monday, extending the shutdown into at least its 34th day, equaling the longest in US history.

Meanwhile, health insurance exchanges enter an open enrollment period tomorrow. An early peek at prices without subsidies suggests that the cost of many plans will double or more. Paychecks for most government employees will not go out tomorrow. And the government will not pay Snap food benefits that would normally land on prepaid cards tomorrow, leaving about 42 million beneficiaries – mostly children and disabled elderly recipients – searching for ways to pay for food.

The president of the Heritage Foundation has denied the suggestion that the conservative thinktank should distance itself from former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, after interviewing white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who made antisemitic statements during the two-and-a-half hour video.

“Christians can critique the State of Israel without being anti-Semitic, and of course, anti-Semitism should be condemned,” said Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, in a video on X yesterday. “[C]onservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.”

Roberts said: “The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won’t start doing that now. We don’t take direction from comments on X, though we are grateful for the robust free speech debate.”

Kennedy Center ticket sales for orchestra, dance and theatre performances are at the worst they have been since the pandemic, analysis by the Washington Post has found.

Back in September, the Guardian reported that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center had continued to plummet following Donald Trump’s takeover of Washington DC’s premier performing arts venue.

Since then typical ticket sales are down from 93 per cent in late 2024 to about 57% this year, according to the Post.

Audiences are “voting with their feet to skip out” on shows that would once have been packed, in protest at the US president inserting himself into the center’s management and operations as its new chair.

A federal judge has indicated that she would order the Trump administration to use reserves to partially fund food assistance for about 42 million Americans in November, reports the Washington Post. If the order goes ahead, it could delay a cutoff in benefits during the government shutdown.

US grocers and food companies ranging from Walmart to Smithfield Foods are bracing for a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits lapse for the first time due to the ongoing government shutdown.

The shutdown has imperiled next month’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, which serves nearly 42 million people.

Neither Congress nor the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acted to fund the benefits beyond Saturday. The gap could mean an $8bn revenue drop for grocers, declining sales for their suppliers and reduced hours for workers as it drives Snap recipients to reduce spending, trade groups, companies and a union said this week, reports Reuters.

Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of health, nutrition and food studies at New York University said:

It’s not only poor people who are on Snap who are going to be affected. It means the places where they spend the money aren’t going to get that money.

The National Grocers Association said on Wednesday that Congress should reopen the government and fund Snap to avoid instability for customers and retailers, warning of “serious consequences for local grocers, their employees, and the food supply chain.”

“Retailers are going to be in a terrible situation here trying to manage costs and inventory,” said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, adding stores could see unsold perishable goods go to waste.

A USDA spokesperson called the benefit lapse “an inflection point for Senate Democrats”. The agency has repeatedly blamed Democrats for the shutdown, most of whom have withheld votes on a spending bill in an attempt to keep healthcare costs from increasing for many Americans.

A US Republican senator is asking President Donald Trump’s administration to help the Malaysian government prevent US artificial intelligence chips from being smuggled through the country to China, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Reuters has previously reported that US officials believe Malaysia is among a handful of countries where organized smuggling operations have worked to get US chips into China that would otherwise be banned from export to China.

Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, wrote a letter to US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick saying Malaysian officials had begun cracking down on such activity and the Trump administration should aid Malaysian officials in the effort by helping the country develop screening programs to ensure chips are not being diverted to China.

Cotton, who along with the Trump administration has supported the idea of requiring US chips to contain technology that would verify their location to prevent smuggling, said chips with such technology should be given a green light for export to Malaysia, reports Reuters.

Cotton wrote in an 30 October letter:

As is often the case, US companies are at the forefront of developing creative and innovative technical solutions, which will help add layers of assurance against illegal diversion.

Cotton said:

To support the semiconductor industry in their efforts, it may be beneficial for US and Malaysian officials to develop priority customs clearance procedures for shipments of advanced U.S. chips with anti-diversion mechanisms.

Malaysia, China’s largest trading partner in Southeast Asia, announced in July it was requiring permits for all exports, trans-shipments and transits of US-made high-performance chips, such as those made by Nvidia.

UN human rights official says US strikes on alleged drug boats are 'unacceptable'

The UN high commissioner for human rights said on Friday that US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.

Volker Türk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization, reports the Associated Press (AP).

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for Türk’s office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular UN briefing:

These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.

She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law”.

President Donald Trump has Justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the US, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61, reports the AP.

Shamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.

Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. Shamdasani added:

Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.

The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.

US Senate votes to reject Trump’s global tariffs on more than 100 countries

Rachel Leingang

The US Senate took a stand against Donald Trump’s global tariffs affecting more than 100 countries on Thursday, voting to nullify the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs.

Four Republicans joined with all Democrats to vote 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs that the president put into place via executive order.

It was the third time the Republicans have voted alongside Democrats on a tariff resolution this week, previously rallying to end tariffs targeting Brazil and Canada.

Going against Trump is rare for Republicans in his second term. But Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined the opposition party.

The vote came as Trump is wrapping up a week in Asia, where he struck a deal with China to lower tariffs on Chinese goods into the country and get China to buy up US soya beans, a pain point of the trade wars that had farmers on edge, among other concessions.

Despite the opposition in the Senate, the House is unlikely to take any similar action. House Republicans created a rule earlier this year that will block resolutions on the tariffs from getting a floor vote.

The tariff resolutions are a rebuke to the tariffs themselves and to Trump overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, told reporters that the symbolic opposition should catch the president’s attention.

Kaine said:

I did learn in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior.

Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown

President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.

Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social:

THE CHOICE IS CLEAR – INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER.

The filibuster is a longstanding tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the 1 October shutdown when the new fiscal year began.

Trump’s call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional deal-making operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.

Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

In a separate post on Truth Social, Trump wrote about his meetings and said it “was a great honor” to “see that America is respected again”. He also claimed that “money is pouring into our Country because of Tariffs and, frankly, the Landslide Results of the 2024 Presidential Election”.

Switching back to the filibuster issue, Trump wrote:

It is now time for the Republicans to play their “TRUMP CARD,” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!

More on this in a moment. First here are some other key developments:

A (small) handful of US Senate Republicans issued a legislative rebuke to president Donald Trump’s world-rattling trade tariffs in a rare alignment with their Democratic counterparts. Four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – joined the opposition party, voting 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs on more than 100 nations that the president put into place via executive order.

The Trump administration is going to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the United States next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans. The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, on Thursday declared a state of emergency to free up funds so that she could issue $65m in assistance to food banks because federal funding for the national food stamp program is set to lapse on 1 November. Oregon and Virginia have also issued emergency declarations to release state cash to go towards emergency food assistance as the federal government shutdown imperils Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits for nearly 42 million Americans.

More than half of Americans disapprove of Trump’s demolition of the White House’s East Wing and the construction of a new ballroom, according to a new poll from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos. The survey was conducted between 24 and 28 October and indicates 56% of the respondents disagree with Trump’s recent move while 28% are in favor of it. Most of the survey’s respondents were white, one-third of them voted for Donald Trump and another third for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has urged the Trump administration to suspend its immigration crackdown in his state from Friday to Sunday, to allow children to “spend Halloween weekend without fear”.

The Department of Homeland Security has issued new guidance requiring foreign nationals – including green card holders and other non-U.S. citizens living legally in the country, to be photographed when they enter or leave the United States.

CBP currently employs facial recognition at airport checkpoints, but the updated rule will broaden its use to cover every U.S. entry and exit point — by air, land and sea.

The change will broaden CBP’s biometric screening program to include more comprehensive image and data collection aimed at tightening verification procedures and preventing document fraud.

AMERICANS ON ALERT AS POPULAR TOURIST HOT SPOT NOW ENFORCING DIGITAL IDS AT BORDER

""This final rule amends Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations to provide that DHS may require all aliens to be photographed when entering or exiting the United States, and may require non-exempt aliens to provide other biometrics,"" a summary of the new policy in the Federal Register reads.

""The final rule also amends the regulations to remove the references to pilot programs and the port limitation to permit collection of biometrics from aliens departing from airports, land ports, seaports, or any other authorized point of departure. In addition, DHS is requesting comments on the specific collection process as well as costs and benefits for new transportation modalities,"" it continued.

The rule also lifts previous age exemptions, authorizing facial recognition scans for travelers younger than 14 and older than 79.

""The exemptions in the current regulations for biometric collection based on the age of the individual (i.e., under 14 and over 79) were based on technological limitations on collecting fingerprints from children and elderly persons, as well as traditional law enforcement policies and other policies, such as not running criminal history background checks on children,"" the policy stated.

""These exemptions are not applicable to CBP’s facial comparison-based biometric entry-exit program, as the use of biometrics has expanded beyond criminal history background checks and now plays a vital role in identity verification and management, and combatting the trafficking of children,"" it added. ""Furthermore, internal CBP studies of biometric facial match accuracy, historical matching data, examination of biometric matching of ages under 14 and over 79, and CBP standard operating procedures associated with these ages no longer support exempting facial biometric collection from these populations. Exemptions based on age will continue to apply to biometrics other than facial images.""

The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.

The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.

A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that “ambulances have to come almost every day,” according to the report.

Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.

“Americans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,” Ossoff told The Associated Press. “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.”

The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.

Expired milk, foul water, scant food are reported

The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.

The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report’s findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff’s first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to “score political points.”

Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they’ve seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.

Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization’s clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola’s Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,” she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn’t able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he’s been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

The Baltimore field office is examined

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization’s clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it’s much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,” Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren’t always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”",https://www.wcia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2025/10/6904930d755b93.57150014.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-31 13:04:08.496249

On Thursday, two immigrant advocacy groups were denied a requested temporary restraining order (TRO) that would have guaranteed attorney access to detainees brought up on deportation-related charges in, but then removed from, the Beaver State.

In a six-page opinion and order, U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken, a Bill Clinton appointee, said the plaintiffs did not yet make a clear enough showing that such alleged behavior by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents is unconstitutional.

""Plaintiffs allege that ICE obstructs and delays attorneys from meeting with their detained clients before it transfers their clients out of state,"" the judge explains. ""Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO is DENIED.""

The litigation was filed earlier this month by the Innovation Law Lab, a Portland-based group of lawyers, activists, and tech professionals focused on immigration reform and upholding constitutional rights.

In a 35-page complaint and concomitant 21-page motion for a TRO, the plaintiffs allege various violations of the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the federal statute governing the behavior of administrative agencies like ICE.

""The U.S. Constitution requires that individuals subject to the government's unilateral power of detention, transfer, and extraordinary rendition must have the right to access counsel before any transfer or rendition,"" the lawsuit begins. ""Recent federal agency action, however, has undermined this sacrosanct safeguard.""

The complaint details the allegations:

[F]ederal agencies have commanded their vast resources and innumerable agents to assault the people—immigrants and non-immigrants alike. Undertaking the orders of the President ""to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,"" federal agencies—which are mere creatures of law with an ironclad obligation to always obey the law—have largely abandoned the law, especially the law on immigrant detention, and their constitutional, statutory, and regulatory obligations.

In this spirit, federal agencies have adopted officially sanctioned policies, patterns, and practices designed to achieve quota deportations at all costs—even if that means violating the right to access counsel that is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment…

In their request for emergency relief, the plaintiffs asked the court to ""immediately"" enter a TRO barring the government ""for three business days from transferring"" immigration detainees out of Oregon so as to give the detained individuals time to meet with counsel.

Painting a dire picture, the plaintiffs accused ICE of detaining ""citizen and immigrant"" alike in ""violent sweeps"" that then ""trap"" such detainees in the government's ""vast detention network: a network that spans from Tacoma, Washington, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Sudan to Libya to CECOT—a notorious torture center in El Salvador.""

The plaintiffs' Kafkaesque recitation of ICE activity recalls a flashpoint in the second Trump administration's immigration control campaigns, the use of so-called ""third-country"" deportation flights. In fact, the plaintiffs clearly allege they think this is happening to Oregonians.

""Individuals arrested in immigration enforcement actions may not only be rapidly transferred outside of Oregon and far from their communities of support, but they can also be sent quickly to third countries—like South Sudan, Eswatini, El Salvador, or Libya—where they have never been before and where the government takes the position that they are beyond the reach of this Court's jurisdiction and ability to remedy any unlawful detention or transfer,"" the lawsuit goes on.

The government, in turn, said the plaintiffs were raising much ado about a very simple fact of ICE's operational capabilities.

""Plaintiffs' requested relief is overbroad, unworkable, potentially contrary to law, and otherwise improper,"" the 45-page opposition motion filed by the Department of Justice reads. ""As to the transfer prohibition in particular, ICE does not have any overnight detention facilities within Oregon. Any alien arrested in Oregon that ICE determines will remain in custody must be transferred out of state.""

To hear the DOJ tell it, ""[a]lmost all adult"" Oregon detainees are transferred to the ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington. Such detainees ""routinely"" access attorneys in ""several"" ways, the DOJ claims.

""The thrust of Plaintiffs' complaint is that detainees are not being given sufficient access to attorneys,"" the government's response reads. ""The way to remedy that harm would be to mandate increased access in some fashion. But there is absolutely no reason for the Court to restrict Defendants from detaining individuals in particular locations. Whether a detainee is held in Oregon or Washington does not impact his ability to interact with a lawyer; there is simply no connection between attorney access and whether an individual is transferred out of state.""

The DOJ also argued that ICE has ""clear statutory authority"" to make immigration-related arrests – even without a warrant – under two different prongs of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

And, for now, at least, the court sided with the government.

""At this preliminary stage, the Court finds that Plaintiffs declarations present evidence of Defendants' practices and policies that may violate a detainees' constitutional rights or conflict with Defendants' own rules and regulations,"" the brief bit of legal analysis supplied by the court reads. ""However, Defendants have presented evidence contradicting Plaintiffs' allegations and the testimony and evidence in the declarations does not show that the law would 'clearly favor' Plaintiffs.""

While giving a very terse explanation for her reasoning, the judge more or less suggests the plaintiffs have raised some general issues of constitutional concern while at the same time outright saying ""there is some doubt"" they are likely to succeed on the current set of facts. To that end, the court says the immigrant advocates need to show more – and at this moment have not shown enough.

""It may be that evidence from other witnesses, or the addition of a party is necessary to establish a more concrete connection between the injured party and the rights Plaintiffs seek to enforce,"" Aiken muses.

The judge gave the plaintiffs two weeks to file an improved motion for a TRO. The government will then have two weeks to respond. After that, the plaintiffs will have two weeks to reply to the government.

The difference between “Visa” versus “Status”

First things first: what is the difference between “visa” and “status?” The two terms are often used interchangeably.

Your visa is the foil or sticker placed in your passport by a U.S. consulate outside the U.S., granting you permission to travel to the U.S. and seek entry. You can find it inside your passport. See Figure 1 for details.

On the other hand, your immigration status (e.g., B-1/B-2, F-1, or H-1B) describes how long in the specific status you can lawfully remain in the U.S. Your immigration status is decided at the border, when you seek entry into the U.S., and is recorded on an I-94 (i.e., the Arrival/Departure Form), and you are able to seek an extension of your immigration status in the U.S. or change your status in the U.S.

Your visa can expire even if immigration status remains active. The reverse is also true: your immigration status can expire even if your visa remains active. In either case, you can face legal consequences — which means renewing your visa and respecting the rules of your immigration status is critical should you wish to remain in the U.S.

H-1B Visa Holders

There are an estimated 730,000 H-1B visa holders living in the U.S. Most of them are from Asian countries. In fact, Asian workers accounted for almost 90% of approved H-1B visa applications in 2024, with most applications coming from India (71%) and China (12%). However, recent changes could put the future of the H-1B program into question. Here’s what we know:

$100,000 fine on H-1B applicants and visa holders

The Trump White House announced a $100,000 fee for individuals filing first-time H-1B petitions on or after September 21, 2025, and who are not currently in the United States. This fee will not apply to those who submitted their H-1B petitions before September 21; those with a valid H-1B visa (travel in and out of the U.S. is still permitted); and those in H-1B status inside the U.S. who petition for amendment, change, or extension and are granted such amendment, change, or extension.

There is an exception to the $100,000 fee for individuals whose “presence in the United States as a H-1B worker is in the national interest” — but it’s up to the Department of Homeland Security to decide who satisfies this “high threshold.”

In short, the $100,000 fee targets H-1B applications from people who:

Are outside the U.S. and who do not hold a valid H-1B visa.

Are in the United States with a request for consular notification, port of entry notification, or pre-flight inspection.

Are in the United States with a request for amendment, change, or extension of H-1B status, and that request is denied.

What else you should know:

Petitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment using pay.gov according to the instructions available here. Petitioners must complete payment prior to filing a petition with USCIS and will be required to submit proof of payment from pay.gov — or proof of an exception from the Secretary of Homeland Security — in order to complete the filing process. Without proof of payment or proof of an exception, petitions subject to the $100,000 fee will be denied. Talk to an immigration attorney if you have questions about the payment.

Trump has instructed the State Department to warn B-1 and B-2 visa holders against misusing their current status to avoid the $100,000 fine. We are still waiting for more specific guidance — but in the meantime, B-1 and B-2 visa holders who anticipate filing an H-1B application should consult legal counsel.

📝 The American Immigration Lawyers’ Association has a helpful fact sheet with even more information about the new fine.

Proposed changes to the H-1B lottery system

On September 24, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to replace the current H-1B lottery system for H-1B cap-subject petitions with a weighted selection process, prioritizing higher-paid foreign workers. Here’s what we know:

Under the new system, each H-1B petition will be assigned to one of four wage levels, and each wage level will be given a specific number of entries into the selection pool. As a result, high-wage earners (Level 4) will be four times as likely to receive an H-1B visa in comparison to low-wage earners (Level 1).

➡️ Where do you fit in? To make a determination, the Department of Labor will look at your occupation, position requirements, and geographic location.

Please note: This is just a proposal and it still has to go through a one-month commenting period before the Trump administration makes a final decision. This could take months.

What can we expect in the coming months?

Under the Trump administration, it appears that the future of the $100,000 H-1B fee will be decided in the courts. In recent days, a national coalition of labor unions and immigrant justice organizations filed the first legal challenge to Trump’s proclamation. Not long afterwards, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced a lawsuit of its own. Where does this leave immigrant workers? The answer is unclear, and it could take months before a final decision is reached.

International Students

For international students, the path forward is uncertain. Those who have lost their status are forced to transfer schools and leave the country. Those who have lost their visas are effectively trapped in the U.S. — unable to return home for weddings, funerals, or cultural holidays without giving up their studies.

What about federal litigation? Students and immigration advocates filed more than 100 legal challenges against the Trump administration in response to its SEVIS termination policy. Many of them are still in process. Others have granted at least temporary relief to affected students.

All of this appears to have made a difference. In April 2025, ICE declared that it will cease the terminations of SEVIS records. Just a few weeks later, a federal district court judge in the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, putting a stop to ICE’s arbitrary termination of the SEVIS records and calling for the restoration of all SEVIS records.

Continuous vetting and consular review

The Trump administration has also expanded screening and vetting for visa applicants. infrastructure for monitoring international students and other visa-holders.

The process is even more intensive for F-1 visa applicants. Starting on June 18, 2025, all FMJ applicants are expected to make their social media accounts public, to allow consular officers to review your entire online presence. Should you refuse, officials could reject your visa application on the grounds of “evasiveness.”

Other important considerations

Trump’s travel ban on 19 countries — including four Asian and Pacific Island nations — restricts people from around the world from traveling to the U.S. for business, tourism, or even tourism. Though it doesn’t revoke visas from current students, it does stop their families from visiting and attending their graduation ceremonies.

Secretary Rubio has announced plans to enhance screening for F-1 visa applicants from China or Hong Kong and revoke visas from Chinese students who are either connected to the Chinese Communist Party or majoring in “critical fields.” For the hundreds of thousands of Chinese international students at U.S. colleges and universities, the implications are profound.

ℹ️ What do Trump’s travel restrictions and screening policies mean for your travel plans? Read our blog post to find out.

A new proposal from Secretary Noem replaces F-1 “duration of status” — which lets international students remain in the U.S. so long as they are in school — with a “fixed period of stay” (e.g., four years). For students who change programs, or whose studies take longer than anticipated, this means leaving the country or going through the application process for a second time.

💡 Stop AAPI Hate submitted a public comment in opposition to this proposal for placing undue burden on international students.

Another proposal limits “third-country national” (TCN) visa processing, which allows international students to renew their visas in a country that isn’t their home country. Now, students will have to return to their home countries, which can be far more expensive and time-consuming than traveling to Canada or Mexico, for example. And for students from countries with long visa processing times or political conflict, this will make it even harder to continue their U.S. studies.

Impact on international students

In September 2025, a federal judge in Massachusetts called out the Trump administration for violating the first amendment by systematically targeting pro-Palestinian students as means to spread fear on suppress free speech on campus.

This is promising news — but for international students, it does little to assuage their fears of detention or deportation.

Around 70 white South Africans were relocated to the U.S. in two groups in May and June in what U.S. officials described as the start of the program.
Approximately 400 white South Africans in total have reportedly been moved to the U.S. already.
There are around 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa's population of 62 million, which is more than 80 per cent Black.
Guerline Jozef, director of immigration for Haitian Bridge Alliance, called the new cap ""white supremacy disguised as refugee policy.""","President Donald Trump is slashing the number of refugees allowed into the United States, and people fleeing war-torn countries, human rights abuses and catastrophes will now be of lower priority than white people from South Africa.

The Trump administration is cutting the number of refugee places to as few as 7,500, for the 2026 fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, down from a limit of 125,000 last year under the Biden administration.

The White House did not provide a reason for the drastically lower numbers, which were published in a notice on the Federal Register, but this new cap sets a historic low for refugees being admitted to the U.S. since the program's inception in 1980.

The notice was published on Sept. 30 but became official on Thursday.

It states admission will ""primarily be allocated"" to the Afrikaner white minority from South Africa, which Trump and some of his supporters allege face ""race-based"" discrimination and violence at home — even claiming, without reliable evidence, that they are at risk of ""genocide.""

But Afghans fleeing persecution under the Taliban, including women facing gender-based violence under the Islamist regime, people escaping the war in Sudan or gang violence in places like Haiti were not considered priorities under the new policy, only Afrikaners.

Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), says the U.S. government is ""politicizing a humanitarian program"" and giving special privilege to Afrikaners.

""It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,"" Aly said in a statement.

Trump policy follows unsubstantiated claims

Aly said this latest order shows ""how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world.""

IRAP is already suing the Trump administration after the president signed an executive order, on his first day in office earlier this year, indefinitely suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program until it ""aligns with the interests"" with the country.

But months later, Trump began opening the door to white South Africans, announcing a new program earlier this year to fast-track the relocation of Afrikaner farmers making unsubstantiated claims they were being subjected to systematic violence.

The South African government has strongly denied this.

Around 70 white South Africans were relocated to the U.S. in two groups in May and June in what U.S. officials described as the start of the program.

Approximately 400 white South Africans in total have reportedly been moved to the U.S. already.

The Washington Post, citing unnamed officials, reported that the U.S. State Department ""has set a goal of processing 2,000 Afrikaners for resettlement by the end of October and an additional 4,000 by the end of November.""

There are around 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa's population of 62 million, which is more than 80 per cent Black.

Afrikaners, who were at the heart of the country's apartheid system of racial segregation that lasted from 1948 until 1994, are today represented in every facet of South African life and are successful business leaders, some of the country's best-known athletes and also serve in government.

Lowering 'our moral standing'

By comparison, among the top countries of origin for the more than 100,000 refugees admitted into the U.S. in 2024 were the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and Syria — countries that have endured years of horrific violence.

Putting the focus on one group ""undermines the [refugee] program's purpose as well as its credibility,"" said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, a U.S.-based resettlement agency.

""This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" she said in a statement on the group's website.

The advocacy group Human Rights First called the policy ""blatantly racist.""

“Turning our back on hundreds of thousands of truly at-risk refugees fleeing religious, political, and other forms of persecution defies decades of bipartisan support for welcoming the vulnerable, from Vietnamese to Afghan allies,” Uzra Zeya, the organization's president and a former U.S. State Department official, said in a statement.

Guerline Jozef, director of immigration for Haitian Bridge Alliance, called the new cap ""white supremacy disguised as refugee policy.""

""At a time when Black refugees from Haiti, Sudan, the Congo and Cameroon are drowning at sea, languishing in detention or being deported to death, the U.S. government has decided to open its arms to those who already enjoy global privilege,"" she said, according to The Independent.

Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, which advocates for resettling at-risk Afghans, described the decision Thursday as a ""horrendous betrayal.""

""I think we need to face facts. This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,"" he said in a video posted on Instagram.

Kennedy Jr. encouraging the Trump administration to reinstate workers at the Office of Population Affairs (OPA), who were illegally fired on October 15.

OPA administers key programs like Title X, which provides essential family planning services to 2.8 million people, and which was first introduced in 1970 by then-Congressman George H.W. Bush of Texas’ Seventh Congressional District. OPA also administers the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program and provides resources to expand access to embryo donation and adoption as a family building option for families with fertility obstacles.

The letter can be found in its entirety below and here.

""We write to express our grave concern at the recent actions by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to terminate nearly the entire staff at the Office of Population Affairs (OPA). The OPA oversees the nation’s only federal program dedicated to family planning, the Title X program, among other vital reproductive health programs. These firings will severely undermine the functionality of the office, hindering the Title X program’s ability to operate effectively, and threatening the loss of health care for many of the millions of people that these programs support annually.

""On October 10, all but one of the 50 employees at the OPA lost access to their government email accounts. Five days later, they received confirmation from human resources that they were subject to a reduction in force (RIF).

""These RIFs are another example of this Administration’s ongoing assault on the Title X program, birth control, and reproductive health care access more broadly. Earlier this year, HHS illegally withheld $65 million in Congressionally appropriated funding for the Title X program from 16 grantees with grants in 23 states, threatening essential health care access for an estimated 842,000 people, or 30 percent of all Title X patients. Nine of the impacted Title X grantees have yet to have their funding restored seven months later. Many of these affected grantees struggle to sustain the financial burden caused by the extended delay in funding and the ongoing attacks on reproductive health care from this Administration and Congressional Republicans. As a result, they have been forced to close health centers, lay off staff, and reduce available services. As we pass week three of a government shutdown and as Republicans refuse to address the health care crisis they created, the President’s FY2026 budget proposal and House Republicans’ partisan spending bill would only make the situation worse by seeking to eliminate the Title X program entirely.

""For more than 50 years, Title X has served as a cornerstone of safety-net care. Title X-funded health centers are lifelines in their communities, providing high-quality family planning and sexual health care, including cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, HIV testing, contraceptive services and supplies, pregnancy testing, and other essential health care services.

""The bipartisan Title X program, championed by then-Congressman George H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Nixon, served 2.8 million people in 2023. For many of those patients, especially in rural and underserved communities, Title X health centers are their only source of health care. In 2023 alone, Title X supported 3,853 health centers across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. The RIFed OPA employees are essential to administering these grants, and without them clinics will be left without the needed support to continue to provide the Title X program’s critical services.

""Undermining the federal government’s ability to effectively administer the Title X program funds will unquestionably result in the loss of health care for patients who depend on it. The dismantling of the OPA threatens to rip away critical services from millions of Americans at thousands of health centers across the country. We urge you to immediately reinstate the OPA employees so they can continue to carry out their essential functions.""",https://escobar.house.gov/images/facebook-meta-25.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 06:56:39.589842

In a statement, the administration says it has deported 527,000 illegal migrants since President Trump took office in January.

""More than 2 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. including 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and over 527,000 deportations,” said Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “DHS, ICE and CBP, have not just closed the border, but made historic strides to carry out President Trump’s promise of arresting and deporting illegal aliens who have invaded our country.”

In addition, DHS points out that the US is offering illegal migrants $1,000 and a free flight if they self-deport, noting if they do so, they “reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right, legal way to live the American dream.”

However, the New Republic notes that the deportation number is “unverifiable, and almost certainly inaccurate, given that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not updated its arrest statistics since January.”

Border Patrol Set to Play Bigger Role in ICE Offices

There are also leadership shakeups in the pipeline.

According to reports, the Trump Administration plans to reassign 12 ICE field office directors and replace at least some of them with officials from U.S. Border Patrol. NewsNation says that the changes are being made in Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and San Diego.

The move to give Border Patrol greater responsibility on immigration raids could mark a new phase in the Trump Administration’s deportation plan.

As NBC News notes, “Border Patrol’s approach to recent arrests in major U.S. cities has been more aggressive, making large sweeps that have sparked some of the sharpest backlash from protesters and prompted lawsuits.”

And Fox News reports that the leadership shakeup shows growing division inside the Department of Homeland Security on how to proceed with ramping up deportations.

On one side, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, senior adviser Corey Lewandowski, and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino are pushing for a “broader and more aggressive approach, targeting anyone in the U.S. illegally to boost deportation numbers.”

On the other ICE Director Todd Lyons and Border Czar Tom Homan are focusing on removing “criminal aliens and those with final deportation orders.”

""ICE started off with the worst of the worst, knowing every target they are hitting, but since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,"" one senior DHS official told Fox News. ""It’s getting numbers, but at what cost?""

Chuong Dong came to the U.S. from Vietnam as a 12-year-old refugee in 1980 and received a green card shortly thereafter. He pleaded guilty to robbery for stealing two speakers as a teen, spent some time in prison and was ordered deported in 1999. But Vietnam would not take him or anyone else back as a matter of policy, so he was told to check in with ICE annually, doing so with no issue for 25 years.

This past summer, he filed a motion based on a 2017 California law allowing a conviction to be vacated if the defendant can prove they did not understand the immigration implications of their plea. But as Dong awaited a hearing in that matter, he went to his most recent check-in in August, where ICE agents took him into custody, placing him into handcuffs as he said goodbye to his wife.

“I was pretty traumatized,” Dong said Tuesday. “I was scared because I’ve been out for 26 years, never been in trouble, you know? And I don’t understand why.”

Dong was taken to the Otay Mesa Detention Center for a month and three weeks, he said, then transferred to a facility in Bakersfield, awaiting deportation.

“I came here when I was young, very young,” he said, “And I don’t have family back there, so, you know, I don’t know what to do.”

“Difficult” was how his wife Christy Huynh – an American citizen – described the months without him, breaking into tears. “I basically do everything by myself.”

Dong and Huynh work together inspecting hospital construction projects. She took on his work, paid their bills alone and fought his case.

“There’s a lot of times, like, I want to give up because I was under very, like – a lot, a lot of stress,” Huynh said. “But I just hide in some corner and then cry my stress out. Cry a whole lot and then, OK, continue: I'm not going to give up on him.”

Days after he was detained, a San Diego County judge vacated Dong’s old deportable conviction. Any other old, non-deportable convictions were vacated as well, and his immigration attorney then filed to stop his removal proceedings. On Oct. 22, they found out he was coming home with his green card restored.

“The first thing I do is hold his hand because that's what we normally do when we’re in the car driving,” Huynh said. “We were like, ‘I still can't believe this happening,’ you know? There's so much joy.”

“I’m given a second chance at life, you know, to finish what I started,” Dong said.

“We take this as a major victory in, you know, what is otherwise pretty challenging times right now for immigration,” Dong’s immigration attorney Derek Poulsen said.

Poulsen said he’s seen many others in the same position, urging anyone in a similar position to explore their pathways.

“There's a lot of people that I speak with who actually do have a way to become legal in the United States, but they're so scared from current policy and everything that they see going on in the news that they don't even look to see what their options are,” he said, adding, “To reopen that case and to get them their green card back, I mean – that’s why we do what we do.”

Dong said he was in the detention center alongside many people from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia with old convictions like him.

“The people that I was in with, everyone had a story. But it wasn’t the worst of the worst,” Dong said. “It seemed like everybody give up.”

Dong and Huynh said they got home to San Diego at around 2 a.m. and turned around at 6 a.m. to head straight back to work on the inspection of a new skilled nursing facility in La Mesa, slated to be completed by November.

“I think I make it just in time to help my wife get the project done so the patients can move in and they have a home,” Dong said.

“We didn't really have time to celebrate yet,” he continued. “Maybe this weekend we can do something. Just a small get together with family.”

But since Dong never had paperwork before to leave the country and return, Huynh said they’ve never taken a vacation, so she has bigger plans: a family trip to Europe or Asia.

“He would always say, ‘Oh, I can YouTube and see everything,’” Huynh said. “But now that thinking has changed. He says, “I would love to go with you.’”

The couple said they have spent more than $70,000 on attorneys and legal fees trying to fix his status for several years, even before he was detained – a price they said was worth every penny.

“It's like, better than winning $1 million. Better than winning a lottery,” Huynh said. ""Nothing can compare to his freedom.”

“He’s the love of my life, you know? So I would never give up on him,” she continued. “If I had to do it again, I would do it again.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/10/chuong-dong.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-31 11:22:49.950777

CHICAGO (AP) — A Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois has been accused of blocking a federal agent’s vehicle during September protests outside an immigration enforcement building in suburban Chicago, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court blocked the order before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”",https://firstamendmentwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-26T193700Z_946293913_RC2NZGAUM92W_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 23:56:45.574956

ICE officers now face a 1000% increase in assaults them including cars being used as weapons and death threats against our agents are up 8000%.","ONTARIO, Calif. (KABC) -- An ICE operation in Ontario turned violent Thursday morning after a man was shot by an ICE agent and then fled the scene. ICE said he tried to intervene in enforcement action and that's why they opened fire.

The shooting happened at around 6:30 a.m. in the 2800 block of South Vineyard Avenue.

ICE said that the man who was shot wasn't their original target.

They said they tried to conduct a traffic stop of the driver of a gray sedan when the driver of a Lexus SUV tried to intervene.

ICE said he drove up, turned around, threw his car in reverse and tried to run them over.

That's when an ICE agent opened fire, shooting out of the passenger window.

Video from AIR7 showed a sedan boxed in by an unmarked SUV and a pickup truck on South Vineyard Avenue. The street was shut down at the scene as the investigation continued, but it has reopened.

Ontario police responded to a ""request for emergency assistance"" after Department of Homeland Security officers were involved in a shooting, authorities said.

The request was made at 6:33 a.m. in the 2800 block of South Vineyard Avenue, the Ontario Police Department said in a statement, adding that its officers were not involved in the initial incident.

The location is in a residential neighborhood west of the Whispering Lakes Golf Course.

""Several Ontario Police Officers responded to the scene to provide traffic control and scene security while DHS conducted their investigation,"" the police department said in a statement. Homeland Security and the FBI were investigating the shooting.

The brother of the man who was shot spoke to Eyewitness News. He said he lives in the nearby mobile park and his brother ran in screaming that he'd been shot in the shoulder.

Police tape surrounded one of the residences on the property of the mobile home park and the Lexus SUV with a shattered window was parked near the home.

Family drove the man to the hospital where they say he's been released, but they now have no idea where he is. They also said he is a U.S. citizen.

Immigrants rights groups were furious over what happened.

""You have federal agents coming in with masked faces, and not having to identify themselves, not having to provide a warrant,"" said Javier Hernandez, the executive director for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.

""The systems that are supposed to protect us are no longer there,"" said Hernandez. ""When the Supreme Court says you can racially profile people, now you have U.S. citizens who are being racially profiled, you have here possibly a U.S. citizen that was shot today.""

Even though the man who they shot is a U.S. citizen, he was not the original target.

ICE did not provide any information on why they were conducting the vehicle stop, nor are they releasing information about the person who allegedly tried to ram them with their vehicle.

Resident Jane Westmoreland says there has been an increase in ICE sweeps in the area in recent months.

""At one time they were keeping the gates closed, and I was told by people who lived at the mobile park that they were doing that because ICE had come in without permission,"" said Westmoreland.

In a statement, ICE said in part ""This is another example of the threats our ICE officers are facing day-in and day-out as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals. ICE officers now face a 1000% increase in assaults them including cars being used as weapons and death threats against our agents are up 8000%.

""This violence must end. Let me be clear: Anyone who assaults, impedes, obstructs, or threatens the lives of federal officers will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Congresswoman Norma Torres also released a statement saying ICE has refused to provide her office with official information despite multiple requests.

""There must be a full, transparent investigation with immediate updates. As we've seen in numerous incidents over the past several months, statements from the Department cannot be taken at face value,"" the statement read.

""Witness statements, body-camera footage, security footage, and all relevant information must be released so the public can judge for themselves what really happened. Accountability is not optional; it is demanded.""",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18091364_103025-kabc-md-ontario-fed-ois-vid.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-31 00:16:55.512343

The lawmakers warned that opening these untouched coastlines to new offshore drilling would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans’ health and safety at risk, hurting people across the political spectrum.

By reversing long-standing legal protections for vulnerable coastal waters, new offshore leases would cause significant environmental damage to communities already reeling from natural disasters and recent oil spills. Oil spills not only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies, and weaken coastal infrastructure. Already, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is forced to respond to over 150 oil and chemical spills each year. One disastrous spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs, and ecosystem restoration.

These threats of expanded oil drilling come as the Administration already dismantled(link is external) NOAA’s oil spill prevention and response programs, as almost 30 percent of the team in charge of addressing oil spills has been laid off or took early retirement. The Emergency Response Division team and the oil spill program are slated to lose half their funding(link is external) from the Administration’s proposed FY 2026 budget.

“This is a matter of national consequence for coastal communities across the country, regardless of political affiliation. It puts our economies, national security, and our most vulnerable ecosystems at severe risk,” wrote the lawmakers. “… Expanded oil and gas leasing poses risks to the health and livelihoods of our constituents, jeopardizes our tourism, fishing, and recreation economies, and threatens the marine life that inhabits our coastlines.”

“The United States already leads the world in oil and gas production. The industry currently holds more than 2,000 offshore leases covering over 12 million acres of federal waters — yet fewer than 500 of those leases are actively producing oil and gas,” continued the lawmakers. “There is no justification for opening vast swaths of our oceans to leasing when existing leases remain largely unused, while imposing mounting environmental and economic costs on coastal communities.”

Additionally, the Department of Defense (DOD) previously warned that oil and gas leases in portions of the Eastern Gulf would impact areas critical to our military readiness, including for military training and testing opportunities and assets. DOD has also signaled that parts of the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Planning Areas are “not compatible with oil and gas activities and infrastructure.”

The lawmakers condemned the potential expansion of offshore drilling while the Administration simultaneously curtails offshore wind and clean energy development. This year, the Trump Administration has withdrawn(link is external) all outer continental offshore wind leases, rescinded all designated Wind Energy Areas(link is external), and eliminated $679 million(link is external) in offshore-wind-related port infrastructure funding, including over $426 million for Humboldt Bay offshore wind infrastructure.

Specifically, the lawmakers demanded that President Trump and Secretary Burgum:

Halt any steps toward new offshore oil and gas leasing in the Atlantic, Pacific, off the coast the Arctic and Bering Sea coasts of Alaska, and the Eastern Gulf.

Limit offshore drilling, consistent with previous statutory and agency protections.

Prioritize coastal resilience, including expanded storm-surge and flood protection, restoration of wetlands and sand dunes, and early-warning systems, so that communities in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, New Jersey, Alaska, and beyond are better protected.

Restore a credible pathway for offshore wind and other clean-energy projects by rescinding the OCS wind-leasing withdrawal and rescinded WEAs, enabling science-based projects that support jobs and coastal economies.

“Our coastal communities, fishermen, small business owners, Tribal Nations, tourism operators, and families cannot be sacrificed in the name of short-term drilling booms,” concluded the lawmakers. “Opening new offshore lease areas while cancelling clean energy progress is potentially illegal, a failure of leadership, and a dereliction of the public trust.”",http://pelosi.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/pelosi.house.gov/files/featured_image/Speaker%20Emerita%20Full%20Screen.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 23:56:49.008916

The admissions allocation focus on white Afrikaners expands on Trump’s commitment in an executive order this year to resettle what he described as “Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation,"" even as he paused refugee admissions.
The new refugee cap is a dramatic shift from the Biden administration's 125,000 target for refugees and a marked decline from the record low cap of 15,000 refugees in Trump's first administration.
The Trump administration in May welcomed dozens of white South Africans to the United States as part of its resettlement effort while it barred refugees from most other countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar.
""The Administration has brazenly ignored the statutory requirement to consult with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees before setting the annual refugee admissions ceiling.","The Trump administration dramatically slashed the refugee admissions cap for the new fiscal year starting this month at 7,500, the lowest on record, according to a Federal Register memo posted Thursday.

The memo, dated Sept. 30, said the admissions numbers “shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa,” a white ethnic minority group that controlled South Africa during apartheid, as well as ""other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.""

The admissions allocation focus on white Afrikaners expands on Trump’s commitment in an executive order this year to resettle what he described as “Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation,"" even as he paused refugee admissions.

The new refugee cap is a dramatic shift from the Biden administration's 125,000 target for refugees and a marked decline from the record low cap of 15,000 refugees in Trump's first administration. The notice said the new ceiling ""is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.""

The average ceiling for refugees for both Democratic and Republican administrations has historically hovered at 95,000.

The new action follows the South African-born Elon Musk's frequent criticism of the country's land ownership laws against white farmers when he was advising Trump this year in the Department of Government Efficiency.

In his criticism, Musk has highlighted the passage of President Cyril Ramaphosa's Expropriation Act, which allows the government to seize private property, at times without compensation, in certain circumstances ""for a public purpose or in the public interest.""

The Trump administration in May welcomed dozens of white South Africans to the United States as part of its resettlement effort while it barred refugees from most other countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar.

Trump’s executive order this year also ended U.S. aid to South Africa, much of which is funneled into the country’s HIV/AIDS program, accusing the South African officials of “confiscating land” from minority farmers “and treating certain classes of people very badly.”

Top Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees, including Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Alex Padilla of California, have criticized Trump for the move, saying the new cap was announced without consultation with Congress.

“This bizarre presidential determination is not only morally indefensible, it is illegal and invalid,"" they said in a statement Thursday. ""The Administration has brazenly ignored the statutory requirement to consult with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees before setting the annual refugee admissions ceiling. That process exists to ensure that decisions of such great consequence reflect our nation’s values, our humanitarian commitments, and the rule of law, not the racial preferences or political whims of any one president.""

This cap would set a historic low of refugees admitted to the U.S. since the program's inception in 1980.
This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,” he said in a video posted on Instagram.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is restricting the number of refugees admitted annually to the United States to 7,500 and they will mostly be white South Africans, a dramatic drop announced Thursday that effectively suspends America's traditional role as a haven for those fleeing war and persecution.

The move cements a major shift in policy toward refugees that aligns with the Republican administration’s broader goals of keeping out foreigners whom it deems a risk to the nation’s security or a threat to U.S. jobs. That shift has meant increased immigration enforcement, in cities and at borders and entry points, in what’s become a vastly changed landscape in a country long seen as a beacon for migrants.

No reason was given for the new numbers, which were published in a notice on the Federal Register and are a steep decrease from last year’s ceiling of 125,000 set under Democratic President Joe Biden. The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.

The notice said the admission of the 7,500 refugees during the 2026 budget year, which began Oct. 1, was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.” It made no mention of any other specific groups to be admitted besides the white South Africans, known also as Afrikaners.

""Other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands” will be considered as refugees, according to the notice, which gave no specifics on who that could entail.

The lower cap represents another blow for the long-standing refugee program that until recently enjoyed bipartisan support.

Groups denounce the historically low cap

Groups that work to resettle refugees said the announcement was an abdication of the country's historic role in welcoming refugees from around the world.

“This decision doesn’t just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, President and CEO of Global Refuge, one of the nationwide resettlement agencies. “To concentrate the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program’s purpose as well as its credibility.”

Trump suspended the refugee program on his first day in office and since then only a trickle have entered the country, mostly white South Africans. Some refugees have also been admitted as part of a court case seeking to allow entry to refugees who were overseas and in the process of coming to the U.S. when the program was suspended.

The International Refugee Assistance Project, which sued over the program's suspension, said in a statement that refugees waiting to be admitted to the U.S. have already gone through rigorous security checks and are stuck in dangerous conditions.

“By privileging Afrikaners while continuing to ban thousands of refugees who have already been vetted and approved, the administration is once again politicizing a humanitarian program,"" said the group's president, Sharif Aly.

Other nationalities, including Afghans, are left out

The administration announced the program for the Afrikaners in February, saying that white South African farmers faced discrimination and violence at home. The South African government strongly denied it.

Presidents have the authority to set the cap on refugee admissions as they see fit, often taking input from the State Department or consulting with the refugee resettlement agencies. This cap would set a historic low of refugees admitted to the U.S. since the program's inception in 1980.

During his first term, Trump progressively set the cap increasingly lower each year until it reach 15,000 in the last year of his administration.

The determinations usually lay out which regions of the world the refugees will come from over the upcoming year.

Left out from Thursday's notice were Afghans, many of whom have been trying to flee the Taliban after the U.S. withdrawal there in 2021.

A separate program for Afghans who worked closely with the U.S. government is still admitting Afghans into the country. But tens of thousands of others who also contributed to the U.S. mission there have been trying to emigrate to America via the refugee program and this year have been largely shut out.

Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, which advocates for resettling at-risk Afghans, described the decision Thursday as a “horrendous betrayal.”

“I think we need to face facts. This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,” he said in a video posted on Instagram. “This is a really bad day.”

In a supplementary declaration filed on Oct. 22, Lopez said staff have had to stop working ""almost entirely"" on other programs since ICE ramped up immigration enforcement in Oregon.

The lawsuit is ongoing with an evidentiary hearing scheduled in December.

Democrats must put the Trump administration on notice that the era of impunity will end soon — and no Supreme Court can protect them from that.","President Donald Trump keeps getting away with it. He’s survived two impeachments, multiple criminal charges (and one conviction) and several unlawful and unconstitutional actions in the first few months of his second term.

Thinking too much about that can lead to despair about the future of the country. How can we hope to repair the damage Trump is doing on a daily basis if we can’t hold him accountable?

But Trump isn’t doing these things alone. From billionaire supporters such as Elon Musk to top advisers such as Stephen Miller to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carrying out his deportations, the president is dependent on other people to carry out his agenda.

That points to a tactic that Democrats need to embrace: Put all of Trump’s happy helpers on notice. The Supreme Court may have decided that the president has broad immunity, but that’s not the case for Musk, Miller and the masked men terrorizing Chicago.

Democrats need to make it clear to every one of those underlings that they will be held accountable.

That’s why Democrats in Congress and in governors’ mansions and state legislatures need to make it clear to every one of those underlings that they will be held accountable — if not today, then one day soon.

Some Democrats realize this. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker created the Illinois Accountability Commission to document interactions between ICE agents and Chicagoans during Operation Midway Blitz and held them accountable. Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell told Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr and his staff to “get a lawyer and save your records” for a future hearing on their dealings when Democrats hope to hold the House majority in 2027.

The nation has endured a sustained shock to its democratic system. We are drowning in chaos, so much so that this week alone marks the fifth week of a government shutdown. Forty million people are at risk of losing food benefits and ICE agents are operating like Trump’s modern-day Gestapo. The abuses of power, the legal intimidation campaigns, the politicized prosecutions and the cruelty on display from immigration enforcement have piled up so relentlessly that many Americans have begun to treat the unacceptable as routine.

Authoritarian behavior has crept into everyday governance. It has been normalized. This normalization presents a profound and irreversible danger. Someone must break this trance and say what is obvious. And the only political entity with the legitimacy and structure to deliver that alarm is the Democratic Party.

Democratic senators and representatives have to create their own bullhorn of accountability — raging against not just the illiberal and unconstitutional behavior of a rogue president, but also making it very clear to everyone inside and outside the Trump administration that they will be held accountable for their actions. Period.

Democratic leadership must warn every official, every aide, every lawyer and every strategist that their decisions will not be forgotten.

Democratic leadership must directly and publicly warn every official, every aide, every lawyer and every strategist who participates in attacks on democratic institutions that their decisions will not be forgotten. Their conduct will be scrutinized. If they choose to undermine free elections, weaponize the justice system or dismantle the social contract, they will be held accountable through lawful political means.

The American people are waiting. They are looking to Democrats, expecting them to defend access to health care and a strong social safety net, yes; but also, the foundations of the republic: representative government and the rule of law. Republicans have abandoned these commitments, repeatedly promising to “fix” health care, only to repeatedly oppose expanding Medicaid and affordable coverage options, while offering no comprehensive alternative to rising medical costs or gaps in access. Republicans have also sat silently and often complicitly in the destruction of the symbols of our nation, the upending of constitutional norms, the erasure of our civil liberties and the efforts to steal congressional seats.

The question for Democratic leaders is simple: Are you ready to wage the kind of politics the moment demands? Are you prepared to impose accountability on those who would dismantle our democracy for their own gain? Are you prepared to show your fellow citizens that the days of consequence-free corruption in Washington are over?

Courts alone cannot protect our democratic institutions. A lone politician with a sharply worded letter cannot reverse institutional decay. Only a collective force, organized and relentless, can confront this assault on democracy and put accountability back on the table.

Two SUNY Upstate Medical University employees were detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Wednesday.

The men were taken into custody before entering immigration court hearings to finalize their legal status, the Civil Service Employees Association said in a release.

Both employees worked in the environmental services department at SUNY Upstate, a state-owned hospital in Syracuse. They have worked in New York state since 2022 and 2024, respectively, according to CSEA.

In a Thursday morning statement to The Daily Orange, a SUNY Upstate spokesperson said, to their knowledge, the employees had the legal authority to live and work in the U.S. and were “productive members of the community.”

“These hard-working employees are an integral part of our hospital’s Environmental Services team which we depend upon to maintain a safe environment for patient care,” the spokesperson said. “They are a respected part of the Upstate family, and we are working to support them.”

One employee is a CSEA member, while the other is represented by Upstate United University Professions.

In a Wednesday night statement to The D.O., UUP President Frederick Kowal said the union would “stand shoulder to shoulder” with its members, fighting for the right to due process.

“(The men) acted in good faith to finalize their legal status,” Kowal said. “But as we have seen over and over under the anti-immigrant regime in place in Washington D.C., they were met with handcuffs.”

In its statement, CSEA said it stands in solidarity with the workers and called the detainment of people following the legal process “unjust” and “inhumane.”

“They are part of our Upstate family, they are our co-workers, our neighbors, and valued contributors to the hospital and community,” CSEA President Mary Sullivan said in the statement. “No one should be punished for following the law. Our union members and all hospital employees deserve dignity, respect and the chance to live and work without fear.”

The reason ICE detained the employees is “unclear,” Kowal said, and they are currently being held in a federal detention facility in Batavia, awaiting potential deportation.

ICE did not immediately respond to The D.O.’s request for comment.

Durango Police Chief Brice Current requested the investigation, according to the CBI statement.

The Durango protest on Tuesday was over the earlier arrest and detention of a Colombian man, Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, and his two children. The trio was detained on their way to school. The family has an active asylum case and has been in Colorado for 18 months, according to the Durgano-based nonprofit Compañeros: Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center.

During the protest, held outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, a law enforcement officer, who CBI says appears to be a federal agent, was video recorded grabbing a woman’s phone and pushing her to the ground. The video was published by The Colorado Sun.

CBI will investigate whether there were state criminal law violations during the incident and then give the completed investigation to the 6th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said Wednesday that ICE did not inform his office about the operation to detain Jaramillo-Solano.

The current rule gives immigrants a period of 540 days for their permit to renew automatically while their documents are pending.

Now, the new process, which targets Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization, calls for stricter vetting. USCIS said the new rule is meant to ""deter fraud"" and ""detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the United States.""

“USCIS is placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting, eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow in a written statement. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended. All aliens must remember that working in the United States is a privilege, not a right.”

The USCIS is recommending that immigrants renew their work permits promptly, which includes filing for renewal 180 days before expiration.

“The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation,” USCIS said.

Any individual who filed to renew their Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization after Oct. 30 will not receive the automatic renewal. However, the new rule does not impact those who extended their permit before that date.

There are some exceptions to the new rule, according to the USCIS, which include extensions provided by law or through a Federal Register notice for TPS-related employment documentation.

A group of 20 Democratic AGs and the Governor of Kentucky obtained a preliminary injunction barring the U.S. Department of Agriculture from withholding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding during ongoing litigation over USDA's demand that states disclose information from SNAP records about applicants and recipients. USDA had notified states that it would withhold significant SNAP funds from any state that failed to comply with its data-sharing requirement.

In its order granting the preliminary injunction, the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California found that the plaintiff states had demonstrated: a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that USDA's data-sharing demand and threatened disallowance of funding violated the SNAP Act; that they were likely to incur irreparable harm if SNAP funds were withheld; and that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored injunctive relief.

We previously covered the filing of the complaint and the court's issuance of a temporary restraining order against USDA.

St. Louis County Sheriff Gordon Ramsay said agents with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Border Patrol joined members of the Lake Superior Violent Offenders Task Force during a drug bust at a Hibbing restaurant off East 18th Street and Third Avenue East just after noon.

JB Pritzker has asked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to pause federal immigration enforcement operations around Halloween, after a neighborhood raid this week disrupted a children’s parade.

“No child should be forced to inhale tear gas or other chemical agents while trick or treating in their own neighborhood,” Pritzker wrote Wednesday in a letter to Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons and Border Patrol Commissioner Matthew Scott.

In the letter, Pritzker referenced the operation earlier this week on the northwest side of Chicago in which agents deployed tear gas as children were gathering for a costume parade.

The episode prompted a warning to ICE officials from a federal judge reviewing the actions of agents taking part in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s surge of federal forces into the Chicago area, ostensibly to fight gangs.

In a Thursday news conference, Pritzker lambasted the crackdown, accusing agents of targeting innocent “Black and brown” people instead of “the worst of the worst” criminals, as Noem has previously said.

The IRS filed redacted emails and records requests as a part of the administrative record produced in a lawsuit brought by taxpayer advocacy groups including the Center for Taxpayer Rights and unions including the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO. The groups sought a preliminary injunction to halt IRS disclosure of taxpayer information to the Department of Government Efficiency.

The disclosures show IRS officials attempting to respond to a request the DOJ acknowledged was unprecedented, but also says falls within IRC Section 6103, the Tax Code provision intended to protect taxpayer information from unauthorized disclosure.

ICE requested the information pursuant to a carve-out in Section 6103 that allows information disclosures in the event an individual is under criminal investigation. This is one of several lawsuits challenging ICE’s requests for large data sets of taxpayer information at once.

The IRS responds to about 30,000 requests in a typical year. The requests have very specific rules, requiring the requesting agency provide the name, taxpayer number, and address of a person; the justification for seeking the record; and an agency head’s approval before the IRS responds.

ICE’s first request, for about 700,000 people who were under final orders of removal, came Feb. 18, according to an email from Guy Ficco, chief of the IRS’ criminal investigation division. A later email shows that information was requested by Caleb Vitello, who was acting director of ICE for several weeks.

An analysis sent back several days later by former IRS Deputy Commissioner Douglas W. O’Donnell, who has since retired, indicated the IRS “cannot provide information responsive to the request made,” citing Section 6103.

After a memorandum of understanding was signed in April, the agencies facilitated a secure large file transfer via Kiteworks. In June, ICE provided data for and requested the records of “the full alien population, which contains 7,615,279 records.” Acting IRS Chief Counsel Andrew De Mello determined there were several deficiencies and didn’t process the request.

After refinement, ICE officials came back with a set of 1,277,464 requests, sought by acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

A further request on June 27 returned just 3.7% matches; 93.7% didn’t match and 2.6% didn’t met specifications of the MOU. The IRS rejected the request if the record wasn’t at least 90 days old, according go an August 7 email from Lou Capece, coordinating director of infrastructure for the IRS.

The IRS indicated that about 47,000 records matched data in that request, depending on the date and time of the run. The messages don’t indicate how many were actually sent to ICE.

“There is no need for a press release or broad disclosure of the fact that this information is being provided and the MOU does not discuss any publicizing of the disclosure,” said Kenneth Kies, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, in the last email in the record, which is dated Aug. 7.

The plaintiffs allege the disclosures violate the Tax Reform Act, the Privacy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.

“The dangers posed by these disclosures are real, imminent threats to core privacy rights,” Maddy Gitomer, counsel for the plaintiffs said. “The administration’s ongoing rush to execute this dangerous policy will have disastrous consequences if not stopped urgently.”

The IRS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Even before the shutdown, emergency food programs nationwide widely reported that they were unable to meet the current surging demand for food.","US elites tend to have a “normalcy bias” that allows them to believe our political leaders would never take actions so reckless, and so clearly detached from reality, that they would grievously harm the country.

Many elites simply couldn’t fathom that President George W. Bush would invade a sovereign nation based on false pretenses or that President Donald Trump would incite a violent riot to try to overturn democracy.

Likewise, elites were largely in denial about the grave threat to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—formerly called the Food Stamp Program—during a showdown.

Prior to the shutdown, I warned some colleagues and elected officials that President Trump and congressional Republicans could use a shutdown as an excuse to deny up to 42 million SNAP recipients (and more than 260,000 neighborhood SNAP retailers) nationwide of $8 billion per month in grocery funds. Many assumed that I was exaggerating the threat and there was no way that our political system would allow something that disastrous to occur. But that is exactly what is playing out.

On the same day that Trump pledged to CNN that he would continue SNAP payments in November, his own Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the government wouldn’t. The next day, the USDA used its website to double down on the SNAP shutdown, using lies about immigrants and a false smear against transgender Americans in a partisan message that clearly violated the federal Hatch Act prohibition on using tax dollars for partisan purposes. Even if Trump or the GOP Congress or the Democratic attorneys general suing the government over the debacle succeed in ending the SNAP shutdown, there will still be a significant delay in the delivery of November’s SNAP benefits.

It wasn’t always this way. In the late 1960s and 1970s, prompted by Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign and widespread media coverage of the serious domestic hunger problem, a bipartisan coalition in Washington (including President Nixon, President Carter, conservative Republican Senator Robert Dole, and liberal Democratic Senator George McGovern) started the National School Breakfast Program and the Women, Infants, and Children Program for pregnant women and children under 5. Most significantly, they created the Food Stamp Program, which eventually enabled tens of millions of Americans to receive monthly benefits to help them afford groceries. Collectively, these programs worked spectacularly, almost entirely ending hunger in America.

But, starting in the 1980s, Ronald Reagan combined crushing unions and outsourcing middle-class jobs overseas with using racial dog whistles to demonize those receiving social safety net benefits. Building on the divisive but electorally successful rhetoric of George Wallace, Reagan decried “strapping young bucks” getting food stamps, and began to slash away at domestic food assistance.

The GOP intensified its racist rhetoric to undermine the social safety net during the time of the Obama administration, as Newt Gingrich called Obama the “food stamp president” and Senator Rick Santorum implied that non-white people were uniquely dependent upon food stamps (for the record, the plurality of SNAP recipients were then, and are today, white). Even the supposed moderate Republican Mitt Romney falsely accused Obama of eliminating work requirements for food stamps, which the GOP maintains are necessary into promote work for people in safety net programs even though data proves such requirements don’t increase employment and even though conservatives never impose such work requirements on programs that aid the wealthiest Americans.

The bipartisan anti-hunger coalition unraveled. In 2018, when the Paul Ryan–led US House voted to take billions of dollars’ worth of food from millions of SNAP recipients, not a single House Democrat voted for the bill, but 86 percent of House Republicans did.

Massive influxes of federal food and cash aid allotted by Democrats kept US hunger at bay during the economic recession caused by the pandemic. But after conservatives, including then–Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, allowed such assistance to expire, US hunger soared. The USDA found that the number Americans who lived in food-insecure households (meaning they were unable to afford a sufficient supply of food) jumped to 47 million people in 2023, a 40 percent increase over 2021. The number of food insecure Americans in 2023 exceeded the total populations of the states of Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and Virginia, combined.

Fully 17 percent of US children, 10 percent of employed adults, and 8 percent of older Americans lived in food-insecure households from 2021 to 2023, according to an analysis of USDA data from my organization, Hunger Free America.

The number of Americans who didn’t have enough to eat over two one-week periods increased by 55 percent between August/September 2021 and August/September 2024, according to our computation of Census Household Pulse Survey data.

Still, over this time period, many elites (even liberal ones) have celebrated the supposed overall health of the economy, ignoring that struggling Americans can’t eat a rising GDP. These same economic cheerleaders then scratched their heads when Americans voted against the Democratic administration, which they blamed (often incorrectly) for their troubles. With Trump back in the White House, advancing an openly racist agenda, it was only a matter of time before his administration took aim at the nutrition safety net.

We didn’t have to wait long. In their big ugly bill, Trump and his congressional GOP puppets slashed $186 billion out of SNAP, the deepest cut in history, citing the outrageously false charge that most SNAP spending is on “illegal aliens” and “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Not a single House or Senate Democrat voted for the bill, and of the tiny handful of GOP Members of Congress who voted against the bill, most did so because the SNAP cuts weren’t large enough. Contrary to their assertions, the vast majority of SNAP recipients harmed by the cuts are low-paid workers, children, people with disabilities, older Americans, and/or veterans. On top of all that, the Trump administration canceled more than 84 million pounds of food aid scheduled to be distributed by charities, many of which are faith-based.

Then, in an act of reality-denial fit for Noth Korea, the Trump administration ended USDA’s 27-year practice of collecting and publishing food insecurity data, citing variety of preposterous justifications for doing so. Its obvious that their real reason for eliminating this data is their desire to keep the public in the dark about how Trump’s failing tariff and other economic policies—combined with the massive food aid cuts—are causing US hunger to skyrocket even more exponentially. Obviously, the ostrich approach won’t end hunger.

Now nearly 42 million Americans nationwide may lose access to sufficient food. Not only would this create the greatest domestic hunger crises since the Great Depression; it would also wreak havoc on food retailers, perhaps even forcing some to lay off staff.

No one should be duped into thinking that charitable food programs can make up for the end of SNAP, which provides literally 10 times the dollar amount for food as does every charity in America. Even before the shutdown, emergency food programs nationwide widely reported that they were unable to meet the current surging demand for food.

The map below, complied by Hunger Free America using USDA and Census Bureau data, shows the percentage of each state’s population that relies on SNAP. In red states like Louisiana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, more than 15 percent of the population relies on SNAP. More than 10 percent of residents receive SNAP in Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Texas, South Carolina, and Missouri.

Ad Policy

Many SNAP recipients are Trump supporters and Republican voters. It’s no wonder that key GOP leaders and MAGA acolytes have starting pivoting away from lambasting SNAP to defending it as key to helping the “vulnerable,” incorrectly blaming Democrats for halting it.

So, where do we go from here?

While progressives should push governors and state legislatures to take emergency steps to ameliorate the impact of the shutdown, the only real solution is to pressure Trump and congressional Republicans to compromise with the Democrats on a plan that both reopens the federal government and prevents tens of millions of Americans from suffering from huge spikes in their healthcare premiums.

After all, if people have to spend hundreds of more dollars per month on healthcare, they will have far less to spend of food, so those premium hikes would also increase hunger. That’s why this healthcare fight is also an anti-hunger fight. We must all hang tough and win.

Beyond that, progressives should consistently and forcefully advocate for transforming our nation’s policies and programs in order to ensure an “Opportunity Society,” in which people who work hard don’t just get by but actually get ahead. We must build upon a reliance on means-tested programs aimed at mostly the impoverished in order to also focus more broadly on helping a wide array of Americans with universal programs, as well as comprehensive policies to help struggling Americans transition from owing debts and paying interest (and losing wealth) to owning assets—such as homes, small businesses, and savings—that earn interest (and accumulate wealth).

The most effective—and most political popular—policies need to restore the American dream for both the middle class and then tens of millions of American struggling to rise into the middle class. America can achieve normalcy again only when we have society that works for everyone.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1186596424.jpeg,N,,2025-10-30 21:04:08.230820

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the WRAP until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

""I think it's very problematic,"" Van Hollen told The Associated Press. ""They want to keep the public in the dark.""

The senators' letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people — sometimes for hours — on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, and six others.

The WRAP is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the WRAP's use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.

""When an organization like DHS doesn't want transparency, it's because they don't want people to know what they're doing,"" Van Hollen said, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency.

In addition to the letter, U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., told AP in a statement that she is working on a bill to rein in the agency's use of the WRAP.

""ICE's use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,"" Ramirez said.

DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the WRAP. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said that ICE's practices ""align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.""

The AP found that DHS has paid the manufacturer of the WRAP, Safe Restraints Inc., $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.

ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it's not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

In addition to reporting on ICE's use of the device, the AP identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined ""restraint"" played a role in the death.

Chanthila ""Shawn"" Souvannarath, 44, was deported on Friday, according to his attorneys, a day after a federal judge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep him in the country so that he could present what the judge called a ""substantial claim of U.S. citizenship.""

Souvannarath was born in a refugee camp in Thailand but has lived most of his life in the U.S. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the judge's order keeping him in the country ""was not served"" to ICE until after Souvannarath had been deported.

""To the media's chagrin, there was no mistake,"" McLaughlin said in a statement.

DHS and ICE did not respond to questions from The Associated Press seeking additional details on the timeline and how officials receive federal court orders.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Souvannarath, asked U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick to order his immediate return to the U.S., calling the deportation ""unlawful.""

""ICE has acted in direct opposition to a federal court order, which should disturb everyone,"" said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana.

The deportation comes as Trump administration officials have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants. There have been previous cases of U.S. citizens being deported, including U.S.-born children.

Souvannarath most recently lived in Arab, Alabama. Court records show he was granted lawful permanent residence in the U.S. before his first birthday. His father, a native of Laos, is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and Souvannarath claims his citizenship derives from that status.

Souvannarath was taken into ICE custody in June following an annual check-in with immigration authorities. Two of his five children were with him when he was detained, his wife told the AP.

McLaughlin said Souvannarath ""lost his green card"" and was ordered to be deported in 2006 following convictions for ""heinous crimes"" — assault and unlawful possession of a firearm — and ""had no right to be in this country."" It was not clear why Souvannarath was not previously taken into ICE custody.

In 2004, Souvannarath was convicted of unlawful firearm possession and assault against his then-girlfriend in King County, Washington. He had also been convicted of a misdemeanor assault against the same woman several years before, court records show.

""20 years later, he tried a Hail Mary attempt to remain in our country by claiming he was a U.S. citizen,"" McLaughlin wrote in her statement. ""I know its shocking to the media — but criminal illegal aliens lie all the time.""

Souvannarath's wife, Beatrice, described him as a hard worker and loving father who stayed out of trouble since his run-ins with the law two decades ago. He's mostly worked installing air conditioners and heaters, she said. ""He doesn't even drink,"" she said.

His wife said she received word last week that he was being deported and, days later, that he was in custody in Laos, a country he had not previously visited.

Representing himself in court, Souvannarath filed an emergency motion seeking to halt his deportation. The judge, appointed by President Barack Obama, cited the ""irreparable harm that would be caused by immediate deportation"" in issuing a temporary restraining order pausing the deportation for 14 days.

Before his deportation, Souvannarath had been detained at a newly opened ICE facility at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251030-Chanthila-Shawn-Souvannarath-rs-80d46a.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 21:04:30.870632

Nana Regional Corp. is supposed to uphold Iñupiat values. Some shareholders say its role in the president’s deportation machinery makes a mockery of that. Through several presidential administrations, the company has turned itself into a large government contractor, with its biggest revenue generator run out of an office park in a suburb of Washington, DC. Nana’s largest contracts, worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, are with the Department of Defense. But over the past decade, one of its fastest-growing lines of government business is with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Warships, Fighter Jets and the CIA – What is Trump’s Endgame in Venezuela?

For two months, the US military has been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, bombers, marines, drones and spy planes in the Caribbean Sea. It is the largest deployment there for decades. Long-range bomber planes, B-52s, have carried out “bomber attack demonstrations” off the coast of Venezuela. Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela and the world’s largest aircraft carrier is being sent to the region. The US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry “narcotics” and “narco-terrorists”, without providing evidence or details about those on board. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. They are being sold by the US as a war on drug trafficking but all the signs suggest this is really an intimidation campaign that seeks to remove Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro from power.

Sen. Mark Warner, of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told reporters at a news conference in the Capitol on Thursday that the partisan briefing was a ""new low"" for the administration.

""That is not how the system is supposed to work,"" he said.

The Trump administration has launched at least 14 strikes on vessels that it claims were involved with drug trafficking since early September. Calls for transparency into the strikes from members of Congress, including allies of Trump, have grown in recent weeks.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Democrats have “been denied essential information about these airstrikes. From everything we have been told, there are very severe questions about the legality of these strikes.”

Several Republican senators told NBC News that Democrats should have been included in the meeting.

Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said that it was ""an unfortunate situation"" that Democrats were not briefed but that he believed they would be included in future briefings.

""I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way,"" he said. ""It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis.""

Rounds also said that based on the briefing, he believes the strikes were legal.

Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., also said Democrats should have been briefed.

""I don’t think any administration should leave out any party from a briefing that level of importance,"" he said, adding, ""I think all of that should be available to people who oversee them.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of Trump’s, said that it “wouldn’t be appropriate” for Democrats not to be briefed and that “the goal is to brief everybody, not just Republicans.”

Warner said he was incensed to learn that the administration shared its legal justification for the strikes during the briefing, since Secretary of State Marco Rubio had “personally promised” him that information would be shared with the bipartisan Gang of 8, which still has not happened yet.

Asked by NBC News whether he got an explanation for why Democrats were excluded, Warner said: “We got a ham-handed ‘Oh, maybe you’re right.’ ... I say bulls---.”

The White House accused Democrats of ""pushing bogus claims about the administration’s efforts to kill narcoterrorists to distract from their decision to shut the government down and force federal employees and military servicemembers to work without pay.""

""The Department of War has held nine bipartisan briefings on narcoterrorist strikes, with additional bipartisan briefings scheduled, and individually works through requests from the Hill,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. ""It’s pathetic that these Democrats care more about running cover for foreign drug smugglers and illegal immigrants seeking taxpayer-funded health care than paying federal workers and protecting American citizens from deadly narcotics.”

Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, also said he disagrees with the premise that Democrats were left out because Democrats are “free to do whatever they want to do. They can ask for a briefing, just like we got.”

“Those of us that are on the Intelligence Committee, Republicans or Democrats, can get briefings anytime they want on these,” Risch said. “It’s not unusual for us to ask for briefings individually or as a group or, for that matter, as Republicans. Democrats do the same.”

Meanwhile, the House Armed Services Committee held a bipartisan classified briefing on the strikes Thursday. But Democratic committee member Jason Crow, of Colorado, told NBC News that Pentagon lawyers were pulled away from the briefing at the last minute, so members did not get any legal justifications for the strikes, leaving him “unsatisfied.”

Rep. Gregory Meeks, of New York, top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Thursday's briefing was “incredible for how little information was shared, how little time the briefers stayed to answer questions, and how completely absent any credible legal rationale was for the administration’s unauthorized, ongoing expansion of these strikes.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250514-capitol-building-se-1055a-fbbf98.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 21:04:12.307987

Adjust I-9 reverification tracking and HR compliance systems to avoid unintentional lapses in employment authorization.
For Employees and Individuals: File EAD renewal applications as early as possible—USCIS recommends up to 180 days before expiration.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have announced a policy change that will end the automatic extension of employment authorization documents (EADs) for certain renewal applicants. The change will take effect on October 30, 2025.

Background

Under current regulations, certain EAD renewal applicants receive an automatic extension of their work authorization for up to 540 days if they timely file a renewal application before their existing EAD expires. This policy allows applicants to continue working after the expiration of their existing EAD, for up to 540 days, while the renewal application is pending. The automatic extension terminates once USCIS approves or denies the renewal application.

What Is Changing

Under an Interim Final Rule (IFR), which will be published and take effect on October 30, 2025, this automatic extension will no longer apply. EAD renewal applicants filing on or after October 30 will no longer receive an automatic extension of employment authorization. For these applicants, if processing of the renewal extends past the expiration of their existing EAD, they will lose work authorization upon the expiration of that EAD, and need to wait for USCIS to adjudicate the renewal application and produce a new EAD before accepting or resuming employment.

The IFR indicates that this is part of DHS’s broader effort to prioritize the screening and vetting of foreign nationals. How these attempts at increased vetting will affect EAD processing times is uncertain—but an increase in processing times, coupled with the elimination of the automatic extension, would likely result in substantial disruption for employers and employees. DHS notes in the IFR that it expects EAD filing rates and processing times to decline, thus reducing the need for automatic extensions to avoid lapses in employment authorization. However, EAD renewal applications can be filed no earlier than six months before an EAD expiration, and shorter processing times have yet to materialize. According to USCIS’s own data, at present, some EAD applications take well over a year to be processed.

Who Is Affected

This change primarily affects applicants who have received EADs based on humanitarian grounds, including asylum applicants, refugees, foreign nationals granted Withholding of Removal, and certain recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), among others. The change also applies to spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders (H-4 dependents), as well as those whose EAD cards are based on pending Adjustment of Status applications, though the impact to these populations may be somewhat more limited, as explained below.

Exceptions

The change does not affect:

F-1 students applying for STEM OPT;

Spouses of L-1, E-1, E-2, and E-3 nonimmigrant visa holders (L-2S, E-1S, E-2S, and E-3S, respectively), who are authorized to work incident to status (i.e., they are authorized to work based on their status alone, even without an EAD);

Automatic extensions provided by law (e.g., certain TPS designations or automatic extensions announced through Federal Register notices);

DACA recipients, whose EADs have never been eligible for automatic extensions; or

Applicants who file EAD renewal applications before the change takes effect on October 30, 2025.

Limited Impact on Certain EAD Applicants

As a practical matter, the change will have a somewhat limited effect on:

Spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders (H-4 dependent spouses), who only benefit from the current 540-day automatic extension in limited circumstances, and only after overcoming significant logistical hurdles. That said, the change will certainly impact H-4 spouses who were previously willing and able to jump through the necessary hoops to avail themselves of the automatic extension; and

Applicants who receive an EAD based on a pending Adjustment of Status application (Form I-485). USCIS currently approves these EADs for a five-year period, and applicants generally receive their “green cards” well before an EAD needs to be renewed.

Practical Recommendations

For Employers:

Identify employees whose work authorization relies on EADs that expire after October 30, 2025, and consult with immigration counsel to determine the impact of this change (if any).

Adjust I-9 reverification tracking and HR compliance systems to avoid unintentional lapses in employment authorization.

Communicate with affected employees about renewal timing and potential employment gaps.

For Employees and Individuals:

File EAD renewal applications as early as possible—USCIS recommends up to 180 days before expiration.

Plan ahead to avoid interruptions in work authorization after October 30, 2025.

Explore alternative visa or work authorization options if continued employment is critical.

The teen said she tried to keep her diagnosis private for several months, but told ABC News she is speaking out to defend her father.
“Regardless of what you feel about immigration or the levels of immigration or the level of enforcement — those are fair debates for us to have.
Torres said despite how her father was treated, she has “nothing but love” for the federal agents who arrested her father.","(CHICAGO) — Chicago immigration judge Eva Saltzman on Thursday set a $2,000 bond for Ruben Torres-Maldonado, whose 16-year-old daughter Ofelia Torres is battling stage 4 cancer. Torres-Maldonado will be released from immigration detention as early as Thursday.

During the hearing, the judge not only ruled for him to be released, but also said he is now eligible to apply for a cancellation of removal based on the hardship his family would endure if he’s forced to leave the country. If his application is denied, he could still face deportation.

Despite the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) earlier claiming Torres-Maldonado was a “criminal illegal alien” who has a history of driving offenses, Saltzman said she had no reason to believe that he posed a risk to the public.

“I see that you have very strong family ties and community ties in the United States and that you’ve hired an attorney which shows me that you take these proceedings very seriously,” the judge said. “And I see nothing in the record that would indicate to me that you pose a danger to the community.”

Torres-Maldonado also noted during the hearing that he has a valid license and insurance.

“I wish you much luck in the future, and I wish your daughter a full recovery,” the judge said.

DHS didn’t immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment about the judge’s order.

In an interview with ABC News last week, 16-year-old Ofelia Torres recalled receiving a strange phone call on Oct. 18. She said her mom had just put on sterile gloves and was helping to drain the ascites — a buildup of fluid — in her abdomen when it came.

“The first call that came through was Walgreens, and so we just declined the call. It was probably just my medication,” Torres said. “Another call came through and it said prison slash jail and I was like ‘Why is the prison calling me?’ But in my head, I kind of knew, I think they got my dad.”

Since learning that federal immigration agents arrested Torres-Maldonado at a Home Depot in Niles, Illinois, on Oct. 18, Ofelia has made it her mission to continue fighting her stage 4 cancer diagnosis and her father’s possible deportation too.

ABC News interviewed the teen at her home in Chicago last week as part of a “Nightline” story on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement mission in the state. Dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” by the administration, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) campaign targeting undocumented people in Chicago and greater Illinois.

Torres-Maldonado is one of more than 2,800 undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it has apprehended in the Chicago area since they announced the operation in early September.

At a recent press conference, attorney Kalman Resnick, who is representing Torres-Maldonado, said federal agents surrounded his client’s vehicle, smashed the window of his truck and “dragged” him into a vehicle at gunpoint.

ICE is under the supervision of the DHS. In a statement sent to ABC News before the hearing, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin alleged that Torres-Maldonado backed into a government vehicle while attempting to flee.

“His criminal history shows he has a history of habitual driving offenses and has been charged multiple

times with driving without insurance, driving without a valid license, and speeding,” McLaughlin said.

Torres denied the government’s claims that her father is a criminal.

“I’ve gotten a parking ticket, am I a criminal?” she said. “Sometimes we break a law without even knowing, does that make us criminal? I don’t know.”

Torres was diagnosed with metastatic aviolar rhabdomyosarcoma — an aggressive form of cancer — last December. The teen said she tried to keep her diagnosis private for several months, but told ABC News she is speaking out to defend her father. She said Torres-Maldonado instilled in her a sense of gratitude for the country they call home.

“I need the world to know my dad’s story and if that means letting the world know I have cancer, so be it. I don’t care,” she said. “I need my dad.”

The immigration crackdown in Chicago has come under scrutiny from advocates and legal experts including Mark Fleming, associate director of Federal Litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center, who told ABC News that many of the arrests and detainments have been unlawful.

So far, the human rights organization National Immigrant Justice Center has presented over 800 cases that they claim were unlawful under a consent decree — a court-ordered agreement between parties that resolves a dispute — limiting DHS’ ability to hold someone who entered into the country unlawfully without a bond hearing.

Fleming told ABC News the organization has 280 more cases that his legal team will soon present before a judge.

“It’s truly unprecedented. We are lead counsel in a class action lawsuit that has a consent decree that dictates when and how DHS, Department of Homeland Security, whether it’s Border Patrol or Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, can stop and arrest people without warrants,” Fleming said.

“Regardless of what you feel about immigration or the levels of immigration or the level of enforcement — those are fair debates for us to have. What is deeply troubling here is the lawlessness, the violence, the cruelty, the carelessness with which they are doing this operation,” he later added.

Torres said despite how her father was treated, she has “nothing but love” for the federal agents who arrested her father.

“That’s all I have for everyone in this world. Love in my heart,” she said. “To the ICE agents who smashed my dad’s window, to the ICE agent who pointed a gun at my dad, I’m not mad at you … I just want you to know that that was not the right thing to do.”

What we know:

The incident happened just after 6:30 a.m. in the 2800 block of South Vineyard Avenue as ICE officers were attempting to conduct a traffic stop.

According to Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, an unknown individual, who was not the target, pulled up in a vehicle in front of the officers. Officers ordered the driver to leave the scene, but as the driver began to pull away, the car stopped and attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping, McLaughlin said in a statement. An ICE officer then fired defensive shots at the vehicle. The driver fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle, McLaughlin added.

The family of the man involved in the shooting identified him only as 24-year-old Carlos. Family spokesperson, Javier Hernandez, with the Inland Coalition of Immigrant Justice, said the man stopped his Lexus when he saw federal agents stopping a dark-colored Honda on Vineyard Avenue.

Carlos' family said he was shot in the shoulder, and they immediately drove him to a nearby hospital with federal agents behind them.

""We do know he was released from the hospital but the family doesn't know where he is at, they believe he is in custody of the federal government,"" Hernandez said. ""He was someone being basically surrounded by armed men with masks so he decided to see what was going on.""

The man in the vehicle that was originally stopped during the traffic stop was not injured in the shooting. He was taken into custody by agents. It's unclear why he was stopped.

In targeting Kat Abughazaleh, a progressive candidate for Congress in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, the DOJ’s new case raises stark constitutional and electoral concerns, as opposition to President Donald’s Trump aggressive immigration raids in Chicago has become a central issue in her campaign.

In a statement, Abughazaleh described the charges against her and others as a “political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment.”

“This case is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks against them. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges,” she said.

The grand jury indictment against Abughazaleh comes after federal agents have already arrested or detained multiple Democratic officials, including Sen. Alex Padilla (Calif.) and Rep. Lamonica McIver (N.J.), who participated in oversight efforts on or demonstrations against Trump’s large-scale mass deportation program.

Alongside Abughazaleh, the DOJ indicted a Democratic candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman, a municipal board member and two other people.

The indictment alleged that they conspired to impede a federal officer by being among a group of people who surrounded a government vehicle outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility last month in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

A video accompanying the indictment showed a large group of people in front of and around a black SUV outside of the Broadview ICE facility. Members of the group threw stuffed animals at the vehicle and pounded on its windows while shouting chants.

The DOJ alleged that by participating in the demonstration, Abughazaleh and the five others attempted to “prevent by force, intimidation, and threat” a federal agent “from discharging the duties of his office, and to injure him in his person or property.”

All six were charged with conspiracy to impede a law enforcement officer and individual counts of impeding a law enforcement officer. If convicted, they could face several years in prison and large fines.

The indictment was also revealed days after senior White House and DOJ officials vowed to go after those who attempt to hold federal immigration agents accountable.

Trump officials made the threats largely in response to federal, state and local Democrats in several states announcing new initiatives to document — and potentially prosecute — federal agents who commit misconduct during immigration operations.

The elected Democrats recently threatened by Trump officials with prosecution or investigation over the ICE accountability efforts include former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Bob Bonta, the California attorney general.

Democrats around the country have announced accountability initiatives after countless videos this year — including some promoted by the federal government — have shown federal agents using aggressive tactics in carrying out Trump’s deportation agenda or cracking down on people protesting it.

In Chicago specifically, agents have been seen grabbing people by the throat, indiscriminately deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods, conducting mass raids on apartment complexes and shooting journalists and clergy members in the head with less-than-lethal projectiles.

Pritzker last week announced an independent commission that will create a public record of unlawful actions committed by federal agents in the state while also documenting the effects of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration raids around Chicago.

Legal experts have noted that while citizens and elected officials have a constitutional right to document any potential misconduct by federal officers, prosecuting agents for state law violations is complicated because of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241649940-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 18:01:02.464889

But a section in the Internal Revenue Code, known as 6103, heavily limits taxpayer data sharing, except in specific circumstances. The exceptions include when the information is necessary for a non-tax federal criminal investigation or proceeding in which the United States or a federal agency is a party, and the agency has obtained approval from a court or a federal agency head. And the IRS generally bars agencies from accessing individual taxpayer return information

Douglas O’Donnell, the IRS’s then-acting commissioner, and other agency officials questioned the legality of ICE’s effort under 6103 during the project’s infancy in late February, following a legal analysis from the IRS’s Office of the Chief Counsel and Treasury’s Office of the General Counsel, the emails show.

“Our current understanding,” the analysis reads, “is that ICE’s request does not relate to a criminal investigation, because removal proceedings are generally civil in nature.”

“We cannot provide information responsive to the request made,” O’Donnell wrote in an email to another Treasury official.

Weeks later, Caleb Vitello, the acting director of ICE, asked the IRS to provide “all possible information” on “700 thousand criminal illegal aliens who have standing deportation orders.” The request included known home addresses, employers’ information, relatives, bank names, IP information, and Social Security or taxpayer identification numbers.

ICE spent weeks asking for this data, even as IRS staffers mulled over the legality and practicality of the information exchange, the records show.

O’Donnell, a 38-year veteran of the IRS, abruptly retired in February.

The immigration enforcement agency eventually found a workaround: It could slap a federal criminal penalty for failure to leave the country on the undocumented immigrants to spur a criminal investigation and get Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to sign off on the data sharing effort.

And they could tighten the scope of their data probe to only seek names, addresses and other qualifying information within a taxable period.

Bessent and Noem signed a memorandum of understanding in April, and the data was transferred through a system called Kiteworks this summer. Shortly after, acting IRS Commissioner Melanie Krause, who had replaced O’Donnell, accepted a deferred resignation offer.

The IRS and ICE — which continued to squabble over the minutiae of section 6103 over the summer — contend they’ve worked out the kinks, though it is unclear from the latest emails alone if that’s true.

Over 40 drivers had been issued Commercial Drivers Licenses. The tops states that issued these Commercial Drivers Licenses to the illegal aliens were Illinois, California, and New York. Some of the Commercial Drivers Licenses of illegal aliens arrested in the operation are below:

“Far too many innocent Americans have been killed by illegal aliens driving semi-trucks and big rigs. And yet, sanctuary states around the country have been issuing illegal aliens commercial driver’s licenses. The Trump Administration is ending the chaos,” said Secretary Noem. “Thanks to President Trump, Operation Midway Blitz has already removed over 140 illegal alien truck drivers in Indiana. The brave men and women of ICE and the Indiana State Police are working nonstop to get criminal illegal aliens out of our communities and off our roads.""

“Indiana is the Crossroads of America, and that’s something we’re proud of — but it also means we must stay vigilant about those using our interstates for crime and thus endangering our communities,” said Governor Mike Braun. “The safety of our state is our top priority, and we’ll keep working with our federal partners to keep Hoosiers — and Americans — safe.”

“ICE launched operation Midway Blitz to remove illegal alien threats to public safety, which is exactly what we have done in Chicago. We recognized from the start that this must include protecting roadways carrying interstate traffic and cargo. Sanctuary policies like those in Illinois sadly don’t recognize borders, and ICE and the Indiana State Police have successfully arrested hundreds of illegal alien truck drivers who should not be operating on our highways,"" said ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons. ""In recent weeks, we have seen illegal semi-truck drivers responsible for significant loss of life across the country. This was preventable, and that is precisely why we are working to ensure this doesn’t happen in Indiana or Illinois.”

“This operation wouldn’t have been as successful as it was without our strong 287(g) partnership with the Indiana State Police. Protecting communities from criminal illegal aliens also includes those posing safety threats on our interstates,"" said ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan. ""When cities and states partner with us, communities are safer, and as this operation has proven, our efforts in Indiana extend protection to those living in the sanctuary state of Illinois as well.”

In recent months, we’ve seen a disturbing pattern of criminal illegal aliens driving commercial vehicles on American roads, directly threatening public safety and resulting in senseless loss of life.

In August, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for a criminal illegal alien—Harjinder Singh— following his arrest for three counts of vehicular homicide while driving a semi-truck in Florida.

Last week, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for a criminal illegal alien—Jashanpreet Singh—who killed three people in California while driving an 18-wheeler under the influence.

The Trump administration is changing the criteria for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, a student debt cancellation program for Americans who spend part of their career working for a nonprofit, among other qualified roles.

""I would appreciate your cooperation and confirmation that federal agents will stand down from any actions that could endanger or harm perfectly innocent children in our communities during this Halloween weekend.

They highlighted the trauma and toll that the intensified immigration enforcement has had on not only immigrant communities but every community across the state.","The day before Halloween, Gov. JB Pritzker urged the President Donald Trump administration to suspend its immigration enforcement operations this weekend so families and children can stay safe while celebrating the holiday.

Speaking from Springfield, Pritzker said he sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem asking them to pause all federal agent operations for the entirety of the Halloween weekend. Halloween is Friday, followed by Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) on Saturday and Sunday. The latter honors friends and family members who’ve passed away.

“I’m asking for basic human decency. I think their response will be revealing. They’ve disrupted everything for more than two months already. Give the children and the families of Illinois a break, Donald Trump and Kristi Noem,” Pritzker said. “This is about something other than you just causing mayhem on our streets and visiting cruelty upon our people.”

For nearly two months, DHS — which oversees federal agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) — has been carrying out its so-called “Operation Midway Blitz” throughout the Chicagoland area. The operation, according to Noem, is supposed to be targeting the “worst of the worst.”

However, Pritzker said today that’s not what’s happening across the state, and it’s far from the expressed goals of federal immigration authorities. He also noted that the militarized immigration enforcement is happening at “a pace and scale that is wider and more intense than in previous weeks.”

“They have targeted families and children, burrito vendors, landscapers, delivery drivers, nannies, U.S. citizens, legal residents and longtime Chicagoans, people who have never broken the law,” Pritzker said.

During an interview on Thursday with Fox News, Noem was asked if she would pause immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. In response, Noem said she wouldn’t be altering immigration enforcement operations this weekend.

“No, we’re going to be out on the streets in full force and increase our activities to make sure kids are safe. Every day in Chicago, we’re arresting murderers, child pedophiles, those who have perpetuated assault and pornography against children,” Noem said. “We’re going to be out there to make sure that they can be safe, enjoy the holiday, spend some time with their families, their neighbors and their communities, and they don’t have to be the victim of a crime because of these illegal aliens that are in our country, victimizing them.”

Earlier this month, DHS said it arrested more than 1,000 people since it started “Operation Midway Blitz” in September. The TRiiBE hasn’t verified those numbers; with the magnitude and sporadic tactics of detainments, it is challenging to track the number of people who have been taken and where exactly they have been taken to.

During today’s press conference, Pritzker highlighted multiple instances of what he refers to as the Trump administration’s “unlawful behavior and abuses of power.” On Oct. 25, federal agents tear-gassed residents in Old Irving Park who were there documenting enforcement actions. In total, three people were detained by federal agents, and two were U.S. citizens.

An annual children’s costume party in Old Irving Park was scheduled to take place on Oct. 25, but the parade was interrupted and later canceled, Pritzker said.

“This year, the parade was interrupted and then canceled, not because of rain, but because of tear gas. Federal agents swarmed into the neighborhood, not with a criminal target in their sights, but just because Old Irving Park was the next neighborhood on their list to terrorize,” Pritzker said.

Last Saturday was the fourth day in a row that federal agents deployed tear gas. They did so in Cicero, Little Village and in Lakeview, as well.

During his remarks, Pritzker also called out CBP Commander Gregory Bovino and said the operation has “sown fear, division and chaos.”

“If you are unwilling to cease operations and leave our city, can we at least agree that our children should not be victims, especially on Halloween?” Pritzker said. Can we agree that there is no imminent threat that should disrupt their holiday? No child in America should have to go trick-or-treating in fear that they might be confronted with armed federal agents and have to inhale tear gas. I honestly can’t even believe that I have to make this plea. This is not the America that I know. I ask you to restore some sanity for the sake of our children.”

This week, Bovino was called to testify in federal court about a video showing him throwing tear gas in Little Village, as well as other alleged violations of a temporary restraining order that U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued.

Also at the press conference were Illinois State Representative Norma Hernandez (D-77), Latino Policy Forum president and CEO Linda Xóchitl Tortolero, Principal of Lords Park Elementary School in Elgin Noe Velazquez, and a representative from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. They highlighted the trauma and toll that the intensified immigration enforcement has had on not only immigrant communities but every community across the state.

“These actions are not just traumatizing, but they are destabilizing our economy, hurting small businesses and even impacting school attendance and fear is not a policy solution,” Hernandez said. “Trauma is not public safety, and no level of government, local, state or federal, should be allowed to terrorize the very people they’re supposed to serve.”

Hernandez added that rapid responders, legal observers, journalists, elected officials and other volunteers are being arrested when they document federal agents’ misconduct and illegal tactics.

On Wednesday, half a dozen Chicago-area political figures were named in a felony indictment and are being charged with felony impeding and impeding conspiracy charges. The charges stem from a Sept. 26 protest outside the ICE processing center in Broadview. The six people include Democratic Illinois 9th District congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, Cook County Democratic committeeman Michael Rabbitt and Chicago Ald. Andre Vasquez’s Chief of Staff Catherine Sharp.

“They are getting more aggressive, more violent and attacking more people who pose no threat to them,” Hernandez said.",https://media.thetriibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30114854/Halloween-in-Hyde-Park-x-Ash-Lane-x-Oct-31-2024_42-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 18:01:05.624974

Many have been in the United States for years and have established deep roots in their communities.
Throwing such people out is a disservice to them, but also to the nation, Archbishop Wenski suggested.
“Home is here,” Archbishop Wenski said.
“The Biden administration gave humanitarian visas to about half a million people from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba,” Archbishop Wenski said.","Miami’s Archbishop Thomas Wenski understands in his bones the plight of today’s immigrants. He can draw on his own experience as the child of a Polish immigrant with family roots in the immigrant stronghold of Detroit as well as his unique perspective as a pastoral leader in a part of the country that has been powerfully redefined by the immigrant experience.

In an online forum sponsored by Jesuit Refugee Service USA on Oct. 28, Archbishop Wenski recalled how unwelcome Haitian immigrants had initially been in South Florida and when Cuban immigrants fell from grace following the infamous Mariel Boatlift in 1980.

“What the ’80s taught me…was that immigration was not a threat, but an opportunity because certainly South Florida, especially Miami, has benefited tremendously from immigration,” he said in a conversation with Don Kerwin, JRS vice president.

American dreamers

Like other immigrant groups that came to the United States, the Haitians and Cubans arriving in Miami, he said, were standouts in their homelands, people ready to work hard for their piece of the American dream. In their time, they contributed mightily to the transformation of South Florida—and now their children and grandchildren hold up the region’s health care, real estate and hospitality industries, pursuing advanced degrees and professions their immigrant parents and grandparents could only have dreamed about.

He sees many examples of immigrant success stories in these families. “You could say that immigrants in general—and this has been my experience with Haitians—are almost driven to succeed because they’re risk takers, they’re the decision makers,” Archbishop Wenski said.

“They decided, ‘I can’t take this anymore in Haiti,’ and they took the risk,” he said.

“And this American society of ours rewards people that can make decisions and take risks. So the Haitians, like other immigrant groups, have taken advantage of the opportunities that are provided by America and by freedom to succeed here.”

What a terrible mistake it would be to thwart a process that has been instrumental in the American success story, he suggested. “Originally they were going after the worst of the worst, but the numbers weren’t high enough,” Archbishop Wenski said of the Trump administration’s clampdown, “so they started picking up people that were sitting in the back of a pickup truck as they were leaving lawns that they were cutting in the suburbs.”

“We have to press Congress to change the laws, but we also have to approach the president” and tell him “that he should take a victory lap for having controlled the border” and removing the “worst of the worst” from U.S. communities, he said. Now, the president, he said, has the opportunity to “pivot” from a deportation campaign that has been sowing chaos and anxiety across the country.

There are signs that the Trump administration may be far from the reversal that the archbishop seeks. On Oct. 28, top leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices were abruptly deposed, replaced in many instances by Customs and Border Protection staff in a major shake-up that analysts said would mean even more aggressive deportation tactics. In May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told Fox News the Trump administration’s hope is to make “a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day” with an annual goal of 1 million deportations.

That plan will only frustrate the administration’s other goals, Archbishop Wenski warned.

“The president has always said that he wants to have the biggest economy ever,” he said. “If you’re gonna have the biggest economy ever in the United States, you’re not going to do it without the labor force participation of the migrants.”

Catholics: Remember who you are, where you come from

According to Pew Research, more than 14 million people with irregular status are resident in the United States, the numbers spiking sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic. Pew researchers say a record 7.5 million U.S. households included unauthorized immigrants in 2023.

Almost 70 percent of these households are considered “mixed status,” meaning that they also contain U.S.-born residents or lawful immigrants. Most of the U.S.-born residents are children of unauthorized immigrants, Pew reports.

Over decades of inaction on immigration reform, the issue of residency has become muddled for generations of immigrants. Cut off from legal immigration channels by laws that have not adapted to changing conditions, millions have indeed been arriving irregularly. Many have been in the United States for years and have established deep roots in their communities. Throwing such people out is a disservice to them, but also to the nation, Archbishop Wenski suggested.

“Home is here,” Archbishop Wenski said. “There’s no ‘home’ [for deportees] to go back to, and that’s really where the inhumanity of a mass deportation comes up, because after being here all these years, you start forging connections with this host country: You get married; you have kids; you might have kids that are American citizens; you have a spouse that may be a legal permanent resident or American citizen. And all this is going to be thrown into chaos because of [our] antiquated laws.”

And many flippantly described as “illegal” by media commentators and actors in the Trump administration are nothing of the sort, Archbishop Wenski said. They have been residing and working in the United States under humanitarian parole, Temporary Protected Status or while asylum claims or residency applications have slowly made their way through an overwhelmed system.

“The Biden administration gave humanitarian visas to about half a million people from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba,” Archbishop Wenski said. “You could argue about whether that was a smart move or not, but half a million people came here. They were sponsored by somebody in the United States. They had to pay their own transportation here, and they got work permits for two years.”

“Now, the administration is saying that [when] the two years are up; they’re not going to renew [protected status]. They’re going to have to go back. But none of those people were ever a day illegally here in this country.”

And how, he wonders, can any American seriously suggest returning those who have been legitimately offered a refuge in the United States to the chaos and oppression of the failing nations they have fled? “They’ve continued to deport people to Haiti, which is a stateless country right now,” the archbishop said. “They’re deporting people to Cuba, which is in an economic crisis, besides the politics of the whole place, and Nicaragua, which is a country that has deported priests and religious sisters and clamped down on the church there, a very repressive country.”

“They want to deport people there; it doesn’t make sense.”

The U.S. church should continue to keep the issue of comprehensive immigration reform and steps toward rationalizing immigration policy before the U.S. public and its political leadership, Archbishop Wenski said. He urged Congress to reassert its authority over immigration policy and finally address the inadequacies created by decades of inattention.

Simply harmonizing the immigration registry, last updated in 1986 with a cut-off date of Jan. 1, 1972, to current realities could address the status of the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants, he said. He recalled that his own father was able to formalize his residency in the United States through the registry when it was updated in 1929.

It is “Congress that makes the law, and Congress should change the laws,” he said. “We need to focus on Congress to address this issue because every time Congress had an opportunity to do something about immigration over the past 20, 25 years, they always decided to kick the can down the road when the pressure was taken off of them.”

He reminded contemporary Catholics that the history of the American church is intrinsically bound with the continuing phenomenon of immigration. Catholics “should remember where we come from,” he said, “who we are.”

There are few Catholics in this country that are not “maybe a generation removed from the immigration experience,” he said. Noting a surge of neo-nativist ideology and rhetoric, he added, “Catholics have to be careful that they’re not swept up by people who are masking their anti-Catholicism with an anti-immigration stance.”

In a presidential document published on Thursday but dated September 30, the Trump administration indicated that the US refugee system would remain largely closed to the millions of people around the world fleeing unsafe conditions.

Instead, priority for the 7,500 available slots would be given to white Afrikaners from South Africa.

“The admissions numbers shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa pursuant to Executive Order 14204 and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands,” the document said.

Trump has repeatedly said white South Africans are being persecuted in the Black-majority country, a claim rejected by South Africa’s government and top Afrikaner officials.

Thursday’s filings also indicated that the Trump administration would narrow the groups that handle refugee services moving forward.

Refugee resettlement grants and contracts that currently go to an array of public and private organisations will instead be rerouted to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.

“The transfer ensures better alignment of resources, oversight, and accountability [of] resettlement activities that take place entirely within the United States,” a separate declaration said.

Trump’s refugee cap is the lowest since Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980, which codified a formal process for admitting and relocating refugees to the US.

Since then, at least two million refugees have arrived through the US Refugee Admissions Program or USRAP. Trump sought to suspend the programme upon taking office, prompting a successful legal challenge from immigrant rights groups.

Thursday’s cap of 7,500 is only a fraction of the 125,000 refugees allowed to enter under former President Joe Biden during his final year in office. The new, lower cap is set to last from October 2025 through September 2026.

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently 42.7 million refugees globally.

The US Refugee Act allows presidents to set a cap on the number of annual refugee admissions, but there is no bottom limit. That has long sparked concerns that Trump, who slashed admissions during his first term, could effectively grind USRAP to a halt.

‘Downfall for a crown jewel’

In a post on the social media platform X, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noted that Trump’s declaration appeared to shift the definition of whom Washington considers to be a refugee.

“Trump’s new refugee determination appears to call for admitting refugees who wouldn’t meet the definition of refugee — someone who faces persecution (not ‘discrimination’) on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” he wrote.

He added that, for decades, the US refugee programme has admitted “people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors”.

“Now it will be used as a pathway for White immigration,” he said. “What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”

The International Refugee Assistance Project, meanwhile, said that Trump did not appear to follow the required congressional consultation process before announcing the cap. The group dismissed the move as baldly political.

“Today’s announcement highlights just how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world,” the organisation’s president, Sharif Aly, said in a statement.

“America’s refugee program was built to reflect our values, and the thousands of individuals we’ve closed our doors to represent thousands of missed opportunities of people who could have strengthened a local community or economy,” the statement said.

Trump’s declaration did not give a reason for the massive cut in refugee admissions, saying only that the number was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.

The US president has led a massive crackdown on all forms of immigration since taking office, but some advocates had hoped that the refugee programme — which historically had broad bipartisan support — might be spared.

The cross-aisle support has been buoyed in recent years by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, with many politicians supporting pathways to immigration for Afghans who worked alongside the US military or allied forces and companies.

Many Afghans have relied on the refugee programme while other specialised immigration programmes remain constricted or backlogged.

Since taking office for a second term, Trump, however, has focused heavily on white Afrikaners. In February, for instance, Trump issued Executive Order 14204 to cut aid to South Africa, on the basis that it demonstrated “shocking disregard” for Afrikaners.

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today released new statistics on violent threats against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) law enforcement officers who are now facing an 8,000% increase in death threats against them.

“Our ICE law enforcement is now facing an 8,000% increase in death threats against them while they risk their lives every single day to remove the worst of the worst,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “From bounties placed on their heads for their murders, threats to their families, stalking, and doxxing online, our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence and threats against them and their families. Make no mistake, sanctuary politicians are contributing to the surge in violent threats and assaults of our officers through their repeated vilification and demonization tactics, including gross comparisons to the Nazi Gestapo. This violence against law enforcement must end.”

Disturbingly, in recent days, ICE officers’ family members have been doxed and threatened, and had bounties placed on their heads for their murders. Below are a handful of violent threats made against ICE law enforcement officers recently:

Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the arrest of Eduardo Aguilar, an illegal alien from Mexico residing in Dallas, Texas, after he posted on TikTok in Spanish soliciting the murder of ICE agents. Aguilar’s post from October 9, 2025, called for “10 dudes in Dallas with determination who aren’t afraid to [two skull emojis],” and offered “10K for each ICE agent.”

In Texas, an ICE officer’s spouse received a call saying, “I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F*** you, f*** your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F*** you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family.”

A separate voicemail left on an ICE employee’s phone was also discovered this month, where a caller states, “I hope every one of those lawless c**** you call ICE officers gets doxxed one by one.”

On October 24, 2025, ICE also became aware of a potential officer safety threat based on a Facebook post from a man named James Adrian Warren. On October 22, 2025, the individual shared posts that threatened ICE officers. The post specifically targets the Ferndale, Washington ICE office and he calls ICE “Nazi’s” and “The Gestapo.” The man also says he will begin observing, tailing, recording and reporting ICE employees to “make life harder for ICE here in Whatcom County.”

Operation Midway Blitz was launched in honor of Katie Abraham, who was killed in a drunk driving hit-and-run car wreck caused by criminal illegal alien Julio Cucul-Bol.

While there is bipartisan support for standalone bills that would fund SNAP through the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.)
The judge has handled several high-profile disputes since President Donald Trump was sworn in to a second term in January.","Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states sued the Trump administration earlier this week over its decision not to tap emergency funds for SNAP.

“Because of USDA’s actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,” state officials wrote in the lawsuit. “Worse still, USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits.”

The Trump administration has insisted that the contingency fund is reserved for emergencies such as natural disasters and does not have enough money to supply the roughly $8 billion needed for benefits next month.

Partially funding SNAP would be “disastrous,” Jason Altabet, the Justice Department’s lawyer, argued Thursday. States would have to figure out how to administer partial benefits — potentially just to turn around and begin administering full benefits should Congress reach a government funding deal, he added.

But Talwani challenged that argument, saying she believed Congress’ intention in setting aside emergency funds for the program was to “protect the American people.”

Even if Congress agrees on a funding patch for the program, logistical and administrative delays will likely prevent the money from flowing immediately. While there is bipartisan support for standalone bills that would fund SNAP through the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has said he won’t bring them to a floor vote — an attempt to keep pressure high on Democrats for a full reopening of the government.

Without SNAP, food banks and other emergency feeding organizations have said they are unprepared to bridge the gap. Officials in states like Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, Hawaii and Minnesota have announced plans to tap state and local funds to provide food aid and assist food banks in the interim.

Talwani acknowledged Thursday that, “absent a 100 percent win” for the plaintiffs, millions of SNAP recipients would lose their benefits on Nov. 1.

The judge has handled several high-profile disputes since President Donald Trump was sworn in to a second term in January.

In April, Talwani blocked a Trump administration effort to strip more than half a million Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan immigrants of immigration parole status granted during the Biden administration. The Supreme Court halted her order the next month, without explanation.

In July, Talwani blocked enforcement of a provision in a Trump-backed budget law that sought to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood. She said the move unconstitutionally targeted the organization. However, last month, an appeals court stayed her ruling, allowing the administration to enforce the funding ban for now.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd3%2F2e%2Fc01b881a43d69e0fd76c6cf91555%2Fgovernment-shutdown-food-aid-78738.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 15:56:54.356088

The change marks a substantial shift from the Biden administration’s EAD policy, which allowed many renewal applicants to continue working for up to 540 days after the expiration of the permit while their renewal application was pending with USCIS.
Employers and authorized workers must note that, under the new rules, merely filing a timely renewal application is no longer sufficient in some categories to continue working after the card’s expiration date.
An authorized worker’s EAD renewal application must first be approved by USCIS to be actually extended or renewed.
“It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended,” Director Edlow explained in the USCIS’s announcement.","DHS this week announced an interim final rule (IFR) that will end its policy of automatically extending employment authorization documents (EADs – work permits) for certain renewal applicants. The change marks a substantial shift from the Biden administration’s EAD policy, which allowed many renewal applicants to continue working for up to 540 days after the expiration of the permit while their renewal application was pending with USCIS.

Some exceptions to this policy still apply. For example, automatic extension provisions tied to certain statutory requirements or Federal Register notices (such as those for Temporary Protected Status‐based EADs) may remain in force.

Employers and authorized workers must note that, under the new rules, merely filing a timely renewal application is no longer sufficient in some categories to continue working after the card’s expiration date. An authorized worker’s EAD renewal application must first be approved by USCIS to be actually extended or renewed. Employers must terminate the employment of workers whose EADs expire while renewals are pending.

USCIS emphasized that by requiring a full adjudication before extending work authorization or renewing the document, the agency is “placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting … [and] Eliminating policies … that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security.”

Immigration Enforcement Implications

This regulation change may allow the Trump administration to more quickly enforce immigration laws, particularly with regard to those who entered the United States illegally but were given work permits via grants of parole or have received some form of prosecutorial discretion, like deferred action.

Aliens in other categories who become removable may also face more exposure to immigration officers if their EADs expire. While this policy change by itself does not create any new enforcement authorities, it removes a bureaucratic buffer that previously gave tens of thousands of aliens cover while their renewal applications were pending before USCIS. Their records, if their EAD validity period lapses, will show as “unauthorized” in DHS systems (such as SAVE, E-Verify, PCQS, and related systems) earlier and ICE will have fewer administrative obstacles in initiating or executing removals.

Categories – especially parole-based or deferred action EADs – could also now lose their protection from enforcement more quickly if USCIS does not automatically renew their EAD and decides to deny a renewal application, which has always been subject to USCIS discretion. When employment authorization lapses, it can also trigger status reviews or end discretionary parole or deferred action, especially if the status depends on continuing EAD eligibility. That, in turn, may allow DHS to issue Notices to Appear (NTAs) sooner given current U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) goals.

USCIS Director Joseph Edlow explained that the agency is rescinding the Biden administration’s automatic EAD renewal policy to allow the agency to properly verify the applicants’ eligibility and confirm the absence of fraud or other security concerns. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended,” Director Edlow explained in the USCIS’s announcement. Moreover, the rule’s Federal Register notice explained:

The automatic extension of the validity of an EAD grants the benefit of extending an alien’s expired EAD and/or employment authorization merely by filing a timely renewal EAD application and without first completing adjudicative review and related vetting, including resolution of derogatory information identified during the vetting process. That is, it grants the benefit without an eligibility determination; without completing vetting and screening checks; without resolving potential hits of derogatory information; and, when applicable, without a determination that the employment authorization should be granted in the exercise of discretion. Without this IFR, aliens could still obtain an automatic extension despite derogatory information that could flag them as a national security or public safety risk. As described above, vetting and screening might not be completed and derogatory information reviewed and resolved before the alien’s EAD expires. The automatic extension, therefore, poses a security vulnerability that could allow bad actors to continue to work and generate income to potentially finance nefarious activities that pose an imminent threat to the American public. Granting benefits without proper vetting and full adjudication is contrary to the mission of DHS and poses a threat to the safety and security of the American people.

In its press release, USCIS recommended that eligible aliens seeking a timely renewal of their EAD should properly file a renewal application early, up to 180 days before their EAD expires. “The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation.”

What Was in Place Before the IFR

The IFR was issued to repeal the December 2024 regulation, issued under the Biden administration, that increased the automatic extension period for certain employment authorization document renewal applicants for both employment authorization (for aliens who are authorized incident to status) and EADs (for aliens who must apply for work authorization documents) from up to 180 days to up to 540 days from the expiration date stated on expiring Form I-766 if they have a timely filed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. As a result of that 2024 rulemaking, the 540-day automatic extension became available to:

Asylum applicants and grantees;

Refugees;

Parents or dependent children of lawful permanent residents (green card holders);

Aliens who have applied for, and aliens who have been granted, withholding of removal;

Certain TPS applicants;

TPS recipients;

Spouses of E-1/2/3 nonimmigrant visa holders;

Spouses of L-1 nonimmigrant visa holders; certain aliens who have filed lawful permanent resident (green card) applications;

Aliens who have filed applications for suspension of deportation, cancellation of removal, or special rule cancellation of removal; aliens who have filed applications for creation of record of lawful admission for permanent residence;

Aliens who have filed applications to legalize under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA);

Alien spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders; and

Aliens who are the principal beneficiaries or derivative children of approved VAWA self-petitioners.

The Biden administration’s stated justification for codifying the automatic extension as a regulation in 2024 was to address USCIS’s inability to keep up with its workload (indefinitely, rather than on an as-needed basis, which the agency had done previously in the form of issuing temporary rules). In addition to financial shortfalls caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and litigation, the Biden administration’s border policies, historic expansion of TPS, and abuse of parole played a significant role in limiting the agency’s ability to manage its finances and adjudicative capacity in recent years. These policies created “[a]n additional contributing factor… a substantial and sustained increase in initial and renewal EAD applications which significantly increased renewal EAD processing times.”

The agency stated then that processing times “increased to such a level that the 180-day automatic extension for certain pending renewal EAD applications under 8 CFR 274a.13(d) was insufficient to prevent many renewal applicants from experiencing a lapse in employment authorization and/or documentation while their renewal applications remained pending with USCIS”. At that time, the agency estimated that if the agency did not automatically extend EAD validity periods, “approximately 800,000 renewal applicants would have been in danger of losing their employment authorization and/or documentation in the period beginning May 2024 and ending March 2026”.

Processing times for EADs, however, have improved. For the month of September 2025, USCIS reported an average processing time of 3.7 months for the Form 765, Application for Employment Authorization.

Opportunity to comment

While DHS’s new policy will go into effect immediately, the agency is accepting comments on the interim final rule through the end of November (or 30 days after official publication in the Federal Register).

During the comment period, members of the public can submit feedback, including support, opposition, or relevant policy alternatives, through regulations.gov or directly on the federal register’s website. Generally, all comments are publicly available for review, and agencies must review and respond to all relevant comments before it can finalize the regulation. All comments must include the agency name (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) and the docket number (DHS Docket No. USCIS-USCIS-2025-0271) for this rulemaking.

Public comments give individuals, organizations, and experts the opportunity to provide the government with real-world perspectives, data, and feedback that agencies may not otherwise have considered. By highlighting potential impacts, gaps, or improvements, these comments can influence how final policies are written and implemented.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/EAD2.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 17:01:24.324249

(Warning: This video contains violence and strong language.)

Durango Police Chief Brice Current requested the investigation, CBI said in a statement.

CBI will investigate whether the agent violated state criminal law during the Tuesday incident during a protest over the arrest of a Colombian man, Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, and his 12-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son while on their way to school.

The family’s active asylum case is pending. Jaramillo-Solano has lived in Colorado for 18 months and has no criminal history, advocates with Compañeros Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center said.

Once the probe is completed, CBI’s findings will be presented to the 6th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.

The district attorney will decide whether to file criminal charges.

The woman the agent confronted, Franci Stagi, told The Colorado Sun on Thursday she is “incredibly sore” with pain in her upper back, neck and head.

Stagi was protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office early Tuesday when she saw an unmarked car pull up about 6:15 a.m.

She began recording on her phone and asked an officer, “You’re a good Christian, aren’t you?”

“Boy, did that piss him off,” Stagi told The Sun on Tuesday, shortly after it happened. The officer, who was wearing a black vest with “police” printed on it, knocked her phone out of her hands and she tried to grab it back.

Stagi said the officer then yelled, “She’s assaulting me!” before grabbing Stagi by her hair. He put her in a chokehold and pushed her to the ground over a grassy embankment, where she landed on her head, according to a video of the interaction.

It was not clear through the video which federal agency the officer worked for. The agent did not attempt to place Stagi under arrest and let her leave after the encounter.

Because the incident happened on federal property, the FBI is also looking into the incident, Durango city officials said Wednesday. An email to an FBI spokesperson in Denver was not immediately answered Wednesday.

“During the current lapse in appropriations, FBI operations are directed toward national security, violations of federal law, and essential public safety functions,” the agency said in an automated email.

ICE’s arrests of Jaramillo-Solano and his children Monday have drawn backlash from the local community and state officials.

Gov. Jared Polis said his office was not informed of the operation, nor was it provided any information about whether Jaramillo-Solano and his children were suspected of any crimes.

“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and in the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he said Wednesday in a post on social media. “The federal government should prioritize apprehending and prosecuting dangerous criminals, no matter where they come from, and keep our communities safe instead of snatching up children and breaking up families.”

A community meeting about the protests with Durango city officials is set for 4 p.m. today.

""This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling.
Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program.","The Trump administration is drastically cutting the number of refugees it will admit to the U.S., capping it at 7,500 for the current fiscal year. That's the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980.

The U.S. wants to primarily admit Afrikaners from South Africa, according to a notification in the Federal Register filed on Thursday, and ""other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.""

The administration has largely paused the U.S. refugee resettlement program so far this year, with the exception of a streamlined process of resettlement for white South Africans. Several hundred from the group have been resettled across the U.S. since March.

In response, some resettlement groups have been quick to voice concern over the lack of resources and limits on admission of those from other countries. Others have shuttered their services, changing the landscape of the refugee resettlement process.

Thursday's notification, which covers the fiscal year that started October 1, does not provide a reason for the lower cap, beyond mentioning previous Trump administration policies on refugees, including pausing admissions overall and barring admissions from countries seen as threats to U.S. security and welfare.

Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, previously told reporters that criteria for bringing in refugees included making sure that they did not pose a national security challenge and could be easily assimilated.

""This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, said in a statement. ""At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility.""

The Biden administration had set the refugee cap at 125,000 for fiscal year 2025.

Push for higher caps

Refugee advocates have spent the year pushing for a broader range of admissions beyond Afrikaners, including admitting people from other countries who had already been vetted to arrive in the U.S.

""It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,"" said Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project. He said that the number of those with confirmed travel plans to the U.S. is greater than the new refugee cap.

The admission of Afrikaners to the U.S. has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies in the U.S., who have faced sharp budget, resource, and personnel cuts since President Trump took office.

Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program. Various agencies including the State Department have also paused disbursing funding for critical services for other refugees, such as the home, job and school assistance the Afrikaners are poised to receive.

The pause also sent the refugee resettlement agencies into turmoil as refugees already cleared to arrive in the U.S. received notice their flights had been cancelled.

Among those left in limbo were Afghans who worked with the U.S. military, a move that some Republicans have criticized.

PEN America said these deceptive information practices are eroding trust in government information that the public depends on and must end.

In response, Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at PEN America, issued the following statement:

“It is becoming starkly clear that under this administration, information provided by the government may be misleading or flat-out wrong, intended to build public support for policies not shaped on their merits, but through selective or manipulated content. Certainly, both Democratic and Republican administrations have routinely infused politics into their communications, but the deceptive messaging tactics seen in recent months stand in clear contrast to the past. Federal government data and information have long been a reliable source for credible information for journalists, researchers, and the public. But increasingly, public confidence and trust in these sources is being eroded. These practices must end — the administration should be honoring the public’s right to the truth, rather than peddling falsehoods.”

The Washington Post’s reporting coincides with a new Pew Research Center analysis that found about half of Americans say it’s difficult to determine what’s true and what’s not when they get news. It comes alongside the growth of generative AI to create content, and social media amplification for distribution. The misleading videos also follow earlier moves by the administration to restrict data and research on topics of public interest that don’t align with its agenda, often with a focus on topics such as health, gender, education, and climate.

The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.
The government memo said only that the admission of the 7,500 refugees during 2026 fiscal year was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.
The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law that allegedly targets Afrikaners’ land.

The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.

The administration published the news on Thursday in a notice on the Federal Registry.

No reason was given for the drop in numbers, which are a dramatic decrease from last year’s ceiling set under the Biden administration of 125,000.

The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.

The government memo said only that the admission of the 7,500 refugees during 2026 fiscal year was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.

The figure had previously been reported after documents about the plans were leaked.

The announcement swiftly drew criticism from refugee organizations, with the International Refugee Assistance Project saying: “This determination makes it painfully clear that the Trump administration values politics over protection.”

“By privileging Afrikaners while continuing to ban thousands of refugees who have already been vetted and approved, the administration is once again politicizing a humanitarian program. It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,” it added.

Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, CEO of the US-based Global Refuge, took issue with the ethics of the decision.

She said: “This decision doesn’t just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing. For more than four decades, the US refugee program has been a lifeline for families fleeing war, persecution, and repression. At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program’s purpose as well as its credibility.”

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council posted on X.

He wrote: “Since the US Refugee Program was created in 1980, it has admitted over two million people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors. Now it will be used as a pathway for white immigration. What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”

In February, Trump signed an executive order to cut financial aid to South Africa after he accused its Black-led government of “unjust racial discrimination” to white Afrikaners, a minority group who are descendants of Dutch and French colonial settlers.

The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law that allegedly targets Afrikaners’ land.

The South African government has pushed back, calling the claims false as well as denying US accusations that Afrikaners are being subjected to racially motivated violence in rural areas.

Across South Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by white individuals, who make up 7.3% of the total population of the country, according to Action for Southern Africa. Meanwhile, Black Africans, who make up 81.4% of the country’s population, only own around 4% of the land.

Thursday’s announcement is not the first time Trump has slashed refugee resettlement numbers.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c867ab86734f09127f9dfacce0914e6077435e3d/557_0_4671_3736/master/4671.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79f838663bec1126a4597af7648bb7df",N,,2025-10-30 18:01:09.121196

The civil case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado against top officials at the Department of Homeland Security represents four immigrants who were, or still are, detained in Colorado while awaiting deportation hearings. They are seeking class action status.

At issue, the ACLU and other attorneys argue, is that under federal law immigration agents are not granted unfettered authority to make warrantless arrests. In order to detain someone without a warrant signed by a judge, an agent must have probable cause to believe the person being arrested is in the United States in violation of immigration laws and likely to flee and escape before a warrant can be obtained.

ACLU lawyers say their four plaintiffs’ stories, while all different, represent a pattern in the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents operate in Colorado.

The four people were arrested and detained without a warrant and without any public evaluation that they were likely to flee before a warrant could be obtained. The four have lived in their communities for years and have long histories of local employment or schooling, and present no likelihood of escape, let alone probable cause for a crime, their lawyers argued in the suit.

One of the plaintiffs is Caroline Dias Goncalves, a University of Utah student who was detained after being stopped on Interstate 70 in Mesa County. She was brought to the United States from Brazil as a child and was in the United States on an expired tourist visa. She had no criminal record when she was detained for more than two weeks. Goncalves has since been released.

The plaintiffs attorneys are seeking a preliminary injunction in a two-day scheduled hearing in front of U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson.

Lawyers for the government said in filings that the preliminary injunction would enable the ACLU attorneys to assume control over certain ICE operations in Colorado relating to arrests, training and reporting and that would be inappropriate.

The federal government acknowledges in court documents that although “some” warrantless arrests occur, Denver ICE agents usually conduct targeted operations to arrest undocumented immigrants with warrants. These operations, the federal government said in a court filing, primarily focus on immigrants with final removal orders or serious criminal history.

They also told the court that the Department of Homeland Security agents are trained to assess flight risk of the people they’re detaining. They’re “expected to evaluate, through a consensual encounter, whether there is reason to believe that the person may be in the United States unlawfully as well as whether the person poses a flight risk,” government lawyers said in court documents.

“Determining whether there was a reason to believe an alien was likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained is a nuanced inquiry,” the documents said.

The government also noted that the plaintiffs in the ACLU’s case are not likely to be subject to unlawful warrantless arrests in the future because ICE now has arrest warrants signed by judges for all four of them.",https://wp-cpr.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/CPR-ICE-RAID-20250205-07.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 18:01:29.388383

ICE leaders want to mask the agency’s detention flights for the same reason its officers want to mask their faces: Their behavior is inhumane and indefensible.
But the work of advocates and journalists like Wilson exposes much about the true face of ICE Air.","The perpetrators of federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration are allergic to transparency.

The most widely recognized symptom of this condition is their habit of masking up. The face-covering gaiter has quickly become a shameful icon for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who’ve terrorized countless communities across Colorado and the country.

But ICE and its partners in the lawless implementation of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program mask up in other ways. As Newsline reporter Sara Wilson recently discovered, the numerous daily flights that crisscross the country to transport immigrants are difficult to track.

That’s by design.

The flights are run by ICE, which transports people to immigration detention hubs and out of the country to deport them. The operation balloons the catastrophe of detention by putting whole states between family members and undercutting the ability of detainees to seek legal help.

Think of how a normal criminal prosecution works. A person is arrested on suspicion of violating the law by uniformed, identifiable police officers. That person is booked at a local facility and possibly jailed, but in many cases they have the opportunity to secure pre-trial release, and in all cases they’re given access to legal representation.

Compare that to how faceless, unaccountable immigration officers grab residents off the street and whisk them to locations unknown to family and friends. Most people whom ICE arrests in Colorado have no criminal conviction or charge, and that tracks with the national trend. Despite constitutional rights that are supposed to protect them, they have little expectation of due process or access to legal representation.

ICE flights are a major component of this injustice.

Wilson reported that Colorado-based Key Lime Air, which many customers know as Denver Air Connection, in mid-September started running daily flights of detainees for ICE. Key Lime is the first known Colorado-based company to participate in ICE Air, the agency’s program of removal and domestic transfer flights on charter and commercial airlines.

Key Lime aircraft shuttle detainees around the country, and they frequent ICE detention hubs, particularly El Paso and Harlingen in Texas, and Alexandria, Louisiana. As part of reporting the story, Newsline journalists observed dozens of detainees exit and enter Key Lime aircraft with their hands and feet shackled.

The reporting didn’t come easy. The Key Lime planes that perform ICE Air work are devoid of company logos. The company appears to have blocked the planes’ registration numbers from at least one popular flight tracking website. When they started ferrying detainees they stopped using the Key Lime flight communication call sign, “LYM.”

Federal authorities communicate very little about the flights. We don’t know the identity of the passengers. And Key Lime was no help. Wilson had a door shut in her face at Key Lime headquarters at Centennial Airport, and when she got CEO Cliff Honeycutt on the phone he quickly ended the conversation.

Much of what is known about ICE flights comes from independent trackers, like Washington-based La Resistencia, and immigration advocates. The New York Times relied on a flight database created by refugee advocate Tom Cartwright when it published an investigation into the Alexandria deportation hub. The Guardian‘s investigation into the hub, which features a detention center on the airport tarmac, found “a pattern of alleged due process violations … neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays.”

“There is almost no legal access to the center,” the Guardian reported.

ICE leaders want to mask the agency’s detention flights for the same reason its officers want to mask their faces: Their behavior is inhumane and indefensible. And the result is the same: Malign government agents defy transparency and accountability.

Under the May 15 data-sharing agreement, which was posted recently on the Social Security Administration’s website, the system added information, including full Social Security numbers, on millions of Americans not in DHS databases.
That’s because multiple audits and analyses have shown that SSA’s citizenship information is often outdated or incomplete, especially for people who became naturalized citizens.
As of last month, Homeland Security officials had run more than 33 million voters through SAVE, USCIS told NPR.
Federal officials aren’t done adding data to SAVE.","This year, when states began using an expanded Department of Homeland Security system to check their voter rolls for noncitizens, it was supposed to validate the Trump administration’s push to harness data from across federal agencies to expose illicit voting and stiffen immigration enforcement.

DHS had recently incorporated confidential data from the Social Security Administration on hundreds of millions of additional people into the tool, known as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, system. The added information allowed the system to perform bulk searches using Social Security numbers for the first time.

The initial results, however, didn’t exactly back up President Donald Trump’s contention that noncitizen voting is widespread. Texas identified 2,724 “potential noncitizens” on its rolls, about 0.015% of the state’s 18 million registered voters. Louisiana found 390 among 2.8 million registered voters, a rate of about 0.014%.

Instead, experts say, the sweeping data-sharing agreement authorizing DHS to merge Social Security data into SAVE could threaten Americans’ privacy and lead to errors that disenfranchise legitimate voters.

The details of the agreement, which haven’t previously been reported, show it contains alarmingly few guardrails to ensure accuracy and scant specifics on how the data will be kept secure, election and privacy lawyers who have reviewed it say. Further, it explicitly does not bar DHS from deploying the SSA data for other purposes, including immigration enforcement.

Experts have raised similar concerns about other parts of the Trump administration’s data-pooling drive, which has sought to tap all sorts of traditionally tightly controlled federal information, even tax data.

Until this year, SAVE contained information only on immigrants who’d had contact with DHS, such as those with permanent resident status, and had been assigned immigrant identification numbers. State and local officials typically used the system to verify immigrants’ status when they applied for benefits such as SNAP or to check, one by one, whether individuals who were registering to vote were citizens.

Under the May 15 data-sharing agreement, which was posted recently on the Social Security Administration’s website, the system added information, including full Social Security numbers, on millions of Americans not in DHS databases. The combined dataset joins together this information with addresses, birth dates and criminal records, along with immigration histories.

The agreement allows the SSA’s data to be used for searches to check voters’ citizenship, along with “other authorized inquiries from Federal, State, territorial, tribal and local government agencies seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of individuals within their jurisdiction.”

In doing these searches, SAVE stores not only the voter data that election officials upload but also the outcome of their queries, according to the data-sharing agreement and other documents from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the branch of DHS that oversees SAVE. The documents do not explain who can access this information or how it can be used.

Experts say adding Social Security data to SAVE could help election officials verify, en masse, if voters are U.S. citizens, but it shouldn’t be used to make final determinations that people aren’t citizens.

That’s because multiple audits and analyses have shown that SSA’s citizenship information is often outdated or incomplete, especially for people who became naturalized citizens. With the 2026 midterms about a year away, Caren Short, director of legal and research for the League of Women Voters of the United States, said she fears the expanded use of SAVE will lead to errors.

“The Trump administration is hunting people to try to purge people from the rolls who are lawfully registered, and they are doing it by looking at unreliable, outdated data,” Short said.

Several privacy lawyers said they believe it’s illegal for DHS to expand the use of SAVE without taking steps required in federal law, such as issuing a system of records notice to inform the public how the additional data will be collected, stored and used. Last month, advocacy groups sued the federal government, alleging that its expansion of SAVE and other data consolidation efforts violate the Privacy Act, a federal law that prohibits public agencies from misusing private information.

Officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to answer questions from ProPublica.

In a filing responding to the advocacy groups’ lawsuit, federal officials said that another statute, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, explicitly allows information sharing to verify citizenship status and that agencies would exercise caution in determining whether voters are noncitizens.

“There is zero basis to assume that State officials have any interest in haphazardly and unlawfully removing large numbers of U.S. citizens from their voter rolls, and no credible evidence that any such thing has happened or is going to happen any time soon” the filing says.

Still, Leland Dudek, acting SSA commissioner until early May, told ProPublica he doesn’t trust that DHS will accurately flag noncitizens as officials try to cross-match data and files from multiple systems.

“They are probably going to make some massive mistakes,” he said.

This summer, the Justice Department started demanding access to state voter registration lists, saying this was necessary to ensure compliance with federal voter roll maintenance laws. The agency has filed lawsuits against a number of states that have refused to comply.

Some of the states that have refused to provide voters’ private information directly to the Justice Department have entered into agreements with DHS under which they upload that same information into the SAVE system.

According to a document obtained by the ACLU, which sued the administration for SAVE-related records, a growing number of states are signing agreements with DHS to use SAVE to vet voter rolls. Ten states had signed such agreements coming into 2025; as of July, another 10 had signed on, the document shows.

As counsel for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit voting rights group, Naomi Gilens specializes in issues related to privacy and technology. Gilens said it’s important for Americans to consider if they want the government — including future administrations, not just this one — to have so much consolidated information on them.

“That is a very invasive picture that starts to be painted, in one place, for every individual who lives here’s private lives,” she said.

As of last month, Homeland Security officials had run more than 33 million voters through SAVE, USCIS told NPR. So far, the agency has declined to say publicly what the outcome of these queries have been.

But the initial results are tucked into another document obtained by the ACLU.

As of late August, about 96.3% of the voters checked in the SAVE system were identified by the system as U.S. citizens. For an additional 3.1% of voters, the system either couldn’t find them or needed more information to determine their citizenship status. About 0.5% of voters checked had died, the system found. And 0.04% showed up as noncitizens.

According to copies of 12 state agreements with DHS obtained by the ACLU and reviewed by ProPublica, election officials are required to take additional steps to verify SAVE results for voters the system identifies as other than U.S. Citizens. Then, if SAVE still can’t verify citizenship, the election officials “must contact the registrant or registered voter to obtain proof of citizenship.”

Dudek and Kathleen Romig, a former Social Security official who now works at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, worry even those steps won’t be enough to prevent mismatches from happening.

People’s names can be misspelled or listed differently in the various datasets. Many states collect partial, not full, Social Security numbers from voters and matches using partial numbers will be even less accurate, since many people share the same names, Dudek and Romig said.

“If there’s Jane Smith that is a citizen, and a Jane Smith that isn’t, you don’t want to disenfranchise the citizen Jane Smith by accident,” Romig said.

Federal officials aren’t done adding data to SAVE. Next up, according to a recent USCIS presentation to election officials shared with ProPublica: passport information from the State Department.

Tracking and evaluating the evolution of immigration enforcement, however, will be increasingly difficult without regularly published and reliable data.
At a time when immigration enforcement has been deemed a high federal priority, it is in the national interest for the government to provide transparent, regular, reliable immigration enforcement data.","Unauthorized migration at the U.S.-Mexico border plunged dramatically during the just-ended fiscal year, as the Trump administration leveraged new border controls, further asylum restrictions, and the promise of mass deportations, reaching about 444,000 migrant encounters recorded in fiscal year (FY) 2025. This sharp drop from 2.1 million encounters the prior year was also marked by reversion to a pattern last experienced more than a decade ago: Flows primarily composed of Mexican single adults and Central American unaccompanied children.

The steep decrease in unauthorized arrivals at the border and return to nationalities that are easier to turn back because of existing repatriation agreements has permitted the administration to direct its focus to immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior—in fact deploying significant U.S. Border Patrol assets to cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago. To achieve its goal of mass deportations, the administration has increased coordination among federal agencies, elevated cooperation with state and local law enforcement agencies, rapidly accelerated the build-up of detention capacity, expanded the use of fast-track removal powers, tapped the U.S. military, and established new agreements to repatriate returnees to third countries. As a result, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recorded more deportations from within U.S. communities during FY 2025 than the Border Patrol apprehended people crossing the Southwest border illegally—the first time since at least FY 2014, according to available data.

While detailed FY 2025 data about ICE arrests and removals have not been released since January, there is no doubt that interior enforcement has risen. But it has become increasingly complicated to track results because only selective statistics have been made public. Returning to regular reporting of detailed data on immigration enforcement across the various Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration agencies could not only improve the public’s understanding of current immigration enforcement activities but also inform state and local stakeholders who want to collaborate or who are affected by enforcement.

Ramped-Up Interior Enforcement and Mass Deportations

While U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) continues to post border encounter statistics every month, DHS has inconsistently released immigration enforcement data and its last detailed tables of ICE and CBP actions ended with November 2024 activity. Based on the latest publicly available figures, however, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates that ICE conducted about 340,000 deportations in FY 2025, including noncitizens with a formal order of removal and immigration detainees who chose to end their detention with a voluntary departure. This would mark a level of activity 25 percent higher than the 271,000 deportations recorded by ICE in FY 2024. These fiscal year figures do not include deportations conducted by CBP, which DHS has yet to release.

The administration says it conducted more than 400,000 deportations overall between ICE and CBP in its first 250 days, and was on pace to reach nearly 600,000 by the end of its first year. This projection falls short of the 685,000 deportations recorded by the Biden administration in FY 2024—and is well off the Trump administration’s pledge of carrying out 1 million deportations per year.

Location Matters

Where the deportations are happening is significantly different under the Trump administration, with more occurring within the U.S. interior rather than at the border. This has significant operational impacts, given deportations in the interior are likely to be far more resource intensive and carry higher individual and societal costs with enforcement happening in U.S. cities and against people who, unlike many recent border crossers, often have significant years of U.S. residence and deep community ties.

Of the 400,000 deportations conducted by the Trump administration through its first 250 days, MPI estimates approximately 234,000 were conducted by ICE from the U.S. interior, with another 166,000 by CBP.

ICE daily deportations, in fact, doubled from 600 in January to 1,200 since June. ICE deportations have increased as the number of immigrants being placed in detention centers has surged. Since the start of the Trump administration, the average number of noncitizens in ICE detention centers has grown gradually, reaching about 60,000 by the end of FY 2025 (see Figure 1). And by March, most detainees had been arrested by ICE in the interior, not by CBP at the border or through CBP transfer to ICE, as was usually the case under the Biden administration.

Note: Data on immigrant detainees are through September 20, 2025.

Source: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), “FY 2025 ICE Statistics,” updated September 22, 2025.

Among detainees arrested by ICE, a shrinking share had a criminal conviction despite the administration’s pledge of targeting “dangerous criminals” and the “worst of the worst.” About 35 percent of detainees arrested by ICE had a criminal conviction in September 2025 compared to 65 percent in October 2024 (see Figure 2). Meanwhile, the share of detainees with immigration violations but no criminal charges increased from 6 percent in October 2024 to 35 percent in September 2025.

Once in detention, it is increasingly unlikely that immigrants will be released. The share who were released on bond or under parole or supervision fell from 26 percent in October 2024, at the end of the Biden administration, to 3 percent in September 2025. In fact, 90 percent of those in ICE detention in September 2025 were deported directly from detention, compared to 63 percent of those in an ICE facility in October 2024.

How long a noncitizen spends in ICE detention depends on whether they were arrested by CBP or ICE, as well as their criminal history. The average length of detention for detainees arrested by CBP was 63 days, compared to 44 days if they were arrested by ICE. Immigrants categorized as “other immigration violator” and who were arrested by ICE had a shorter length of detention (32 days) than those with criminal convictions or charges (47 days). It is possible the difference is due to delays in criminal proceedings and/or delays in deporting individuals with criminal convictions or pending charges to their countries of origin.

Trends at the U.S.-Mexico Border

CBP recorded 444,000 migrant encounters at and between ports of entry in FY 2025, down from 2.1 million encounters a year earlier. The 238,000 encounters by the Border Patrol of migrants crossing the border without authorization represent a 55-year low. (The remaining 206,000 were encountered at ports of entry by CBP’s Office of Field Operations.)

Notably, 75 percent of the FY 2025 encounters were recorded in the last four months of the Biden administration. Irregular arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border fell sharply at the start of the Trump administration, continuing a trend that began in January 2024 and accelerated mid-year, and have remained consistently low since. Since February, the Southwest border has seen an average of 11,000 encounters a month. In fact, daily Border Patrol interdictions reached as low as 116 in July—a far cry from the 11,000 recorded on some days during the record arrivals experienced in December 2023.

The Border Patrol effectively ended the practice termed “catch and release,” with only about a dozen encountered migrants released into the United States with notices to appear (NTAs) in immigration court. From February through September, the Border Patrol processed more than 94 percent of migrants it encountered for expedited removal, reinstatement of removal, voluntary return, or ICE detention. As much as this was the result of policy change, it was also due to the Border Patrol’s capacity to more quickly process migrants and transfer them out of its custody given that arrivals fell sharply and returned to the pattern of originating from nearby countries with which the U.S. government has long had repatriation agreements.

While these measures have reduced irregular crossings of migrants of all nationalities and demographic groups, they appear to be especially effective in reducing encounters of families and migrants from countries other than Mexico. Mexicans accounted for 45 percent of Border Patrol encounters in October 2024, a share that rose to 69 percent by September 2025 (see Figure 3). Over the same period, the share of migrants from countries other than Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, or Venezuela fell from 28 percent to 11 percent.

Similarly, as the share of “family unit” encounters (CBP’s term for an adult or minor child traveling with a family member) dropped from 27 percent to 12 percent, the share of single adults increased from 63 percent to 79 percent (see Figure 4).

Figure 4. Share of Encounters of Migrants Crossing the U.S-Mexico Border without Authorization, by Month and Demographic Group, FY 2025

This makes today’s migration patterns resemble those of 13 years ago, when most migrants arriving at the border were single adults from Mexico or unaccompanied children from Central America.

The Future of Immigration Enforcement

Whether the Trump administration reaches its goal of 1 million deportations annually or not, it has implemented a vast array of policy and operational changes that have reshaped the direction of immigration enforcement. The infusion of $45 billion from Congress to build new immigrant detention centers and $30 billion to expand enforcement and deportation operations provided under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act alone will transform ICE and further enhance cooperation with state and local law enforcement over the coming years.

Tracking and evaluating the evolution of immigration enforcement, however, will be increasingly difficult without regularly published and reliable data. Instead of releasing detailed tables on immigration enforcement each month, as done under prior administrations, the Trump administration has relied on issuing a constellation of individual statistics in press releases, tweets, and media interviews, which have conflated sources at times. This has made it difficult to verify the administration’s success against its policy objectives as well as the impacts on federal agencies, immigrants, and U.S. communities alike.

The changes in how the program is administered comes after a July layoff at the State Department largely gutted its Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration, which oversaw and coordinated refugee efforts with U.S. embassies around the world.
