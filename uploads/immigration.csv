Mr. Rubio made his remarks in a briefing on Monday with lawmakers from the main armed services and foreign policy committees in both chambers of Congress. The same day, Mr. Trump told aides to deliver an updated plan.

The congressional briefing was focused on Venezuela, but lawmakers raised concerns about Mr. Trump’s intentions on Greenland given aggressive remarks this week by the American president and a top aide, Stephen Miller, two officials said.

Mr. Rubio did not go into detail on what he meant by buying Greenland. Mr. Trump spent decades in New York as a real estate developer, and one of his top diplomatic envoys, Steve Witkoff, comes from the same background. Mr. Trump has coveted Greenland since his first term.

Greenland is a sparsely populated, autonomous territory that falls under the sovereign boundaries of Denmark, a member of NATO. Denmark established colonial control over Greenland in the 18th century, and allowed it to become autonomous in the 20th century.

On Tuesday, leaders of six NATO nations joined with Mette Frederiksen, the prime minister of Denmark, to issue a remarkable joint statement pushing back against Mr. Trump’s assertions that the United States should take over Greenland. The nations that aligned with Denmark were Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland, all of which are close allies of the United States.

“Security in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders,” they said. “These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them.”

“Greenland belongs to its people,” they added. “It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.”

Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Trump had not ruled out a U.S. invasion of Greenland.

“President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region,” she said in a statement. “The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the commander in chief’s disposal.”

Some lawmakers voiced concern about Mr. Trump’s stated plans. On Tuesday evening, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, and Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, issued a joint statement saying the U.S. government must respect its allies.

“When Denmark and Greenland make it clear that Greenland is not for sale, the United States must honor its treaty obligations and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” said the senators, who lead the Senate NATO Observer Group.

“Any suggestion that our nation would subject a fellow NATO ally to coercion or external pressure undermines the very principles of self-determination that our alliance exists to defend,” they added.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that “Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.”

Those two nations are active powers in the Arctic Circle, but Greenland is not surrounded by their ships. In fact, it is the United States that has a military base in Greenland. Vice President JD Vance visited the base with his wife, Usha, last year.

Mr. Trump has also focused on Greenland because of its potential wealth of critical minerals.

The second Trump administration’s National Security Strategy says dominance of the Western Hemisphere is a top priority. That has been brought into sharp focus with Mr. Trump’s monthslong military pressure campaign against Venezuela and the seizure on Saturday by U.S. troops of Nicolás Maduro, the country’s leader, and his wife, Cilia Flores, during a deadly attack.

It is the largest such detention facility in California.

Since its opening early last year, the detention center — which is operated by the company CoreCivic via a contract with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) — has become one of the most notorious facilities.

In November, detainees held in California City brought a class action lawsuit alleging, among other things, that the staff there “routinely engage in abusive behavior and unreasonable use of force.” It also alleges that people “are routinely subjected to solitary confinement for conduct that should not be punished at all.”

On Dec. 19, California Attorney General Rob Bonta wrote a letter to the Trump Administration detailing “dangerous and inadequate living conditions” endured by detainees. If even half of what he says is true, it should be intolerable. We should have learned from the horrors of slavery and the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II that treating humans in an inhumane way leaves an indelible stain on our history.

And, unless something is done quickly to address the situation, things in immigration detention are going to get worse.

Trump’s inhumane plan

Late last month, The Washington Post ran a story about a Trump Administration immigrant detention plan so cruel that it could have been ripped from the pages of the Marquis de Sade’s playbook for sadism. The plan is to dramatically expand the number of facilities in which immigrants can be warehoused by using actual warehouses to hold them.

The administration hopes to utilize these facilities to expedite the movement of individuals from the moment they are picked up by ICE agents to the moment they are deported.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” ICE Acting Director Todd M. Lyons told The Post. The article also states that the goal of the administration is “to deport immigrants as efficiently as Amazon moves packages.”

“Like Prime, but with human beings,” Lyons said.

Human beings treated like packages?

We must say, “not in the United States.” It is time for Congress to hold hearings to shed light on the cruelty currently happening in these facilities and halt the administration’s warehouse plan.

As The Post notes, “Such structures are designed for storage and shipping, not human habitation ... (for) thousands of full-time residents.”

Lawless places

It is already clear that existing ICE detention facilities across the country are lawless places not fit for human habitation. The immigrants who are housed there are being subject to dreadful conditions of confinement.

Remember Alligator Alcatraz? PBS reminds us that “President Donald Trump toured (the Everglades Detention Facility) in July and suggested it could be a model for future lockups nationwide.”

A few months after that well-publicized tour, Alligator Alcatraz has become a nightmare for people who are sent there. Amnesty International notes that they “are living in inhuman and unsanitary conditions ... (M)edical care is inconsistent, inadequate or denied all together.” Moreover, people held there are “always shackled when they were outside their cage.”

Meanwhile, the ICE facility at Fort Bliss, Texas — the largest such facility in the country — “is a massive tent camp … located in the middle of the desert on a military base.”

In December, the American Civil Liberties Union sent a letter to ICE and to relevant Congressional Committees about Fort Bliss alleging that “detained immigrants are held for weeks at a time ... in cramped, squalid soft-sided tents with 72 people per unit, where toilets and showers flood eating areas with raw sewage.

“As immigrants detained at Ft. Bliss report, officers have beaten detainees and used threats of violence, criminal charges and imprisonment in attempts to coerce people held at Ft. Bliss to leave the United States and cross the border into Mexico.”

We can’t expect the courts to stop such treatment because prior judicial decisions suggest that detainees have less legal protection than prisoners. Because their detention is not regarded as punitive, it is not covered by the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment.

But as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held more than 20 years ago: “(A civil) detainee is entitled to ‘more considerate treatment’ than his criminally-detained counterparts.“ And, according to the court, a civil detainee should not be “confined in conditions identical to, similar to or more restrictive than those in which criminal counterparts are held.”

Today, I am not confident that today’s Supreme Court would apply such a principle to people in Trump’s immigration detention gulag. That is why it is up to the American people and Congress to reject what the administration is doing in California City, Alligator Alcatraz, Fort Bliss and other detention centers.

Humans, whatever their immigration status, should never be treated as “packages.”",https://www.mcclatchy-wires.com/public/incoming/9fke9k/picture313788624/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/6b4f79c6-d7a1-4803-a314-8979950cb8e0,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:33.355424

The administration ended the program for more than 600,000 Venezuelans last year, saying then that conditions in the country had improved.
""The Trump administration has been saying for a year the conditions have changed for good in Venezuela,"" Sebastian said.
But the Trump administration has doubled down that Venezuelans in the country with temporary status must leave.
She added that every individual under TPS ""has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward.""","The last few days have been full of emotions for Sebastian, a 28-year-old Venezuelan architect who lives in Miami.

Sebastian, who asked to be identified by his first name because of his ongoing immigration case, says he was happy to learn U.S. forces had captured President Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela in the early hours of Jan. 3.

""I felt a relief, because I thought that there'd be a radical change in the country,"" he told NPR. ""Maybe things were going to be different.""

But in a press conference later that day, President Trump said his administration had a conversation with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro's deputy and vice president. Trump said his administration was working with her toward U.S. plans to run the country.

That announcement left Sebastian disappointed. He said he feels the danger is still as present in Venezuela.

But the Trump administration says it is safe for Venezuelans to go back to their country, especially those who were in the U.S. with temporary protected status, or TPS. The administration ended the program for more than 600,000 Venezuelans last year, saying then that conditions in the country had improved.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, told Fox News on Sunday, ""the great news for those who are here from Venezuela on temporary protected status is that now they can go home with hope for their country — a country that they love — that there is going to be peace, prosperity and stability.""

But Sebastian, who came to the U.S. in 2023 and had TPS, said that does not make sense.

""The Trump administration has been saying for a year the conditions have changed for good in Venezuela,"" Sebastian said. ""But I would ask, if the U.S. has to extract a man who took over the government, how am I supposed to believe that the situation in Venezuela is good? It's contradictory, I see the opposite — the situation is worse.""

The Department of State has advised U.S. citizens not to travel to Venezuela ""due to severe risks to Americans, including wrongful detention, torture in detention, terrorism, kidnapping, arbitrary enforcement of local laws, crime, civil unrest, and poor health infrastructure.""

On Monday, at least 14 journalists — most from international news organizations — were detained in Venezuela, according to Venezuela's National Union of Press Workers. There are also reports that armed groups are already working to suppress any support for Maduro's ouster.

Luis Falcón said going back to Venezuela under these conditions can put those returning at extreme risk. He came to the U.S. in 2017 after fleeing persecution.

He used to work for the Presidential Honor Guard, the security detail assigned to presidents and their family members. But after retiring in 2009, he started to join protests against the Maduro government. Authorities threatened him with jail time for betraying the country, and he decided to leave Venezuela.

""I'm grateful for the big step taken in Venezuela,"" Falcón said. ""But this is the beginning of the end. There's still a long road ahead for Venezuela to become a country of liberties, opportunities and justice for those Venezuelans who have been part of the opposition.""

He said returning now is impossible.

""Putting a foot back in Venezuela means I will be taken to jail, tortured, and potentially killed,"" Falcón said.

He says TPS should be restored for Venezuelans until there's a transition of government there. But the Trump administration has doubled down that Venezuelans in the country with temporary status must leave.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said in an interview with Fox News on Sunday that ""Venezuela today is more free than it was yesterday."" She added that every individual under TPS ""has the opportunity to apply for refugee status and that evaluation will go forward.""

However, immigration attorneys said that's misleading.

""Saying that someone can apply for refugee status within the U.S. — the generous interpretation is that she misspoke,"" said Lily Axelrod, an immigration lawyer based in Memphis, Tenn. ""The less generous interpretation is that she doesn't know what she's talking about or is lying.""

To apply for refugee status, she says, an immigrant must be outside the U.S. Axelrod said Venezuelans in the U.S. could still apply for asylum, although that could be a challenge, especially after the Trump administration paused all asylum decisions in November.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x1688+0+142/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9a%2F19%2F70374f9d4974a2a7f4dcefb6101f%2F260105-nyre-josealvaradojr-30.JPG,N,,2026-01-07 08:57:33.590085

There’s more to come in 2026. The lawsuits are part of a coordinated legal strategy by Democratic AGs in 22 states and the District of Columbia to resist the ever-widening power of the executive branch.

It’s not unusual for states to sue an administration; the party not in the White House has often turned to the courts. But it’s one of the few pathways for Democrats now, since Republicans hold the presidency, both chambers of Congress and have appointed a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court. And Trump in his second term has taken a much broader view of presidential power than previous administrations, asserting far more authority than his predecessors.

Democrats hope to retake at least one chamber of Congress in November’s midterm elections. But for most of the coming year, the party will be relying on AG court challenges as their main venue to take on Trump.

‘A boundless power’: Democratic states ask Supreme Court to halt Trump troop deployment to Chicago

One of the most prolific AGs is Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who has led or joined 52 lawsuits against this Trump administration.

“It’s not a slogan or a political brand,” Rayfield said of the coalition in an email interview with Stateline. “It’s a working partnership. When we coordinate, we’re able to defend the constitutional balance, push back when a president overreaches, and make sure our residents aren’t left paying the price for unlawful decisions coming out of Washington.”

The state AGs have brought cases over Trump’s tariffs and National Guard deployments. They’ve also fought cuts to federal research, education programs, food assistance, disaster recovery, health care and housing. And they say it’s their job to maintain core civil rights protections as well as stick up for the people in their state who, they argue, are harmed by the whims of the president’s executive orders.

“None of the institutions in our government have been built to respond and react to the scale and speed of the destruction that’s being wrought by the Trump administration,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez told Source New Mexico.

Since the beginning of 2025, the attorneys general have toured the country on multistate listening tours and have touted their accomplishments on progressive legal podcasts. They’ve won 40 of the 51 resolved cases, according to a tracker from the Progressive State Leaders Committee.

The AGs are not alone in taking legal action. Individuals, businesses, labor unions, associations, universities, local governments and other entities have filed 554 cases against the president’s expansion of executive branch powers, according to Just Security, a daily digital law policy journal with a litigation tracker that monitors challenges to Trump administration executive actions.

But the attorney general coalition serves as “a coordinated, quick-moving and high-capacity force protecting the rule of law, federal funding streams, and people’s rights,” said Jonathan Miller, chief program officer of the Public Rights Project, which helps state and local governments partner on litigation that protects and advances civil rights.

The attorneys general have proven such a successful coalition that the Public Rights Project is adopting a similar approach that makes it easier for cities and counties to pool expertise, coordinate legal theories and act collectively, Miller said.

“The rule of law is ultimately about people,” Miller said. “When courts enforce the law, families stay housed, public health and emergency services stay open, and local leaders can govern without political coercion. That’s the foundation for restoring faith in democratic institutions: making the legal system work the way it’s supposed to for the people it’s supposed to serve.”

Immediate action

Democratic AGs began filing their multistate lawsuits the day after Trump took office, challenging the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship. The immediate legal action was intended to send a clear message to the Trump administration that state attorneys general will “stand up for our residents and their basic constitutional rights,” New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement at the time. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case this spring.

Rayfield said some days their work aims to build an emergency firewall to halt unlawful presidential actions — such as deploying the National Guard. Other days, it’s more targeted, fact-driven litigation designed to keep money, benefits and services flowing to states.

In December, Rayfield, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Washington Attorney General Nick Brown led a coalition of 19 attorneys general and the governor of Pennsylvania in challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for threatening to punish doctors, hospitals and clinics that provide gender-affirming care.

Democratic AGs sue DOJ to receive federal funding for victims of violent crimes

In early November, the U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments from Oregon’s then-solicitor general, Benjamin Gutman, who argued on behalf of a coalition of a dozen states that sued over Trump’s sweeping tariff policy on most goods entering the United States. Rayfield and Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes began discussing a tariff lawsuit in April, before a joint appearance at a town hall in Oregon. Both had been considering it, but it was their in-person discussion that led to the collaboration, Mayes said during a panel discussion hosted by the “Legal AF” podcast on the MeidasTouch Network.

“This is not what I get up every day wanting to do,” Mayes told Cronkite News outside the Supreme Court, after Gutman argued the tariff case. “But if Donald Trump decides to violate the Constitution, violate statute, or harm the people of Arizona, I’m going to file that lawsuit.”

After Trump’s 2024 election, Democratic attorneys general began meeting almost daily over Zoom to prepare their legal approach for a second term. This time around, they had a better sense for what was coming because it was outlined in Project 2025, the conservative blueprint that has shaped much of the Trump administration’s agenda so far.

As they enter their second year of legal collaboration, the AGs continue to meet regularly, but because they’ve developed close working relationships, it’s at a “more sustainable cadence,” Rayfield said.

Republicans sue, too

Republican attorneys general say they, too, are taking action to protect state sovereignty. Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post in November that lawsuits emerging from progressive states, particularly state- and municipal-driven cases in state courts over climate change, are “as much of a threat to state sovereignty as the federal government” as well as an attempt to “remake the nation in the image of progressive enclaves such as San Francisco and Portland, Oregon.”

“They reach into states like Alaska with their rules and regulations,” Cox wrote. “They push misguided legal theories targeting ordinary Americans. And they file lawsuits that would give state courts in ideologically aligned jurisdictions the chance to control the economies of states like mine.”

Republican attorneys general have been largely supportive of the president’s second-term agenda, including supporting the deployment of out-of-state National Guard troops to protect federal facilities. Led by Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, Republican attorneys general in 26 states sent a letter in support of such a mobilization in June in Los Angeles, describing it as “the right response — and one we fully support.” And as recently as October, Republican attorneys general in 16 states wrote a letter supporting the Trump administration’s attacks on boats it says are smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.

State attorneys general have long taken on the executive branch, no matter who was in power.

Democratic attorneys general filed 138 multistate lawsuits against federal agencies during Trump’s first administration, according to a 2020 assessment by Paul Nolette, a political scientist at Marquette University in Milwaukee.

And some Republican attorneys general were especially litigious during the Biden administration. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton famously sued the Biden administration 106 times, including a suit challenging the administration’s offshore drilling policy in the final days of the presidency. Paxton followed in the footsteps of his Republican predecessor, now-Gov. Greg Abbott, who sued the Obama administration 31 times as a Republican attorney general: “I go to the office. I sue the federal government. Then I go home,” he told The Dallas Morning News in 2012.

20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

Attorneys general in more progressive states say their actions during the current administration have kept their states from losing billions of dollars in federal funds that would have otherwise been blocked for schools, public health, domestic violence prevention and other services. In Oregon, it’s an estimated $4.5 billion, Rayfield said. Arizona estimates it has held on to $1.5 billion. In California, it’s $168 billion.

In Oregon, one of the lawsuit hearings this fall drew an audience so large that an overflow courtroom adjacent to a packed main federal courtroom was needed. A crowd quietly watched arguments on a video display as lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland argued that the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops was not only a vast federal overreach, but also a threat to state sovereignty and public safety.

The administration said it deployed the Guard to protect federal agents, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But when an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department described protesters as “vicious and cruel radicals” for their demonstrations outside of an ICE facility in Portland, the phrase elicited muffled snickers from the otherwise decorous courtroom observers.

Among the protesters dominating news reports and social media feeds was a 20-something in a chicken costume. Other peaceful protesters spawned a new symbol of resistance: inflatable frog costumes. And naked bike riders rolled up en masse to the ICE facility, too, braving a cold, wet day and exposure on Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.”

But the issue in front of U.S. District Judge Karin J. Immergut was no laughing matter.

Oregon’s lawsuit challenging Trump’s National Guard deployment was a critical public safety outcome for the state, Rayfield said. It prevented troops from mobilizing in Portland, forestalling what he described as “the kind of escalation that could have caused real harm.”

Attorneys general are prepared in 2026 to monitor and enforce their courtroom victories, Rayfield said. He and other state officials and local prosecutors have warned U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi that excessive force by DHS officers won’t be tolerated during immigration enforcement activities. If warranted, they’ll refer them for prosecution, he said.

“That isn’t just a legal win — it’s a safety win,” Rayfield said. “The president cannot use federalization as a shortcut to move troops into American cities without lawful cause. That matters for Portland, and it matters for every state watching what happened here.”",https://stateline.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Democratic-AGs.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 09:57:40.751053

Tim Walz said, his decision to end his bid for a third term as Minnesota’s governor came down to this: Facing a torrent of threats and taunts from the Trump administration over a fraud scandal that has plagued the state’s social services system, he concluded that abandoning his political campaign might shield his constituents from further harm.

“I don’t think any governor in history has had to fight a war against the federal government every single day,” Mr. Walz told reporters on Tuesday in his first lengthy remarks about his decision, announced on Monday, to quit the race.

The announcement came a few weeks after the White House began portraying Mr. Walz, a former vice-presidential candidate and member of Congress, as an avatar of Democratic misgovernance. In early December, federal agencies began threatening to cut funding for Minnesota programs in response to a sprawling criminal investigation into fraud in a Covid-19 program meant to feed children and other safety net programs overseen by the state. Federal prosecutors have asserted that as much as $9 billion might have been stolen.

The White House simultaneously launched an immigration crackdown in Minnesota as the president railed against the state’s Somali diaspora, noting that a majority of defendants charged in the fraud cases are of Somali origin. Last week, Republicans on Capitol Hill scheduled a hearing about Minnesota’s fraud scandal, and demanded that Mr. Walz testify.

Mr. Walz, who was first elected in 2018 and whose current term in office will end early next year, pledged to continue tightening oversight of safety net programs that proved easy to defraud. Speaking defiantly, he also said that his critics should not expect him to spend his remaining year in office being cowed.

“I have more energy today than I’ve ever had,” Mr. Walz, 61, told reporters at Tuesday’s news conference, where he and colleagues announced the rollout of a new paid family and medical leave program for the state, one of his signature legislative initiatives. “I am committed to this state more than I have ever been.”

Being unburdened from the constraints and demands of a campaign, he said, would allow him to focus on fighting fraud and protecting immigrants and L.G.B.T.Q. Minnesotans in the months ahead.

“The attacks on Minnesota are far beyond me, and it’s hurting Minnesotans,” said Mr. Walz, who called the president’s insults toward Somalis in the state “absolutely unconscionable.”

Asked to respond to the governor’s comments, a White House spokeswoman said the administration’s efforts to combat fraud and illegal immigration in Minnesota would continue.

“Dropping out of the race won’t shield him from the consequences of his actions,” the spokeswoman, Abigail Jackson, said in an emailed statement, which urged the governor to apologize for allowing “tax dollars to be misused so badly.”

The governor said that Republicans in the closely split Legislature should brace for a confrontational session in the coming weeks, adding that he intends to press them to vote on gun control bills and other measures he feels strongly about.

“Expect for the next 11 months for me to ride you like you’ve never been ridden, to make sure that you’re doing your job,” he said.

Mr. Walz said he had decided to drop out of the race over the holidays after conversations with members of his family. In a podcast interview recorded Monday, his daughter, Hope Walz, said that the federal scrutiny of Minnesota reflects that “Trump just hates” her father.

Part of the reason he stepped aside was his belief that doing so stood to “kind of get that target off of Minnesota,” she said in the show “One Hour Detours.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/us/06nat-walz-speaks-1/06nat-walz-speaks-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 06:58:11.482885

And the findings provide us with a road map for our focus going forward to continue strengthening oversight and integrity of behavioral health grants,"" Gandhi said.","An audit of the Minnesota Department of Human Services' Behavioral Health Administration grant programs found ""widespread failures in oversight,"" according to a state watchdog.

The Office of the Legislative Auditor says the department ""did not comply with most requirements tested for mental health and substance use disorder grants and did not have adequate internal controls over grant funds.""

According to the audit, the Department of Human Services distributed more than $425 million in grants to 830 grantees between July 1, 2022, and Dec. 31, 2024.

Of 51 grant agreements, the report says more than half of the progress reports were missing or past due. The agency also could not prove that it completed 27 of 67 required monitoring visits, and for 24 visits involving 11 grantees, it could not provide any documentation.

One auditor noted that several documents were created by the Behavioral Health Administration only after the audit began and had been backdated in response to document requests.

Two grantees were overpaid, and the Behavioral Health Administration paid some grantees for work performed before it fully executed the grant agreements, according to the audit. The agency also made payments to grantees for costs that were either not incurred or not properly supported by source documents.

In a survey of employees at the Behavioral Health Administration, the report says 73% of respondents said they did not receive sufficient training to manage grants.

""Executive leadership has repetitively shown staff that they won't take the staff's concerns or questions seriously until something serious happens or it makes the news,"" one employee wrote in the survey.

State Sen. Mark Koran, R-North Branch, a member of the Legislative Audit Commission, says the audit shows that Department of Human Services leadership ""failed at every level.""

""The OLA report shows a complete breakdown in how DHS's Behavioral Health Administration manages hundreds of millions in taxpayer-funded grants,"" Koran said. ""BHA failed to verify that grantees were providing the services they were paid for, failed to put basic financial controls in place, and then created documentation after the fact to mislead auditors.""

Temporary commissioner for the Department of Human Services, Shireen Gandhi, said she was ""shocked"" to learn the information included in the audit.

""With respect to the audit report, while it's upsetting that DHS has findings in areas we have placed concerted effort, the OLA's report highlights the importance of the grant compliance work already underway at the department. And the findings provide us with a road map for our focus going forward to continue strengthening oversight and integrity of behavioral health grants,"" Gandhi said. ""I take the report seriously, I accept responsibility for the findings, and I will ensure DHS closes the findings.""

The report comes amid a widening fraud scandal in the state. Criticism about Minnesota's fraud caused Gov. Tim Walz to announce on Monday that he is dropping his bid to be reelected to a third term.

On Sunday, the Trump administration began a massive deployment of hundreds of DHS agents to the Twin Cities area. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to look into alleged fraud cases following last month's investigation by federal agents in Minneapolis that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said was for ""child care and other rampant fraud.""

More than 90 people face federal charges as a result of fraud schemes that have been uncovered in Minnesota since 2021. Prosecutors estimate the total amount of fraud could reach $9 billion. The scandal started with a $250 million COVID-era scheme involving a nonprofit called Feeding Our Future, which was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program.

Since then, federal prosecutors have uncovered ""large-scale fraud"" in a housing program for seniors and people with disabilities, and a program that provides services to children with autism. The Trump administration is also probing claims of fraud by day care centers in Minnesota, which gained national attention after a conservative YouTube personality named Nick Shirley posted a video that showed him visiting federally backed child care centers around Minneapolis and finding no children there.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/12/04/3e591d27-7363-4260-a4c2-7fddcbc90859/thumbnail/1200x630g8/75f5365ffce9a29d4ae2457a0fc61ec5/gettyimages-2237567426.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 01:57:19.185133

But the data available for 2025 show ICE agents in Hawaiʻi conducted 194 arrests between Jan. 8 and Oct. 15, up from 52 arrests the year before under the Biden administration.
Based on the available 2025 data, there were an average of 20 arrests per month in Hawaiʻi last year, compared to four per month in 2024.
By May, ICE had conducted 128 arrests in Hawaiʻi; 31 arrests were made over the same period in 2024.
The ICE data does not specify where most of the at-large arrests occurred.","Updated tallies are not yet complete but already eclipse those in 2024. Data show immigration arrests are increasingly likely to take place at ICE offices and at the state’s civil court houses.

Arrests and removals by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Hawaiʻi through October were quadruple those in all of 2024, based on ICE operations data.

The exact numbers for the full calendar year won’t be available until mid-March due to delays in data releases by the Department of Homeland Security. But the data available for 2025 show ICE agents in Hawaiʻi conducted 194 arrests between Jan. 8 and Oct. 15, up from 52 arrests the year before under the Biden administration.

Those numbers are certain to rise. They do not include dozens of arrests made on Kauaʻi in early November at six properties in Kapahi and Kalāheo used as workforce housing by a cleaning contractor, Hawaii Care and Cleaning Inc.

Citizens of Mexico made up nearly a quarter of all those detained by ICE in Hawaiʻi so far in 2025, followed by Chinese nationals, and citizens of the Federated States of Micronesia. But more than 100 other nationalities were represented.

Arrests increasingly occurred when people came to ICE offices for mandatory check-ins or turned up at state courthouses on matters unrelated to immigration, Neribel Chardon, a senior staff attorney with The Legal Clinic, said Monday.

Chardon, one of a handful of pro bono attorneys in Hawaiʻi, said ICE personnel can usually find some grounds for arresting someone. That can include failing to update contact details with the immigration court or missing a notice to appear.

Those decisions are hard for attorneys to appeal, she said, “because the person failed to comply with their obligations, and they ended up in detention.”

She said she had not seen an increase in arrests in immigration court as had been reported in other states.

The data was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy Deportation Data Project and dates back to Sept.1, 2023. Arrests or apprehensions made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection at ports of entry, including airports, are not included in the count.

Based on the available 2025 data, there were an average of 20 arrests per month in Hawaiʻi last year, compared to four per month in 2024. The uptick began immediately after the Trump inauguration on Jan. 20. By May, ICE had conducted 128 arrests in Hawaiʻi; 31 arrests were made over the same period in 2024.

Until the 44 Kauaʻi arrests in November, May was officially the month with the highest number of arrests – 34. Almost all of them took place on May 6 and 7 when ICE agents detained workers from Central America at coffee plantations on the Big Island.

The data shows that most of the arrests this year were “at-large”, meaning they occurred in public spaces such as courts, streets and workplaces, rather than in facilities where people are already incarcerated.

The ICE data does not specify where most of the at-large arrests occurred.

Asked for comment, ICE responded with an emailed statement last week that arrests reflected the agency’s “mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe. So far, DHS has arrested over 622,000 illegal aliens, and we have no plans of stopping or slowing down.”

After that initial surge in immigration arrests in Hawaiʻi in the first five months of the Trump administration, arrests dropped off from June through October, when agents made 61 arrests — or about half as many. That ran counter to the trend nationally, where the rate of administrative arrests increased by about 60%, according to analysis by The Washington Post.

Some jurisdictions saw far greater spikes.

The District of Columbia saw a fivefold increase in arrests, the highest in the nation according to the Deportation Data Project, while New Mexico saw a fourfold increase.

Montana was the only other state that saw a fall in administrative arrests similar to Hawaiʻi, but the number of arrests in Montana and Hawaiʻi is relatively small compared to states like Texas, skewing percentage comparisons.

ICE media did not respond to a question about the downturn. Analysis of the same data by the Prison Policy Institute found that arrest rates were higher in states that fully cooperated with the Trump administration, which has set a goal of 3,000 immigration arrests per day.

Current estimates are that ICE is detaining 1,000 people per day, and there are approximately 605,000 people in detention nationwide.

Forced Removals And Voluntary Departures Up

Other indicators published by the Deportation Data Project and the tracreports.org site at Syracuse University also show how overall increases in immigration enforcement under the Trump administration have played out in the islands.

Those include an uptick in both the number of requests by ICE to Hawaiʻi authorities, such as county police, to detain individuals for 48 hours. By mid-October ICE in Hawaiʻi had requested 71 detainers, 22 more than the 49 requested during 2024.

Detainer requests are the legal mechanism for holding individuals until ICE agents can take them into custody for alleged immigration or criminal violations. In some mainland jurisdictions, local law enforcement has notified ICE about individuals in their custody who they suspect might also have immigration violations, under memoranda of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security.

Local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration actions has been controversial across the islands. In response, representatives of local law enforcement said last April they were not actively participating in immigration enforcement operations under existing agreements with DHS — other than complying with the detainers.

Detainers for people being held in cells at the Honolulu Police Department and the Oʻahu Community Correctional Facility make up over 40% of the running total for 2025. There was also a large increase in the average daily number of inmates held in the Honolulu federal detention center, which houses ICE detainees, including some from the mainland.

The average daily number of ICE detainees at FDC Honolulu in January 2025 was 15. At the end of November, it was 81, according to agency data published on tracreports.org.

As of Oct. 15, ICE data showed 218 individuals had been booked into FDC Honolulu, exceeding the 130 detainees booked in during 2024. That number includes detainees arrested by ICE on the mainland housed at the Honolulu facility while awaiting proceedings.

In July, ICE issued a departmental memo requiring the mandatory detention of all immigrants who entered the United States without inspection, a move that also restricts their access to bond hearings before an immigration judge.

Chardon said it has been increasingly difficult to get her clients released on bond under the revised guidelines, even though there was evidence that federal judges were pushing back on the mandatory detention policy, according to reporting by Politico.

The federal Bureau of Prisons agreed to provide 125 beds to the Department of Homeland Security under a new agreement approved in February, Civil Beat confirmed. That’s resulted in ICE detainees from as far away as Florida being temporarily housed there, local immigration attorneys said.

Of those booked into the Honolulu facility in 2025 up to mid-October, 121 were detained for alleged immigration violations, 66 had previous criminal convictions, and 31 had pending criminal charges.

The data also shows that more people were removed by ICE or chose to leave Hawaiʻi voluntarily in 2025 than in 2024, however the total won’t be available until mid-March.

The final disposition of 224 people released from FDC Honolulu so far in 2025 is shown in a dataset of “Detention Stints” — a log of when detainees were booked in and booked out, and the reason for their release from Honolulu, including transfers to a facility elsewhere. That number includes people arrested in 2024 and released in 2025.

As of Oct. 15, 106 people had been deported from Hawaiʻi, compared to 113 forced removals in all of 2024. But using a daily rate to measure the difference in the rates of removals year-over-year, 143 people could be expected to have been deported by Dec. 31 — a 35% increase over 2024.

Already, far more people have chosen to depart voluntarily in 2025 than in 2024, with 30 leaving so far, compared to two individuals the previous year.

The Trump administration is promoting a self-deportation program that offers undocumented people a $3,000 payment and a free flight to their destination.

“We encourage every person here illegally to take advantage of this offer and reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right, legal way to live the American dream,” the ICE emailed statement said.

Chardon said that voluntary self-removal could be risky for undocumented people looking to get safely out of the U.S. because they could still be arrested and detained if Customs and Border Patrol agents at the airport determine they had entered the country illegally.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2025/11/26113616/IMG_6805-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-07 02:57:06.528821

Reyes noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio identified “immediate security challenges” in the country last year.
The DHS under the Trump administration has voided 12 designations for 11 countries, drawing lawsuits in courts across the country.
A New York judge blocked the agency last year from removing TPS protections early for Haitians in the US.
But the agency months later issued a Federal Register notice that it would remove protections when they’re set to expire in February, arguing that conditions had improved enough in the country to remove protections.
Reyes probed government lawyers over the decision to remove protections for Haitians.","A Washington, DC federal judge pressed lawyers for the Trump administration on how Haitian immigrants targeted for removal from the US could safely return to a country deemed unsafe for travel by the government.

Judge Ana C. Reyes noted that Secretary of State Marco Rubio identified “immediate security challenges” in the country last year. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits civilian US aircraft from operating in portions of Haitian airspace because of security forces’ inability to prevent attacks from terrorist groups, she said.

“Can you explain to me how it’s safe to return to a country or live in a country when it’s not even safe to fly into that country?” she asked.

The District Court for the District of Columbia case is one of multiple legal challenges to the Department of Homeland Security’s termination of Temporary Protected Status for Haiti, stripping lawful status and work authorization for more than 350,000 Haitian immigrants in the US.

TPS allows immigrants from designated countries to stay in the US for up to 18 months when conditions like armed conflict make it unsafe to return. The DHS under the Trump administration has voided 12 designations for 11 countries, drawing lawsuits in courts across the country.

A New York judge blocked the agency last year from removing TPS protections early for Haitians in the US. But the agency months later issued a Federal Register notice that it would remove protections when they’re set to expire in February, arguing that conditions had improved enough in the country to remove protections.

Reyes probed government lawyers over the decision to remove protections for Haitians. When Justice Department attorney Dhruman Sampat said he wasn’t a foreign policy expert in response to her query on air travel, Reyes responded “I’m just asking as a matter of logic.”

She also asked why it’s a national interest to remove Haitians. The government has argued that the secretary has broad discretion to make determinations of the national interest that can’t be reviewed by the courts.

Reyes asked whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could decide it’s in the national interest to remove Haitians because she “doesn’t like vanilla ice cream.” Sampat quipped that it could be a possible economic consideration for a decision.

“Listen to yourself,” Reyes said. “I understand you’re in a tough spot, but just take a breath and listen to yourself.”

Hearings on the litigation will continue Wednesday. Reyes said before adjourning that her critiques of government attorneys have generated significant press coverage. She added that counsel for DHS had done a “phenomenally good job” in the hearing.

Like the Hispanic and Latino communities, as well as other migrant groups across the U.S., Asian families live under constant threat of unlawful detentions, family separations, neglect, abuse and trauma at for-profit prisons.
In the 19th century, our nation’s first mass deportation laws targeted the surveillance, registration and detention of Chinese people living in the American West.
Last year, a survey by the Asian American Foundation reported that 63% of Asians now feel unsafe because of their race.
The five deaths of Asian nationals in ICE custody in 2025 are not just isolated tragedies.","More than 30 people died while being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in 2025, marking it as the deadliest year for those held in custody by the agency in two decades. At least five of the detainees who died were Asian nationals: Chaofeng Ge, Nhon Ngoc Nguyen, Tien Xuan Phan, Kaiyin Wong and Huabing Xie. So far their deaths have received little public attention, even as ICE increases raids, expands capacity at its facilities and accelerates deportations across the country.

As I grieve these deaths, I’ve also witnessed ways that mass deportations have induced palpable fear throughout the Asian American community. Like the Hispanic and Latino communities, as well as other migrant groups across the U.S., Asian families live under constant threat of unlawful detentions, family separations, neglect, abuse and trauma at for-profit prisons.

In August, ICE guards found 32-year-old Chaofeng Ge hanging in a shower stall at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center in Philipsburg, Pa. Although investigators ruled Ge’s death a suicide, the autopsy report stated that he was found with his hands and feet tied behind his back. Despite these troubling circumstances, the federal government has yet to release the full records regarding Ge’s death to his family. Chaofeng’s brother filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit in November seeking transparency and accountability, and complained that the prison provided no Mandarin interpretation, leaving his brother isolated and possibly without access to medical care or mental healthcare while in custody.

Seven detainees at the California City Immigration Processing Center have made similar claims, accusing ICE of inhumane conditions inside its network of for-profit detention centers, including delayed medical care, inadequate food and water, and limited access to interpreters. Things are likely to only get worse unless the corporate profiteering that drives mass detention ends now.

Ge’s death points not only to the dangerous conditions inside ICE facilities, but also to the wider climate of terror that mass deportation policies have instilled in large segments of our community. Currently, 1 in 7 Asian immigrants living in the U.S. are undocumented and under imminent threat of removal, and undocumented Asian students represent a significant share of the population, accounting for approximately 16.5% of those eligible for DACA benefits.

Given the widespread and devastating impact of ICE arrests, more than 70% of Asian Americans now disapprove of President Trump’s immigration policies, arguing that his mass deportation practices have gone too far.

Trump’s policies are largely a continuation of immigration laws that have historically excluded Asian Americans. In the 19th century, our nation’s first mass deportation laws targeted the surveillance, registration and detention of Chinese people living in the American West. My family’s own immigration records from a century ago speak of my great-grand-uncle’s removal and of my grandparents’ detainment at the Angel Island Immigration Station in San Francisco.

Even though my grandfather was a native-born American citizen, his bride was imprisoned by armed guards for weeks because the government had racially profiled the two as illegal immigrants. White witnesses were required to testify on my grandfather’s birthright citizenship, and my grandmother was required to correctly answer a 56-question interrogation or else be deported. The poems of Chinese prisoners inscribed on the walls of the Angel Island immigration center speak to the fear and injustice that they and thousands more endured.

The use of deportations as a form of international segregation persists today as politicians rehearse old stereotypes to scapegoat and expel migrants. Once again charged as “criminal” and “invading armies,” a wide range of Asian groups face racialized deportation practices that deny them their rights and fracture families.

Consider Yunseo Chung, a 21-year-old Korean American student and lawful permanent U.S. resident. After she exercised her right to free speech while participating in student-led demonstrations at Columbia University, ICE moved to revoke Chung’s status and sought to deport her multiple times. Only when Chung sued the U.S. government to prevent her deportation did she gain a restraining order, blocking her removal.

Another innocent caught in this system is 6-year-old Yuanxin Zheng, a Chinese immigrant who arrived in New York City with his father in April. Even as they were following proper procedures to gain asylum, the family was forcibly separated by ICE on Nov. 26. Among the more than 2,600 children arrested this year by ICE, Yuanxin is one of the youngest. And although Yuanxin’s panic-stricken father was allowed a brief phone call with his son, he was left in the dark about his child’s whereabouts. ICE didn’t reunite the two until they were deported together, more than three weeks later.

Southeast Asian refugees also face a form of double jeopardy under the current administration’s policies. More than 15,000 Southeast Asians, many of whom served prison sentences for offenses committed in their youth, confront a second punishment: deportation orders.

For example, while serving 26 years in prison for murder, Phoeun You graduated from self-help programs, rebuilt his life and proved his commitment to change as he earned parole. Yet You never got to embrace his parents upon his release. Instead, he was immediately deported to Cambodia, a nation he never knew, and was permanently separated from his family. “I went from a life sentence to an eternal life sentence,” You told me when we spoke in February.

Last year, a survey by the Asian American Foundation reported that 63% of Asians now feel unsafe because of their race. ICE’s use of racial profiling and our nation’s xenophobic climate have undoubtedly contributed to these anxieties.

The five deaths of Asian nationals in ICE custody in 2025 are not just isolated tragedies. They reveal a system that has expanded faster than oversight can follow. Language barriers, delayed medical care and a lack of transparency inside detention centers have already had fatal consequences. This broken system does not make America safer but instead strikes fear throughout entire communities. ICE’s racial profiling and punitive enforcement practices do not bring about security but instead inflict lasting traumas on families and on generations like mine.

Ge’s passing demands justice — not only for his family, but for the end of for-profit prisons, of family separation and of the racist and violent enforcement of deportations. Each is a cruel and unusual punishment; together they constitute a morally bankrupt immigration system.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bbb1f49/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5125x2691+0+364/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F41%2F77%2Fe2eb709f40bda3433b47319364cc%2F2237821829.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 23:57:17.166086

The Trump administration has threatened federal funding cuts to organizations and states over a number of issues since taking office – ranging from alleged fraud in programs of states governed by Democrats to diversity initiatives and pro-Palestinian university protests against US ally Israel’s assault on Gaza.

On Tuesday, HHS said it notified the five states, all with Democratic governors, that its freeze applied to the “Child Care and Development Fund” worth $2.4bn, the “Temporary Assistance for Needy Families” worth $7.35bn and the “Social Services Block Grant” worth $869m.

In a statement, the department said the states’ access to those funds would be restricted pending further review. The administration has not laid out details of either the fraud claims or the widening plan to withhold funds, which was first reported by the New York Post.

Democrats condemned the freeze. “Our states should not be political pawns in a fight that Donald Trump seems to have with blue state governors,” New York governor Kathy Hochul said, adding the step was “vindictive” and “cruel”.

Trump himself has not spoken on the specifics, but he proclaimed on social media Tuesday: “The Fraud Investigation of California has begun.”

In the fallout, HHS officials said no state will receive childcare funds without providing more verification. Several states told the Associated Press that they had not received any guidance on that decision.

Tara Gallegos, a spokesperson for California governor Gavin Newsom, said in an email that “Donald Trump is a deranged, habitual liar whose relationship with reality ended years ago” and defended California’s record at stamping out fraud in government programs.

The senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, said Trump’s move to halt funding aims to score political points, not to stop fraud.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has singled out Minnesota, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by immigrants in the welfare system and in social service programs.

Trump administration officials have frequently and sharply attacked the state’s Somali community, the largest in the country, as well as the Minnesota governor Tim Walz, the 2024 Democratic vice-presidential nominee, and the Democratic representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali American who represents a Minneapolis-based district in Congress.

Federal childcare funding has been put on hold in Minnesota since late last month amid investigations into a series of alleged fraud schemes at daycare centers run by people with family roots in Somalia.

Rights advocates say the Trump administration is using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target immigrants and political opponents more broadly.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6fd97cad218febce3b2ccfc2971798be060addd/411_0_4815_3850/master/4815.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aa69ee392a6fae374112c93d25baa6bc",N,,2026-01-06 22:56:19.531020

“You cannot rely on the article for one thing and not the other,” Judge Reyes said.
Lawyers representing the plaintiffs have also said that the government has sought to cast Haitian T.P.S.
If Judge Reyes pauses the revocation for Haitians, the government is likely to appeal, and the case could end up before the Supreme Court.
Early last year, Ms. Noem announced the end of T.P.S.","The Trump administration’s effort to revoke protections for 350,000 people from Haiti who fled their troubled homeland is facing what could be the last legal challenge before Temporary Protected Status for Haitians expires early next month.

Ending T.P.S. for Haitians was part of a wave of actions by the Department of Homeland Security last year as President Trump launched his campaign to carry out mass deportations and remake the U.S. immigration system.

T.P.S., which provides a shield against deportation for people from countries in the throes of a humanitarian crisis or armed conflict, has been a target of Trump officials, who say the program has become anything but temporary and no longer serves its intended purpose.

But revoking protections for Haitians, Venezuelans and people from several other countries has prompted more than a dozen legal challenges, including the case involving Haitians that is being heard this week in federal court in Washington, D.C.

Lawyers challenging the decision to end T.P.S. for Haitians have argued that the move was driven by politics and racial animus rather than by a required assessment of safety conditions in Haiti, where gangs have taken control of much of the capital since the 2021 assassination of the last elected president.

The lawyers have asked the judge in case, Ana C. Reyes of the Federal District Court, to put the revocation of T.P.S. for Haitians on hold while the lawsuit proceeds. Judge Reyes said on Tuesday that she expects to rule on that request by Feb. 2, the day before the status is scheduled to expire for Haitians.

During the hearing, Judge Reyes pressed government lawyers about whether the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, had adequately reviewed conditions in Haiti before terminating T.P.S.

The administration, which is seeking to dismiss the lawsuit, has argued that ending T.P.S. for Haitians is in the national interest and that Secretary Noem is “unfettered by any statutory standard whatsoever.”

At the hearing on Tuesday, the judge focused on an email exchange that the administration cited as evidence that it had met its obligation to assess whether conditions in Haiti had improved sufficiently to justify ending the protection.

In the exchange, a homeland security official asked a State Department official for input on designation for Haiti T.P.S. According to the judge, the State Department official replied that the agency “believes there would be no foreign policy concerns.”

“That response does not address country conditions in Haiti,” Judge Reyes told one of the government lawyers, Dhruman Sampat.

The judge noted that the one-sentence reply from the State Department official had been sent just 53 minutes after the inquiry arrived on a Friday afternoon, and she suggested that the official could not have consulted experts or otherwise conducted a meaningful review.

In a back and forth that lasted more than 30 minutes, Mr. Sampat argued that the term “foreign policy” could reasonably be interpreted to encompass conditions on the ground. Judge Reyes was unconvinced. “This does not address whether it’s safe for Haitian T.P.S. holders to return to Haiti,” she said.

The named Haitian plaintiffs in the lawsuit include a registered nurse, a doctoral candidate researching Alzheimer’s disease, a woman adopted by Americans and a college student.

In a government notice, the Trump administration had cited a U.N. finding that there were “emerging signals of hope” in Haiti. But it did not refer to the U.N.’s assessments that Haiti was immersed in a “life and death emergency” and was going through one of five “highest concern” hunger crises in the world.

The judge faulted the government for “selectively” using the line from the report to justify not extending T.P.S., while ignoring a plethora of concerns about conditions in Haiti the U.N. had laid out.

“You cannot rely on the article for one thing and not the other,” Judge Reyes said.

Later in the hearing, the judge read aloud a statement from Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in which he said that Haiti was facing “immediate security challenges.” The judge then asked the government lawyer if Mr. Rubio had been consulted about conditions in Haiti.

Lawyers representing the plaintiffs have also said that the government has sought to cast Haitian T.P.S. beneficiaries as criminals after identifying fewer than 900 out of 350,000 of the beneficiaries, or about .25 percent, as public safety threats.

“They are trying to fit the facts to their conclusion,” said Geoff Pipoly, a lead litigator for the plaintiffs. “Their entire process was informed by political considerations.”

T.P.S. was created by law 35 years ago to offer humanitarian protection to people from countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disasters or other “extraordinary and temporary” conditions.

While the program allows recipients to live and work legally in the United States, it does not provide a pathway to permanent residency or citizenship.

Applicants must pass background checks, and those with a felony conviction or two or more misdemeanors cannot secure the status. Its holders can obtain driver’s licenses and Social Security numbers, but they are not eligible for most public benefits.

The Trump administration has moved aggressively to cancel T.P.S. from more than one million immigrants. People who lose the status become undocumented, lose their jobs and face deportation.

Economists have warned that shedding hundreds of thousands of workers by removing T.P.S. and carrying out mass deportations could disrupt could disrupt American businesses and cause prices of many goods and services to climb. Labor shortages in the hospitality, senior care and construction industries are all but certain.

Aline Gue, a Haitian community leader who attended the hearing, said, “Ending T.P.S. will not only break up our communities, it will result in the loss of billions of dollars for the U.S. economy.""

“It puts our Haitians in a position to be deported to a country where there is documented mass displacement, widespread gender-based violence and no recourse for justice,” she said.

If Judge Reyes pauses the revocation for Haitians, the government is likely to appeal, and the case could end up before the Supreme Court.

Early last year, Ms. Noem announced the end of T.P.S. for about 350,000 Venezuelans who had received it in 2023 and later ordered the termination of the status for another 250,000 Venezuelans granted protection in 2021.

Ms. Noem argued that conditions in Venezuela had improved and said recipients of the program were a burden on American taxpayers. She also claimed that members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan criminal gang, were among those benefiting from the designation.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/06/multimedia/06nat-immig-tps-1-pvhl/06nat-immig-tps-1-pvhl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:57:12.434962

“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Trump said while campaigning in 2016.
Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.
Joe Lombardo, who is credited by Trump with helping lift him to victory in Nevada, did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s military action in the South American nation.","Nevada’s sole Republican congressman, Rep. Mark Amodei, had as of Monday evening yet to comment on the military capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or President Donald Trump’s assertion the country and its oil production industry are under U.S. control.

Maduro and his wife, captured Saturday in Caracas by an elite U.S. military squad, entered pleas of not guilty Monday in New York to charges of trafficking cocaine.

Amodei’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. His silence comes as Nevada’s Democratic congressional delegates are calling out Trump for deploying the military for a criminal matter and for engaging in regime change and nation-building, policies Trump has previously decried.

“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Trump said while campaigning in 2016.

Maduro “was a brutal dictator who deserves no sympathy,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on social media. “But the Trump Administration using American service members to overthrow a foreign leader it has criminally indicted under U.S. law sets a dangerous precedent.”

Trump, she said, “made a dangerous decision to bypass Congress with his actions in Venezuela, and so far he has offered no real details on plans for the future other than a vague assertion that the ‘United States will be running the country.’”

The prosecution of Maduro, Cortez Masto added, “contradicts” Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiring to traffic cocaine and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released last month as a result of Trump’s pardon.

On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president in Maduro’s absence. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, laid out a scenario that more closely resembles a military takeover than the criminal apprehension of two individuals.

“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “By definition, we are in charge, because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Maduro an “illegitimate and brutal dictator” but noted only Congress has the power to declare war. “This illegal regime change operation won’t make our country safer and risks destabilizing the region, dragging us into additional military conflicts, and increasing the amount of immigrants seeking refuge at our border.”

Trump’s administration needs to “explain why it lied when it claimed in its briefings that regime change wasn’t the U.S. goal in Venezuela,” Rosen said, and urged Congress to pass Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) War Powers Resolution “to prohibit Donald Trump from carrying out additional strikes without our input.”

In a statement issued Saturday, Rep. Dina Titus, a former Political Science professor at UNLV, detailed more than half a century of U.S. regime change efforts in Latin America.

“In each case, our long-term interests were not advanced, regional relationships were damaged, and the Hemisphere saw more turmoil and violence, not less, “ she said. “Instead of learning from history, President Trump has perpetuated a failed foreign policy.”

The Trump administration’s action, Titus said, “is clearly based largely on the desire to take over Venezuela’s oil.”

The U.S. invasion of a sovereign nation, she added, “opens the door for Xi Jinping to do the same in Taiwan and lends legitimacy to Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine.” Titus said Trump, who calls himself “the ‘President of Peace’ has once again shown that he is the ‘Commander-in-Chaos.’”

Titus faces challenges in 2026 from six Republicans, including State Sen. Carrie Buck, who did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s takeover of Venezuela.

Rep. Susie Lee, also a Democrat, said Maduro’s capture raises “more questions for the Trump Administration than answers. The American people are opposed to another forever war.”

Lee noted that taking control of Venezuela is “an act of war, not a law-enforcement activity, and requires Congressional authorization and clear legal authority, neither of which the Administration has been given.”

Three Republicans vying to replace Lee are praising Trump’s actions.

Dr. Aury Nagy praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” but a spokesman was unable to say whether Nagy supports putting U.S. troops in Venezuela.

Marty O’Donnell, who is prioritizing affordability in his campaign, commended Trump and the military for taking decisive action without loss of life to Americans.

Dr. Jeff Gunter, who served as an ambassador during Trump’s first term, praised the military action that resulted in Maduro’s capture as a “’lawful, moral, and necessary’ step to protect American families from drug cartels and liberate Venezuela from socialist tyranny.”

Gunter is best known in political circles for an attack ad in the 2024 Republican primary race for U.S. Senate, in which he portrayed fellow Republican Sam Brown as a swamp creature. Brown was disfigured by an improvised explosive device in 2008 in Afghanistan, where he was serving in the U.S. Army.

Gunter did not respond when asked whether he supports U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.

Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, echoed colleagues in asserting Trump’s actions “appeared to be driven largely by access to Venezuela’s oil resources.”

“Nevadans struggling through the Trump Slump get no relief from another reckless attempt at nation-building abroad,” he said. “President Trump is occupying Venezuela for corporate oil profits while the American people are clamoring for affordability relief here at home.”

David Flippo, one of several Republicans seeking to oust Horsford, praised Trump’s actions. In a statement, the former Air Force commander said Trump acted “exactly how the Commander-in-Chief is supposed to act…”

He did not respond when asked whether he supports prolonged U.S. involvement and troops in Venezuela.

Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.

“Operations like this send a clear and unmistakable message: the United States will not tolerate criminal regimes poisoning our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,” Whipple said in a statement. He did not say whether he supports deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, criticized the federal enforcement surge as ""a war that's being waged against Minnesota.""

""You're seeing that we have a ridiculous surge of apparently 2,000 people not coordinating with us, that are for a show of cameras,"" Walz told reporters in Minneapolis on Tuesday, a day after announcing he was ending his campaign for a third term.

WATCH: Fraud scandals and Trump's rhetoric escalate fears in Minnesota's Somali community

Many residents were already on edge. The Trump administration has singled out the area's Somali community, the largest in the U.S. Last month, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara criticized federal agents for using ""questionable methods"" following a confrontation between agents and protesters.

Molly Coleman, a St. Paul City Council member whose district includes a manufacturing plant where agents arrested more than a dozen people in November, said Tuesday was ""unlike any other day we've experienced.""

""It's incredibly distressing,"" Coleman said. ""What we know happens when ICE comes into a city, it's an enforcement in which every single person is on guard and afraid.""

Julia Decker, policy director at the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, said there had been an increase in sightings of federal agents and enforcement vehicles in locations like parking lots.

""We can definitely a feel a heavier presence,"" said Dieu Do, an organizer with the Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee, which dispatches response teams to reports of agents.

Surge includes investigators focused on fraud allegations

Roughly three-quarters of the enforcement personnel are expected to come from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, said the person with knowledge of the operation. The force also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE's investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks.

HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Cmdr. Gregory Bovino, the person familiar with the deployment said. Bovino's tactics during previous federal operations in other cities have drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates.

Hilton drops Minnesota hotel that canceled agents' reservations

Hilton said in a statement Tuesday that it was removing a Minnesota hotel from its systems for ""not meeting our standards and values"" when it denied service to federal agents.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville hotel, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) outside Minneapolis, apologized Monday for canceling the reservations of federal agents, saying it would work to accommodate them. The hotel, like the majority of Hampton Inns, is owned and operated by a franchisee.

The Hampton Inn Lakeville did not respond to requests for comment.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

He also says ICE will reimburse agencies for overtime related to immigration enforcement.
RELATED: Texas troopers to enforce immigration laws under new federal partnership with ICE He plans to take the agreement to the Commissioners Court soon.","Texas counties with large populations are now on the clock.

Because of a January 1 deadline in Texas law, sheriffs of counties with more than 100,000 residents are required to formally partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the federal 287(g) program.

Counties have until the end of 2026 to sign on and implement one of three enforcement models.

While several major metro counties are still weighing their options, Bexar County has already signed on, becoming one of the first large urban areas in the state to do so.

Three Models, Different Levels of Authority

“By the end of this year, all of the counties with over 100,000 residents must enter into some type of agreement with ICE, but there are various levels,"" explained immigration attorney Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch.

Under the task force model, officers can use enforcement power in routine work or while assisting an ICE-led task force.

The warrant service officer program allows local officers to serve and execute administrative warrants on migrants in local custody.

The jail enforcement model focuses on identifying and processing people eligible for removal who are already in county jails.

Bexar County chose the Warrant Service Officer Model.

Sheriff Javier Salazar says it was the most cost-effective option for taxpayers and allowed patrol deputies to operate as usual. Under the agreement, one deputy will be assigned to serve ICE warrants inside the county jail. That deputy is still waiting for ICE training.

“The vast majority of our community will not see any difference in how the sheriff's office does what we do,” Salazar said.

Salazar says he moved early to sign onto the program so his office could spend the year showing the community what participation will look like, and ensuring an agreement was in place in case the rule changed.

Lincoln-Goldfinch says the decision is not simple for many counties, especially those with large immigrant populations.

She says she's not surprised that major metro counties like Harris, Dallas, and Travis have not yet signed on, saying officials must balance compliance with state law and maintaining trust within their communities.

“When immigrants are afraid of sheriffs, they are not reporting being the victims of crime. They might avoid being witnesses to crime,” Lincoln-Goldfinch said.

Salazar says preventing that fear is a priority.

“We're going to come out and handle their case appropriately and not be conducting ourselves as if we're immigration agents,"" Salazar said.

Other Agencies Signing On Voluntarily

While some counties are still deciding, other law enforcement agencies are joining the program even though the law does not require them to.

Precinct 3 Constable Mark Vojvodich says his office agreed to the Task Force Model to formalize practices already in place.

“When we make arrests for a felony or a misdemeanor, and then if we run across somebody with an ICE detainer, we'd report that to them anyway, and this was a method we could use to add some other tools to our toolbox,"" he explained.

Vojvodich says none of his deputy constables will be dedicated specifically to ICE, but they will be able to assist if requested. He also says ICE will reimburse agencies for overtime related to immigration enforcement.

“Once it becomes an ICE issue, like we're waiting 45 minutes for ICE to arrive, they will actually compensate us on an overtime basis and pay back Bexar County taxpayers,"" Vojvodich says.

Those reimbursements, he says, can help offset other budget pressures.

“The day-to-day operation for a constable won't really change,"" Vojvodich assures the community.

Balcones Heights has also signed onto the program, telling the I-Team its decision is about public safety, not politics.

The Mayor and City Council set the goals and objectives for the City of Balcones Heights. It is then the responsibility of the City Administrator and the Chief of Police to operationalize those goals through professional judgement and day-to-day management.

Our goal is clear and unchanged: to make Balcones Heights the safest suburban city in Bexar County. The decision to enter a 287 (g) agreement authorized by Congress since 1996 was made by our professional leadership as an operational tool to advance that goal. This was not a political statement, but a judgement call by those responsible for public safety. We respect that chain of responsibility and place our trust in our professionals to act lawfully, effectively, and in the best interest of our residents

Potential Legal Consequences

Counties that do not participate by the end-of-year deadline could face legal action from the Texas Attorney General. Senate Bill 8 gives the AG the authority to take noncompliant jurisdictions to court.

The Attorney General’s Office did not respond to a request for comment.

Until DHS can provide transparency and assurance that these operations are conducted lawfully and effectively, similar enforcement actions should be suspended.”","WASHINGTON — Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi today sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem raising serious concerns about how DHS conducted Operation Midway Blitz in Illinois, including in his district, warning that the operation appears to have swept up large numbers of individuals without criminal convictions and produced deadly consequences.

The Congressman writes:

“DHS has said this operation focused on dangerous criminals, but the facts suggest that many people with no criminal convictions were arrested instead. During my oversight visit, I learned that individuals were targeted and held not because they had been convicted of a crime, but merely because they had been charged with an offense in the past.”

He further notes that public reporting contradicts DHS’s stated priorities:

“While DHS has stated that roughly 4,500 people were detained during Operation Midway Blitz, reports show that only about 15 percent of those detained had prior criminal convictions. When enforcement actions primarily affect people without criminal convictions, it undermines DHS’s stated focus on targeting the most dangerous individuals.”

The letter also highlights the death of Nenko Gantchev, who died in DHS custody after being arrested when he voluntarily appeared for a scheduled immigration interview.

“He was not detained because of a criminal conviction,” Krishnamoorthi writes, “but because of enforcement practices that prioritized increasing the number of immigrants detained rather than focusing on genuine public safety threats. His case underscores the human cost of enforcement actions that do not center on individuals with criminal convictions.”

To ensure accountability, Congressman Krishnamoorthi requests written responses from DHS by January 15, 2026, to the following questions:

How many people detained during Operation Midway Blitz had criminal convictions?

How many detainees with no prior criminal convictions were charged with a crime by DHS at the time of their arrest?

Please provide body-camera footage for any arrests of individuals without prior convictions or active charges.

To which facilities were individuals detained in Illinois transferred, and how many of those transferred experienced serious health deterioration while in DHS custody?

How will DHS ensure that future enforcement actions target individuals with serious criminal convictions or active warrants?

The Congressman concludes:

“Immigration enforcement should focus on individuals who pose real public safety risks, not on families, workers, or bystanders caught in a dragnet. Until DHS can provide transparency and assurance that these operations are conducted lawfully and effectively, similar enforcement actions should be suspended.”",https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/profiles/evo/assets/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-06 21:57:20.950790

Justice Minister Paul Goldsmith acted unlawfully when making two key appointments to New Zealand’s human rights watchdog, the High Court has ruled, in a decision that is likely to curb ministerial discretion when filling sensitive public service roles.

The court found Goldsmith failed to follow proper procedure when appointing Chief Human Rights Commissioner Stephen Rainbow and Race Relations Commissioner Melissa Derby in 2024.

“The decision was unlawful because: (a) the minister applied the incorrect legal test; and (b) the minister failed to take into account relevant considerations,” Justice David Gendall found in a decision published late last month.

While the ruling is embarrassing for Goldsmith – the minister charged with overseeing the justice system – it does not make the appointments of Rainbow and Derby to the Human Rights Commission invalid.

While the court heard evidence that neither candidate received backing from a four-person panel of experts set up to consider the appointments, Gendall said each still met many of the criteria required for their roles.

“I do not consider the fact that the minister departed from the recommendations of the panel here rendered his decision unreasonable… the minister was not bound to follow their recommendations, and it was open to him to place different weight on the various criteria,” he said.

‘Errors’ in appointment

The application for judicial review was brought by Paul Thistoll, chief executive of campaign group Rights Aotearoa, in his capacity as a private citizen.

Thistoll said he wanted to ensure the appointments followed “a lawful, robust process that respects the statutory criteria set by Parliament”.

“The court has confirmed that the minister cannot simply bypass the legal requirements of the Crown Entities Act and the Human Rights Act,” he said in a statement.

“While the minister has discretion, he must apply the correct legal tests and genuinely weigh the mandatory considerations.”

Thistoll initially wanted the appointments of Rainbow and Derby to be overturned, but later dropped this from his application, which Gendall said was the correct course of action.

But the judge disagreed with counsel for Goldsmith, who argued that declaring the appointments unlawful but not invalid would be “futile” and have no practical value.

“I agree with the applicant [Thistoll], that the declaration sought here would serve a real purpose in ensuring that future recommendations for the position of human rights commissioners proceed lawfully,” he said.

“When potential appointees for such positions occupy an important public office intended to help ensure the human rights of New Zealanders are upheld and promoted, there is a clear and substantial public interest in having errors in their appointment publicly declared.”

Unlawfulness ‘rests with the minister’

The court heard that neither Rainbow nor Derby was on the initial shortlists of candidates drawn up by the appointment panel. The panel comprised former solicitor general and Supreme Court justice Sir Terence Arnold, former Attorney-General Chris Finlayson KC, barrister Paul Rishworth KC and Māori advocate Lorraine Toki.

Once interviews were completed, the panel did not recommend Rainbow, noting he was “less commanding than other leading candidates” when responding the questions about legal matters.

After Derby’s interview, the panel’s assessment was that she “lacked depth and experience, and that she would find the role very challenging”.

Thistoll’s counsel told the court that there were concerns that ACT Party leader David Seymour had spoken with Goldsmith directly about Rainbow’s candidacy after learning his application had not been successful.

Both Rainbow and Derby were subsequently appointed to their respective roles and commenced work in November 2024.

While they were not the appointment panel’s preferred picks, Gendall said the experts noted both candidates had qualities suitable for their roles.

For Rainbow, these included “excellent communication skills, his ability to build bridges across the political divide, and his prior experience as an advocate for LGBT rights”.

Derby was described as having first-rate intellectual ability, an approachable personality, a sound knowledge of human rights and social issues, Te Tiriti o Waitangi dimensions and an understanding of the rights of indigenous peoples.

Gendall pointed out that Rainbow and Derby had done nothing wrong or unlawful themselves, saying “the unlawfulness rests with the minister in making his decision, in which they had no involvement”.

The deployment, which began over the weekend, represents one of the largest single-city mobilizations of Department of Homeland Security personnel in years, according to a person briefed on the operation. The surge dramatically expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota amid heightened political and community tensions.

The person was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the operation and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.

Immigrations and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons said during an interview with Newsmax that the agency was carrying out its “largest immigration operation ever,” though he did not specify how many officers were involved.

Roughly three-quarters of the personnel are expected to come from ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations, the person said. The operation also includes agents from Homeland Security Investigations, ICE’s investigative arm, which typically focuses on fraud and cross-border criminal networks. HSI agents were going door-to-door in the Twin Cities area investigating allegations of fraud, human smuggling and unlawful employment practices, Lyons said.

The HSI agents are largely expected to concentrate on identifying suspected fraud, while deportation officers will conduct arrests of immigrants accused of violating immigration law, according to the person briefed on the operation. Specialized tactical units are also expected to be involved.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was also in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area and accompanied ICE officers during at least one arrest. In a video posted on the social media platform X, Noem is seen wearing a tactical vest and knit cap as agents arrest a man in St. Paul. In the video, she tells the man, whose hands are cuffed behind his back, “You will be held accountable for your crimes.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in a news release that the man arrested was from Ecuador and that he was wanted in Ecuador and Connecticut on charges including murder and sexual assault.

When asked how many officers and agents had been deployed to Minnesota, Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin declined to provide a figure, citing officer safety. She said DHS had surged law enforcement resources to the state and had already made more than 1,000 arrests of people it described as killers, rapists, child sexual offenders and gang members.

The operation also includes personnel from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including Commander Gregory Bovino, whose role in previous federal operations in other cities has drawn scrutiny from local officials and civil rights advocates, the person familiar with the deployment said.

Federal authorities began increasing immigration arrests in the Minneapolis area late last year. Noem and FBI Director Kash Patel announced last week that federal agencies were intensifying operations in Minnesota, with an emphasis on fraud investigations.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly linked his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota to fraud cases involving federal nutrition and pandemic aid programs, many of which have involved defendants with roots in Somalia.

The person with information about the current operation cautioned that its scope and duration could shift in the coming days as it develops.

WASHINGTON—The Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) has filed a brief in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in support of the Trump administration’s lawsuit to shut down Texas’s law granting in-state tuition to illegal aliens who live in the state.

Not only does Texas let illegal aliens attend its public universities, but it lets illegals who meet a three-year state residency requirement pay only in-state tuition, while charging American citizens from out of state much higher tuition.

Congress has passed a law against this practice, giving Americans from any state an entitlement to pay the same in-state tuition to another state’s public universities as illegal aliens who live in that state pay based on their residence.

True, the Supreme Court has held that laws passed by Congress that tell states what laws they may or may not pass are instances of unconstitutional “commandeering” of states. But, as FAIR shows in its brief, if a law of Congress can be read to establish a federal right to engage in certain activity—here, pay the same instate tuition that illegal aliens are allowed to pay based on their residence—that law overrides and preempts any state law that violates that right.

“For Texas, it’s not enough to let illegal aliens—who are not permitted to live in the United States at all—into its state schools, and apply lower admission standards to instate illegal aliens than to out-of-state Americans,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “Even after all that, Texas also lets them pay much less in tuition than the out-of-state Americans have to pay. That’s where federal law and its supremacy come in, however. We hope the court sees that Congress’s law against this practice in clearly constitutional, and rules for the United States.”

Tammy Verhas said Monday her room was entered about 6:45 a.m. by three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents who grabbed and cuffed her husband, Jose Martinez, and detained him in a detention facility. Both are U.S. citizens.

“We were in bed asleep and all of a sudden flashlights were going all over the place and three men came in and grabbed Jose,” Verhas said. “I was trying to film the whole thing, and they brought in a woman to try and keep me from filming, but I was able to shove her off of me.”

Carnival Cruises declined to comment on the incident citing a policy regarding individual guests, and officials with ICE in the Phoenix area were checking on the incident with counterparts in Miami.

While at the detention facility, Martinez was told has his name had come up with warrants for being a violent offender. It was later found that the Martinez they were looking for was not him, and he was released from the detention center and reunited with Verhas off ship by cruise security.

“They gave me no reason, and that name association was their justification,” Martinez said. “I gave all my documented information to Carnival. I should have known before getting on the ship that my name would have been flagged for any issues.

“I was treated like a criminal right from the start,” Martinez added. “I have never been in this type of situation before. I was traumatized.”

Verhas had her phone taken away for a time because of the video she had taken of the incident. ICE told her she would only receive her phone back if she deleted the video she had taken. Verhas complied and her phone was returned to her.

“I was told ‘This is how we do it.’” Verhas said. “I was traumatized by the whole situation.”

Verhas said there have been issues in the past with her husband’s name being flagged.

“This isn’t the first time we have had issues with being stopped,” Verhas said. “We’ve been pulled out of line a number of times with TSA, and all those times we have complied without any issues.”

Verhas and Martinez are not sure what steps they will take next.

He shared the news on Tuesday during an interview with Newsmax.

""We have the largest immigration operation ever taking place right now,"" Lyons told the media outlet. ""It is a great effort by ICE.""

Lyons added that ICE, as well as agents with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS ) have been going ""door-to-door"" to visit companies that were accused of hiring illegal immigrants, as well as businesses that are potentially involved in human trafficking and recent fraud cases.

""States like Minnesota that have a strong sanctuary city policy and sanctuary protections do attract other illegal aliens to come there to take advantage of welfare, public assistance, SNAP benefits,"" he told Newsmax. ""And that's just a magnet that brings a criminal element that can hide in plain sight -- and that's what we're finding up in Minnesota.""

Lyons said (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem was in Minnesota during the operation, adding that agents arrested multiple suspects.

""She ran an awesome, successful operation,"" he said, ""[She] got a suspected murderer and a wanted rapist that was hiding, again, in plain sight in Minneapolis,"" Lyons said. ""And that's what ICE agents are doing on the ground up there.""

DHS shared a clip of the interview and shared it on social media.

""Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS law enforcement is surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens,"" DHS noted on X.

The news comes amid fraud claims in Minnesota.

FBI director Kash Patel last week said he already ""surged personnel and investigative resources"" to the city to dismantle ""large-scale fraud schemes"" exploiting federal programs. The cases allegedly involved members of the area's Somali immigrant community.

""Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide,"" Patel previously wrote on X, noting that the FBI uncovered and dismantled a $250 million fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during the coronavirus pandemic.

Patel said the investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network. He also said the case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions so far.

""The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg,"" Patel added. ""We will continue to follow the money and protect children.""

It also follows allegations made in a 42-minute video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley. In the footage, Shirley visited what appeared to be empty daycare centers, mostly run by members of the Somali community, which receive millions of dollars in taxpayer money.

At one point, he attempted to confront daycare staff members. The video shows a woman yelling, ""Don't open up. It's ICE."" She also tells Shirley and his team to ""go away.""

Shirley asks the woman how she feels about the fraud that's taking place in Minnesota, but she continues to holler.

""Tim Walz and the fraudsters aren’t escaping this one,"" Shirley wrote on X, adding that no children were present at the center. ""In one day my crew and I uncovered over $110,000,000 in fraud, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We the people simply work too hard and pay too much in taxes to allow this to happen, they must be held accountable.""

Walz has since announced he won't be seeking re-election.

The arrest comes days after more immigration officers were reportedly sent to Minnesota in a surge of enforcement that continues the work of Operation Metro Surge that began in December. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was seen taking part in an early morning raid in St. Paul on Tuesday amid the expanded enforcement efforts.

Wilderness Inquiry said in a written statement that the man came into their building in distress as ICE was attempting to apprehend him. The company’s staff let the man stay in their vestibule where he was visible to ICE agents, but did not let agents in the building as they consulted their legal counsel about what to do.

What followed was a back-and-forth through an interpreter between the man, who was inside the office, and immigration agents and Bloomington police, who were outside.

“I am proud of the Wilderness Inquiry team, who showed composure and compassion during a very difficult situation today,” Wilderness Inquiry’s Executive Director Erika Rivers said in the statement.

ICE agents can make arrests in public spaces without a warrant signed by a judge, but need a judicial warrant in order to gain entry and make arrests in private spaces like homes and businesses.

Reached for comment, ICE declined to provide details about the incident or detainee. Bloomington police declined to comment on the arrest, and said their involvement was “limited to helping maintain the peace and ensure the safety of all individuals involved.”

More than two dozen bystanders watched the incident unfold. Zarazua said ICE agents tried to intimidate her into coaxing her boyfriend out, but she refused and demanded to see a judicial warrant.

“I told them they need an arrest warrant signed by a federal judge to do this,” she said. “And they said, ‘No, I don’t need that, I’m going to arrest him no matter what.’”

Law enforcement ultimately presented a felony arrest warrant about two hours after the man arrived at the building, prompting him to voluntarily surrender.

Reports of ICE activity in the Twin Cities proliferated across social media Tuesday. Several videos showed the arrest of an Ecuadorian man in St. Paul, where Noem was present.

“What’s happening right now in Minnesota with all of the immigration officers that are coming is just so unfair,” Zarazua said through tears. “[They’re] separating people from their loved ones.”",https://sahanjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_2190.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 21:57:25.559611

John Larson as ally in fight against Trump - CT Mirror,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2026/01/06/william-tong-endorses-john-larson-as-ally-in-fight-against-trump/,"U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, accepted the endorsement of Attorney General William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, each ignoring the congressman’s three Democratic rivals to focus on their party’s great unifier: President Donald Trump.
“I don’t have to guess what John Larson is about.
Larson is “fighting for people that come to Mayberry Village, that come to the community center here.
He’s fighting for immigrants like my parents, who walk around with a target on their backs every single day,” Tong said.
“That’s why I’m supporting John Larson.","U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, accepted the endorsement of Attorney General William Tong on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, each ignoring the congressman’s three Democratic rivals to focus on their party’s great unifier: President Donald Trump.

The chosen venue for the Tuesday morning press conference was the community center named for his late mother, Lois Nolan Larson, at Mayberry Village, the one-time federal housing project in East Hartford that has been a blue-collar touchstone for Larson through his nearly 50 years in public life, the last 27 as a congressman.

Tong, the first of the state’s six statewide constitutional officers to take sides in the rare intra-party challenge to a Connecticut congressional incumbent, said he and Larson share modest beginnings that shape their politics and fuel their opposition to a president the attorney general has sued 45 times this year.

“I don’t have to guess what John Larson is about. I don’t have to guess what this campaign is about. It’s about the people that live here,” said Tong, the son of Chinese immigrants. “It’s about the people that fight for every inch, every single day.”

Larson, 77, who has not had a Democratic primary since winning the open seat in 1998, is facing a challenge from former Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin, state Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, and Hartford school board member Ruth Fortune.

Tong’s repeated references to Mayberry Village and Larson’s upbringing in a public housing seemed calculated to draw a contrast with Bronin, who grew up in Rye, N.Y., and Greenwich, and is by far the best funded of the three challengers.

Larson is “fighting for people that come to Mayberry Village, that come to the community center here. He’s fighting for immigrants like my parents, who walk around with a target on their backs every single day,” Tong said. “That’s why I’m supporting John Larson. The other reason why I’m supporting John Larson is because in our official roles, we are on the front lines of this fight against a president and the federal government that every day seeks to do us harm.”

Tong’s endorsement was expected. He had joined Larson in September in opposing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants and speaking out against the Department of Homeland Security targeting the congressman over his harsh criticism of the tactics employed by DHE’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Larson had compared masked ICE agents to the SS and Gestapo of Nazi Germany.

On Tuesday, Larson accused Secretary of State Marco Rubio of lying to Congress when he assured members that the Trump administration was not working for regime change in Venezuela, not long before U.S. commandos seized its president, Nicolas Maduro, snubbing congressional leaders who should have been consulted.

“How about respect for the law, the Constitution and the War Powers Act?” Larson said.

He offered sarcastic praise for the president on one count.

“At least he was honest about this: It’s about the oil. It’s about the oil and taking over those refineries,” Larson said. “And by the way, who’s going to defend those refineries and the American corporations that go there? And who’s going to defend that pipeline? United States military. This president and his administration need to come before Congress.”

Larson said Democrats need more than criticism of Trump and pivoted to a favorite topic: the preservation of Social Security. He faulted Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee after President Joe Biden quit the race, for failing to talk about issues other than Trump’s fitness.

“I begged the Harris administration to talk about Social Security, to put it out there, and we didn’t. We talked about Donald Trump, and as bad as he is, if you don’t have a plan, you’re not going to be successful. And we will have a plan, and you’ll hear about it in more detail.”

Larson said he is working with two other members of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal of Massachusetts and Mike Thompson of California, on legislation addressing student debt and the difficulty in renters becoming homeowners.

“We’re going to be back to the new New Deal,” Larson said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG_9382-scaled.jpeg,N,,2026-01-06 16:58:10.201062

Tomas Espin Tapia, a criminal illegal alien from Ecuador, illegally entered the United States on October 23, 2022, and was RELEASED into the country by the Biden administration. His criminal history includes an active warrant in Ecuador for murder and an active warrant for sexual assault in Connecticut. He also has previous convictions in Ecuador for robbery and extortion.

He was convicted of robbery and extortion in Ecuador.”

DHS has surged law enforcement and has already made more than 1,000 arrests of murderers, rapists, pedophiles, and gang members in Minnesota. Just yesterday more than 150 illegal aliens were arrested in Minneapolis. Some of the worst of the worst arrested recently include:

Since Inauguration Day, more than 1.5 million immigrants have either lost or will lose their temporary legal status, including their work authorizations and deportation protections, due to President Donald Trump’s aggressive revocation of legal immigration.

It’s the most rapid loss in legal status for immigrants in recent United States history, experts in immigration policy told States Newsroom. The Trump administration curtailed legal immigration by terminating Temporary Protected Status for more than 1 million immigrants and ending Humanitarian Parole protections for half a million more individuals.

“I don’t think we’ve ever, as a country, seen such a huge number of people losing their immigration status all at once,” said Julia Gelatt, the associate director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute.

The move to strip so many immigrants of their work authorization is likely to not only affect communities, but also batter the economy, both immigration and economic experts told States Newsroom.

“Seeing well over 1 million people lose their work authorization in a single year is a really huge event that has ripple effects for employers and communities and families and our economy as well,” Gelatt said.

Dozens of lawsuits have been filed by immigrant rights groups and TPS recipients themselves challenging the terminations as unlawful.

“This is the continuation of the Trump administration attack against the immigrant community, and specifically about the TPS program, a program that, for many of us has been a good program, a life-saving program,” said Jose Palma, a TPS recipient from El Salvador and coordinator of the National TPS Alliance, which is part of several TPS lawsuits.

Who is granted Temporary Protected Status?

A TPS designation is given because a national’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to due to violence, war, natural disasters or some other unstable condition.

When Congress created the program in 1990, it was initially meant to be temporary, which is why authorizations can be as short as six months and as long as 18 months.

Immigrants who are granted TPS must go through background checks and be vetted each time their status is renewed, but the program does not provide a path to citizenship.

Under the Biden administration, the number of TPS recipients grew, as did the category of humanitarian parole.

That policy decision was heavily criticized by Republicans, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem vowed to reevaluate TPS country designations for terminations during her Senate confirmation hearing this year.

“This program has been abused and manipulated by the Biden administration, and that will no longer be allowed,” Noem said during her hearing.

Before the Trump administration came into office in late January, there were more than 1.3 million immigrants in the TPS program, hailing from 17 countries. Under the first Trump administration, there were roughly 400,000 TPS recipients.

“Almost a million new people got onto TPS protections under President Biden, so we saw a really rapid expansion, and now we’re seeing a very rapid contraction, which is all to say that in the first Trump administration, there weren’t so many people who had TPS,” Gelatt said.

Noem has terminated TPS for immigrants from 11 countries, and the more than 1 million immigrants affected will lose their protections by February.

Noem extended six months’ protection for South Sudan earlier this year, but decided in November to terminate protections by January. She most recently terminated a TPS designation for Ethiopia on Dec. 12.

The other countries with TPS termination are Afghanistan, Burma, Cameroon, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Syria and Venezuela.

“We’ve never seen this many people lose their legal status in the history of the United States,” David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, said. “This is totally unprecedented.”

People losing their status are also concentrated in certain areas. Florida has more than 400,000 TPS recipients, and Texas has nearly 150,000. Bier said he expects certain industries with high TPS workers to feel the impact, such as construction and health care.

Haiti, Venezuela

Immigrants from two countries — Haiti and Venezuela — make up a majority of recipients set to lose their TPS protections, at nearly 935,000 people.

Venezuelans, who make up 605,000 of those 935,000 TPS recipients, were first granted protections during Trump’s first term.

On his final day in office in 2021, his administration issued 18-month deportation protections for Venezuelans — known as Deferred Enforcement Departure, or DED — citing the country’s unstable government under President Nicolás Maduro.

“Through force and fraud, the Maduro regime is responsible for the worst humanitarian crisis in the Western Hemisphere in recent memory,” according to the Jan. 19, 2021, memo. “A catastrophic economic crisis and shortages of basic goods and medicine have forced about five million Venezuelans to flee the country, often under dangerous conditions.”

After the Trump administration’s 18-month DED designation, the Biden administration issued the TPS designation for Venezuelans who came to the U.S. in 2021 and again in 2023. The move created two separate TPS groups for Venezuelans.

“The bottom line is that removing the 935,000 Venezuelans and Haitians would cause the entire economy to contract by more than $14 billion,” said Michael Clemens, a professor in the Department of Economics at George Mason University.

He added that not all the TPS recipients are in the labor market. Some are children or elderly dependents who cannot work. Clemens said the TPS workforce population of Haitians and Venezuelans is about 400,000.

Humanitarian Parole program

Separately, under the Biden administration, nearly 750,000 immigrants had some form of humanitarian parole, granting them work and temporary legal status due to either Russia’s war in Ukraine or efforts by the administration to manage mass migration from Central American countries.

DHS has moved to end humanitarian parole for 532,000 immigrants hailing from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, opening them up for deportation proceedings.

“The onslaught of attacks that we’ve been seeing on temporary forms of immigration status, specifically with a humanitarian focus, is truly saddening and concerning,” said Alice Barrett, a supervising immigration attorney at the immigrant rights group CASA.

Not every recipient has been affected. The agency has kept humanitarian parole for 140,000 Ukrainians who came to the United States after Russia’s invasion in 2022, and 76,000 Afghans who were brought in after the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from their country.

But since the National Guard shooting in late November in Washington, D.C. — tied to an Afghan national granted asylum — the program is under increased scrutiny, and all immigration-related paperwork from Afghans has been halted.

Court decisions influential

This is not the first time the Trump administration has tried to end TPS.

During the president’s first term, he tried to end TPS for Haiti, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Sudan, but the courts blocked those attempts in 2018.

This time is different, said Palma of the National TPS alliance.

“The only thing different right now is that the Supreme Court is allowing the Trump administration to continue with termination of TPS, even though lower courts are saying, ‘No, we should stop the cancellation of TPS for now, until it’s clear whether the decision was illegal or not,’ ” he said.

So far, in emergency appeals, the high court has allowed the Trump administration to move forward in stripping legal status for the two groups of Venezuelan TPS recipients and individuals in the humanitarian parole program.

Barrett at CASA, which is leading the legal challenge of TPS termination for Cameroon and Afghanistan, said when it comes to TPS termination, “what we are seeing in the second Trump administration is a supercharged version of what we saw in the first Trump administration.”

“We are essentially seeing during this administration more actual terminations happening early on even while litigation is pending, which has certainly been disappointing for members of the community, because they’re still left in this limbo,” she said.

Barrett added that even when TPS recipients try to apply for longer-term legal status, they face multiple hurdles.

“For example, we are seeing them questioned or denied relief at asylum interviews because they did not apply for asylum within one year of entering the United States, even though the Code of Federal Regulations clearly creates an exception to this one-year filing deadline for people who have been in other valid status before applying for asylum,” Barrett said.

“These members of our community who have been in lawful status therefore now risk being placed in removal proceedings and even (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) detention, where conditions are increasingly inhumane and dangerous,” she continued.

TPS recipients are still continuing to fight in the courts and share their stories, Barrett said.

“These cases are still in progress, and we remain hopeful that despite preliminary rulings leaving so many hardworking individuals and their families in a state of uncertainty, upon thorough review and litigation of these cases the courts will recognize the improper nature of recent TPS terminations and restore status for those seeking safety here in the United States,” she said.

Why it matters: Venezuelan immigrants had temporary U.S. legal protections until last year, in part due to poor economic conditions and human rights abuses under the Maduro government.

""President Trump's decisive action to remove Maduro marks a turning point for Venezuelans. Now, they can return to the country they love and rebuild its future,"" said U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services spokesperson Matthew Tragesser in a statement.

Zoom in: A Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation in 2023 gave about 348,000 Venezuelans legal status and the opportunity for work permits. The Trump administration terminated that status in April.

Another TPS designation from 2021 gave roughly 268,000 Venezuelans protection and was terminated in November.

Many more Venezuelans live and work in the U.S. with visas or could apply for permanent legal status (like a green card).

Between the lines: Venezuela is ""more free today than it was yesterday,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Sunday, the day after the Maduro raid became public.

Noem said TPS holders can apply for ""refugee status.""

But asylum isn't currently an option. A December policy memo from USCIS ordered a pause on all asylum applications.

Venezuelans are also affected by the Trump administration's pause on all immigration decisions because Venezuela is on the travel ban list.

USCIS did not respond when asked whether there are any changes to process applications from Venezuelans.

The bottom line: Rep. Dan Goldman (D-N.Y.) said Monday, after an unannounced ICE detention oversight visit, that there are now plans to ramp up deportation flights.

""A supervisor told me that in light of the abduction of Nicolás Maduro this past weekend that the Department of Homeland Security is going to be taking another look at the possibility of deporting Venezuelans back to Venezuela,"" he said.

Venezuela has been considered non-cooperative with deportation flights, accepting a limited number of deportees. Many deported Venezuelans had been sent to other countries, including Mexico, to facilitate faster removals.

Anthropic PBC, Case No. 24-CV-5417 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 23, 2025), requiring five law firms seeking a fee award in connection with a class action settlement to file a declaration setting forth the full extent of any of the firms' actual or proposed fee-sharing agreements and the extent to which any arrangement may result in some class members receiving a sweeter recovery than other class members. Judge Alsup also ordered preservation of all communications and other documents relating to such side deals.

The ruling is significant because it shows that only appointed class counsel may be eligible to receive a fee award in connection with a class action settlement, and may not outsource its responsibilities to non-appointed counsel or seek any other arrangements that may favor some class members to the detriment of other class members. Furthermore, the ruling shows that any such side deals must be disclosed publicly prior to any final approval of a class action settlement.

Background

This case is one of several class actions that plaintiffs have filed alleging that developers of generative artificial intelligence (""gen AI"") violated copyright laws by generating infringing outputs and/or by using unauthorized copies of copyrighted works as inputs to train the developer's models.

Many of these gen AI class actions are ""bet-the-company"" lawsuits, even for the world's largest companies. Plaintiffs in gen AI class actions typically invoke the Copyright Act in order to seek millions — and sometimes even billions — of dollars on the theory that thousands or millions of unauthorized copies of copyrighted works, times up to $150,000 per copyrighted work for willful infringement, equals a crushing, settlement-inspiring number.

InBartz, the parties reached a $1.5 billion settlement, which the Court preliminary approved, and which we blogged about previously here and here.

Following preliminary approval, two law firms appointed as class counsel and three additional non-appointed firms filed a petition for fees to be awarded in connection with the class action settlement. The fee petition sought $225 million for class counsel and $75 million for the non-appointed law firms. Id. at 3, 7. These three non-appointed firms had agreed to gather contact information for the class list and to provide input on the claim form and claims process, two for the publisher class members (""Publishers' Coordination Counsel""), and one for the author class members (""Authors' Coordination Counsel""). Id. at 3.

The Court's Decision

The Court declined to rule on the fee petition, ordering that a number of disclosures and preservation efforts be made first in order ""to set the record straight"" concerning aspects of the fee petition. Id. at 1. Such was necessary, according to the Court, because it appeared that counsel may have entered into one or more ""side deals."" Id. at 3.

As the Court explained, ""[t]wo and only two law firms were ever appointed class counsel."" Id. at 1. Moreover, ""preliminary approval and the class notices confirmed that only two firms were approved to serve the class ... Those firms never proposed a fee splitting scheme, and none was ever even preliminarily approved."" Id. at 7.

As to the three non-appointed law firms, the Court found that they ""cannot appoint [themselves] class counsel by showing up. Nor can class counsel appoint someone else to do its work."" Id. at 2. As the Court further explained, it had not had a chance to vet the non-appointed counsel for conflicts, or to prevent duplication of effort by overlapping law firms. Id. at 8. In addition, the Court found it concerning that ""we do not yet know whether 'Publishers' Coordination Counsel' will share any part of their bonanza with one or more publishers so as to give those publishers a premium to not opt out ... and thereby avoid triggering [the defendant]'s right to about the settlement."" Id. Furthermore, the class notice ""never alerted class members that still other lawyers would come out of the woodwork to seek a third again whatever their class counsel would seek for its work."" Id. (emphasis added).

For these reasons, the Court ordered that, within one week, all law firms who filed fee petitions or on whose behalf fee petitions were filed, must publicly file a declaration (not under seal) setting forth the ""full extent"" to which such firm agreed or made a proposal ""to share any portion(s) of any fee award in this class action or in any other class action (putative or certified) involving any party (or class member) herein,"" and stating as to each such agreement or proposal its date, terms, the extent to which it is verbal and the extent to which it is in writing (or in an email or text or other message), and the parties and the names of all persons who made the agreement. Id. at 10. The Court also ordered public disclosure in a declaration of the ""full extent to which any arrangement has been made or proposed by which any class member would receive a sweeter recovery than other class members."" Id. at 10-11. Finally, the Court further ordered that ""[a]ll emails, messages, and written materials relating to any of the above shall be preserved for future potential discovery."" Id. at 11.

Implications For Companies

The Bartz fee petition order is as extraordinary as it is unique. It offers strong precedent for any company defending a large class action and preparing to enter into a class action settlement. Specifically, Bartz shows that plaintiffs' firms seeking any portion of a fee award in connection with such a settlement will need to publicly disclose any side deals prior to any final settlement approval. Therefore, settling defendants should consider seeking to discover any side-deal information before entering into such settlement. That way, any obstacles to final settlement approval such as that presented by the Bartz fee petition order might be considered before the parties reach any settlement.",http://www.mondaq.com/images/profile/companythumb/21358.webp?v=20241101122045,N,,2026-01-06 18:58:55.595498

DHS shared a clip of the interview and shared it on social media.

""Under the leadership of @Sec_Noem, DHS law enforcement is surging to Minneapolis to root out fraud, arrest perpetrators and remove criminal illegal aliens,"" DHS noted on X.

The news comes amid fraud claims in Minnesota.

FBI director Kash Patel last week said he already ""surged personnel and investigative resources"" to the city to dismantle ""large-scale fraud schemes"" exploiting federal programs. The cases allegedly involved members of the area's Somali immigrant community.

""Fraud that steals from taxpayers and robs vulnerable children will remain a top FBI priority in Minnesota and nationwide,"" Patel previously wrote on X, noting that the FBI uncovered and dismantled a $250 million fraud scheme that stole federal food aid meant for vulnerable children during the coronavirus pandemic.

Patel said the investigation exposed sham vendors, shell companies, and large-scale money laundering tied to the Feeding Our Future network. He also said the case led to 78 indictments and 57 convictions so far.

""The FBI believes this is just the tip of a very large iceberg,"" Patel added. ""We will continue to follow the money and protect children.""

It also follows allegations made in a 42-minute video posted by independent journalist Nick Shirley. In the footage, Shirley visited what appeared to be empty daycare centers, mostly run by members of the Somali community, which receive millions of dollars in taxpayer money.

At one point, he attempted to confront daycare staff members. The video shows a woman yelling, ""Don't open up. It's ICE."" She also tells Shirley and his team to ""go away.""

Shirley asks the woman how she feels about the fraud that's taking place in Minnesota, but she continues to holler.

""Tim Walz and the fraudsters aren’t escaping this one,"" Shirley wrote on X, adding that no children were present at the center. ""In one day my crew and I uncovered over $110,000,000 in fraud, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We the people simply work too hard and pay too much in taxes to allow this to happen, they must be held accountable.""

Walz has since announced he won't be seeking re-election.

ICE in Minnesota

What we know:

Activists and city leaders have noted increased ICE activity in Minneapolis on Tuesday. In posts on social media platform Bluesky, Minneapolis City Council member Jason Chavez warned of immigration officers checking Latino residents' status.

In his post, Chavez writes: ""Activity is really hot this morning on Lake Street and Powderhorn. There’s also confirmed ICE vehicles using Uber stickers. Please be careful.""

The backstory:

The Trump administration is reportedly sending upwards of 2,100 ICE agents and Department of Homeland Security investigators into the Twin Cities for the new operation. The basis for the new operation is to take on fraud in the Twin Cities, according to reports.

Sec. Noem in St. Paul

Local perspective:

The Department of Homeland Security also shared videos Tuesday morning of Sec. Kristi Noem assisting agents in the arrest in St. Paul of an Ecuadorian national who they say was wanted for murder.

In the video, agents are seen moving into an apartment near the Payne Market off Payne Avenue near Jenks Avenue East on Tuesday.

What they're saying:

In a post on X, Noem wrote: ""Another murderer and sexual predator off of Minneapolis’s streets thanks to @ICEgov. Just arrested this criminal illegal alien from Ecuador who has an active warrant for murder and sexual assault in Ecuador. He was convicted of robbery and extortion in Ecuador.""

Local perspective:

Tuesday morning, protesters gathered outside the Whipple Building at Fort Snelling, where immigration court takes place, as part of an ""emergency protest.""

The massive 30-day surge began on Sunday with roughly 1,000 additional agents deployed to Minneapolis and St. Paul, including from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a person familiar with the plans told MS NOW. Agents who were already on the ground are expected to have their deployment extended, the person said.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed the deployment to MS NOW but did not provide details on the number of agents on the ground.

The fraud allegations were fueled by a viral video from 23-year-old conservative content creator, Nick Shirley, that alleged Somali-run day cares were receiving federal subsidies without actually providing child care. In the 43-minute video, Shirley visits what he says are fake day care centers. But the evidence for his allegations are unsubtantiated. The director of one of the facilities told a local news station that Shirley had arrived at the center with a team of people, some masked, causing fear.

Still, the video was spread by top officials in the Trump administration, including Vice President JD Vance and FBI Director Kash Patel.

President Donald Trump has often attributed the alleged fraud to the state’s Somali immigrant population. Late last year, ICE carried out an immigration enforcement operation in Minneapolis aimed at people who had received deportation orders, including immigrants from Somalia. As of mid-December, at least 400 immigrants were detained, according to DHS.

Minneapolis is among a growing list of cities targeted by the Trump administration in a nationwide crackdown on crime and immigration. In recent months, agents and National Guard troops have been sent to cities including Washington, D.C., and Memphis. States and cities have filed lawsuits over the actions.

Recommended

In a rare reversal last week, Trump announced he is pulling National Guard troops out of Chicago; Los Angeles; and Portland, Oregon.

The move substantially expands federal law enforcement’s presence in Minnesota amid rising political and community tensions. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced on Monday that he is suspending his campaign for a third term as his administration faces scrutiny over the fraud allegations. DHS recently paused federal child care payments to the state and announced last week that the suspension would be expanded nationwide pending a fraud investigation.

On Monday, ICE posted an email appearing to be from a Hilton hotel that said reservations for DHS and ICE agents had been canceled. A statement from Hilton said the hotel in the email is “independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values.” The company added that it is “investigating this matter with this individual hotel.”

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey’s office and Walz’s office did not immediately respond to MS NOW for comment.","https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1767650186/260105-mn-federal-agent-pi/260105-mn-federal-agent-pi.jpg?_i=AA",N,,2026-01-06 15:57:29.672843

Following Maduro’s capture, Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called on the Trump Administration to reinstate TPS for Venezuelans.
In mid-December, the Venezuelan government claimed that the U.S. had suspended deportation flights to Venezuela, a claim denied by Washington.
Following Maduro’s capture, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to EL PAÍS that the flights are not suspended.","The capture of Nicolás Maduro by U.S. forces has opened a new chapter of uncertainty for many Venezuelan exiles in the United States, for whom the lack of clarity regarding a democratic transition and the possibility of further military action are dampening any thought of returning to their country. This ambiguity is compounded for hundreds of thousands of people who are in limbo after the Trump administration canceled temporary immigration protections, as well as for asylum seekers who fear their cases will be affected by the changing circumstances in Venezuela.

“In the last 48 hours, the community has been in complete panic,” says John De La Vega, a Venezuelan lawyer in Miami who says he has received calls from “hundreds of people” worried about their immigration cases since news broke that a commando unit had captured Maduro in a surprise attack last weekend. “The main uncertainty is: If Maduro has been captured, will my asylum case fall apart? Will the government stop approving asylum cases because of this situation?” says De La Vega.

On the other hand, for many, the news revived hopes that Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Venezuela would be restored after the Trump administration canceled it last year, leaving more than 600,000 Venezuelans in immigration limbo, many of them residents of South Florida, the lawyer added.

This decision was compounded by the cancellation of the humanitarian parole program that had allowed more than 100,000 Venezuelans to live and work legally in the United States for a period of two years.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were indicted in the Southern District of New York on narcoterrorism charges. Trump has stated that the U.S. will run the country: “We’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.” He also asserted that the U.S. military is “prepared to do a second wave” of attacks, although “we probably won’t have to do it.”

But the situation inside Venezuela remains uncertain. Vice President Delcy Rodríguez assumed the interim presidency, but it is unclear who effectively controls the military and security structures that sustained Chavismo for more than two decades. Key regime figures, such as Diosdado Cabello, considered the number two in Chavismo, and high-ranking military officers continue to operate within the country, fueling fears of reprisals and a further narrowing of political space.

Among the diaspora, many believe that the conditions that forced them to flee remain in place, and the country’s immediate future remains uncertain.

One person who lost her TPS status and doesn’t see returning as an option is Rossaly Nava, a 43-year-old Venezuelan who has lived in the U.S. for 10 years. Nava, originally from Maracaibo, was involved with the opposition and had to flee the Chavista regime. Her former boss, a member of parliament, remains detained in Venezuela on charges of treason and other offenses. “This doesn’t guarantee that I can return,” she says. “Maduro isn’t looking for me, but there are those directly responsible, like Diosdado Cabello and his torturers, who know perfectly well who I am. I can’t return until I’m certain that those who attacked me won’t be there.”

When she had TPS, “I was protected,” she explains, but today she only has an asylum process that began 10 years ago. “I consider myself at risk of being returned to a country that is not ready to protect those of us who were linked to the opposition,” she adds.

On Saturday, a crowd in Doral, the Miami-Dade city with the largest Venezuelan diaspora in the country, where many backed Trump in the hope that he would remove Maduro from power, celebrated the latter’s capture. That enthusiasm, however, has given way to discontent following the end of immigration protections, amid an anti-immigrant offensive that has sown fear in the community.

Following Maduro’s capture, Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called on the Trump Administration to reinstate TPS for Venezuelans. But that hope was dashed on Sunday when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem—who canceled TPS for Venezuela four months ago, claiming it was contrary to the national interest—stated that the country is “more free than it was yesterday” and that those who lost TPS could apply for asylum instead.

“That only confused the community even more,” says Helen Villalonga, president of Amavex, a human rights organization, who says that “many people have contacted her” seeking clarification because “they believe they can now apply for asylum, but asylum is not requested from within the United States.”

Furthermore, Villalonga maintains that Venezuelans need protection now more than ever. “Before, we didn’t have an invasion; now we do.”

The confusion also extends to the subject of deportations. In mid-December, the Venezuelan government claimed that the U.S. had suspended deportation flights to Venezuela, a claim denied by Washington. Following Maduro’s capture, a DHS spokesperson confirmed to EL PAÍS that the flights are not suspended.

Patricia Andrade, founder of Venezuela Awareness, warns about the deportations, saying, “You can’t send people to a country that remains unstable, where orders have been given to imprison those who support Trump’s actions.” She says her contacts in Venezuela describe an apparent normalcy, but that “there is a lot of fear” among the population, that paramilitary groups are in the streets, and that Chavistas are “shoring up the few followers they have left.”

Last month, the Trump Administration suspended immigration processing for citizens of a list of countries that includes Venezuela. However, De La Vega, the lawyer, clarifies that asylum has not been eliminated, but rather that “what is suspended is the decision-making process, the government’s approval or denial of cases.” Nevertheless, he warns that the situation is extremely volatile. “We have to wait.

Asylum seekers are individuals who apply for international protection due to fears of persecution or violence in their home countries.1 In 2024, the United Nations estimated that 123.2 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide due to persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations, or other events disturbing public order.2 Among these displaced individuals, many sought asylum in countries with established protective programs, such as the US, where pending asylum cases exceeded 2.2 million in 2025.3

This unprecedented increase in asylum cases has coincided with increasingly restrictive US border policies. Citing border security concerns, the US implemented the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) in January 2019, requiring asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border to remain in Mexico while awaiting hearings. The MPP marked a shift from international norms, which traditionally permitted asylum seekers residence in the host country during case processing. Individuals subjected to the MPP reported being returned to border towns where they faced dangers including threats of violence and kidnapping, forced family separation, and unstable living conditions, including living in overcrowded tent cities without access to running water or electricity.4 Objective systematic data on trauma in this population are limited, although nongovernmental organizations such as Human Rights First and Amnesty International estimate the number of violent attacks on individuals subjected to the MPP to be over 13 000, with the true number likely higher due to underreporting.5,6

Due to these concerns, the MPP remained subject to legal and policy challenges and was suspended temporarily in January 2021, formally halted after a Supreme Court ruling in June 2022, and reinstated again by the US Department of Homeland Security in January 2025.7 In parallel, other policies such as Title 42 expulsions based on public health safety with the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent asylum transit bans limiting asylum applications for individuals who had already traversed multiple countries similarly restricted access at the US southern border, showing a broader transition in the US asylum landscape toward more restrictive migration policies.8,9

Such measures not only limited access to asylum but also placed asylum seekers, a group already fleeing persecution and violence in their home countries, into unstable environments associated with a heightened risk of trauma. Global research has consistently documented high rates of trauma-related conditions among asylum seekers, including a meta-analysis of more than 5000 adults in 2020 that estimated a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence of 31%.10,11 A more recent 2021 study of 57 asylum seekers from Central America, a region impacted by the MPP, showed PTSD rates approaching 79%.12 With respect to the MPP, several small case series and reports from nongovernmental organizations have raised concerns about the exacerbation of trauma for those subjected to the MPP.13-17 However, larger systematic studies on individuals exposed to the MPP remain limited, in part due to challenges with access and follow-up in this displaced population. To address this gap, forensic medical evaluations and legal affidavits, which are frequently collected to support asylum claims by providing objective documentation of trauma, could serve as valuable resources for examining the association of health outcomes with the MPP. To better understand the association of exposure to the MPP with migration-related trauma, we examined legal affidavits and forensic medical examinations of 94 asylum seekers at an academic-affiliated asylum clinic, comparing traumatic experiences before and after the implementation of the MPP in 2019.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study evaluated traumatic experiences before and after the introduction of the MPP in January 2019. Participants were selected between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2022, from an academic-affiliated asylum clinic providing pro bono forensic evaluations to asylum seekers. These forensic medical evaluations were performed for asylum seekers to document objective findings of their previous trauma and are associated with a higher rate of asylum application success. A study of over 2800 asylum applicants between 2008 and 2018 found that nearly 82% of those applying for immigration relief were granted relief compared with only 42% without a forensic medical examination.18 Clinicians performing the forensic medical evaluations undergo training to follow the Istanbul Protocol, which is a set of international guidelines for the effective investigation and documentation of torture and other human rights violations.19 Evaluations were conducted by the University of Southern California Human Rights Clinic in Los Angeles, California, and Tijuana, Mexico, as well as remotely due to limitations with the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligibility criteria included all asylum seekers aged 18 years or older who completed forensic medical examinations at the clinic during this period. Exclusions included age younger than 18 years, examinations missing substantial data, and cases containing potentially identifiable material even after deidentification. Of 108 forensic evaluations screened, 14 were excluded (9 individuals younger than 18 years, 3 records with duplicate information, and 2 with insufficient data) leaving 94 cases for analysis (eFigure in Supplement 1). Data from legal declarations and forensic exams were securely stored in REDCap and deidentified. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Southern California Social Behavioral Institutional Review Board, which waived the requirement of informed consent due to the research being retrospective and posing minimal risk to participants with deidentified data. The study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline for cohort studies.

A standardized data abstraction form was developed to record demographic characteristics (age, sex, and country of origin) and study outcomes focusing on MPP exposure, traumatic events, and reporting of PTSD. Exposure to the MPP was classified from the legal documentation and corroborated by forensic examiner report. The primary outcome variable of interest was traumatic exposures during migration, categorized as physical violence, sexual violence, violence against family or friends, violence by organized criminal groups, violence by government organizations, forced labor, and extortion or robbery (eTable in Supplement 1). Posttraumatic stress disorder was assessed based on either documentation by the forensic examiner stating the participant’s presentation was consistent with PTSD or a formal score on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, when available. The demographic data in our study were collected using predefined categories on the intake form, which specified ethnicity rather than race. Ethnicity, when reported, was classified according to the original source documentation and recorded by the researchers given their potential relevance to the outcomes of interest. The available response options included: Asian; African, Afro-Latino, or Afro-Caribbean; Hispanic or Latin American; Middle Eastern; White; Other, and Not stated. “Other” included options such as Indigenous, Pacific Islander, or other multiracial backgrounds not captured by the other categories. Sex was documented in applications and included in the data abstraction. Conversely, gender identity was reported in a minority of cases, typically when relevant to the asylum claim (eg, persecution based on gender identity), so it was not systematically included in analyses, although LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and other) status, when reported, was recorded (Table 1). Data abstraction was performed by 3 researchers (K.J., S.M., and K.E.). Fifteen percent of cases were dual-abstracted to assess interrater reliability, showing high agreement between abstractors (pooled κ = 0.81). The remaining cases were divided evenly among the 3 researchers.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis was conducted from January 2023 to May 2025 using Stata, version 17 (StataCorp LLC). Logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association of exposure to the MPP with trauma during migration. Specifically, the odds of an asylum seeker reporting any of the traumatic events listed during migration was measured. To limit potential confounders with the year of evaluation and changing asylum landscape, we divided patients into 3 groups anchored on the introduction of the MPP in January 2019: asylum seekers from 2016 to 2018 (n = 26), asylum seekers from 2019 to 2022 exposed to the MPP (n = 22), and asylum seekers from 2019 to 2022 who were not exposed to the MPP due to exemptions or alternative entry points (n = 46). Post-2019 is used to refer to the group that includes the years 2019 through 2022. Participants in the post-2019 non-MPP group were excluded from the MPP for a variety of reasons including alternate entry points and exemption from the policy based on home country.

Statistical tests were 2-sided. Logistic regression was performed between the pre-2019 group and both the post-2019 MPP and post-2019 non-MPP groups to calculate the odds that any traumatic event occurred during migration, reported as odds ratio (ORs) with 95% CIs and a preestablished statistical significance of α = .05. Additional sensitivity analysis was completed with only participants with a Latin American country of origin to assess for regional bias. Additional adjustments for other factors (age, sex, and reason for asylum) were not performed because of the small sample size.

Qualitative analysis was performed using a deductive approach. Quotations from affidavits and forensic examinations of MPP asylum seekers were reviewed and grouped into predefined trauma categories. Selected illustrative quotations were chosen to highlight key themes. All quotations were deidentified and pulled directly from source data. Some appear in first or third person, reflecting the way they were originally documented by attorneys or clinicians.

Results

Among 94 participants, the mean (SD) age was 33.1 (10.1) years, 56 (60%) were men and 38 (40%) were women, and 68 (72%) originated from Latin America, with Africa the next most common region (20 [21%]) (Table 1). Additional participants were from Asia, the Middle East, and Russia. The most common asylum claim across all groups was persecution based on social group membership, reported by 75 participants (80%), followed by political opinion, reported by 29 participants (31%). The MPP group had a younger mean (SD) age of 30.6 (6.9) years and higher percentage of participants from Latin America (19 of 22 [86%]).

The primary outcome, trauma reported during migration, was higher in the MPP group (14 of 22 participants [64%]) compared with in the pre-2019 group (3 of 26 participants [12%]) (OR, 9.20; 95% CI, 2.12-39.89) (Table 2). The post-2019 group not exposed to the MPP did not have higher odds of trauma (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.32-5.85). In a sensitivity analysis limited to participants from Latin America, the OR for trauma between the pre-2019 and MPP group was 4.40 (95% CI, 0.75-25.84), which did not reach statistical significance.

As a secondary outcome, the clinical examiner’s impression of PTSD was higher in the MPP group, (21 of 22 participants [95%]) than in the pre-2019 group (11 of 26 [42%]) (OR, 28.64; 95% CI, 3.33-246.25) (Table 2). In the post-2019 non-MPP group, 36 of 46 participants (78%) were assessed as having PTSD, a higher rate than the pre-2019 group (OR, 4.91; 95% CI, 1.72-13.99).

In addition to the quantitative patterns of trauma prevalence, we examined qualitative narratives to further characterize the nature of traumatic experiences. Thematic analysis of affidavits and forensic examinations highlighted different forms of trauma reported by asylum seekers. Major themes included physical and sexual violence, violence directed toward family or friends, police violence, gang violence, extortion, forced labor, and robbery. These narratives contextualize the quantitative findings by illustrating the lived experiences of asylum seekers. Representative deidentified quotes for each theme are presented in Table 3 and map onto the higher rate of migration-related trauma observed quantitatively in the MPP group.

Discussion

This cohort study found that exposure to the MPP was associated with higher odds of migration-related trauma and PTSD among asylum seekers. These results highlight the association of MPP exposure with migration-related trauma and its potential downstream health outcomes. We discuss these findings in 3 areas: demographic, trauma and protective factors, and policy implications.

First, we examined demographic patterns across groups. Asylum seekers exposed to the MPP were the youngest group in our cohort and had the highest proportion from Latin America. This finding aligns with recent studies showing younger age distributions among asylum seekers in the US.20 Several factors may explain this finding. First, the MPP was originally designed to apply primarily to individuals from Latin American countries traversing Mexico, which shifted the affected population toward primarily Central American nationals. Second, trends from the Northern Triangle countries (Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador) in particular have shown an increase in younger migrants over the past decade.12 Data from the World Bank correlate with this finding, showing that Central American asylum seekers are increasingly arriving in their early 20s with a growing proportion of women and families compared with previous years.21 These demographic trends are consistent with our finding that the MPP group skewed younger than other groups in our cohort.

These results are consistent with previous research showing high rates of trauma at the US-Mexico border.12 ,14-16,22,23 Systemic gang violence was a common reason asylum seekers in our cohort fled their home country, and reports document that gang-related murders of deported asylum seekers and continued exploitation during migration continue to be problems facing migrants in Mexico.22 Returned migrants, known as “retornados,” face marginalization and risk revictimization.16 In a Mexican migrant encampment study, women expressed widespread fear of sexual violence and distrust of authorities.23 Such themes are demonstrated in our forensic evaluations (Table 3). For example, 1 participant described repeated robberies and direct threats from gang members, including receiving messages stating “I know where you are… where you live.” Another woman described an inability to secure safe lodging in Mexico, which led to sexual violence against her child.

In contrast, asylum seekers after 2019 who were not subjected to the MPP did not report higher rates of trauma. Access to safer communities and services in the US may have been protective against trauma. Research suggests that protective factors such as social support, faith, and civic engagement have been associated with decreased migrant stress.24 Those admitted to the US likely benefited more from these factors. However, while protective factors may mitigate the association of migration-related trauma, the more important distinction is that individuals exposed to the MPP were more likely to be placed in high-risk environments such as tent cities or unsafe border regions with inherently higher trauma exposure.

Similar patterns have emerged globally, where restrictive policies and high-risk environments have been associated with higher rates of trauma and a greater burden of mental health disease among displaced populations. Research on Syrian refugees living in tent-city camps documented overcrowding, insecurity, and limited access to basic services being associated with a high rate of PTSD.25 Médecins Sans Frontières reported that among a group of migrants who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy, over 80% of respondents experienced torture either in their country of origin or in transit, most commonly at the hands of traffickers (61%) or law enforcement (29%).26 More than one-third of these incidents occurred in countries designated by European authorities as “safe” for migrants. This parallels the experiences of individuals in our cohort who, despite being returned to Mexico under the MPP, continued to report unsafe and harmful conditions. Similarly, a study of nearly 500 Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh found high rates of depression and PTSD that were linked not only with exposure to previous trauma but also ongoing daily stressors such as overcrowding, food insecurity, and violence and crime in their refugee camps.27 Together, these findings highlight how restrictive migration and asylum policies such as the MPP that compel migrants to remain in unsafe environments can perpetuate rather than alleviate trauma among displaced populations.

These results should be interpreted in the broader context of ongoing US border policy debates. Although the MPP aimed to manage migration and strengthen border security, it was associated in our study with higher reported rates of violence, exploitation, and psychological distress. This finding adds to evidence that deterrent-based approaches may be associated with higher rates of migrant trauma and reliance on riskier migration routes, compounding the premigration trauma that compelled many asylum seekers to flee their home countries in the first place.28

Despite its suspension in 2021, the MPP was reinstated in January 2025 and continues to shape the asylum process.7 Other recent measures, such as the US Department of Homeland Security Third Country Removals,29 permit deportation to countries where assurances of migrant safety are uncertain. Although such policies may reduce cross-border entry or perpetuate the image of security in the short term, our results suggest that they may do so at the cost of exposing migrants to unsafe environments. Policymakers should therefore weigh not only border security objectives but also the public health and human rights consequences of these policies.

These findings highlight the importance of considering the health and safety of asylum seekers in the design of asylum policies. Potential approaches such as expanded legal pathways, increased access to mental and trauma support, and targeted international initiatives to address root causes of migration, such as systemic violence and economic instability in countries of origin, could reduce the harms observed in this study. If the MPP continues, a more robust multinational effort to ensure asylum seekers receive adequate protection and basic social support would be important for their health and safety.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, the sample was drawn from a medicolegal clinic that evaluates primarily asylum seekers who have obtained legal representation and undergone forensic medical examinations. Amnesty International has estimated that only 5% of asylum seekers subject to the MPP have been able to obtain legal representation, so our patient population likely represents a subgroup with greater access to legal and medical resources.6 Second, the retrospective design of this study limits causal inference and relies on preexisting documentation, which may vary in documentation style and introduce reporting bias. For example, the higher rate of PTSD observed in both the MPP and post-2019 non-MPP groups may reflect increased attention to screening and documentation of PTSD in recent years rather than true differences among groups.

Preexisting conditions and socioeconomic factors were not controlled for and may have confounded the observed associations. The MPP group skewed younger and had a larger proportion of migrants from Central America. A planned sensitivity analysis limited to Latin American participants showed that the odds of migration-related trauma in the MPP group was not significantly different compared with the pre-2019 group, highlighting that migration from Latin America, a region heavily affected by violence and instability, may be an independent risk factor in itself for migration-related trauma.12 In addition, logistic regression analyses were unadjusted given the small sample size, which limited our ability to control for all factors. Finally, other asylum policies implemented after 2019, such as the asylum transit ban and changes to US Customs and Border Protection processing, may have contributed to the observed differences, making it difficult to isolate the associations of MPP alone.

Conclusions

In this retrospective cohort study of asylum seekers before and after the introduction of the MPP in 2019, exposure to the MPP was associated with higher rates of trauma experiences during migration and a higher rate of PTSD reported in forensic medical examinations. These findings highlight the possible health consequences of restrictive border policies and underscore the need for immigration policies that consider the safety and well-being of asylum seekers throughout the migration process.",https://cdn.jamanetwork.com/ama/content_public/journal/jamanetworkopen/939758/zoi251354t1_1766526075.21591.png?Expires=2147483647&Signature=OXtrjfMik3Amwe3VBf-XQZulDWr6VB~pXDdDEvUY-A5Jp6LAkSfYGKVg3X64hOf0~01ofJQmo-U6ypcRyHnkNCgfMVfMrFT6OXYQ424WHkW5yQCC5MtirI8rS-VdWlsCo2hFZQP4Pxc64HDIdl-JBIkMkA3MOvNItquen7w1KuEhHZfWwpd8lKw3MBqw50eBvTkp9Fwy~Uc0XjlrAi3ta~jfR6NsHvvmEfKE~n4R5~gvxy~DqKjHLEymMmn1Hzwnx0~GzV2fzpMUQjDVgdRpKq0ks125r10fdgR~Nt5gd5Adin3pTZAxD6HCZJgpmlo12l9YQYOLWSHlYvVmTimMgg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA,N,,2026-01-06 14:57:21.711024

Proposal would hold sanctuary sheriffs accountable with criminal penalties, removal from office; modeled on Texas law upheld by federal courts

Representative Nancy Mace today proposed the South Carolina Immigration Enforcement Act, legislation that would impose penalties on sheriffs and jail administrators who refuse to honor federal immigration detainer requests. The bill is modeled on Texas SB 4, which was upheld by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018.

“South Carolina already bans sanctuary cities on paper. This bill puts teeth behind that ban,” said Rep. Mace. “If a sheriff releases a criminal illegal alien back onto our streets because they refuse to work with ICE, they should face the consequences, including removal from office.”

Under current South Carolina law, political subdivisions are prohibited from adopting sanctuary policies, but lacks enforcement. The State Law Enforcement Division has never found a single jurisdiction out of compliance, even as some have refused dozens of ICE detainer requests and been designated “non-cooperative” by federal immigration authorities.

The South Carolina Immigration Enforcement Act would:

• Require jails to honor ICE detainer requests and notify ICE 48 hours before releasing detainees

• Create a misdemeanor offense for those who knowingly refuse to comply, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine

• Trigger automatic removal from office upon conviction

• Impose civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day on noncompliant jurisdictions

• Cut off Local Government Fund appropriations for three years to jurisdictions that violate the law

• Allow any citizen to file a complaint with the Attorney General

BUILT TO WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGES

The legislation was drafted to address anticipated Constitutional challenges that have been raised against similar laws in other states:

Anti-Commandeering Doctrine: The Supreme Court’s ruling in Printz v. United States (1997) held that the federal government cannot compel state officers to enforce federal law. However, this bill is a state law requiring state officers to cooperate with federal authorities, not a federal mandate. States have broad authority to direct their own employees. The Fifth Circuit upheld Texas SB 4 on precisely this basis, finding that a state choosing to require its officers to cooperate with ICE does not violate anti-commandeering principles.

Fourth Amendment Concerns: Some courts have found that holding individuals solely on an ICE detainer, which is an administrative request, not a judicial warrant, may violate the Fourth Amendment. This bill addresses that concern by including an explicit exception: if the detainee provides proof of U.S. citizenship or lawful immigration status (driver’s license, passport, or federal documentation), the detainer compliance requirement does not apply. This mirrors the Texas model that survived court challenge.

Due Process / Removal from Office: The bill’s removal provision is grounded in existing South Carolina constitutional and statutory authority. Article VI, Section 8 of the South Carolina Constitution provides that any officer convicted of a “crime involving moral turpitude” may be suspended by the Governor and, upon conviction, the position “shall be declared vacant.” The bill explicitly designates a violation as official misconduct under S.C. Code §8-1-80, which already provides for removal upon conviction. This is not a novel mechanism, it leverages existing state law.

First Amendment / Criminalizing Speech: Unlike Tennessee’s recent legislation which criminalizes voting for sanctuary policies, this bill criminalizes only the act of knowingly refusing to comply with a detainer, not speech, advocacy, or voting. This avoids First Amendment concerns that could arise from punishing officials for their policy positions rather than their conduct.

Indemnification / Liability Shield: The bill includes a state indemnification provision protecting law enforcement agencies and officers from civil liability when they comply with detainer requests in good faith. This removes a key excuse some sheriffs have cited for non-cooperation, fear of lawsuits, while ensuring officers are protected when following state law.

“We studied what worked in Texas and what’s being challenged elsewhere,” Rep. Mace said. “This bill is designed to hold up in court. It uses existing South Carolina constitutional provisions, follows the Texas model the Fifth Circuit already blessed, and avoids the First Amendment problems in Tennessee’s approach.”

Mace previously led congressional oversight efforts investigating South Carolina Sanctuary Sheriff Kristin Graziano who refused to cooperate with ICE. Subsequently, Graziano released many violent, criminal illegal aliens onto the streets of South Carolina from 2021 to 2024 when voters elected a new sheriff due to this issue.

The number of 287(g) agreements in South Carolina has grown from 3 to 20 counties since January 2025, along with the State Law Enforcement Division and three municipalities.

“Our sheriffs who are doing it right deserve recognition. Any one who isn’t should be held accountable. This bill does both, and it’s built to last. There will never be another sanctuary sheriff in South Carolina if I’m in charge.”

I hope that you managed to have a bit of break over the holidays and are feeling well rested and ready for the many challenges that we already know 2026 will have in store, both for migrants and for those of us working to support them.

Regulations laid just before the break have brought some provisions of the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act into force today, including the ability to take people’s mobile phones from them when they arrive in the UK. This seems likely to make it more difficult for people to access and provide evidence for their asylum claim, as well as creating barriers to maintaining contact with family. Access to legal representatives will need to be facilitated somehow. I will write up a short post on the regulations as a whole a.s.a.p. but I have looked at these powers in a bit more detail here.

LaMalfa, 65, was a fourth-generation rice farmer from Oroville and staunch Trump supporter who had represented his Northern California district for the last 12 years. His seat was one of several that was in jeopardy under the state’s redrawn districts approved by voters with Proposition 50.

Emergency personnel responded to a 911 call from LaMalfa’s residence at 6:50 p.m. Monday, according to the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. The congressman was taken to the Enloe Medical Center in Chico, where he died while undergoing emergency surgery, authorities said.

An autopsy to determine the cause of death is planned, according to the sheriff’s office.

LaMalfa’s district — which stretches from the northern outskirts of Sacramento, through Redding at the northern end of the Central Valley and Alturas in the state’s northeast corner — is largely rural, and constituents have long said they felt underrepresented in liberal California.

LaMalfa put much of his focus on boosting federal water supplies to farmers, and seeking to reduce environmental restrictions on logging and extraction of other natural resources.

One LaMalfa’s final acts in the U.S. House was to successfully push for the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools Act, a long-standing financial aid program for schools surrounded by untaxed federal forest land, whose budgets could not depend upon property taxes, as most public schools do. Despite broad bipartisan support, Congress let it lapse in 2023.

In an interview with The Times as he was walking onto the House floor in mid-December, LaMalfa said he was frustrated with Congress’s inability to pass even a popular bill like that reauthorization.

The Secure Rural Schools Act, he said, was a victim of a Congress in which “it’s still an eternal fight over anything fiscal.” It is “annoying,” LaMalfa said, “how hard it is to get basic things done around here.”

In a statement posted on X, California Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said he considered LaMalfa “a friend and partner” and that the congressman was “deeply committed to his community and constituents, working to make life better for those he represented.”

“Doug’s life was one of great service and he will be deeply missed,” Schiff wrote.

Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in a statement called LaMalfa a “devoted public servant who deeply loved his country, his state, and the communities he represented.”

“While we often approached issues from different perspectives, he fought every day for the people of California with conviction and care,” Newsom said.

Flags at the California State Capitol in Sacramento will be flown at half-staff in honor of the congressman, according to the governor.

Before his death, LaMalfa was facing a difficult reelection bid to hold his seat. After voters approved Proposition 50 in November — aimed at giving California Democrats more seats in Congress — LaMalfa was drawn into a new district that heavily favored his likely opponent, state Sen. Mike McGuire, a Democrat who represents the state’s northwest coast.

LaMalfa’s death puts the Republican majority in Congress in further jeopardy, with a margin of just two votes to secure passage of any bill along party lines after the resignation of Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene on Monday evening.

Adding to the party’s troubles, Rep. Jim Baird, a Republican from Indiana, was hospitalized on Tuesday for a car crash described by the White House as serious. While Baird is said to be stable, the Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson from Louisiana, will not be able to rely on his attendance. And he has one additional caucus member — Thomas Massie of Kentucky — who has made a habit of voting against the president, bringing their margin for error down effectively to zero.

President Trump, addressing a gathering of GOP House members at the Kennedy Center, addressed the news at the start of his remarks, expressing “tremendous sorrow at the loss of a great member” and stating his speech would be made in LaMalfa’s honor.

“He was the leader of the Western caucus — a fierce champion on California water issues,” Trump said. “He was great on water. ‘Release the water!’ he’d scream out. And a true defender of American children.”

“You know, he voted with me 100% of the time,” Trump added.

A native of Oroville, LaMalfa attended Butte College and then earned an ag-business degree from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. He served in the California Assembly from 2002 to 2008 and the California State Senate from 2010 to 2012. Staunchly conservative, he was an early supporter of Proposition 209, which ended affirmative action in California, and he also pushed for passage of the Protection of Marriage Act, Proposition 22, which banned same-sex marriage in California.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6c0773f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5392x2831+0+381/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F03%2F30%2F590e97e6485a910937ce92745cab%2Fla-me-doug-lamalfa-town-hall03-ha.JPG,N,,2026-01-06 13:57:20.037247

President Donald Trump did not exceed his authority when he issued a Sept. 19 proclamation requiring employers to pay an additional $100,000 before new H-1B visas can be processed, a federal district court judge held Dec. 23 in Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

President Trump legitimately exercised his broad discretion authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict the entry of noncitizens into the U.S., the judge found. Trump found the proclamation was necessary to counter abuse of the H-1B program, which the proclamation asserts is harming American workers and creating a national security threat, he said.

The ruling does not discount the contributions H-1B workers are making to the American economy, the judge stressed. But the parties’ debate over how the proclamation will affect employers and the economy is not within the court’s province to decide, so long as it is within the confines of the law, she said.

Dive Insight:

The Association of American Universities and the Chamber, a business federation with approximately 300,000 members, sued the Trump Administration in October. It was the first of at least three lawsuits by different groups challenging the proclamation, including California v. Noem, filed mid-December by 20 state attorney generals from mainly Democratic states.

The litigation focuses on two issues — that President Trump exceeded his delegated authority, or acted “ultra vires,” under the INA and that DHS and the State Department “arbitrarily” implemented the proclamation without following proper notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act.

The judge ruled against AAU and the Chamber on both claims. The INA’s “exceedingly broad language” gives President Trump the authority to issue the proclamation, which he backed with evidence showing how the H-1B program is being abused, and the proclamation does not contravene the INA’s H-1B scheme, the judge held.

As for the second issue, DHS and the State Department “plainly do not act ‘arbitrarily and capriciously’ or ‘contrary to law’ in implementing a legally permissible presidential directive,” the judge wrote. “Indeed, defendants here had no other course of action” because agencies “‘may not simply disregard’ a binding presidential directive,” she said.

The Department of Homeland Security says that the man had a rifle and pointed it at the agent.

The family has a lot of questions, and what they're looking for most of all are answers. About a dozen of the man's family and community members came together on Monday to ensure that there is a thorough investigation.

""From day one that he was born, I knew that he was my joy,"" said Franceola Armstrong, the mother of 43-year-old Keith Porter.

Armstrong described her son as caring, hardworking and uplifting to those around him.

""When he came around, people looked for him. He was a joy to be around. My son, the biggest heart, sympathetic, appreciative, so much gratitude,"" Armstrong said.

On New Year's Eve, the father of two was shot and killed by an off-duty ICE agent.

According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security, the ICE agent said he heard gunshots outside of his apartment that sounded like they were getting closer. DHS says, ""The officer took his ICE-authorized firearm and left his apartment to investigate.""

Loved ones say Porter fired gunshots outside as part of a New Year's Eve celebration.

""He claims he heard gunshots were getting closer to his apartment, but rather than staying at a position of safety, he left his apartment and went downstairs to what would be a position of danger,"" said attorney Jamal Tooson with Lessem, Newstat & Tooson.

According to DHS, the ICE agent identified himself, and that's when Porter aimed the rifle at him. The agent then ordered Porter to put down the weapon, and when he didn't comply, the off-duty officer shot him. The agency claims Porter fired three rounds at the officer before he died. The off-duty ICE officer was not injured.

Tooson, however, says they've spoken with neighbors who say they did not hear an agent identify themselves.

Now, Porter's family and attorney are looking for answers. They say the ICE officer wasn't trained for that situation and should have called police and waited for them to arrive.

""But instead of staying in his apartment for a trained law enforcement officer from LAPD to respond, he made the premeditated and calculated decision to grab a firearm,"" Tooson said.

He announced his decision on the fifth anniversary of the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, which he invoked while criticizing Trump's ""attacks on our democracy.""

Goldman closed the video with an indirect swipe ahead of a primary challenge from former state Comptroller Brad Lander, an ally of New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani who is running against Goldman from his left.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., slammed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's announced overhaul yesterday of the childhood vaccine schedule that recommends fewer shots.

Cassidy, who chairs the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said in a statement on X that as a doctor who treated patients for decades, his top priority is protecting children and families. He noted that multiple children have died or have been hospitalized after contracting measles and two kids died in his state from whooping cough.

""All of this was preventable with safe and effective vaccines,"" Cassidy said. ""The vaccine schedule IS NOT A MANDATE. It’s a recommendation giving parents the power. Changing the pediatric vaccine schedule based on no scientific input on safety risks and little transparency will cause unnecessary fear for patients and doctors, and will make America sicker.""

The CDC is recommending that all children get vaccines for 11 diseases, down from the 18 that were previously on the childhood schedule.

European NATO allies warned the United States today that they would “not stop defending” the values of sovereignty and territorial integrity following Trump’s threats against the Danish island of Greenland.

Trump and his team have ramped up hostile suggestions that they want to seize Greenland, a vast Artic island of just 50,000 people that has mineral and strategic significance. The U.S. attack against Venezuela and capture of President Nicolás Maduro — which the United Nations said undermined international law — has raised fears that this might not be an empty threat.

It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia’s war in Ukraine.

George Conway, the longtime conservative lawyer who became a prominent critic of Trump, is officially launching a Democratic campaign for Congress in Manhattan today, the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

In an interview, Conway framed his campaign for New York’s 12th District squarely around Trump, calling for his impeachment and for the U.S. to undertake a “modern legal reconstruction” to “make sure this never happens again.”

“We’re at a crossroads in our country, and Donald Trump is the greatest threat to the Constitution and the rule of law and democratic government that we have ever seen in our lifetime,” Conway, 62, said. “And I want to fight that. He’s a criminal. He defies the law. He thinks he’s the law, and that’s not just an abstraction about the rule of law. He’s hurting people in this country and in my district by using his power to enrich himself instead of using it for the good of the people. He’s running the country like a mob boss.”

Five years after he and his allies tried and failed to overturn the results of the 2020 election, Trump is using his time back in the White House to take a series of actions aimed at erasing or rewriting the Jan. 6, 2021, siege on the U.S. Capitol, with more likely to come.

Trump mass pardoned Jan. 6 rioters on his first day back in office. Justice Department officials and FBI agents involved in the massive investigation and prosecution were fired. Dozens of other supporters involved in efforts to overturn the election results have been pre-emptively pardoned.

Chuck Schumer, the top Democrat in the chamber, has said the party will push for a vote within the week. By all accounts, the odds of its success remain long.

Since Trump took office for a second term in 2025, Congress has weighed multiple bills that would force him to seek legislative approval before initiating a military strike.

But the latest attack on Venezuela offers a stark instance of presidential overreach, one that is “crying out for congressional action”, according to David Janovsky, the acting director of the Constitution Project at the Project on Government Oversight.

Experts say it is also one of the clearest tests in recent history of whether Congress will continue to cede its authority to check US military engagement abroad.

“There are a lot of angles where you can come at this to say why it’s a clear-cut case,” Janovsky told Al Jazeera.

He pointed out that, under the US Constitution, Congress alone wields the authority to allow military action. He also noted that the Venezuela attack “is in direct contravention of the UN Charter, which is, as a treaty, law in the United States”.

“Any of the fig leaves that presidents have used in the past to justify unilateral military action just don’t apply here,” Janovsky added. “This is particularly brazen.”

An uphill battle

Since August, the Trump administration has signalled plans to crank up its “maximum pressure” campaign against Venezuela.

That month, Trump reportedly signed a secret memo calling on the US military to prepare for action against criminal networks abroad. Then, on September 2, the Trump administration began conducting dozens of strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats off the Venezuelan and Colombian coasts.

That deadly bombing campaign was itself condemned as a violation of international law and an affront to Congress’s constitutional powers. It coincided with a build-up of US military assets near Venezuela.

Trump also dropped hints that the US military campaign could quickly expand to alleged drug-trafficking targets on Venezuelan soil. “When they come by land, we’re going to be stopping them the same way we stopped the boats,” Trump said on September 16.

The strikes prompted two recent votes in the House of Representatives in December: one that would require congressional approval for any land strikes on the South American country, and one that would force Trump to seek approval for strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats.

Both resolutions, however, failed roughly along party lines. A similar resolution in the Senate, which would have required congressional approval before any more attacks, also fell short in November.

But speaking to reporters in a phone call just hours after the US operation on Saturday, Senator Tim Kaine said he hoped the brashness of Trump’s latest actions in Venezuela would shock lawmakers into action.

Republicans, he said, can no longer tell themselves that Trump’s months-long military build-up in the Caribbean and his repeated threats are a “bluff” or a “negotiating tactic”.

“It’s time for Congress to get its a** off the couch and do what it’s supposed to do,” Kaine said.

In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, US Senator Chris Murphy also agreed that it was “true” that Congress had become impotent on matters of war, a phenomenon that has spanned both Democratic and Republican administrations.

Bash pointed to former President Barack Obama’s 2011 military deployment to Libya, which went unchecked by Congress.

“Congress needs to own its own role in allowing a presidency to become this lawless,” Murphy responded.

Republicans ho-hum about resolutions

Under the US Constitution, only Congress can declare war, something it has not done since World War II.

Instead, lawmakers have historically passed Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs) to approve committing troops to recent wars, including the US invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan and the strikes on alleged al-Qaeda affiliates across the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

No AUMFs have been passed that would relate to military action in Venezuela.

When lawmakers believe a president is acting beyond his constitutional power, they can pass a war powers resolution requiring Congressional approval for further actions.

Beyond their symbolism, such resolutions create a legal basis to challenge further presidential actions in the judiciary.

However, they carry a high bar for success, with a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress needed to override a presidential veto.

Given the current makeup of Congress, passage of a war powers resolution would likely require bipartisan support.

Republicans maintain narrow majorities in both the House and Senate, so it would be necessary for members of Trump’s own party to back a war powers resolution for it to be successful.

In November’s Senate vote, only two Republicans — co-sponsor Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska — split from their party to support the resolution. It failed by a margin of 51 to 49.

December’s vote on a parallel resolution in the House only earned 211 votes in favour, as opposed to 213 against. In that case, three Republicans broke from their party to support the resolution, and one Democrat opposed it.

But Trump’s abduction of Maduro has so far only received condemnation from a tiny fragment of his party.

Overall, the response from elected Republicans has been muted. Even regular critics of presidential adventurism have instead focused on praising the ouster of the longtime Venezuelan leader, who has been accused of numerous human rights abuses.

Senator Todd Young, a Republican considered on the fence ahead of November’s war powers vote, has praised Maduro’s arrest, even as he contended the Trump administration owed Congress more details.

“We still need more answers, especially to questions regarding the next steps in Venezuela’s transition,” Young said.

Some Democrats have also offered careful messaging in the wake of the operation.

That included Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents a large Venezuelan diaspora community in Florida.

In a statement on Saturday, Wasserman Schultz focused on the implications of Maduro’s removal, while avoiding any mention of the military operation that enabled it. Instead, she asserted that Trump owed Congress an explanation about next steps.

“He has failed to explain to Congress or the American people how he plans to prevent the regime from reconstituting itself under Maduro’s cronies or stop Venezuela from falling into chaos,” she wrote.

In December, however, Wasserman Schultz did join a group of Florida Democrats in calling for Congress to exercise its oversight authority as Trump built up military pressure on Venezuela.

What comes next?

For its part, the Trump administration has not eased up on its military threats against Venezuela, even as it has sought to send the message that Maduro’s abduction was a matter of law enforcement, not the start of a war.

Trump has also denied, once again, that he needed congressional approval for any further military action. Still, in a Monday interview with NBC News, he expressed optimism about having Congress’s backing.

“We have good support congressionally,” he told NBC. “Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn’t they support us?”

Since Saturday’s attack and abduction, Trump has warned that a “second wave” of military action could be on the horizon for Venezuela.

That threat has extended to the potential for the forced removal of Maduro’s deputy, Delcy Rodriguez, who was formally sworn in as the country’s interim president on Monday.

“If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” Trump told The Atlantic magazine.

The administration has also said that strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats near Venezuela will continue and that US military assets will remain deployed in the region.

Constitutional expert Janovsky, however, believes that this is a critical moment for Congress to act.

Failure to rein in Trump would only further reinforce a decades-long trend of lawmakers relinquishing their oversight authorities, he explained. That, in turn, offers tacit support for the presidency’s growing power over the military.

“To say this was a targeted law enforcement operation — and ignore the ongoing situation — would be a dangerous abdication of Congress as a central check on how the United States military is used,” Janovsky said.

“Continued congressional inaction does nothing but empower presidents to act however they want,” he added.

“To see Congress continue to step back ultimately just removes the American people even farther from where these decisions are actually being made.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26006037081044-1767663789.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2026-01-06 13:57:24.639037

Will a U.S. court allow the Department of Justice to prosecute a sitting foreign head of state?
Instead, it has argued (as in the Noriega case) that Maduro isn’t entitled to be treated as a head of state.
That said, the United States has not recognized Maduro as Venezuela’s head of state since 2019.
Assuming a U.S. court determines he is not entitled to immunity as a sitting head of state, a different immunity analysis would apply.","On Jan. 5, Nicolas Maduro pleaded not guilty to federal criminal charges in a Manhattan courtroom and told the judge, “I am still president.” This is an imagined conversation between two people in the courtroom, one of whom happens to be an international law professor.

Why did Maduro tell the judge he’s still president? Why does that matter?

Under international law binding on the United States (and all countries), the sitting head of state or head of government of one country can’t be sued or prosecuted in another country’s courts. That’s why the U.S. president can travel to other countries without worrying about being sued, prosecuted, or arrested. This is such a well-accepted principle that it’s not codified in any treaty, but it has been restated innumerable times, including by the International Court of Justice and the U.S. State Department. The technical term for this is immunity rationae personae, or personal immunity, and it also extends to foreign ministers and likely to defense ministers. It is designed to protect leaders of foreign countries from being hindered in performing their duties and is rooted in the idea that all countries are equal on the international plane (that is, they have sovereign equality).

But didn’t the United States prosecute Manuel Noriega after abducting him from Panama in 1989?

Yes. The United States didn’t recognize General Manuel Noriega, who was a military dictator, as Panama’s head of state, and the government of Panama didn’t request immunity on his behalf. (Especially in contested cases, it matters whether the government of a country tells the court and/or the State Department that an individual holds a particular position in that government that entitles them to immunity.) So U.S. courts let that prosecution go forward. The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reasoned that Noriega wasn’t entitled to immunity “given that the record indicates that Noriega never served as the constitutional leader of Panama, that Panama has not sought immunity for Noriega and that the charged acts relate to Noriega’s private pursuit of personal enrichment.”

It’s important to keep in mind, though, that recognition by one country alone doesn’t change whether a genuine head of state is entitled to immunity on that basis. If that were the case, countries could game the law by simply withdrawing their recognition, nabbing foreign leaders, and trying them in their courts. The Panama case was arguably more complicated because there were democratically elected authorities in Panama who also did not consider Noriega to be the legitimate head of state.

And more recently the U.S. also prosecuted the former president of Honduras?

Yes, although because Juan Orlando Hernandez was a former, not a sitting, head of state, his prosecution did not violate head of state immunity. Also, importantly, in that case the United States requested and obtained his extradition from Honduras through legal channels. In addition, a country can always waive its own official’s immunity or decline to support the official’s claim to immunity.

Who decides whether to waive an official’s immunity?

Generally, it is the de facto authorities of the official’s home country. It can be complicated, though, especially if there are different political groups within a single country that are all vying for power. There is definitely a risk that arrest and extradition can serve as a convenient way to get rid of political rivals. That’s why international human rights law requires that defendants receive procedural protections, both in the extradition process and when they are eventually tried and prosecuted. Most extradition treaties also have exceptions under which a country that is asked to extradite an alleged offender can refuse to do so on the grounds that the request is politically motivated–but this doesn’t help if the extraditing country also supports the prosecution.

Will a U.S. court allow the Department of Justice to prosecute a sitting foreign head of state?

U.S. courts have dismissed civil suits filed against foreign sitting heads of state. If the U.S. government tried to prosecute a foreign sitting head of state that the executive branch recognized as such, then international law would certainly require a court to dismiss the case. But U.S. courts haven’t faced this particular dilemma, because in Maduro’s case the executive branch isn’t seeking to prosecute someone that it recognizes as a sitting foreign head of state. Instead, it has argued (as in the Noriega case) that Maduro isn’t entitled to be treated as a head of state.

The judiciary does not owe absolute deference to the executive branch on all foreign affairs matters, but it does give the executive branch deference on recognition decisions. It would be interesting to see what a court did in a clear cut case where non-recognition was absurd on its face – for example, if the Department of Justice said “the United States doesn’t recognize Mark Carney as Canada’s head of government,” or “the United States doesn’t recognize Emmanuel Macron as France’s head of state.”

This is a more complicated case. On the one hand, Venezuela now has an interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, sworn in shortly after Maduro’s capture. On the other hand, Rodriguez has publicly called for Maduro’s release and said he is still President of Venezuela. The case could take an interesting turn if Venezuela – through an amicus brief perhaps – informs the court that it has not waived Maduro’s immunity and he remains their head of state.

That said, the United States has not recognized Maduro as Venezuela’s head of state since 2019. That will likely be decisive for a U.S. judge under domestic law because of the executive branch’s exclusive recognition power, even though head-of-state status under international law does not depend on any single country’s recognition decision. Generally, under international law, if an individual has the legal authority to bind the country in its international relations, that person would be considered the head of state regardless of how that person assumed the position.

So international law doesn’t matter?

The United States always indicates when it files immunity determinations with U.S. courts that it is doing so after considering “the relevant principles of customary international law.” The biggest deterrent to violating international law regarding immunities is that other countries can start doing the same thing. The United States has often violated international law with apparent impunity, but every time it does so the international system becomes less stable and less predictable, in addition to less just. Moreover, it should go without saying that disregarding immunity for other countries or their officials also risks eroding the well-established norms that protect the United States and its officials in foreign courts.

Speaking of stability and predictability, what about the military operation to capture Maduro? Doesn’t that make his prosecution illegal?

There is zero international legal justification for conducting a military operation on another country’s territory to capture an alleged fugitive, let alone a foreign leader, without that country’s consent or authorization by the U.N. Security Council. But international law and U.S. law separate the question of how a defendant’s presence was obtained before a court from whether that defendant can be prosecuted. In international law, the principle is called male captus, bene detentus. It essentially boils down to the idea that a person can be unlawfully captured, but still lawfully prosecuted, as long as the proceedings themselves comply with applicable law.

Once Venezuela has a new acting president, will that change Maduro’s status? Can he claim immunity as a former head of state?

If relevant Venezuelan authorities do not treat Maduro as the head of state, then he would no longer be able to claim that status. As noted above, this question may be disputed if his successor maintains that he is still the head of state. Assuming a U.S. court determines he is not entitled to immunity as a sitting head of state, a different immunity analysis would apply.

Former foreign officials enjoy certain residual, conduct-based immunities for their official acts. However, drug trafficking and corruption do not fall within any head of state’s official duties. Such charges do not raise the immunity questions sometimes associated with legal proceedings against former foreign officials for international crimes such as torture that are necessarily committed under color of law. (There is also a separate question of immunity for international crimes before international courts; although Venezuela has announced its intended withdrawal from the International Criminal Court, its ratification of the treaty that created that court amounts to a renunciation of official immunities before the ICC for conduct that falls within the court’s jurisdiction.)

Setting aside Maduro’s unlawful capture, isn’t his prosecution a good thing?

That’s really a question for Venezuelans to answer, especially since the person who has now assumed power was Maduro’s vice president and close associate. It’s difficult for the United States to have credibility in upholding the rule of law when it so willingly violates it and applies inconsistent standards–whether it’s pardoning Hernandez while prosecuting Maduro and executing suspected drug couriers, or defying domestic court orders. Ideally, each country is responsible for ensuring its own compliance with both domestic and international law, with action by foreign or international courts available as a back-up when national institutions fail. In the U.S. legal and political system, the power to rein in a lawless executive branch lies primarily with Congress and with voters, not with courts. That’s one reason why the contours of domestic official immunity don’t necessarily mirror those of foreign official immunity.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254805778-e1767707254870.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 10:58:03.275657

Why it matters: The spiritual panic blended with cultural revival comes as the immigration crackdown continues with no end in sight — despite consistent legal challenges and declining public support for the harsh tactics.

Figures like St. Jude and Santa Muerte have popped up at protests and on car dashboards as the Trump administration orders aggressive ICE raids and tightens legal immigration channels.

""When folks feel like they have no other recourse but the divine, or the supernatural, these types of saints become really important,"" Andrew Chesnut, the Bishop Walter F. Sullivan chairman in Catholic Studies at Virginia Commonwealth University, tells Axios.

Zoom in: At migrant shelters and Latino parishes, images of saints known to help migrants and travelers have spread in recent months.

St. Jude, an official Catholic Saint of Lost Causes, has been seen at demonstrations and outside immigration detention facilities.

Mother Cabrini, patron saint of immigrants, has appeared at protests and candlelight vigils near federal immigration courts.

Our Lady of Guadalupe, the Mother of the Americas, can be found at rapid-response networks, emergency community meetings and roadside altars built after immigration sweeps.

Santo Toribio Romo, widely known as ""el Padre Pollero"" (the Holy Coyote) and as the unofficial patron saint of migrants and border crossers, has shown up in wallets and on necklaces.

The intrigue: Some immigrants are even embracing folk saints unsanctioned by the Catholic Church and often associated with drug cartels.

La Santa Muerte, or Holy Death, a skeleton figure resembling the Grim Reaper, has appeared on dashboards, on candles, and on murals to protect immigrants from arrest.

""One of her main hats is protectress of migrants. A great majority of devotees aren't narcos — they're people in desperate situations,"" Chesnut said.

Jesús Malverde, sometimes referred to as the ""angel of the poor"" and strongly identified with the Sinaloa Cartel, has morphed into another figure to help poor migrants.

State of play: The rising, very public devotion to saints comes as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has increasingly pushed back against the Trump administration's aggressive immigration enforcement.

In November, the bishops overwhelmingly voted on a rare ""Special Pastoral Message"" condemning the indiscriminate mass deportation of immigrants and calling for humane policy rooted in human dignity.

Between the lines: The saints' stories — of exile, danger, persecution and perseverance — mirror the lived experiences of migrant families facing raids, family separations and deportation orders.

In this climate, saints function as emotional lifelines, letting migrants reclaim a semblance of security when the government's actions feel unpredictable and punitive, Chesnut said.

Devotion has become both a private survival strategy and an element of public cultural resilience, especially in communities where trust in institutions has collapsed, he added.

The bottom line: Growing opposition to Trump's immigration crackdown doesn't appear to be affecting the administration's policies, and immigration reform proposals in Congress aren't going anywhere.

Agents have been pulled off complex cases, including investigations into cyber-attacks, domestic extremism, drug trafficking and sanctions evasion, the letter said.
Entire HSI units have reportedly been reassigned to immigration enforcement, the letter continued.
She said Trump was keeping his promises on deportations, adding: “Any insinuation that the Trump administration isn’t successfully combating dangerous crime is false and uninformed.
With narcotic seizures and human smuggling arrests up significantly, paired with a historically secure border, the Trump administration is making America safer than ever before.” The FBI declined to comment.","The Trump administration has abandoned efforts to combat child exploitation, human trafficking and cartels as it diverts thousands of law enforcement personnel to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Democratic senators said in a letter to the White House.

Ruben Gallego of Arizona, along with 28 other Democratic senators and one independent, wrote to the president, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Justice (DoJ) on Monday demanding federal officials provide a “full accounting” of officers who have been redirected to immigration enforcement and a list of all investigations impacted by the reassignments.

The letter, first shared with the Guardian, follows a series of reports suggesting that the president’s push to dramatically expand its force of immigration officers has hampered a wide range of law-enforcement priorities. The senators cited an ICE document from August 2025, published by the Cato Institute, a thinktank, which said more than 28,000 personnel from federal law-enforcement agencies had been diverted from their regular duties to work for ICE’s enforcement and removal operations (ERO), which conducts raids and arrests undocumented people.

The letter referenced a New York Times investigation in November finding the intense focus on deportations has taken resources away from investigations into sexual crimes against children, an inquiry into a black market that finances terrorism, and federal efforts to combat human smuggling and sex trafficking.

“You have pulled agents away from some of the federal government’s most critical criminal investigations, weakening the very work that ensures public safety. In a world in which we must prioritize the use of limited resources, an agent arresting primarily non-violent immigrants necessarily means one less agent available to catch child predators and drug traffickers,” said the letter, which was signed by a majority of Democratic senators.

“This diversion represents a deliberate choice: a stunning abdication of the basic responsibilities of the executive branch to the American people, and a direct threat to the security of communities across the country.”

The reassignments come as ICE has engaged in a massive recruitment push, with the agency announcing on Saturday that it had hired more than 12,000 new officers and employees over the last year.

The number of people in ICE custody hit an all-time high in December, with more than 68,400 people in detention, the Guardian reported. Immigrants with no criminal record now make up the largest group in ICE detention, contradicting the administration’s repeated assertions that it is focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst”.

The senators’ letter, sent to Trump, DHS secretary Kristi Noem and attorney general Pam Bondi, said the administration’s reassignments were designed to “fuel a politically motivated deportation agenda that bears little relationship to actual security or safety priorities”.

Affected agencies, the senators said, include the FBI, the Marshals Service, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Defense, the Internal Revenue Service, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

Agents have been pulled off complex cases, including investigations into cyber-attacks, domestic extremism, drug trafficking and sanctions evasion, the letter said. The senators said the impacts have been “especially devastating” at Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), a DHS branch charged with combating child exploitation and a range of criminal organizations, including cartels.

Entire HSI units have reportedly been reassigned to immigration enforcement, the letter continued. The senators cited accounts from engineers at major tech companies who have reported a “noticeable drop in follow-up from federal officials” when they report child safety issues.

Efforts to combat gun violence have also been “eviscerated” as 80% of ATF special agents have been redirected to immigration, the letter said, citing a November CNN report. And nearly half of FBI agents working in the US’s major field offices have been reassigned to aid immigration enforcement, according to data released by Senator Mark Warner in October.

The Democrats demanded the administration respond by 19 January disclosing threat assessments that informed the reassignments; all communications directing agencies to provide personnel for ICE; and any internal objections raised by leadership and investigators.

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, criticized the letter in an email to the Guardian, accusing Gallego of “pander[ing] to a radical left base ahead of his doomed-to-fail presidential run”.

“The characterization of HSI’s enforcement posture is selective, incomplete, and badly out of step with the actual data. FY25 was the highest year on record for HSI criminal enforcement, with more than 46,000 criminal arrests made – the most in the agency’s history,” Jackson wrote.

FY25 refers to the fiscal year from October 2024 through September 2025, which includes roughly four months of the Biden administration. The New York Times reporting on the HSI data found that as agents dramatically increased civil immigration arrests, narcotics arrests fell by roughly 11%, agents opened 15% fewer new investigations into narcotics crimes, and the number of weapons seized declined by 73%.

Jackson declined to provide specifics on the 46,000 arrests or comment on the declines in drug arrests and gun seizures, accusing the New York Times of “cherry-picking data to advance their preferred narrative when the facts tell a much different story”.

She said Trump was keeping his promises on deportations, adding: “Any insinuation that the Trump administration isn’t successfully combating dangerous crime is false and uninformed. With narcotic seizures and human smuggling arrests up significantly, paired with a historically secure border, the Trump administration is making America safer than ever before.”

""If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation,"" the email read. ""Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property.""

The second was sent less than two hours later, and said it was canceling the reservation ""after further investigation online.""

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security in a social media post on Monday called the cancellation ""unacceptable.""

A spokesperson with Hilton said the following in a written statement to WCCO:

""This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values. We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies. They have taken immediate action to resolve this matter. Hilton's position is clear: Our properties are open to everyone and we do not tolerate any form of discrimination.""

Everpeak Hospitality, which Hilton said independently owns and operates the hotel, said in a statement of its own that the matter was ""inconsistent"" with its policy of ""being a welcoming place for all.""

""We are in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated. We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted,"" Everpeak Hospitality said.

CBS News learned Monday from multiple law enforcement officials that the Trump administration has started a massive deployment of hundreds of DHS agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal in Minnesota. Roughly 2,000 federal agents and officers could be sent as part of the crackdown.

Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to look into alleged fraud cases following last month's investigation by federal agents in Minneapolis that DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said was for ""child care and other rampant fraud.""

Many of the sites visited by investigators on Dec. 29 were from a video, posted by conservative YouTuber Nick Shirley, which alleged nearly a dozen day care centers in Minnesota that are receiving public funds are not actually providing any service.

CBS News conducted its own analysis and visited several of the day care centers mentioned by Shirley: all but two have active licenses, according to state records, and all active locations were visited by state regulators within the last six months. One was subjected to an unannounced inspection as recently as Dec. 4. Our review found dozens of citations related to safety, cleanliness, equipment and staff training, but there was no recorded evidence of fraud. Another day care shared security footage of people dropping off young children the same day that Shirley arrived and claimed the day care was empty.

The deployment started on Sunday and represents one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years.

Maduro “was a brutal dictator who deserves no sympathy,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on social media.
Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.","Nevada’s sole Republican congressman, Rep. Mark Amodei, had as of Monday evening yet to comment on the military capture of former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro or President Donald Trump’s assertion the country and its oil production industry are under U.S. control.

Maduro and his wife, captured Saturday in Caracas by an elite U.S. military squad, entered pleas of not guilty Monday in New York to charges of trafficking cocaine.

Amodei’s office did not respond to a request for comment Monday. His silence comes as Nevada’s Democratic congressional delegates are calling out Trump for deploying the military for a criminal matter and for engaging in regime change and nation-building, policies Trump has previously decried.

“Our current strategy of nation-building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,” Trump said while campaigning in 2016.

Maduro “was a brutal dictator who deserves no sympathy,” Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto said on social media. “But the Trump Administration using American service members to overthrow a foreign leader it has criminally indicted under U.S. law sets a dangerous precedent.”

Trump, she said, “made a dangerous decision to bypass Congress with his actions in Venezuela, and so far he has offered no real details on plans for the future other than a vague assertion that the ‘United States will be running the country.’”

The prosecution of Maduro, Cortez Masto added, “contradicts” Trump’s pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was found guilty by a federal jury of conspiring to traffic cocaine and sentenced to 40 years in prison. He was released last month as a result of Trump’s pardon.

On Monday, Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as interim president in Maduro’s absence. But in an interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper, Stephen Miller, a White House deputy chief of staff, laid out a scenario that more closely resembles a military takeover than the criminal apprehension of two individuals.

“We live in a world in which you can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else. But we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” Miller said. “By definition, we are in charge, because we have the United States military stationed outside the country. We set the terms and conditions. We have a complete embargo on all of their oil and their ability to do commerce. So for them to do commerce, they need our permission. For them to be able to run an economy, they need our permission.”

Sen. Jacky Rosen, a Democrat and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called Maduro an “illegitimate and brutal dictator” but noted only Congress has the power to declare war. “This illegal regime change operation won’t make our country safer and risks destabilizing the region, dragging us into additional military conflicts, and increasing the amount of immigrants seeking refuge at our border.”

Trump’s administration needs to “explain why it lied when it claimed in its briefings that regime change wasn’t the U.S. goal in Venezuela,” Rosen said, and urged Congress to pass Senator Tim Kaine’s (D-Virginia) War Powers Resolution “to prohibit Donald Trump from carrying out additional strikes without our input.”

In a statement issued Saturday, Rep. Dina Titus, a former Political Science professor at UNLV, detailed more than half a century of U.S. regime change efforts in Latin America.

“In each case, our long-term interests were not advanced, regional relationships were damaged, and the Hemisphere saw more turmoil and violence, not less, “ she said. “Instead of learning from history, President Trump has perpetuated a failed foreign policy.”

The Trump administration’s action, Titus said, “is clearly based largely on the desire to take over Venezuela’s oil.”

The U.S. invasion of a sovereign nation, she added, “opens the door for Xi Jinping to do the same in Taiwan and lends legitimacy to Vladimir Putin’s goals in Ukraine.” Titus said Trump, who calls himself “the ‘President of Peace’ has once again shown that he is the ‘Commander-in-Chaos.’”

Titus faces challenges in 2026 from six Republicans, including State Sen. Carrie Buck, who did not respond to requests for comment on Trump’s takeover of Venezuela.

Rep. Susie Lee, also a Democrat, said Maduro’s capture raises “more questions for the Trump Administration than answers. The American people are opposed to another forever war.”

Lee noted that taking control of Venezuela is “an act of war, not a law-enforcement activity, and requires Congressional authorization and clear legal authority, neither of which the Administration has been given.”

Three Republicans vying to replace Lee are praising Trump’s actions.

Dr. Aury Nagy praised Trump’s “decisive leadership” but a spokesman was unable to say whether Nagy supports putting U.S. troops in Venezuela.

Marty O’Donnell, who is prioritizing affordability in his campaign, commended Trump and the military for taking decisive action without loss of life to Americans.

Dr. Jeff Gunter, who served as an ambassador during Trump’s first term, praised the military action that resulted in Maduro’s capture as a “’lawful, moral, and necessary’ step to protect American families from drug cartels and liberate Venezuela from socialist tyranny.”

Gunter is best known in political circles for an attack ad in the 2024 Republican primary race for U.S. Senate, in which he portrayed fellow Republican Sam Brown as a swamp creature. Brown was disfigured by an improvised explosive device in 2008 in Afghanistan, where he was serving in the U.S. Army.

Gunter did not respond when asked whether he supports U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela.

Rep. Steven Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, echoed colleagues in asserting Trump’s actions “appeared to be driven largely by access to Venezuela’s oil resources.”

“Nevadans struggling through the Trump Slump get no relief from another reckless attempt at nation-building abroad,” he said. “President Trump is occupying Venezuela for corporate oil profits while the American people are clamoring for affordability relief here at home.”

David Flippo, one of several Republicans seeking to oust Horsford, praised Trump’s actions. In a statement, the former Air Force commander said Trump acted “exactly how the Commander-in-Chief is supposed to act…”

He did not respond when asked whether he supports prolonged U.S. involvement and troops in Venezuela.

Cody Whipple, another Republican seeking to represent Horsford’s Congressional District 4, applauded Trump’s capture of Maduro.

“Operations like this send a clear and unmistakable message: the United States will not tolerate criminal regimes poisoning our communities with fentanyl and other deadly drugs,” Whipple said in a statement. He did not say whether he supports deploying U.S. troops to Venezuela.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

“I am a kidnapped president, prisoner of war,” ousted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro told the judge in Manhattan federal court yesterday as he and his wife pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges. The couple are charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. Maduro is additionally charged with narco-terrorism conspiracy. Erica Orden reports for POLITICO.

U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz defended the capture of Maduro, saying “we are not occupying a country. This was a law enforcement operation” at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council. In a statement read to the Council, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said the Trump administration had violated the U.N. charter, citing the capture of Maduro and the military incursion into a sovereign state. Several countries agreed that the action in Venezuela was a violation of the charter, including U.S. allies such as France, Denmark, and Spain. The United Kingdom struck a more cautious tone. Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times; James Landale reports for BBC News.

Following yesterday’s classified briefing, top Republican and Democratic congressmen emerged with little clarity on the future of Venezuela. The briefing was carried out by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Dan Caine, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Attorney General Pam Bondi. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) described the briefing as “extensive and long” with “far more questions than it ever answered,” adding that “their plan for the U.S. running Venezuela is vague, based on wishful thinking and unsatisfying.” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) said he expected an election to be called in Venezuela in “short order,” but added that “some of these things are still being determined.” Sen. Jim Risch, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters ahead of the briefing that he would “probably” hold a hearing on Venezuela in the committee. Laura Kelly and Filip Timotija report for The Hill.

Rubio and other senior officials urged Trump not to back María Corina Machado as Maduro’s replacement. According to multiple sources, the officials said that U.S. backing of the opposition could further destabilize Venezuela and require a more robust military presence inside the country. A classified CIA intelligence analysis also reflected this view and concluded that Delcy Rodríguez, the vice president, was the best-positioned short-term successor. The CIA analysis was not focused on the forcible removal of Maduro, but examined a series of possibilities. Tyler Pager, Anatoly Kurmanaev, and Julian E. Barnes report for the New York Times; Julian E. Barnes and Tyler Pager New York Times.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro yesterday condemned the U.S. operation in Venezuela and responded to Trump’s comments that Colombia is run by a sick man, saying, “Come get me, I’m waiting for you here.” Also yesterday, Colombian Interior Minister Armando Benedetti said that Colombia will continue to work with the United States to fight drug trafficking using Washington’s intelligence and technology. “We will continue to emphasize the fight against this scourge, particularly on the Colombian-Venezuelan border,” Idarraga said. Reuters reports; Julianna Bragg reports for Axios.

About a dozen oil tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude oil have left Venezuela since the start of the year, despite President Trump’s imposition of a blockade on all sanctioned tankers in mid-December, according to documents seen by Reuters and industry sources. All the departed vessels identified are under sanctions and most are now sailing without any known flag. It is unclear whether the United States had approved or allowed the shipments. Reuters reports.

U.S. forces plan to intercept the Marinera, a crude oil tanker that was sanctioned by the Treasury Department in 2024 and that Russia has claimed jurisdiction over, according to four sources. The tanker was initially headed for Venezuela before turning around to avoid seizure by the U.S. Coast Guard last month. It was in the North Atlantic as of two days ago, near the coast of the United Kingdom. Two U.S. officials said that the plan would be to seize rather than sink the ship and could take place as early as this week. Two U.S. intelligence officials told CBS News that Venezuelan officials had discussed placing armed military personnel disguised as civilians on tankers for defense purposes. James LaPorta reports; Natasha Bertrand, Alayna Treene, Kylie Atwood, Zachary Cohen, and Avery Schmitz report for CNN.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner will attend a summit today in Paris focused on security guarantees to Ukraine in a future peace deal, a White House official said. The meeting will include leaders from roughly 30 countries who want to be part of the security guarantees and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

An Israeli airstrike in Gaza yesterday killed a 5-year-old girl and her uncle, and wounded two other children, according to officials at Nasser Hospital. The dead are among the more than 400 people killed in Gaza since an October ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The Israeli military said on social media that it struck a Hamas militant who planned an imminent strike on Israeli troops, adding that the strike complied with the ceasefire agreement. It is currently unclear whether the statement referred to the same fatal strike. Wafaa Shurafa and Sally Abou Aljoud report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH – CEASEFIRE

Israeli air strikes yesterday and this morning hit areas in southern and eastern Lebanon, including a commercial building in the coastal city of Sidon. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun condemned the attacks in a statement today, saying they are counter to both international efforts to de-escalate hostilities and Lebanon’s efforts to extend the government’s authority in areas dominated by Hezbollah. Bassem Mroue and Mohammed Zaatari report for AP News.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Ugandan authorities have denied reports that they are planning to cut access to the internet during next week’s election, but the government has banned live broadcasts of riots, “unlawful processions,” and other violent incidents ahead of the election, arguing that these could “escalate tensions and spread panic.” Despite assurances, the main opposition party, the National Unity Platform (NUP), has launched an offline vote-monitoring app in case of a blackout. “As we all know, the regime is plotting an internet shutdown, as they have done in past elections, to block communication and prevent citizens from organising, verifying results, and demanding accountability,” NUP leader Bobi Wine said. Sammy Awami and Jean Otalor report for BBC News.

The United States yesterday reached a deal with Dominica to start sending people seeking asylum in the United States to the Caribbean nation, according to Dominica’s Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit. Last month, the Trump administration announced it was expanding travel restrictions to 20 additional countries, including Dominica. Anselm Gibbs reports for AP News.

Mark Kelly (D-AZ) from a retired Navy captain to a lower rank, with a corresponding reduction in pay, in response to his video warning service members not to follow illegal orders, Hegseth said yesterday. Leo Shane III and Connor O’Brien report for POLITICO.

The Trump administration plans to freeze $10 billion in funding for child care subsidies, social services, and cash support for low-income families in five Democratic-led states, according to Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon. Around $7 billion in funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program will be cut off in Minnesota, New York, California, Illinois, and Colorado. “Democrat-led states and governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” Nixon said. “Under the Trump administration, we are ensuring that federal taxpayer dollars are being used for legitimate purposes.” Minho Kim reports for the New York Times.

The Homeland Security Department has drafted plans to cut the Federal Emergency Management Agency Workforce in 2026 through potential reductions of thousands of disaster response and recovery roles, according to documents obtained by the Washington Post. Emails sent to senior agency leadership in late December include detailed tables identifying roles that can be cut from the agency’s divisions. These tables include a 41 per cent reduction in CORE disaster roles, more than 4,300 positions. In a statement, FEMA spokesperson Daniel Llargués said the agency has “not issued and is not implementing a percentage-based workforce reduction.” Brianna Sacks reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A federal appeals court yesterday ruled that the Trump administration could not make drastic cuts to the federal funding supporting much of the country’s medical and scientific research, reaffirming a lower court’s ruling. Zach Montague reports for the New York Times.

197 plaintiffs on Friday filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging that the suspension of casework by the Homeland Security Department and the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is not authorized by immigration or administrative law. Brittany Gibson reports for Axios.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which began ramping up arrests of undocumented immigrants in the Minneapolis area in early December, will be sending 1,500 deportation officers from Enforcement and Removal Operations as well as 600 agents from Homeland Security Investigations, the officials said. Some of the officers and agents began arriving Sunday, one of the officials said.

The surge stems from a viral video that alleged Somali-run day cares were receiving federal subsidies but that no children were present.

As a result, the Department of Health and Human Services cut funding to day cares in Minnesota and put restrictions on federal subsidies to day cares serving low-income children nationwide.

But the Minnesota Department of Children, Youth and Families said its investigators conducted on-site compliance checks at nine of the 10 facilities. One of the facilities had closed in 2022.

“Investigators confirmed the centers were operating as expected, gathered evidence and initiated further review. Children were present at all sites except one—that site, was not yet open for families for the day when inspectors arrived,” the agency, which oversees day cares in Minnesota, said in a statement.

Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced via X that she was sending agents from Homeland Security Investigations to begin door knocking more than 30 businesses to root out fraud in the Somali community.

One of the DHS officials told NBC News the 600 additional agents from Homeland Security Investigations will be largely focused on identifying possible fraud. Deportation officers will be making arrests of immigrants in the area who are allegedly violating immigration law, the official said.

It's unclear whether the Border Patrol might also add forces to join ICE in operations in Minneapolis. One of the DHS officials said Border Patrol official Greg Bovino — who oversaw operations in Chicago; Charlotte, North Carolina; and New Orleans — may soon be arriving in Minneapolis along with Noem.

A spokeswoman for DHS did not respond to questions about Noem and Bovino’s plans to travel to Minneapolis.

In a post on Instagram, ICE said a Hilton hotel in Minneapolis had canceled reservations for ICE agents upon finding out their stay was related to immigration enforcement in the area.

“After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be cancelling your upcoming reservation. You should see a proper cancellation email in your inbox shortly from Hilton,” the email posted by ICE said.

Hilton said that the hotel was independently owned and operated, that the actions “are not reflective of Hilton’s values” and that they are investigating the matter.

The hotel, run by Everpeak Hospitality, says that the move was “inconsistent with our policy” and that it is making sure affected guests are accommodated.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251211-home-entry-ice-ride-along-gk-57183b.jpg",N,,2026-01-06 09:57:59.574023

Trump has a long history with Minnesota, Somali community The child care fraud scandal has reignited the president’s persistent hostility toward Somalis.","Around 2,000 federal agents are being deployed to Minneapolis as part of the Trump administration’s latest effort to crack down on immigration, two law enforcement officials told CNN, while the city and its officials are reeling from a welfare fraud scandal that’s reaching a fever pitch this week.

In the days since a conservative content creator raised allegations of fraud in a YouTube video – with little evidence – about Somali-run day care centers in Minneapolis, the Trump administration has frozen federal child care funds and unleashed more biting rhetoric against the Somali community, whom President Donald Trump has previously called “garbage.”

Now, the president is stepping up immigration enforcement. Federal agents have already been on the ground in Minneapolis, and both Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and US Border Patrol agents are deploying to Minnesota. US Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, whose controversial tactics have come under increased scrutiny in multiple cities, is also expected to deploy there.

Uncertainty is sweeping Minnesota’s largest city as the fraud allegations prompt shakeups in local leadership, and a new, ambiguous immigration enforcement effort intimidating Somali residents has emerged. Here’s what we know.

Deployment comes as Walz drops reelection bid

The mobilization of more agents to Minneapolis comes as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who has been staunchly opposed to Trump’s deployment of troops to US cities, dropped out of the race for reelection on Monday.

The welfare-fraud scandal in his state has intensified into a political flashpoint seized upon by Trump, and its deepening federal probe complicated Walz’s bid for an unprecedented third term. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but Republicans have sought to blame Walz and Democrats for abuse of taxpayer dollars.

It was the recent criticism from the Trump administration and right-wing allies that Walz said contributed to his decision not to seek reelection.

“For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of this state’s generosity,” Walz said. “And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of a crisis.”

Walz had been criticized for his administration’s oversight of the welfare programs. Several Democrats in the state privately cautioned Walz against seeking reelection as outrage intensified in Minnesota and beyond over the misuse of funds.

In his brief appearance on Monday, Walz said he welcomed the federal investigation. He said it was imperative Minnesotans had confidence in the state’s social safety net programs.

Pushback anticipated over familiar ICE operation targeting Somalis

The 2,000 agent surge isn’t the first time federal immigration authorities have targeted the Twin Cities. In December, following Trump’s disparaging comments about Somalis and calls for them to leave the country, federal agents arrived in Minneapolis and St. Paul as part of the president’s wide-spanning deportation campaign.

The operation sparked fear and anxiety for the area’s Somali community, the vast majority of whom are US citizens. Nearly 58% of Somalis in Minnesota were born in the US, according to the US Census Bureau. Of the foreign-born Somalis in Minnesota, an overwhelming majority — 87% — are naturalized US citizens.

The previous ICE operation sparked protests and tense standoffs with agents. In one incident that drew criticism from the Minneapolis police chief, an agent knelt on a woman’s back as she lay atop a snow bank and then tried to drag her to a car. The episode took place just a few miles from where George Floyd was killed by a city police officer kneeling on his neck in 2020.

Americans of Somali descent told CNN they started carrying their passports and ID cards with them, scared they would be stopped by federal agents.

This time around, DHS said it has run into trouble booking hotel rooms in Minneapolis for newly mobilized agents. It alleged that global hotel chain Hilton launched a “coordinated campaign” to refuse service to agents by cancelling their room reservations in Minneapolis as the agency readies for escalated immigration enforcement there.

Screenshots DHS posted on X on Monday afternoon appear to show emails from a Hilton address stating that immigration agents are not allowed to stay at the Hampton Inn Lakeville property, located in a suburb south of Minneapolis.

“After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be cancelling your upcoming reservation. You should see a proper cancellation email in your inbox shortly from Hilton,” one email reads.

The Lakeville Hilton property is independently owned and operated by Everpeak Hospitality, which said in a statement on its website that the incident “was inconsistent with our policy of being a welcoming place for all,” and that it is “in touch with the impacted guests to ensure they are accommodated.”

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin rejected that statement, writing on X Monday evening that DHS and ICE haven’t heard from Everpeak Hospitality.

Hilton itself, in an initial statement Monday, emphasized that the independently owned and operated hotel’s actions “were not reflective of Hilton values.”

On Tuesday Hilton issued a new statement, saying it had further concerns that the Lakeview Hilton property was “not meeting our standards,” and Hilton was therefore taking “immediate action” to remove the hotel from its system.

“Hilton is - and has always been - a welcoming place for all. We are also engaging with all of our franchisees to reinforce the standards we hold them to across our system to help ensure this does not happen again,” Hilton’s Tuesday statement said.

Friday deadline looms amid frozen child care payments

On December 30, Department of Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O’Neill announced the agency was freezing all child care payments to Minnesota amid the fraud allegations. The state typically receives about $185 million annually in federal child care funding, supporting care for 19,000 children.

Investigators last week visited all of the child care centers accused of fraud in the video, and all were operating as expected, state officials say. Still, investigations into alleged wrongdoing are ongoing.

The state Department of Children, Youth, and Families announced Monday it would conduct additional on-site compliance checks at child care centers across the state.

“Funds will be released only when states prove they are being spent legitimately,” O’Neill said. He said he had demanded Walz provide a “comprehensive audit” of the centers featured in the video.

The proof must be shared with the government by Friday, according to an email from state officials to child care providers. The email said HHS has requested specific details, including the total amount of Child Care and Development Fund payments received by five child care centers and administrative data – like names and social security numbers – for all recipients of federal money.

The fund is the main source of federal support for child care and includes the state Child Care Assistance Program, which Nick Shirley, the creator of the viral video, alleged was being exploited in Minnesota.

In the meantime, thousands of Minnesota families who rely on federal child care funding are in limbo. It is unclear how quickly funding could be restored if the state meets the Friday deadline.

The child care fraud scandal has reignited the president’s persistent hostility toward Somalis. For years, he has attacked Somalis living in the US, Somalia itself, and Somali leaders like Rep. Ilhan Omar, who he has said should not be allowed to serve in Congress.

Somalia was also on the travel ban list during Trump’s first presidential term. Under the Obama administration, several Muslim-majority nations, including Somalia, were identified as “countries of concern” and subject to travel restrictions. Somalia had been added to address “the growing threat from foreign terrorist fighters,” according to a DHS statement. When Trump took office, the restrictions turned into a travel ban.

He continued the attacks Sunday when asked about the Minnesota fraud scandal, insulting Omar and going on a tangent about Somali pirates, while criticizing “astronomical” theft of government funds.

Somalis and their advocates point out the small group of people charged with fraud don’t reflect their thousands-strong community.

Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations’ Minnesota chapter, says there’s a clear motif when isolated instances of wrongdoing are used to scapegoat an entire population.

“Each time, the same pattern emerges: isolate a case, generalize it to an entire group, and use fear to legitimize discrimination,” Hussein said.

“The Somali community in the Twin Cities is overwhelmingly made up of hardworking families, small business owners, health care workers, students, and taxpayers who contribute every day to Minnesota’s economy and civic life,” he said.

Allegations reach halls of Congress this week

The fraud allegations will reach new heights in the halls of Congress this week as Minnesota state lawmakers are set to testify in Washington, DC, on Wednesday before the Republican-led US House Oversight Committee.

The hearing, focused on “fraud and misuse of federal funds,” will feature testimony from three Republican members of the Minnesota House of Representatives who, the chairman of the Oversight Committee says, “sounded the alarm” on the fraud: Kristin Robbins, Walter Hudson and Marion Rarick.

James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, invited Walz and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to testify in a separate hearing before the committee’s investigative panel on February 10, saying the governor “ignored” warnings of fraud from the state lawmakers.

“He better lawyer up,” Comer wrote on X.

“Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison have either been asleep at the wheel or complicit in a massive fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Minnesota’s social services programs,” Comer said in the statement.

Gov. Ron DeSantis announced plans to build another facility to hold ICE detainees, after he said that the state's current detention facility in South Florida, nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz"", is a temporary facility.

What we know:

In a Jan. 5 press conference, Gov. Ron DeSantis spoke about the state's successes in detaining undocumented immigrants within state borders. Under ""Operation Tidal Wave,"" DeSantis said over 10,000 undocumented immigrants were arrested and turned over to the Department of Homeland Security. Among the 10,000, 63% had criminal arrests or convictions, including violent and sex offenders.

Apart from ""Operation Tidal Wave,"" joint efforts from Florida counties contributed to 20,000 arrests. All of Florida's 67 counties have 287(g) agreements – deputizing officers to act as ICE officers by arresting and detaining individuals for immigration violations.

DeSantis praised the ""meaningful results"" and said the state has ""good momentum.""

Expanding Florida ICE detention centers

DeSantis said that Florida is hoping to help DHS with capacity and has a few potential U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center locations in mind.

""We’re looking to help, and we’re going to get reimbursed on this,"" he said in front of the ""Deportation Depot"" in Sanderson on Monday.

DeSantis said he's planning a ""Panhandle-Pokey,"" which will be located in Northwest Florida, but is waiting for approval from DHS – upon which the state will be reimbursed.

DeSantis said DHS didn't have capacity for ICE detainees, so the state offered potential locations and were reimbursed.

If DHS doesn’t approve the new center, then ""we’ll stand by,"" he said. ""I think it should be approved, because I don’t think that they’re where they need to be on detention space.""

Another potential option is in Southern Florida, he said. They’re working on several options, he said.

Florida's Everglades detention facility, ""Alligator Alcatraz"", is a temporary facility, DeSantis said. Its airstrip saves time when flying people out, but they had to build a lot of temporary things in the area, he explained.

""It’s clearly temporary. How temporary will depend on the pace that they have in terms of doing the expansion,"" DeSantis said. ""We would anticipate that at some point they're going to up their own capacity.""

Where are Florida's ICE detention centers?

In Florida, ICE's website lists five locations used as detention facilities, field centers or processing centers.

Baker County. Located at the former Baker Correctional Institution, the Baker County Detention Center, also dubbed the ""Deportation Depot"" in Sanderson opened in August 2025 and has the capacity to hold over 1,300 detainees. Ninety-three deportation flights have left the facility that's been operating for four months, DeSantis said – deporting over 2,000 individuals.

But while Trump’s deportation machine had explosive growth, its reach hasn’t lived up to Wall Street expectations. Stock prices for both companies slumped. Despite a series of immigration blitzes and high-profile raids, the government didn’t use as much detention space as investors expected.

Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year, with the immigration system — and privately run holding facilities — expected to grow even larger.

“Once Trump was elected, there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger,” said Joe Gomes, an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets, an investment bank. “It’s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up.”

On his first day in office, Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department — though they continued to be used for immigration detention. Contractors like GEO Group and its primary competitor, CoreCivic, welcomed the news. Days later, the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law, the Laken Riley Act, made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of low-level crimes.

At the beginning of 2025, the companies had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty, ready to be reactivated. GEO Group, based near Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s home in Florida, seemed particularly well-suited.

“This is a unique moment in our company’s history, and we believe we are well-positioned to scale up our diversified segments — in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring — to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders,” George Zoley, the Greek-born founder of GEO Group, said during a quarterly earnings call in February.

By summer, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, approving $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement.

Oddly enough, the price of GEO Group’s stock, which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day, then plummeted. At the end of 2025, GEO Group’s stock was trading around $16 per share, down from a high of $36.46 on Trump’s second day in office. Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America.

“Investors got over their skis,” said Gomes, the analyst.

The Trump administration has said it intends to deport 1 million people a year. In December, the Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, claimed it had deported 605,000 people since Trump was elected and that an additional 1.9 million people self-deported. The department dangled financial carrots like a “free flight home for Christmas and $1,000.”

Immigrant arrests climbed. In December, ICE detained 68,000 people nationwide, up from about 40,000 at the beginning of the year. That’s more than ever before on record, yet only a quarter of those people had been convicted of a crime, including low-level offenses. Another 25% had criminal cases pending.

Detention capacity is still far from ICE’s stated goal of having access to more than 100,000 beds at a time to detain immigrants.

Early last year, GEO Group said it expected to provide 32,000 beds for ICE, more than double the amount at the end of the Biden administration. In doing so, the firm told investors that it was likely that all of its idle prisons would be activated by the end of the year.

GEO Group resumed admitting immigrants at its 1,940-bed Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California after a COVID ban was lifted. On the East Coast, in Newark, New Jersey, GEO Group’s 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility opened with the help of an ICE contract valued at $1 billion. In the Midwest, North Lake Processing Center, a notorious 1,800-bed facility in Baldwin, Michigan, also opened.

As of Dec. 15, GEO Group had idle facilities with nearly 4,700 empty beds in California, Colorado, North Carolina and Texas, according to its report to investors.

CoreCivic also ramped up, but not as quickly as investors expected. Notably, in March, the Tennessee-based firm said it resumed “operations and care” for up to 2,400 people, including families, at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center in South Texas, a contract expected to generate $180 million in annual revenue.

“Never in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,” CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger, a former correctional officer himself, said during an earnings call in May.

At the end of September, CoreCivic reported that it had idle facilities with more than 7,000 empty beds.

Adding pressure to stock prices, the federal government apprehended fewer people at the U.S. southern border, lowering the number of new arrivals to detain or monitor. Still, in December, GEO Group touted that the “alien population” in the United States holds strong at 16.8 million, citing a figure from the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a nonprofit seeking to reduce immigration. GEO Group also said that 182,000 people were being monitored in the community for ICE’s Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (down from about 370,000 under the Biden administration).

Zoley said GEO Group subsidiary BI Incorporated could scale up its monitoring contract to serve millions of people for ICE.

The Trump administration is also still ramping up. And investors and observers expect the system to keep growing this year.

“As they expand their infrastructure — that includes officers, buildings, fleets, buses, planes, technology — then that’s when we are probably going to see more people, more numbers captured into all of this,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, a national human rights nonprofit that monitors the prison industry.

Join the community that keeps criminal justice on the front page.

The Department of Homeland Security recently signed a $140 million contract to buy planes from Boeing for deportations. Thousands of new ICE and Border Patrol agents are being recruited, with others offered $50,000 signing bonuses to come out of retirement. More local police and sheriff departments have formal agreements to support national immigration enforcement efforts.

The White House and ICE see publicly traded private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic as “allies and assets” to their ongoing efforts to deport many more people, said David Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

“The contractors are the consequence of the policy choice made by this administration,” he said.

And as a libertarian, he said he views illegal immigration as the consequence of a broken immigration system. He described the Trump administration’s immigration policy as “indiscriminate mass deportation.”

“If you go down the list, it’s hard to find a right that they haven’t violated in the Constitution,” he said. “I find it incredibly troubling that they are getting away with it so far.”

He said trying to open 100,000 ICE detention beds nationwide is an “absurd goal” that has required the government to arrest people for a far broader set of reasons than previous administrations have used.

“There aren’t enough criminal immigrants in the United States that they can catch to fill those facilities, so this is all about caging a bunch of peaceful people who aren’t bothering anyone,” Bier said.

He expects the Trump administration to surpass its detention bed goal.

“They could easily be at 200,000 by the end of this term,” he said. “The main limitation would just be the personnel to man that. You have to find actual people willing to do this work. But in terms of just paying for it, they got way more money than they could possibly spend on this.”

Gomes, the analyst, said that as ICE brings more people into work, it could improve the financial results of GEO Group and CoreCivic.

“As those employees come on, you will see the number of detentions increase,” he said.",https://mirrorball.themarshallproject.org/S_vyipQ71nG2K8vqfKNgo5KnXavBgl4XEmUit4A6U78/w:1200/aHR0cHM6Ly9kMm0x/OXBtdnRzNWJvYi5j/bG91ZGZyb250Lm5l/dC9ocHZzYnpuMWNj/MDE0a29pOXZpaW56/N290dHN5L0dFVFRZ/X01BUktFVC1ERVRF/TlRJT05fYWRlbGFu/dG9fZGV0ZW50aW9u/X2NlbnRlcl8yNTEy/MjIuanBn,N,,2026-01-06 09:58:03.386458

I have one question right now: What is America doing in Venezuela? Over the weekend, on Jan. 3, the Trump administration launched an operation that ended with the capture of Nicolás Maduro, the president of Venezuela.

We’ve heard a lot of reasons from the Trump administration about why they decided to do this: Maduro is not a good guy. He’s an oppressive, brutal dictator who has made the lives of many people miserable. But there are a lot of brutal, repressive dictators in this world.

Venezuela is not a leading supplier in America’s fentanyl crisis.

Venezuela’s oil reserves are not an easy source of future wealth or power for the United States. (And oil should not be a reason to invade another country anyway.)

President Donald Trump ran for office promising fewer foreign entanglements. He wanted to be remembered as a peacemaker.

So what are we doing, watching President Trump stand onstage, saying: America is now running Venezuela? That the people standing behind him are now running Venezuela? And then watching Marco Rubio, the secretary of state and interim national security adviser, try to walk that back?

This was a profound gamble from the Trump administration. Trump ran for office this time promising an end to these kinds of gambles, criticizing those that previous presidents had made in the past.

So what are the arguments, views, interests, factions that led America to this point? And what comes after it?

Joining me is Jonathan Blitzer, who has covered immigration and the Trump administration in Central America for The New Yorker. He has profiled Stephen Miller and gone deep into the drug-boat bombings the Trump administration has been executing. He is also the author of the excellent book “Everyone Who Is Gone is Here: The United States, Central America and the Making of a Crisis.”

Ezra Klein: Jonathan Blitzer, welcome to the show.

Jonathan Blitzer: Thanks for having me.

Who is Nicolás Maduro? How should we understand what he represents and was?

Maduro has always been, to my mind, a middling figure who attached himself to his predecessor, Hugo Chávez — who was a transformative, obviously highly controversial figure in Venezuela, who nationalized the oil industry, who made improving the lives of the poor a central plank of his political agenda but also consolidated power in all kinds of ways, flirted with violating the Constitution, and so on.

Maduro was essentially a member of that administration and became Chávez’s appointed successor when Chávez became sick with cancer and died. So Maduro took power in 2013 but never had the charisma of Chávez. Almost immediately when he took office, you had things start to change the fortunes of the country. You had the price of oil drop. There was an economic crisis. You started to have an increase in inflation that got steadily worse in the 2010s. You started to have a series of domestic flare-ups of mass protests, which Maduro responded to by cracking down on the population in increasingly aggressive ways. This was in 2014 and again in 2017.

In 2015, the Venezuelan opposition won congressional elections and it seemed like they could really bring Maduro to heel. The response of Maduro and his inner circle was to essentially invalidate that victory of the opposition in Congress and to go on to try to neuter the power of the opposition. And what we saw in the years since was an increasingly brutal consolidation of power.

So he’s someone who was always a weak personal replacement to Chávez, who channeled all of Chávez’s darkest, most repressive urges and has basically been at the helm during a period where the country has really disintegrated in many ways.

Since 2014, you have close to 8 million Venezuelans who have fled the country. That’s all during Maduro’s time as leader.

Donald Trump has been talking about deposing Nicolás Maduro since his first term. Why? And why didn’t it happen then?

The most interesting thing to those of us following Trump’s stance on this issue during his first term was that there were real hawks and hard-liners in his first administration who were pushing for more aggressive direct action in Venezuela and in the region — and the person who was uncomfortable moving forward was Trump. He was skeptical of the idea of putting boots on the ground. He was skeptical of the idea of overextending American involvement in the region. So probably the most striking thing has been his change from Trump 1.0 to Trump 2.0.

But the Venezuela issue has always loomed large for him. Part of that is just purely political: The South Florida Republican Latino community — which is obviously very important to him and is important among a lot of his supporters and administration members — has always really been fixated on Venezuela. They see the Venezuelan regime as being the key to unlocking the downfall of socialist regimes across the region — in Cuba, above all, but also in Nicaragua.

So there has always been a real appetite for high-flying, saber-rattling rhetoric on the issue. Trump initially understood the priority of Venezuela in those terms — as a political imperative.

But the idea that we did this for political support in southern Florida doesn’t track for me. There have been too many players involved. Donald Trump is not running for re-election again — probably.

What were the conceptions of American interests at play?

There’s no question that oil is a huge interest for Trump and something that he’s always been fixated on.

It bothered him, and it bothered people in his inner circle, that Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, nationalized large parts of the country’s oil sector and essentially forced out American and international companies in the 2000s.

So there’s been this idea that American capitalist interests have been dispossessed and that it’s a matter of recouping what was lost. There’s a sense of opportunity there.

I also think that he’s someone who has grand designs for asserting American influence in the region as a reflection of his political power.

The Venezuela issue has always been an opportunity for him to do that on a big international stage, to really be the bully that he’s wanted to be.

Tell me about the oil and geopolitics side of this. Because that does seem to have been quite compelling to Trump himself.

The thing that I’ve heard is that inside the administration there was tension from the very start of the current term. On the one hand, there were hard-liners like Rubio and that broader delegation of Rubio-aligned members of Congress wanting the administration to take increasingly aggressive action against Venezuela, and roll back some of the easing of the sanctions done during the Biden administration.

The Biden administration created a special exception for Chevron to continue to do some measure of business in Venezuela. And it seems like, at a certain point, the threat was made to Trump that these members of Congress would block or drag their feet on the so-called “big, beautiful bill,” his big domestic spending bill, if he didn’t chart a harder course against Venezuela.

So, in one sense, he was responsive to all of those things and conscious of the need for everyone to be in lock step, particularly around that big domestic spending bill.

At the same time, he was very concerned about the idea of Chevron losing its foothold at a time when a lot of observers will point out that the U.S. hard line against Venezuela has allowed other countries like Russia, Iran and China to establish increasing influence, both in Venezuela and over the Venezuelan oil industry.

So there was this plan to try to manage both things. And I think in some ways, the aggression that we’ve seen is an outgrowth of the administration trying to square that particular circle.

Trump ostensibly acceded to the demands made by hard-line anti-Maduro Republicans in Congress to continue to keep these sanctions, to roll back some of the Biden administration allowances on Chevron’s activity in the region.

Then, by the time that bill had passed, by the end of July, you have the White House signing this legal memorandum to essentially justify, or at least set in motion, the start of these boat bombings.

So I think Trump thinks very actively about the oil issue. What’s unclear to me is what he’s hearing from advisers about the difficulty of propping back up the Venezuelan oil industry.

The big problem has been that Venezuela is responsible for less than 1 percent of the world’s overall oil output. It’s producing half of what it used to produce per day in the ’90s. So re-establishing the industry is going to require a huge amount ——

I’ve seen things like $60 billion of investment, over a long period of time, in a place where we don’t know its long-term stability. We don’t know what Venezuela is going to look like after this in five or 10 years.

The track record of deposing the leader we don’t like, and everything is going to be stable and aligned to American interests for the foreseeable future, is not great.

American oil companies, by the way, are extraordinarily risk averse. It’s not lost on them. First of all, the Iraq example is looming large in their minds. But also, all of these questions about the long-term American plan for Venezuela — that no one really can answer — militate against these companies getting involved in the oil sector right now, given the unpredictability of what’s ahead.

You’ve talked about this as, in part, a Stephen Miller theory — that there is an effort to establish what one might call deterrence or fear among every leader in the Western Hemisphere, and that Venezuela was, for a variety of reasons, the best example to use.

When we talk about Venezuela, we’re not really just talking about Venezuela. We’re talking about making an example of Venezuela such that every other leader in Latin America acts differently when Trump rattles his saber in the future.

That’s exactly right. That’s always been the case with Venezuela. When we talk about Venezuela, we’re never just talking about Venezuela.

One former Trump official said to me at the start of the boat bombings late last year that, insofar as any foreign government was looking at those bombings and scratching their heads and wondering: What is the message here? Is this going to come around for us? — well, mission accomplished. If the idea is to scare everyone and to make everyone feel that Trump is crazy enough to do anything, then his actions are achieving some desired effect.

The interesting thing about Miller’s involvement in this is — as someone who covered the administration during the first Trump term ——

And profiled Stephen Miller.

And spent a lot of time trying to understand Miller’s role in the government then and now — is that he was not someone who was anywhere near this issue during Trump 1.0, which is unsurprising to those who know Stephen Miller as Trump’s immigration adviser and a hard-liner on domestic issues.

What I think has changed, and what’s been interesting to see this go-round, is how Miller has inserted himself into this space.

When this current administration took shape and you saw someone like Marco Rubio as secretary of state, I think it stood to reason that the administration was going to take a series of very aggressive actions in the region, and specifically vis-à-vis Venezuela, because Rubio has always been a really ideological player in this space, both when he was a senator and obviously now.

He’s someone who has always seen the Maduro regime as illegitimate — which he’s not wrong to do, particularly after Maduro lost the 2024 election and declared himself the winner. But going back years and years, Rubio has always had an ax to grind with the Cuban government. He has always been among the hardest-line Republicans on these issues, although he’s particularly well versed in them.

So he’s a complicated player in all of this. It’s unsurprising that a Trump administration with Rubio as secretary of state would be angling for regime change in Venezuela. But what I think has surprised me is the degree to which Miller’s putting his thumb on the scale for intervention changed the development of the administration’s position in the late summer of last year.

Miller is chiefly obsessed with immigration. And to someone like Miller, the situation in Venezuela is responsible for a huge influx of Venezuelan migrants that really exploded during the years of the Biden administration. So it’s not surprising that he would be interested in the region in that way. But another thing that he’s always really fantasized about was using increasingly broad military-style powers for the president to crack down on immigration enforcement in the United States. And the Venezuela issue represents a nexus for him and to that way of thinking.

One of the first things the administration did in 2025 was invoke the Alien Enemies Act, an extremely obscure 18th-century law that basically has only ever been invoked during wartime.

The United States, obviously, at the start of 2025, was not in any war. And yet the logic that Miller put forward, and that the administration adopted, was to say that mass migration represented a kind of hostile foreign invasion. That was defined primarily in terms of Venezuela.

So a lot of the most aggressive immigration actions taken in the United States were taken over the last year and a half in reference to Maduro, in reference to the idea that he posed some sort of hostile threat to the United States.

In fact, the whole premise of Miller’s thinking was that if we bomb these boats and if the Venezuelan government reacts harshly, then we can make some kind of claim that we are in a state of open hostility with this country, and therefore need to take more dramatic action within the country.

You have 600,000 Venezuelans living in the United States with temporary protected status. You have at least 100,000 other Venezuelans who came into the United States during the Biden years through a parole program, which was always going to leave them in a precarious position because that was just a program designed to get them into the country lawfully. They would then have to apply for some more-lasting status. Those people are living in an intense sort of limbo right now. A lot of their work authorizations have been canceled. So I think the Venezuelan population in the United States has always been a very ripe target.

It should be said of Miller: He’s smart. The Venezuelan population is really ripe to be exploited because they’re people who had arrived recently, in the last couple of years, who are on the legal fringes with status that will eventually expire.

The last thing I’ll say is something that I was guilty of dismissing a bit during the Biden years. I found myself in conversations with congressional Republicans during the Biden years who spoke very seriously about the idea of the U.S. bombing fentanyl labs in Mexico. I kind of rolled my eyes and thought it was a lark and just a bit of high-flying rhetoric while they were in the political opposition. It’s something that Trump had openly spoken about during his first term, and they were basically brought to heel by various establishment players like the Department of Defense ——

Well, very specifically, the secretary of defense.

Correct.

That gets to something I want to talk a little bit about. We’re bringing in the staffing here. Every administration action is an emergent property of the people around the president and the president himself.

Tell me just a little bit about the difference between the staffing coalitions here in Trump 1.0 and Trump 2.0, and the way those conversations ended up playing out.

I think that’s everything. I think you’re right to identify that. The one response I get from everyone who had been involved in this issue during Trump 1.0 — which, ironically, includes people who ideologically are more predisposed to interventionism and regime change than some of the current players — is that in Trump 1.0, there was this constant sense: OK, key elements of the Defense Department are going to say we can’t do this.

A former high-ranking State Department official during Trump 1.0 said to me yesterday that Trump and the more hawkish members of his cabinet were told on the first go-round that this has never been done before.

That was a refrain that particularly bothered a lot of the real Trump loyalists, that they were told: No. You want to do this transformative thing, but it’s just not done.

That was taken as a taunt and a challenge to some degree, certainly for someone like Miller. But that was the bottom line.

And interestingly, in the current configuration of his advisers, there’s no one who could impose a meaningful check on Trump’s worst impulses — or on Miller’s worst impulses. The one person who represents a more establishment-grounded-type voice also happens to be one of the most ideological people in the administration on this particular issue — Marco Rubio.

That said, interestingly, at the start of the current administration, Miller brought up this idea of bombing fentanyl labs in Mexico. It was something that brought together all of his pet projects and ideological and, frankly, racial obsessions: the idea that the Mexican government was allowing cartels to export people and drugs into the United States.

He was essentially told: This would be counterproductive in all of these ways. We actually have a pretty strong working relationship with the current Mexican administration. It’s not a relationship the Mexican government wants to tout particularly, but they’re doing everything we want them to do. They’ve helped us with drug interdiction. They’ve helped us increase enforcement along the border — all of these traditional things that the Mexican government has actually taken a very active role in doing behind the scenes. Why would we openly provoke them? They’re our largest trading partner. There would just be catastrophic downstream consequences if we were to take this kind of action there.

So even in the current administration, that message was sent to someone like Miller. His response essentially was: OK, well, let’s find somewhere else to bomb.

They didn’t just find somewhere else to bomb — they found something else to bomb.

This has been one of the strangest dimensions of the arguments around Venezuela: the high-profile bombing of the drug boats.

America has a profound fentanyl problem, and fentanyl comes from, among other places, China and Mexico. Fentanyl is very hard to stop because it is such a potent, synthesized, concentrated molecule that pocket-size amounts can — and do — kill huge numbers of Americans.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration appears to have moved to bombing cocaine smuggling. I’m not saying cocaine is great, but it was not a major issue in either the 2020 or 2024 election that America has a huge cocaine problem.

So there has been this weird movement from: We have this big fentanyl problem, and we need to do something about it. To now: We’re bombing these boats that are allegedly smuggling cocaine.

It’s perplexing.

It’s perplexing if you try to disentangle it logically. It is extraordinarily cynical.

Someone at the Defense Department had told me that, quite literally, the rationale was: We want to do something kinetic — the phrase they all love to use is “kinetic.” We want to do something that’s never been done before. We want to show that Trump is stronger and more serious than any of his predecessors. We’ll literally pick a different target.

The bombing of those boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific is exactly that. To your point, the president comes out and says this is an act of self-defense, that drug overdoses are up, there are hundreds of thousands of Americans who have died ——

They’ve actually fallen recently.

That’s true.

But drug overdoses are high and a genuinely disastrous problem. But from fentanyl, primarily.

One hundred percent. And as everyone points out, if you look at Coast Guard data, none of this is coming through the Caribbean. What’s more, the cocaine that’s coming through the Caribbean and the eastern part of the Pacific tends to have its destination as European cities, not American ones.

So I don’t think there was any serious, substantive point behind selecting these targets as a matter of curbing the drug trade. I think it had a lot more to do with asserting a new, raw power and sending a broader message. But, yes, it’s utterly perplexing. It’s in many ways nonsensical.

I have to say: Trump pardoned Juan Orlando Hernández, the ex-president of Honduras, who was charged and convicted in almost precisely the same way, short of the kind of military intervention that extracted Maduro from Venezuela. But he was someone who was charged in the Southern District of New York and was also held in Brooklyn. The people at the Department of Justice who worked on those charging documents and those investigations go back to Trump’s first term.

One of the most prominent players in that investigation in the Southern District of New York was a guy named Emil Bove, who was a prosecutor in that division during Trump 1.0 and then eventually became Trump’s personal lawyer. He then served at a high level at the start of Trump’s second term in the Department of Justice and has since been nominated and confirmed as an appellate court judge.

He was largely involved in helping prepare that research, showing how Juan Orlando Hernández had been involved in the drug trade. There wasn’t a lot of controversy around the charges brought against him.

Nevertheless, Trump, at the end of November, in a move that, frankly, is inexplicable in every sense, pardoned him.

I still don’t understand how that happened. You don’t, either? You’re telling me that you don’t have an explanation?

There is what Trump himself said, which is that this was a Biden frame-up because technically Hernández was convicted and sentenced during the Biden years. Again, that flies in the face of everything we know about how the case against Hernández was built during the first Trump administration.

Hernández, at a certain point, wrote an obsequious letter to Trump that Roger Stone delivered to him, basically comparing both of them to victims of American justice run amok.

None of these things justify the pardoning of Hernández — least of all at a time when the current administration is saying the reason they ousted Maduro from power and brought him to the United States for trial is because he’s a narco-terrorist. These are exactly the same charges brought against Hernández.

So it pretty much voids any pretense that American interests right now in Venezuela have to do with stemming the drug trade. The randomness of how the administration shifted from a not illegitimate concern about fentanyl labs in parts of Mexico, say, to the indiscriminate bombing of small drug boats in the Caribbean is really a product of a political calculation, above all.

Well, you say what they want to do is something “kinetic,” which is the Orwellian way that violence gets described in military action.

Yes.

It seems to me that what they wanted to do was something that was a spectacle. There is a certain amount of governing or propagandizing or signal sending through spectacle.

With the release of the drone videos — you see the eradication and killing of these people on these boats — they were looking for something that was televisual. They were looking for something that worked as vertical video on X. The photos of the makeshift situation room at Mar-a-Lago during this operation have a huge screen showing X with a search for Venezuela on it. The photos they released of Maduro — the whole thing seems so built around spectacle.

I think you have to see this as “propaganda through force.” That might have been one of your pieces or, certainly, in somebody’s piece that I read in preparing for this.

Exactly. That was a phrase used by a former Trump administration official in describing this.

It’s also worth pointing out what was happening in the United States at the time, at the start of these boat bombings. There was also an increased militarization in American cities like Los Angeles and Chicago related to this immigration crackdown.

One thing that a number of officials have made the point to me, and I think it’s well taken, is that the general logic here is making military action a daily presence in American life in every sense. As you say, it’s visual, it’s kind of atmospheric. So this was all happening simultaneously.

The strangeness, to my mind, about how Venezuela emerges as this particular target that serves all of these different political ends is that there were different factions within the Trump administration that actually had different views on how the United States should engage with Venezuela.

It’s a genuinely complicated question. You have a repressive, dictatorial president who does have ties to the drug trade — there’s no question — who refused to recognize a democratic election, who has done all of these obviously horrific crimes. How do you engage with him?

There are longstanding sanctions. Those sanctions seem to be immiserating the population but haven’t really dislodged Maduro himself from power. Previous diplomatic efforts have all run up against the bottom line that Maduro would never negotiate his own ouster. That has always been a diplomatic catch in any broader design for the region.

So there was an element within the Trump administration early on that favored a more conciliatory approach. It was epitomized by Richard Grenell, a special envoy who flew down to Caracas, met with Maduro, and achieved some small successes. For example, he got the Venezuelan government to release Americans held in Venezuelan prisons and convinced the Venezuelan government to start accepting deportation flights from the United States.

So there were these incremental achievements or gains made from that more conciliatory approach. But someone like Grenell was quickly outgunned by the combination of Rubio and his ideological vision for the region and regime change, and people like Miller, who brought these other concerns to the issue.

It’s kind of a weird confluence of the different interests of people at play, such that this becomes a kind of natural target. And the one through line, I would say, given the differences among the various actors involved inside the administration, was the question: At the end of the day, what would the fallout actually be for the administration if it started to take increasingly aggressive action against Venezuela?

Maduro is an international pariah. Venezuela is not a country that’s contiguous with the United States in the way that Mexico is.

Not to make this sound too simple, but I have to say I’ve been struck in some of my conversations with people on the inside describing that the thinking was boiling down to: Can this really hurt us that badly? As if this is a perfect theater for us to experiment in these ways because the blowback won’t be as substantial as it would be elsewhere.

The Trump administration has described what they think could go right here — which is that you have a pliant government in Venezuela that does what we want them to do, which leads to more oil exports, which leads to fewer migrant outflows.

It seems like a tall order. But what could go wrong here? If we’re looking back in a couple of years, and this looks like a signal catastrophe, what happened?

I would say there are two ways of grouping the categories of what could go wrong — because there’s just a vast amount of things that could go wrong.

The first would be: Let’s say Maduro has been removed and now the administration has elevated a hard-liner in Delcy Rodríguez to this new role as interim president. In this world, where the U.S. now basically begs off or drifts away, you have a regime in Venezuela that is even harder line, that’s been backed into a corner, that’s going to crack down in even new ways on the Venezuelan population that’s there. And what you’ve effectively done is you’ve really neutered the political opposition in the country after years of the Venezuelan opposition really trying to assert itself and trying to build a popular mandate.

It has always been a problem for the Venezuelan opposition: finding a way of continuing to seem relevant to the Venezuelan people, when even after they win elections, the government just refuses to recognize those results, and everyone goes back to the status quo.

The Venezuelan opposition leader just won the Nobel Peace Prize and dedicated it to Donald Trump. But Trump just dismissed her, saying that she doesn’t have the juice to run the country.

Dismissed her, yes. That was always the concern for María Corina Machado, the Nobel laureate and leader of the Venezuelan opposition — an incredibly charismatic figure who wasn’t the candidate who stood for election in 2024. She had been barred from running for office. Instead it was someone she backed, a diplomat, an older, statelier diplomat, who I think won in large part because of Machado’s advocacy for him and her presence and her courage.

Her particular gambit has been that the only way to meaningfully get rid of Maduro is to depend on the direct foreign intervention of the United States. But there was always this concern that if you put all of your stock in the idea that the Americans are going to come dislodge the regime and usher in some sort of democratic restoration, when Trump doesn’t do that, you are discredited, and you are marginalized — which seems to be what’s happening.

So the first order of bad outcomes is exactly this: The administration in some form or another persists. The hard-liners continue to exert major influence in the country, relatively unchecked. There are further domestic crackdowns. And the Venezuelan opposition, such as it is, is now completely at sea.

The other universe of possibilities is that there is a power vacuum. Because there’s a careful, precarious balance to how the current situation is persisting: You have a group of armed vigilante groups called colectivos who have essentially operated at the behest of the regime but are in some ways free agents. You have elements of the military who are very paranoid about their standing, who have access, obviously, to weapons, to drugs, to money. You have a contingent of Colombian rebels operating along the border. You have the potential for an immense amount of uncontrolled violence and intense ongoing factionalism. And if you remove one piece from this equation, all hell will break loose.

These are just tamer summaries of some of the possibilities. But the potential outcomes could be quite grave.

Frankly, I don’t know what’s coming. I don’t know what it means for the current administration to say, as it has in explicit terms: If Delcy Rodríguez, the now acting president, doesn’t do what we want her to do, she’ll suffer a fate worse than Maduro’s.

It’s hard to imagine any government, least of all a government full of Chavistas, who have consolidated all of this power for decades now, just acceding to the idea that they’re just puppets of an American administration.

Certainly, when it comes to American intervention in the region, there are a thousand cautionary tales of what it means for the United States to have this kind of prolonged involvement in the country, and what’s more, to take this kind of aggressive military action.

Needless to say, we haven’t talked about the fact that there was no congressional authorization for this.

Incredible violation of international law.

Exactly. Take your pick.

Maduro is a bad guy. He’s a genuinely bad guy. But there are a lot of bad guys leading countries. As Donald Trump has said before, he has exchanged love letters with Kim Jong-un.

I don’t want to defend Nicolás Maduro. He is bad. On the other hand, this is clearly not a standard that we are applying across the world.

If we did start applying that — America truly as the world’s policeman — should we go arrest the leader of Saudi Arabia for killing a journalist who was writing for The Washington Post and allegedly hacking him up with a bone saw?

This is your point, too, about the history of American involvement in the wider region in Latin America. The United States government propped up some of the worst actors for decades.

We’re negotiating with Putin right now.

Exactly.

I want to get at a bigger-picture point that reflects the oil, the drugs, the socialist leader of Venezuela and the Marco Rubio domino theory about Cuba.

This feels like a war or an operation, whatever you want to call it, out of the 1980s. Out of a time when the big drug is cocaine. Out of a time when the global economy is dependent on oil as opposed to moving to renewable energy supply chains — which China is racing ahead of us on and Trump is devastating in America. Out of a time when there’s more fear that socialism might be on the rise and be an attractive ideology to people. Nobody is looking at Venezuela as a successful country that might inspire a lot of imitators.

I can run through the constellation of arguments being made in favor of this. But they all have this quality of being adjacent to reality as it is now.

There’s an energy argument, but the energy argument is the one that would have made sense in the ’80s. We are a huge energy exporter at this point. America is not dependent on others. We do not have an energy independence problem. And to the extent we do have a problem with the future, it is that China is wrecking us right now on things like the solar supply chain. The expectation is not that the future will be won by whoever has access to the deepest oil reserves.

Again, fentanyl — not cocaine — is the drug problem.

There just isn’t a huge problem with socialist strongmen taking power all over Latin America. It’s a disaster for the Venezuelan people, but that’s a somewhat different issue from, at least, the American perspective.

There just seems to be something slightly out of time about it.

It’s a great observation. The ’80s overlay is particularly striking to me, too, when you think about the immigration policies coming out of this administration. The hostility to immigrants in general, in many ways, is an attempt to rewrite some of the policies written in the 1980s, like the Refugee Act of 1980. That has been all but gutted. The idea of asylum refugee practice — gone.

One of the great ironies, to me, in Trump’s new view of alliances in the region, is his alliance with Nayib Bukele, the authoritarian president of El Salvador. I’m thinking particularly, among other things, about how when the administration first invoked the Alien Enemies Act, it sent a group of some 250 Venezuelans accused — in almost every case, without basis or evidence — of belonging to this Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to a notoriously brutal Salvadoran prison. The Salvadoran government got $5 million to hold them for an indefinite period of time. They were brutally tortured, they were held incommunicado.

To someone like me, who spends a lot of time thinking about the long sweep of American foreign policy and immigration policy and how they’re intertwined over time, it was incredibly striking to see, particularly during the first Trump term, villainizing immigrants on the basis that many of the Central American immigrants who had arrived in the United States in recent years were somehow members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13. Never mind that it began in the United States and was a scourge that defined the region in the early 2000s and led to large numbers of people showing up at the border during the first Trump administration.

Now you have Venezuelans being accused by the government of belonging to a Venezuelan gang. The target has just changed. Now the ally in prosecuting that case, just as it had been in the ’80s, was a hard-line Salvadoran regime in the region that, I think, in some ways, Trump really wants to emulate.

In some sense, it’s ridiculous to suggest that the president of El Salvador right now is a model for Trump, given just his unrivaled power on the world stage. But one of the things that the Salvadoran government has done in recent years has been to basically suspend the constitution and run the country from month to month in what has been called a state of exception. That is almost exactly what the Trump administration fantasizes about in ways both literal and figurative.

So in terms of why that mode of thinking still seems to appeal to Trump and to some of his hard-line ideologues, I can see it as a throwback to an era of American interventionism and unbridled sort of demonstrations of force and power.

There’s been reporting about the fact that Maduro, as an attempt to placate the Trump administration, basically offered his country’s oil up to the administration. The administration refused it, which again raises the question of this being more about a show of force. It’s a very strange thing.

But I think you’re right: A lot of the ideological thinking around this has a kind of hoary, ’80s-era element. If you poke it a little bit further, particularly in the context of Venezuela and this sort of domino theory almost in reverse — if you topple a socialist regime in the region, then others will fall — you really start to see the radicalism of this old hard-line Rubio position on Cuba, which he has not really budged on in his time in public office. He has always been utterly hard-line and stubborn on the question of needing to overthrow the Cuban government. And again, that’s very old-world, backward looking.

I mean, this is not to defend the abuses of the Cuban government, which are obscene in every sense. But it is a mode of thinking that is very dated.

How do you understand who is now running Venezuela?

What Trump and Rubio agree on in their somewhat different statements is that the acting president of Venezuela has to do what we want her to do.

So what do we want her to do?

I don’t exactly know what the U.S. expectation is for Delcy Rodríguez, the interim president.

Have we done a lot of planning about how to run Venezuela?

It does not seem to me to be the case.

Delcy Rodríguez, the acting president of Venezuela, is a strange person for the U.S. to elevate. Delcy Rodríguez is someone who, before Maduro was in power, was basically a middling government bureaucrat during the regime of Chávez.

Her fortunes changed when Maduro came to office. Her brother became the chief political strategist for Maduro, and she, with him, started to have an increasingly active role in overseeing his government.

At a certain point, she was in charge of the foreign ministry. Then she became in charge of the economy and eventually took on the oil portfolio. She was widely regarded as someone who was politically ruthless, someone who was a true believer, one of the most loyal and ideological members of the regime.

Her father had been tortured and killed at the hands of a pro-U.S. Venezuelan administration, and it has been said that she’s always harbored a sense of aggrievement and victimhood as a result of that.

She is, for all of her ruthlessness, also known to have managed somewhat competently under the circumstances in trying — given this terrible hand the country has been dealt economically — to stabilize inflation, trying to increase oil production.

But she’s someone who is deeply implicated in all of the gravest misdeeds of the administration of the regime. For example, her brother was the person responsible basically for forcing through the fraudulent election of 2024.

So she is basically at the center of all of the most controversial elements of the Maduro regime and its actions — and, naturally, during Trump’s first term, was actually sanctioned for this by the Trump administration.

Amazing how things work out.

Yes. As one former Trump administration official told me: If your whole logic has been that Maduro is an illegitimate president and that his regime is illegitimate, what does it mean to remove him and then replace him with his No. 2 — someone who is implicated in every misdeed of the Maduro regime?

I know that there is a complicated problem the administration has to solve, and this has always been on the table — and was always one of the reasons the United States shouldn’t have gotten involved as precipitously as it has — and that is: It’s not clear the best way forward without Maduro.

The Venezuelan opposition won national elections in 2024, but the country is still in the stranglehold of the regime and the military. And the opposition figures who won that 2024 election and who now have this prominent role on the international stage make the existing powers in the country very uncomfortable.

So there’s always going to be this question of whether or not the Venezuelan opposition can coexist with the hard-line elements of the military that remain acting in the country and don’t want any of their interests touched. That was always going to be a conundrum under any circumstance if the current leadership was removed.

So the logic seems to be that in picking someone like Delcy Rodríguez to be the interim figure, that calms the nerves of the key players in the military and the government, the interior minister, the head of the armed forces.

But those guys aren’t naive. Those guys certainly see what course this puts them on — particularly when the administration is now being explicit about the fact that if Rodríguez does anything that the administration doesn’t like, they’ll remove her.

I guess the thinking seems to be that will spook people into maybe agreeing to leave the country. But that has never really been the case.

It’s very, very unclear what the broader calculus is here.

It all reminds me a lot of Iraq. Though I’m not saying that these countries are the same — they do not have the same internal divisions. I’m not saying it will go the same way.

Over the past years, I have read a number of books trying to reconstruct how America ended up in this completely optional, chosen war in Iraq.

One of the things you see when you begin to try to answer the question of why we ended up doing that is that there was no single answer. There were a bunch of factions that each had their own reason for wanting this done, and as an accumulation, it was enough to push the decision-making over the finish line.

The people who hated Saddam Hussein for humanitarian reasons; the people who really did believe in weapons of mass destruction; the people who wanted the oil; the people who wanted to export democracy; the people who wanted to show the world that America was back and you couldn’t mess with us; George W. Bush’s: This guy tried to kill my dad.

Not one of these reasons was good enough, but all of them together created enough pressure that it ended up happening.

This has that strange emergent quality to me. Invading Venezuela for the oil is stupid because we don’t need oil at the moment, and oil prices are low, and we shouldn’t invade countries for oil anyway, and the global energy system is moving over.

In some ways, that’s the scariest prospect here: That it’s the happenstance confluence of individual positions or predispositions of particular people, none of whom, I think it’s fair to say, are people of a high degree of integrity.

We’re talking about someone like Pete Hegseth, whose primary concern, as I understand it in this configuration, is to get on Miller’s good side. So maybe that conditions his acquiescence to Miller’s harder line in a way that a previous secretary of defense would draw a line and say no.

You’ve got Rubio with this age-old ideological obsession that aligns with a jaundiced view that Trump has of the world that harks back to the ’80s — but at the same time also represents a misunderstanding of recent developments.

I asked this question to one former Trump administration official just the other day. This person had been involved in a lot of the decision-making around Venezuela in the first Trump term.

I said: What has changed? Trump initially was reticent to get involved in this direct, overt way. Now, obviously, he’s delighting in it. How do you explain that shift? The only thing I see that has changed is that there was a rationale in the first Trump term that we need to establish democracy or support democracy in the region. Now that’s not even on the table. There isn’t even a gesture made in that direction.

The person went on to enumerate the fact that some recent developments that all occurred during the Biden years and that were obsessions for Trump, in a certain sense, can seem to be aligned with the Venezuela issue.

The rise in overdose deaths — to your point, that’s fentanyl, that is not cocaine. But it doesn’t matter in the rough logic of the current administration.

There’s the idea of the immigration problem. Sure, there are a large number of Venezuelans who have arrived in the United States in recent years. But an intervention like this does not curb the immigration issue at all. In fact, if anything, it unleashes another dimension of it.

There are all these very notional ideas that Trump has latched on to, and they reflect a warped vision of what’s happening in the region.

There’s also supposed to be an idea pushing in the other direction. We keep talking about Trump and what Trump wants, but something that Trump said in his often contradictory but nevertheless repetitive way was that he doesn’t want more wars, he doesn’t want more foreign entanglements.

He ran in 2016 as an opponent of the Iraq war. We can argue about whether or not he actually was when that was happening, but he certainly ran as a critic of it in 2016.

One thing we were endlessly told by MAGA-line figures in this period was that the good thing about Donald Trump is that if he’s in office, he’s not going to waste American blood or treasure going off on adventures in other countries where we don’t know how they’ll end up.

The bulwark on this was supposed to be a MAGA isolationism. What happened to that?

I don’t know that this is a meaningful response, per se, but there is a kind of hermetic logic to the MAGA view of things and to Trump’s view of things in particular. It’s a little bit the idea that action has to be taken to continue to prop up some of the lies and some of the talking points that have come to define Trump’s most visible public positions.

So if you’re always talking about the fact that immigrants are criminals and that specifically Venezuelan immigrants are members of a violent gang, and that violent gang is invading the country, and it’s invading the country at the hands of a foreign dictator who’s trying to sow discord and instability through immigration — if you follow that through to its logical conclusion — if we put the word “logical” in scare quotes — you have something like this direct confrontation with Maduro and, eventually, his ouster.

The fact that there were no lives lost among American soldiers in this operation, I think, contributes to the sense inside the administration that this was a resounding success.

Because we know these things are judged the moment you capture the sovereign of the country. [Laughs.]

It’s truly mind-bending. There’s no way around it. But his whole political brand seems to be built on the idea of his strength and that we’re returning to an era of the Monroe Doctrine.

Can you say quickly what the Monroe Doctrine is?

The Monroe Doctrine, from the 1800s, is the idea that any foreign involvement in the Western Hemisphere will prompt American reprisals or action, that the United States is in charge of the Western Hemisphere, and it will act accordingly. And that gave rise to a series of American interventions in the region and this view that the U.S. is the police force for the Western Hemisphere.

To your question, this seems to fly in the face of the MAGA idea of the importance of isolationism and avoidance of international conflicts, etc. But I think so much of it also speaks to this issue of presidential power and this idea of unapologetic muscle flexing and so on.

Again, I’m casting about for explanations for a series of actions that I don’t think have a logical or substantive explanation. But I’m trying to imagine what the thinking is in the White House where they’re embarking on a project that is extraordinarily complicated and there have been a number of offramps.

I expected the boat bombings and the intercepting of oil ships to continue for several months more before there was direct military action on the ground in Venezuela. I was surprised by the suddenness of this — not necessarily by the outcome, because the administration has been explicit about always wanting to do this sort of thing. But I sort of half-expected all along that there would be some way of drawing down this conflict and declaring victory and moving on to the next thing.

But that’s clearly not how these guys think.

How much do you buy there being a “Wag the Dog” dimension to this?

Trump is down in the polls. The 2025 elections were, across the board, horrendous for Republicans. Anybody reading punditry over the new year was reading piece after piece about the weakening, the shrinking, of Donald Trump: The Trump era is already beginning to end. You’re already seeing the fractures in MAGA.

There has been an overwhelming narrative that Trump is a lame duck of some sort, and that he has lost control of the agenda. There’s an affordability crisis, and he doesn’t have an affordability plan.

Given that this is something they have actually signaled they wanted to do, to what degree do you buy the argument that this is simply Trump attempting to reassert control as the forceful actor of history?

This is his affordability agenda. Because, in theory, one day oil will be cheaper.

He’s now talking about Greenland again. Maybe you can’t pass much in Congress, but maybe you can take territory and show that the world is under your thumb.

Do you buy that?

I don’t quite know, frankly.

I keep going back to the idea of “propaganda through force,” which is the phrase of a former Trump administration official who put this in a political context that I thought was helpful. Which is that there always has to be some ongoing conflict where the president gets to demonstrate his power, his sense of control, his authority.

In that sense, I do think this is kind of tailor made for him in this moment. It’s an issue that he gets to bang the drum on. He gets to say that the Venezuelan government is now taking orders from us. He gets to say that this guy, Maduro, whom he’s talked about ad nauseam for being a horrible person, is finally out.

My understanding of what the administration has done in Venezuela is that it was not an idle outgrowth of this sense of: We need to do something to revive our brand. I think this is something that has been brewing for a while. To your earlier point, I think it was a bunch of different things that finally aligned at the right moment that allowed for this situation to escalate as quickly as it did.

So I do think that this was already set in motion, but I think it’s a very useful political prop for the president.

Of course, I hear myself saying this, and I’m aghast at the idea that this kind of intervention is a “prop,” but I do think that for the administration it is useful in that sense. I certainly think they view it that way.

Always our final question: What are three books you’d recommend to the audience?

My first would be a novel called “The Known World” by Edward P. Jones, about antebellum Virginia. It’s one of the most astonishing novels I’ve ever read, one of my favorite American novels. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

My second recommendation is a memoir by Carolyn Forché called “What You Have Heard Is True.” When she was 27, she was living in El Salvador at the start of what became the Salvadoran civil war, and it’s a reflection on what that period was like for her. It’s incredibly haunting and beautiful — and very much relevant to the current conversation.

My last recommendation would be “The Spy and the Traitor” by Ben Macintyre, from several years back, about a Soviet double agent who was working for the K.G.B. but who became a double agent for British intelligence during the Cold War. Absolutely astonishing true story that reads like fiction.

Jonathan Blitzer, thank you very much.

“There’s no due process if you’ve got an immigration case, once ICE gets you,” he said.","Overview:

The arrest of Haitian media personality Carel Pedre following a domestic dispute has placed him in ICE custody, illustrating how contact with local law enforcement — regardless of the charge — can quickly trigger detention before a criminal case is resolved.

For two weeks, Haitians around the world have been abuzz after a domestic violence arrest that could have been a standard criminal court matter instead placed one of the diaspora’s most visible media figures into federal immigration detention — awaiting his fate with deportation looming.

Carel Pedre, the host of the popular program Chokarella and backer of numerous digital series, remains in the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) following his Dec. 21 arrest in Tamarac, Fla., from a domestic dispute that played out in a neighborhood street. How he ended up spending the holidays in ICE custody is a drama-filled saga that illustrates how brushes with the law can quickly upend lives in an era where Trump administration officials say their goal is to conduct deportations at the speed of “Amazon Prime packages, but with humans.”

With Pedre’s influencer status igniting social media, the arrest also opened a door for unsubstantiated allegations against him, ignited debates about domestic violence in the community, analyses of double standards for privileged people, and spurred speculation about Pedre’s marriage and family life. Florida’s Sunshine Laws, which make public records readily accessible, also unearthed other matters, such as two prior cases where Pedre was accused of stalking violence that were reclosed, meaning resolved after being reopened.

“This is a textbook case of so many things — our biases, lack of understanding and lack of education on some things as a community,” said Frandley Julien, an immigration attorney based in Miami who does not represent Pedre. “Even of people who come from Haiti, where they came from a position of privilege, who cannot adapt to American society.”

Pedre has pleaded not guilty to the domestic violence charge. His attorney has not responded to requests for comment, and his family has asked for privacy. Only Chokarella has issued statements, saying updates will be shared when they do not jeopardize the legal proceedings.

However, how Pedre ended up in detention offers an instructive moment for the community. In just two days, a hardworking entrepreneur from humble beginnings in northwest Haiti — an apparently devoted father of two and well-liked colleague — joined the growing ranks of people from all walks of life who enter ICE custody, caught in the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda and a complex legal process with potentially long-lasting consequences.

“It is extremely common to have these types of cases,” Julien said. “One thing that’s interesting is that the ICE case will outlive the criminal case.”

Who is Carel Pedre?

Pedre’s immigration status is now the main subject of speculation by internet sleuths, legal experts and his media rivals. People have weighed in about the validity of his marriage, why he was living with a girlfriend, reasons Haitians date non-Haitians, and – most vehemently – women making a choice to protect themselves or their significant other when they feel threatened.

Two camps emerged: a #freecarel camp, which insists the argument just got out of control, and a #carelpedre side, which has posted unsavory allegations against Pedre, sometimes reeking with homophobic slurs, and resurfaced past video clips meant to show an elitist attitude.

Coupled with the domestic violence allegations, an emerging portrait of Pedre suggests two contrasting sides. One is the affable, prolific, and visionary entrepreneur the public knows. The other is an opportunistic, entitled figure who has made disparaging remarks about women, poor people, and certain artists.

Either way, Pedre’s emergence as a polarizing figure is a far cry from what the public expected when his star began to rise after the 2010 earthquake that brought him to prominence.

Pedre’s site, carelpedre.com, details his work as a radio and TV personality and philanthropist, who spends much of his time with Haitian celebrities around the world. While documenting the artists’ journeys in the arts, music and entertainment worlds on his many shows, he also works as a brand ambassador for numerous entities and supports several charities.

From Port-de-Paix to Port-au-Prince, a new voice rises

His own journey began in Port-de-Paix, the northwestern Haiti town where he was born to Fritz Pèdre, a technician with the public company Électricité d’Haïti (EDH), and Michelle Pèdre, who worked at the General Directorate of Taxes (DGI).

Locals interviewed by The Haitian Times recall that Pedre attended the National School of the Brothers of Christian Instruction for primary school, then Notre-Dame de Lourdes College (CNDL) for secondary studies. Even as a teenager, he distinguished himself for his intelligence at the local radio station Mélodie FM. He stood out as a promising communicator, a youngster with linguistic talent and remarkable access in the community. He also had a strong interest in information technology.

Pedre once described his attraction to broadcasting in emotional terms.

“Every time I am faced with the need to talk about my beginnings in radio, two feelings come over me: the desire to do better, to go further, and the urge to shed tears,” he reportedly said in a post attributed to him on Africultures.com.

“It was common for me to participate in class debates, whether I was on committees or leading rallies, in reality, I was drawn to microphones.”

At age 20, Pedre went to pursue higher education in Port-au-Prince, beginning his university studies at the Higher School of Infotronics of Haiti (ESIH). People who knew them tell The Haitian Times that Pedre and his two brothers, Steve and Valéry, lived in Tabarre for some time.

During this period, Pedre joined Radio Planèt Kreyòl, then Radio ONE in the capital. In 2007, Pedre began hosting Digicel Stars, Haiti’s top TV show and talent competition, then “Ayiti Deploge,” Digicel’s “Kiyes Ki Toro” – a Shark Tank like competition.

Fashion designer Phelicia Dell met Pedre around that time, first as an invitee to “Ayiti Deploge, then frequent collaborator on events. The VèVè Collections owner says she knows him as a “cool, professional, always there to help.”

“He cares about the image of Haiti, as he always shows through his work. Whatever you’re doing that’s positive, he’ll be there,” Dell recalls. “As an artist, he has a lot of respect for art, for people working hard to change the narrative about Haiti.”

Pedre is also a perfectionist, she said, of his work ethic. His critiques of some performers whom he believed needed to refine their work offended some at times, leading to riffs online.

“For Carel to tell you you’re good, you’re good. He doesn’t really flatter people,” Dell said. “He’s been pushing [backing] people for a long time.”

Out of disaster, new platforms arise

When the 2010 earthquake struck, Pedre was among the first and most consistent in updating people about developments through social media. Afterward, Pedre expanded from radio into digital video and online platforms. His program Chokarella, launched in 2010, built a massive audience in Haiti and the Diaspora, combining news, commentary and cultural coverage.

As technology advanced, so did his web-based content, reaching tens of thousands of people with his morning show alone and making Pedre a giant in Haitian media and entertainment. His Chokarella YouTube channel alone boasts 275,000 subscribers and 38 million views off nearly 2,600 videos posted since 2012. Of the visual podcasts he recently launched with Giuliano “DJ K9” Puzo, the gabfest-style “De Tout et De Rien” — French for “about everything and nothing” — is a crowd favorite. During these moments of camaraderie and online postings, many addressed Pedre as “Ono,” a casual mark of respect short for “your honor.”

In the U.S., he became a familiar face at high-profile events, such as Haitians at Harvard in Boston, hosted panels featuring politicians in Brooklyn, and “vibed” at concerts and shows around Florida.

“Carel did not deserve this,” said Saurel Celestin, a music promoter based in New York who has worked with Pedre. “He has done so much for Haiti, for this community, to see this happen to him is very sad.”

Many credit Pedre for showing a generation of youngsters in Haiti a way to make a living with just their phone and media savvy. He kept Haitians abroad connected to the homeland and each other across borders, with web-based series that profile hitmakers, up-and-comers, people in the periphery and the issues that inspire them.

“As an artist, you haven’t made it until you go on Chokarella or Plezi Mizik,” Celestin said. “A lot of people criticized him for being arrogant. But to me, those are other Haitian media figures who wanted to take his place, and he didn’t take crap from them.”

Landing in Florida amid crisis

In the face of escalating insecurity in Haiti, Pedre relocated to Florida about two years ago — a move that aligned with a broader wave of displacement from the Port-au-Prince area, where 1.4 million people were uprooted in 2024. Unverified reports claim that Pedre allegedly faced threats from gangs and accused him of being too close to certain prominent figures, but neither rumor could be independently verified as of this writing.

In January 2024, according to public records, he and Tanya Marie Lemaire married in Broward County. The mother of two, based in Sunrise, a town adjacent to Tamarac, operates Piece of Cake and Events by Tanya Lemaire — continuing a family baking tradition that originated in Port-au-Prince.

The pair have known each other since at least 2010, according to online archives showing them collaborating on a post-earthquake project. They share a daughter, now 16. Pedre also has a younger daughter.

Adjusting to life out of Florida appears to have come with some friction.

In March 2024, Pedre was accused of “stalking violence after service” by two people, Erwin Papillon and Soraha Papillon. The type of charge is levied when “a person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows, harasses, or cyberstalks another person” continues that behavior after they are served a formal notice, or protective injunction, to stop. Both cases are noted as being reclosed, which occurs when the case stops and resumes without a formal outcome. Details about them are sealed from the public.

Pedre’s relationship with his girlfriend, Richelle Robinson, appeared to have some tension. Few details are publicly available about their connection, but social media posts show she is of Jamaican descent, works in real estate, and frequently shared product reviews. Other posts depict her and Pedre together in various settings — including a barbershop where she’s cutting his hair and cultural events where she wears the Haitian flag.

Now, with Pedre in ICE custody, Robinson has remained mostly silent. Still, she continues to share videos from happier times, showing moments she and Pedre spent together.

Domestic dispute erupts over social media video

A social media post, incidentally, is why the pair argued in their apartment in Tamarac around midnight that Sunday morning of Dec. 21. According to the Broward Sheriff’s Office arrest report, the quarrel occurred after Robinson posted an image on social media that showed Pedre’s “butt crack” that he wanted removed. Pedre took Robinson’s phone and left the apartment, and locked her out of the home from his phone.

A nude Robinson followed Pedre to return her phone, officers reported. She either “did a flip” and fell, as Pedre told deputies, or Pedre pushed her to the ground, as Robinson claims. A neighbor said she allegedly saw Pedre choking Robinson, a claim she denies.

Deputies arrested Pedre and drove him to jail.

To some South Florida residents, being in Tamarac doomed Pedre from the start. The suburb, about 15 miles west of Fort Lauderdale, is a quiet area of planned developments, manicured golf courses, and tall shrubbery that creates a sense of seclusion. It is also the site of a triple murder, where an estranged husband, a known domestic abuser, killed his wife, her father and a neighbor — leading to nearly 20 people at the local station being fired in September. Therefore, many residents say, officers there “are not taking any chances” not making domestic arrests.

Pedre, once led away early Sunday, was booked into the Broward County Main Jail in downtown Fort Lauderdale on a domestic battery charge. Authorities also placed Pedre on an immigration hold. Such detainers are a routine part of law enforcement in many Florida jurisdictions that allow ICE to pick up any immigrant arrested to meet mass deportation goals.

The following day, Monday, a judge reviewing the preliminary charge set bond for release at $1,000, which Pedre posted that day. Broward court documents list Vanessa Joseph as his bond depositor, meaning the person providing the funds or collateral.

That Tuesday, Pedre formally entered a plea of not guilty and demanded a trial by jury, according to the court files.

The video that caused the initial brouhaha was also removed from Robinson’s Instagram account, coinciding with her follower count ballooning.

48 hours for ICE, a lifetime of consequences to process

What happens here — some attorneys and legal observers say — is critical for the next set of events. While domestic violence allegations fall under purview of the criminal courts, arrests also trigger the immigration system, which often moves much more quickly.

With the arrival of ICE looming because of the detainer, Pedre’s lawyer Jeremy McLymont filed a motion for the judge to revoke the bond so Pedre could wait in the Fort Lauderdale jail while the domestic case is resolved. Unfortunately for Pedre, that was too late to stop ICE.

On Wednesday, Christmas Eve morning, the criminal judge called Pedre’s name to go over the bond revocation motion during a virtual hearing. Silence answered.

As it turns out, ICE had picked up Pedre before the 10 a.m. hearing. Later that day, Pedre appeared in a detainee search as being at the Krome Detention Center in Miami. After one night, they transferred him to Florida Soft South Side, better known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” where the influencer spent Christmas. He has since been returned to Krome in Miami.

Lawyers, legal experts and immigrant advocates say Pedre’s transfer into immigration custody reflects a broader reality for immigrants in the United States: Any arrest — from low-level traffic offenses to serious allegations such as domestic violence — can quickly place a noncitizen into deportation proceedings, often before a judge hears the underlying case.

“We have seen a spike during the last four, five months,” Julien says, about ICE custodial arrests triggered by 287(g) agreements. “It’s being applied systematically.

Florida, in particular, leads the nation in the most arrests and detainer requests in the Haitian community. Long a proponent of strict immigration, Florida’s $39 million in ICE contracts puts it atop the 40 states with whom ICE has 1,275 agreements as of Dec. 31 to help identify and detain immigrants.

Deportations at ‘Amazon Prime’ speed goal of new system

Why ICE issued the detainer in the first place is still unknown, though speculation about the type of visa that allowed him into the U.S. and his residency status is rampant online. Such uncertainty mirrors the path of many immigrants who have been arrested for a wide range of alleged offenses and subsequently transferred to ICE custody. Charges may vary in severity and their status may or may not be clear, but the mechanism is often the same: an arrest creates a pathway into immigration detention, even when criminal cases are unresolved or later dismissed.

Federal immigration authorities have spoken openly about these actions. At an Arizona conference earlier this year, they discussed funneling people through the deportation process as quickly as possible, saying they were aiming for “[Amazon] Prime, but with human beings.”

With Trump’s mass deportation executive order aimed at bypassing standard proceedings — where someone had to be convicted and sentenced before deporting them — immigration enforcement no longer depends on the severity of a charge or the outcome of a criminal case. As a result, immigrants can be detained before they can bond out or the evidence is evaluated.

Julien says he has had to defend Haitians arrested for an array of suspected offenses that end up facing immigration charges too. Among them was a mother who was spanking her daughter, a cultural holdover in many Haitian households, and a husband whose wife called the police over a trivial matter. Even though the husband is a permanent resident, he still had an immigration hold placed when arrested.

“Domestic violence is pervasive in the Haitian community, unfortunately,” Julien said, adding that most of his cases are of men abusing women. “We have too much of it.

“But some people take it too far,” he said. “They don’t have control over their impulses.”

Case reveals rifts in community perspectives

As Pedre’s family navigates the judicial and immigration systems, Haitians have been divided in their reactions to the domestic dispute and response to Pedre’s arrest as a celebrity.

Velina E. Charlier, a well-known manbo, said in a Facebook comment that she hoped the experience would be a new opportunity for Pedre to shed light on immigrants in detention.

“The same way you did during Jan. 12, telling us what you were living, I’m counting on you to keep your voice, to talk about the many immigrants from different nations in ICE prisons. The road is hard, but I know you’ll have the strength to get across it.”

On the opposing side are people like Patricia Latour, a former collaborator of Pedre’s. She suggested in a post on Dec. 26 that the focus should be on victims of domestic violence, not Pedre, for his celebrity status. Another social media user said the case would give air to the alleged wrongdoing Pedre may have engaged in. Neither offered definitive proof of any ill behaviors, but the suggestions alone have fueled discussions about stopping people with privilege in Haiti from getting away with harmful acts.

Back in Port-de-Paix, residents seemed indifferent to Pedre’s predicament.

Some people said they still feel slighted by him after he declined to participate in the town’s carnival festivities in 2021.

“He has never engaged in any local activity,” said Pierla Julien, 27. “He’s no longer proud to be from the Northwest. It’s time we give him that same energy.

From a general standpoint, she added, “Violence against women must stop and be punished with the utmost severity. Carel must face justice — no one is above the law.”

A childhood acquaintance of Pedre’s, speaking anonymously for fear of retribution, said Pedre is facing an indefensible position.

“It’s hard for me to stand with Carel, even though we grew up in the same neighborhood,” the friend said. “I can’t support him when he’s done wrong,” said the friend.

Steve Pedre, one of his brothers, wrote on a Facebook post with the #FreeCarel hashtag that support had outnumbered disparaging posts about the influencer.

“From where he is now, he’s getting the messages,” the brother said. “He’ll be back stronger and better.”

Dell, the fashion designer, said she feels sorry that Pedre and his family are going through this experience. From her interactions with him, Dell said she is certain Pedre will do the right thing, whatever that may be, when he is able.

“I’m just waiting for him to say exactly what happened,” she said. “If he did anything wrong, I know he’s the type that would apologize to the woman, to the community, if he really did something wrong. He has a very strong character.”

Saturday, a change.org petition began circulating, asking ICE and Trump to release Pedre that has since received 12,000 signatures. In the petition, the authors said: “We understand that immigration laws are complex and must be upheld; however, detaining individuals like Carel, who are contributing members of their communities, only serves to fortify unjust prejudices and hinder social progress.”

Others writing in social media said such appeals are misplaced and reek of preferential treatment for Pedre because he is prominent, especially considering that some 520,000 Haitian TPS holders are subject to deportation, and no such petition has emerged for them.

Pedre’s immigration case will move forward separately from his criminal matter. Depending on his immigration status, he may request voluntary departure, Julien, the attorney, said. Or, he may move ahead with any adjustment of status application he may have pending, but that has a likelihood of being denied because of the domestic violence case.

As both cases play out, one this is crystal clear for Haitian families in the U.S. The South Florida attorney speaking anonymously said in a place like Miami, where many parents arrived without papers and stayed to build lives while immigration approved their cases, they would’ve all been deported under this administration.

“There’s no due process if you’ve got an immigration case, once ICE gets you,” he said.

Or, to use a Haitian Creole saying about walking the straight and narrow path, as Celestin did: ‘Isit, kounya, se mache sou 13 pou pa pile 14.”",https://haitiantimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/carel-explainer.png,N,,2026-01-06 09:58:39.315568
,Human Rights,2026-01-06 09:41:57+00:00,www.aila.org,Think Immigration: What Are Alternatives to the H-1B Visa?,Not Available,,,,,https://www.aila.org/library/think-immigration-what-are-alternatives-to-the-h-1b-visa,"Cap-exempt H-1B positions at universities and nonprofit research institutions still exist in specific circumstances, but they won’t meet most private-sector needs.
In the near term, two cap-free categories often act as substitutes for roles that would otherwise have defaulted to H-1B: O-1 and L-1.
O-1 Visa for Business, STEM, and Creative Roles The O-1 is a temporary work visa for individuals who have reached the top tier of their field.
L-1 Visa for Executives, Managers, and Specialists The L-1 enables an intracompany transfer from a foreign affiliate to a U.S. entity and is also not capped.
Essential eligibility requires one continuous year of qualifying employment abroad within the last three years, a qualifying corporate relationship, and a bona fide U.S. role that matches the classification.","Employers are facing the prospect of a $100,000 payment for H-1B petitions, and while efforts to halt the fee through litigation are underway, prospects are uncertain at best. This prospective fee has forced many employers to rethink headcount plans, quarterly budgets, campus recruiting timelines, vendor statement(s) of work, , and October onboarding targets. Per guidance shared by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in October, the $100,000 payment generally applies to new H-1B petitions filed for beneficiaries outside the United States, and it generally does not apply to petitions seeking an amendment, change of status, or extension of stay for individuals already in the U.S. in valid status.

Furthermore, whether litigation from government bodies or legal organizations delay or cancel the payment, hiring decisions are happening now, and projects cannot wait for policy to settle. That’s why I’ve been talking with candidates and employers about how to maintain momentum by evaluating cap-independent options that fit the actual work to be done. Cap-exempt H-1B positions at universities and nonprofit research institutions still exist in specific circumstances, but they won’t meet most private-sector needs. In the near term, two cap-free categories often act as substitutes for roles that would otherwise have defaulted to H-1B: O-1 and L-1.

O-1 Visa for Business, STEM, and Creative Roles

The O-1 is a temporary work visa for individuals who have reached the top tier of their field. It covers science, education, business, the arts, and athletics, and it is not subject to the H-1B cap. To qualify, you show either a major, internationally recognized award or a consistent pattern of evidence such as original contributions of major significance, influential publications or patents, invited judging of others’ work, press recognition, selective memberships, high compensation relative to peers, or critical roles at distinguished organizations. You do not need all of these; the key is demonstrating sustained acclaim and impact that independent sources can corroborate.

For candidates in tech and business, the evidence often looks like widely adopted product launches, performance or security gains tied to your work, leadership in standards bodies, or peer-reviewed citations. For creatives, it may be juried awards, festival selections, gallery representation, or wide-reaching media coverage. An O-1 can be filed by a single employer or by a U.S. agent for multi-client work if engagements are cohesive and within the same field. Initial approval is up to three years, with extensions in one-year increments tied to continuing work. While O-1 is not the classic “dual-intent” category, many candidates pair it with future permanent residence planning once the U.S. role and timing are clear. This approach is permissible under 8 CFR 214.2(o), which clarifies that an O‑1 applicant may concurrently have a pending or approved immigrant petition without jeopardizing their nonimmigrant status. If your track record shows supported, independently recognized impact, O-1 can be not just an alternative to H-1B, but a better substantive fit.

L-1 Visa for Executives, Managers, and Specialists

The L-1 enables an intracompany transfer from a foreign affiliate to a U.S. entity and is also not capped. L-1A is for executives and managers and L-1B is for professionals with specialized knowledge of your company’s products, processes, or systems. Essential eligibility requires one continuous year of qualifying employment abroad within the last three years, a qualifying corporate relationship, and a bona fide U.S. role that matches the classification. L-1A status can total up to seven years (in increments), while L-1B up to five years. Spouses (L-2) are employment-authorized incident to status, which can be a practical advantage for families.

For L-1A, the focus is on executive or managerial authority—directing people and budgets, setting policy, and exercising encompassing decision-making latitude. For L-1B, the emphasis is on proprietary, advanced knowledge that is central to delivering a specific U.S. project or product. If you’re launching or expanding a U.S. office, a “new office” L-1 is possible with credible premises, capital, and early hiring milestones. A further benefit: L-1A managers may align with the EB-1C green card category without labor certification. If you already work for a multinational company and your U.S. assignment depends on leadership or specialized know-how, L-1 can be the most direct way to get on the ground.

Strategy, Sequencing, and Staying Practical

Whether an O-1 or L-1 would work for you depends on your facts. If your influence is recognized across your field and can be shown through independent evidence, O-1 keeps you out of the cap and accommodates both single-employer and agent-based engagements. And if your company has a qualifying affiliate abroad and your U.S. role builds on that global structure, L-1 provides a direct bridge with clear maximum-stay rules and, for managers, a streamlined green card track. Some candidates pursue both—timing an L-1 transfer for near-term project needs while developing an O-1 profile for longer-term flexibility, or vice versa.

Whichever route you consider, align the visa with the work you will actually do in the U.S., make sure the U.S. role matches the category’s requirements, and plan your next step early so extensions and permanent residence do not become fire drills. For candidates already in the United States, H-1B change of status remains financially and procedurally viable under the standard fee schedule; where hiring requires consular processing abroad, the $100,000 payment becomes the key budget variable. In either scenario, O-1 and L-1 remain durable, cap-free tools to keep work on track without the lottery.

Under requirements passed by Congress in 2018, the agency then has 90 days to publish a report on the death.
That document, called a “Detainee Death Report,” provides a brief summary of the person’s medical history and the circumstances that the government says led to their death.
In the Imperial Valley, the missed deadline is raising continued questions about the quality of medical care at the detention center.
“We should be having oversight in the detention center,” she said.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has failed to meet a congressionally-mandated deadline to release more details about the in-custody death of a Chinese immigrant held at an Imperial County detention center in late September.

The deadline, established by Congress in a 2018 spending bill, gives the federal immigration agency 90 days to publish a report about what happened when someone dies while in custody.

Huabing Xie died on Sept. 29, according to ICE. In a press release, the agency said Xie had a seizure while being held at the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico and died that afternoon at a nearby hospital.

ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment last week. The agency previously declined to answer KPBS’ questions, citing an ongoing investigation.

The delay in releasing details about Xie’s death comes as the number of immigrants dying in federal detention continues to grow. In October, NPR reported that 2025 had become the deadliest year in decades for immigrants held by the U.S. government.

Since then, deaths appear to have risen sharply. In December alone, seven people died in ICE custody, according to Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies immigration enforcement.

Immigrants’ rights advocates said the delay is keeping crucial information from reaching the public, local officials and members of Congress who could choose to investigate further.

“It is quite disturbing,” said Jesse Franzblau, a policy director at the National Immigrant Justice Center. “Particularly as they are simultaneously expanding the detention system to far larger than we have ever seen before.”

ICE has to meet certain requirements when someone dies in their custody.

The agency is supposed to immediately report the death to several federal watchdogs and let the public know within 48 hours, according to a February 2025 internal policy memo.

Second, ICE is supposed to investigate how the person died. The agency said online it conducts a series of internal medical reviews and oversight investigations, which are eventually sent to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Under requirements passed by Congress in 2018, the agency then has 90 days to publish a report on the death. That document, called a “Detainee Death Report,” provides a brief summary of the person’s medical history and the circumstances that the government says led to their death.

Although those reports are often very limited in scope and detail, Franzblau said they are an important first step towards greater transparency.

“The value is to incentivize increased scrutiny,” he said. “For Congress to then use that to push further and to expose the actual facts behind the death in custody.”

The last time ICE released a report was for Ismael Ayala-Uribe, a former-DACA recipient who was being held at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in San Bernardino County and died just one week before Xie.

In the Imperial Valley, the missed deadline is raising continued questions about the quality of medical care at the detention center.

Weeks after Xie’s death, Management and Training Corporation (MTC) — the private prison company that runs the facility — posted a job online seeking a doctor to provide emergency medical aid and “monitor all potential catastrophic illnesses.”

Marina Arteaga, an organizer with the advocacy group Imperial Liberation Collaborative, said ICE has, since last summer, barred immigrants’ rights advocates from visiting detainees inside the local detention facility.

Arteaga said her organization has been able to communicate with several detainees through family members, but they have not been able to get updates on conditions inside the facility.

“We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted,” the company said. “We are committed to welcoming all guests and operating in accordance with brand standards, applicable laws, and our role as a professional hospitality provider.”

Hilton Hotels and Resorts told NOTUS earlier on Monday that it was investigating an independently owned hotel under its brand in Minnesota after DHS posted the now-viral complaint on social media.

The department, which on Sunday launched a 30-day operational surge in Minneapolis, posted screenshots of emails citing immigration operations as the reason for the canceled reservations at a hotel outside the city.

Just days after a covert mission to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro and strike the capital city, Hegseth announced that Kelly faces retirement grade determination proceedings, a rare administrative action that could see the former astronaut and navy captain demoted in his retired rank. Hegseth accused Kelly of making “seditious statements” that undermined military discipline.

In November, Kelly and five other Democratic lawmakers, all military or intelligence veterans, released a 90-second video speaking directly to service members , calling on troops to uphold the constitution and defy what they characterized as illegal commands

“Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline,” Hegseth said in a statement posted on X, adding that Kelly “is still accountable to military justice” as a retired officer receiving military pay.

The Pentagon declined to comment further beyond the post on social media.

After learning of the censure, Kelly called Hegseth “the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country’s history” and vowed to “fight this with everything I’ve got”.

“Pete Hegseth wants to send the message to every single retired servicemember that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn’t like, they will come after them the same way,” Kelly said in a statement. “It’s outrageous and it is wrong. There is nothing more un-American than that.”

“If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified secretary of defense in our country’s history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn’t get it.

Hegseth’s statement claims Kelly’s conduct between June and December 2025 violated articles 133 and 134 of the uniform code of military justice, which the senator remains subject to as a retired officer drawing pension payments. The defense secretary argues Kelly “characterized lawful military operations as illegal and counseled members of the Armed Forces to refuse lawful orders”.

But the accusation on its face has been contested for months. Military law already requires that troops refuse unlawful orders, which is what Kelly and other members of Congress were echoing. And federal judges have ruled Donald Trump’s military deployments in Los Angeles and other cities violated the Posse Comitatus Act, suggesting the orders Kelly warned about may have actually been illegal.

In the video lawmakers released in November by Kelly and his colleagues – senator Elissa Slotkin and representatives Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan, Slotkin acknowledged that military personnel were “under enormous stress and pressure right now” under the Trump administration’s policies.

Days after the video’s release, Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post.

Kelly has 30 days to respond to the censure, which will be placed in his permanent military personnel file. The Pentagon chief has directed the navy secretary to complete the rank review within 45 days.

The move marks an extraordinary step by the defense department against a sitting US senator and threatened that more action could be coming.

“Captain Kelly’s status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action,” Hegseth wrote.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8fbf2ef78591ddc4d897501fccc144a69b844b/418_0_4164_3333/master/4164.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7443c6a91970ec748e57211779b0f680",N,,2026-01-06 04:58:23.188581

The Trump administration captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife early Saturday.

The operation followed months of airstrikes on suspected drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea from Venezuela and a Trump administration pressure campaign to oust Maduro.

Administration officials say Maduro’s capture was a law enforcement action that merely used military resources and therefore did not require congressional approval, referencing a drug trafficking indictment issued by the Department of Justice in March.

U.S. Rep. Sean Casten, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Chicago’s western and southwestern suburbs, said Monday that some Democrats were briefed before the new year on U.S. strikes on boats but not on any operation to capture Maduro.

“They (administration officials) made it very clear that this was purely to attack boats in international waters — they did not make any mention of actually invading a sovereign nation, much less kidnapping the president and his wife,” Casten said.

The 1980 Intelligence Oversight Act requires the president to brief the “Gang of Eight” — party leaders from both chambers and the top Democrats and Republicans on the intelligence committees — in advance of “any significant anticipated intelligence activity.” Those lawmakers were instead briefed Monday afternoon, though some Republicans were briefed earlier, Casten said.

“We were told that the White House had reached out to some degree to a few Republicans in advance,” Casten said. “The Constitution doesn’t say that you only give your party notification, it says you give Congress notification. So Congress is still very much in the dark on this operation.”

In response to the operation, a group of senators led by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., are pushing a war powers resolution that would bar further military action in Venezuela without congressional approval.

U.S. Rep. Jonathan Jackson, a Democrat whose district includes parts of Chicago’s South Side and south suburbs, said he was concerned about the precedent the attack on Venezuela could set.

“If this is the world of might is right, then that means the larger army of the Russians can go take Ukraine and take land,” Jackson said. “That means Saddam Hussein had the right to go into Iraq and Kuwait and say that was his 19th province. That means China can go into Taiwan. That means the United States can claim the land of the Venezuelan people and say it’s our oil.”

Trump said Saturday that American oil companies would soon enter Venezuela, which holds about a fifth of the world’s oil reserves. He also cited Cuba and Colombia as Western Hemisphere nations that could soon face U.S. military action.

Jackson said sustained U.S. military intervention in Latin America would be an improper use of federal funds.

“Who’s going to pay for this? This is an appropriation that they skirted around. This thing easily cost $1-2 billion,” Jackson said. “He’s going to start this precedent and threaten the government of Cuba, the government of Colombia.”

At an emergency UN Security Council meeting Monday morning, representatives of Russia and China condemned the U.S. attack as a violation of international law and national sovereignty. Casten levied the same criticism.

“It is true that Maduro was indicted in U.S. courts,” Casten said. “That does not give any law enforcement agency the jurisdiction to go into another country. International law is pretty clear. You either need to go to the UN Security Council and get approval. The alternative is if you have an imminent military threat to your country, none of those conditions were present.”

Still, some Republicans say they're concerned about President Trump's comments saying he wants to effectively run Venezuela for the time being.

And some Democrats have made sharp calls for more oversight following the operation.

""I have no love lost for Maduro. Good riddance to him, may he be brought to justice. But the way the president has gone about this has been very chaotic,"" said Rep. Madeleine Dean, (D-PA). ""The administration does not have its story straight. As planned as this was, as much as the military planned for weeks, as [Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine] talked about, and exquisitely brought this about, but they didn't come to Congress.""

Democrats, led by Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, are expected to take a vote at some point this week on limiting war powers for the Trump administration and curtail their ability to conduct a certain military operations without congressional authorization in Venezuela.

It seems unlikely that the vote will succeed. Many Republicans in Congress have made clear that they stand behind the Trump administration and their decision to apparently unilaterally going to Venezuela and extract Maduro.

Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) also demanded that members of his party take a strong stance against Trump's illegal Venezuela attack.","President Donald Trump's invasion of Venezuela is generating fresh calls for his impeachment and removal from office.

Shortly after the US military bombed the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and abducted Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, many experts on international law argued that the president's actions were completely illegal.

In an interview with the New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner, Yale Law School professor Oona Hathaway said that she didn't believe there ""is a legal basis for what we’re seeing in Venezuela,"" while adding that the arguments the Trump administration will likely make simply ""don't hold water.""

For instance, Hathaway noted that while the United Nations charter allows nations to use military force in self-defense against military aggression, the administration's claims that attacking Maduro was a defensive measure intended to stop the flow of illegal drugs into the US was completely outside the scope of traditional self-defense.

""If drug trafficking is a reasonable justification, then a whole range of possible arguments can be made that basically mean that self-defense is no longer a real exception,"" she argued. ""It’s the new rule. Why couldn’t you make the same argument about communicable diseases? There’s bird flu coming from a country, and therefore we have a legal justification for the use of military force. Once we start going down that road, the idea that there’s any limit evaporates.""

Hathaway also said that Trump's militaristic ambitions seem to have grown throughout his second term, and she warned they could lead to a long and bloody US military occupation of Venezuela.

""In his press conference, Trump said that the United States would 'run the country,'"" she said. ""And he made it clear that he was not 'afraid' to put boots on the ground—for years, if necessary... it’s nothing like anything Trump has done before today. His previous illegal uses of force were all over shortly after they began. The scale of the operation that will be required is massive, and it means putting US soldiers at long-term risk.""

Harvard Law School professor Jack Goldsmith wrote a lengthy analysis after the attack on Venezuela and also concluded that it violated the UN charter. What's more, Goldsmith argued that Trump's state plan to seize Venezuela's oil would likely run afoul of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which limits actions that occupying powers can take on the countries they are overseeing.

""There are a lot of international law rules and restrictions that purport to govern what the United States can do as an occupying power,"" he explained. ""I don’t have space here to review them, but suffice it to say that these rules will touch on President Trump’s stated aim of 'tak[ing] back the oil' and 'get[ting] reimbursed.' We will see if the administration takes these rules seriously.""

Many Trump critics also argued that, legality aside, toppling a foreign head of state and vowing to seize their nation's natural resources was morally wrong and deserving of impeachment.

""This is the behavior of a mob boss—but with nuclear weapons and the world's strongest military,"" argued Zeteo editor-in-chief Medhi Hassan. ""None of this is legal. Trump should be impeached by Congress and indicted at The Hague.""

Leah Greenberg, co-founder and co-executive director of Indivisible, denounced Trump's attack on Venezuela as ""wildly illegal, immoral, and irresponsible,"" and urged the US Congress to exercise its powers to stop the president from further escalation.

""The power to declare war belongs to Congress and the American people,"" Greenberg said. ""Trump has once again taken power that's not his. He is attempting to drag the country into war by decree, all while treating the presidency like a throne. Congress must act immediately to stop these illegal strikes and hold the Trump regime accountable. No Kings, No War.""

Cavan Kharrazian, senior policy adviser for Demand Progress, demanded congressional action to ""stop this reckless, unconstitutional act of war.""

""We have seen what happens when the White House invents a pretext to launch a regime change war with an oil-rich nation: disaster and suffering for innocent civilians, our troops and their families, all while costing the American taxpayer a fortune as well,"" said Kharrazian. ""Congress must do the right thing by voting to stop this obvious catastrophe.""

Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic candidate for US Congress in Illinois, wrote on Bluesky that the time for Democratic politicians to issue mealy-mouthed statements about Trump's actions was over.

""Democrats need to grow a fucking spine,"" she wrote. ""No more strongly worded letters. It’s time to draft articles of impeachment. Impeach. Convict. Remove.""

KELLY: One more question for you, Senator Warner, and it has to do with the overarching goal here.","MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:

What is the role of Congress as this whole Venezuela situation unfolds? Senior members of the Trump administration are on Capitol Hill today to brief lawmakers. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia is among those asking questions. He's the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. We have him on the line from Capitol Hill. Senator, Happy New Year. Good to speak with you.

MARK WARNER: Thank you, Mary Louise. Happy New Year to you as well.

KELLY: Chairman of the joint chiefs, the attorney general, the CIA director, defense secretary all briefing Congress today. What do you want to know?

WARNER: Well, first of all, I do want to acknowledge that getting Maduro out of the government of Venezuela - he was a bad guy, and candidly, we should have worked more strongly with the Venezuelan people when they voted overwhelmingly against him in 2024. But that still begs the question of what next? You know, the president says we're going to run Venezuela. For how long? How? If we're going to do it literally with troops on the ground or somehow with simply a fleet threatening offshore? I've got questions about how we got here in terms of the intelligence community's role. I want to get clarification on that. I, of course, won't be able to share that, but I want to get that information.

And then, you know, we have heard this theory before that we're going to come into a country, i.e., Iraq, and they're going to pay for - the Iraqi oil will pay for the whole occupation. And it appears that the president's making the same claim about Venezuelan oil. How is that going to take place? I mean, the Venezuelan oil fields that used to produce 4 million barrels a day, they're now down to 1 million. Everything I've read has said that it would take two to three years to get those back operational back to previous levels. Are we there for that long a time?

KELLY: So you have questions about the budget and who's going to pay for this? Go on.

WARNER: The budget on this. And finally, just, you know, on a broader basis, you know, the enormous precedent this sets if, suddenly, we can go in and snatch a leader if they have violated our law. What would then stop Putin using that same theory of the case to take out Zelenskyy from Kyiv, or what would stop President Xi from taking Taiwan since Chinese law has said that Taiwan is simply a breakaway province?

KELLY: I mean, you're raising a very big-picture question about the global order shifting as we speak. What's the answer to that question? If the U.S. claims the Western Hemisphere, why wouldn't Russia be free to do the same in Europe?

WARNER: That's why I'm going to ask the question. If you follow the logic, there would not be any preclusion. And let's - I think, you know, for the last 70-plus years - basically, since the 60s - I think America - it didn't matter whether it was a Democratic or Republican administration - has tried to build a new kind of arrangement with Central America and South America where we looked at those countries as partners. I've always been interested - I was an exchange student in Argentina. I'm fascinated with the region. I think we've treated them, frankly, badly, year in and year out. Benign neglect. But the notion that we're kind of reintroducing a colonial/imperial sphere of influence towards everything in the Western Hemisphere, that seems to go against everything over the last 70 years in terms of American foreign policy.

KELLY: I want to ask about the lack of congressional authorization for this Venezuela attack. Now, Secretary of State Rubio maintains this was not, in fact, an attack. This was a law enforcement operation, and therefore no congressional authorization was needed. Do you buy that?

WARNER: No, I don't. You know, I worked well with Secretary Rubio. We were good partners when he was on the Intel Committee. And he did - let me be clear - he did try to reach me after the strike had started. We didn't connect, but he did try to reach me. But the idea that somehow this was a law enforcement action, it doesn't pass the smell test. We had a whole fleet off the coast of Venezuela. When you send in the Delta Force, our top military operatives, into a nation-state to extract their leader, that is not a law enforcement action. And I don't know how we can credibly make that case.

KELLY: And when President Trump is threatening that there will be additional action if Venezuela doesn't cooperate going forward, you would argue congressional authorization will be needed for that?

WARNER: I would say, of course, there needs to be. And Senator Kaine will have a war powers resolution on Venezuela up this...

KELLY: This is your colleague, Senator Tim Kaine.

WARNER: Yes.

KELLY: Yep.

WARNER: I will vote for that. I'm sure most of the - all of the Democrats will vote for it. And the question I have, you know, in terms of congressional oversight, it only works if it's truly bipartisan. And I had so many of my Republican colleagues, particularly in the last few weeks after the elections in Virginia, New Jersey and New York City, start to say, well, you know, they maybe willing to speak up more. It'll be very curious to see whether my Republican friends are going to simply continue to write a blank check to this president to take this kind of really significant action without any approval or even prewarning to Congress.

KELLY: Stay with that. Senator Kaine, who you mentioned, has tried to get this war powers resolution passed in past. He's not been able to do so 'cause he doesn't have Republican votes. You would need four. Do you see any sign that your Republican colleagues are likely to line up in blocking the president when they have not done so very often at all in the last year?

WARNER: It is - it's a new year, and hope springs eternal. But if I'm laying a wager, I'm not sure. But it's - the question is, what kind of action is going to finally spur them into activity?

KELLY: One more question for you, Senator Warner, and it has to do with the overarching goal here. We were told - Americans were told - for months that the U.S. military buildup off the coast of Venezuela was about drugs, that this was about protecting Americans by fighting drug trafficking. President Trump didn't mention drugs very often in his address from Mar-a-Lago over the weekend. He now seems to be focused on oil. Is it clear to you from your perch in the U.S. Senate what the U.S. endgame is?

WARNER: It is not clear to me. And matter of fact, if you look at the indictment of Maduro, out of the Southern District of New York, it doesn't even mention fentanyl at all, which is, again, the drug that is doing the most damage in our country. I think, unfortunately, this is about oil. I think this was ill-advised. I don't think there was a real plan. I do think our military executed brilliantly, and Maduro off the stage is good. But, you know, if we really want a collaborative relationship with Venezuela - which we had for many, many decades - we also ought to be interested in the welfare of the Venezuelan people. And this does not bode well for us. It doesn't bode well for the Venezuelans. It doesn't bode well for regional stability.

KELLY: Virginia Democrat Mark Warner. Senator, thank you.

WARNER: Thank you.

In its post, the agency appeared to reference the Biblical story of Mary and Joseph being denied “room at the inn” ahead of the birth of Jesus and shared a pair of redacted screenshots regarding the alleged cancellations in Minnesota.

“After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and will be cancelling your upcoming reservation,” reads one of the messages, dated January 2, which features an “@hilton” email address and a reference to the Everpeak Hospitality group.

“We are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property,” another message, purportedly from the leadership of the Hampton Inn Lakeville, reads.

It is unclear which or how many properties were involved in the alleged cancellations.

DHS did not provide evidence to The Independent when asked how it knew agents were victims of a “coordinated campaign.”

""This hotel is independently owned and operated, and these actions were not reflective of Hilton values,” Hilton told The Independent in an email statement. “We have been in direct contact with the hotel, and they have apologized for the actions of their team, which was not in keeping with their policies.

The president regularly denigrates the large Somali-American community in the city and the administration has responded to viral, disputed allegations of mass fraud at Somali-run day care centers to freeze childcare funding to Minnesota and the rest of the country.

Please let us know if you have feedback.

Dive Brief:

President Donald Trump did not exceed his authority when he issued a Sept. 19 proclamation requiring employers to pay an additional $100,000 before new H-1B visas can be processed, a federal district court judge held Dec. 23 in Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

President Trump legitimately exercised his broad discretion authorized by the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict the entry of noncitizens into the U.S., the judge found. Trump found the proclamation was necessary to counter abuse of the H-1B program, which the proclamation asserts is harming American workers and creating a national security threat, he said.

The ruling does not discount the contributions H-1B workers are making to the American economy, the judge stressed. But the parties’ debate over how the proclamation will affect employers and the economy is not within the court’s province to decide, so long as it is within the confines of the law, she said.

Dive Insight:

Following the ruling, the Chamber posted a statement by Executive Vice President and Chief Counsel Daryl Joseffer that said, “The $100,000 fee makes H-1B visas cost prohibitive for businesses, especially small- and medium-sized businesses that can least afford it. We are disappointed in the court’s decision and are considering further legal options to ensure that the H-1B visa program can operate as Congress intended: to enable American businesses of all sizes to access the global talent they need to grow their operations.”

The Chamber filed a notice of appeal on Dec. 29.

The Chamber, a business federation with approximately 300,000 members, and the Association of American Universities, an organization representing U.S.-based research universities, sued the Trump Administration in October. It was the first of at least three lawsuits by different groups challenging the proclamation, including California v. Noem, filed mid-December by 20 state attorney generals from mainly Democratic states.

The litigation focuses on two issues — that President Trump exceeded his delegated authority, or acted “ultra vires,” under the INA and that DHS and the State Department “arbitrarily” implemented the proclamation without following proper notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act.

The judge ruled against the Chamber and AAU on both claims.

That uptick in law enforcement activity has prompted protests, confrontations and widespread fear among immigrant communities — particularly within Minnesota's large Somali-American population.
The governor and other state leaders have warned that the move, along with a heightened federal law enforcement presence, risks harming legitimate businesses and families who rely on public assistance programs.","The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal in Minnesota, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.

The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations, the agency's investigative arm tasked with fighting transnational crimes, the officials said. They requested anonymity to discuss operations that have not been publicly announced.

The plan is for the agents and officers to oversee a 30-day surge in operations in the Twin Cities area, making the region the first major target of the Trump administration's expanded immigration crackdown in the new year, officials said. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to probe alleged cases of fraud, building on last month's inspection of dozens of sites in the Minneapolis area.

Officials said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, who has overseen controversial immigration roundups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans, is expected to arrive in Minnesota to help lead immigration enforcement efforts, along with an unknown number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel.

The deployment, which began Sunday, represents one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years. The move greatly expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota at a time of heightened political and community tension there.

According to senior law enforcement officials, the surge includes several hundred additional agents from Homeland Security Investigations, as well as hundreds of officers from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations. Tactical units known as Special Response Teams are also slated to be part of the operation, along with a layered command structure of dozens of high-ranking supervisors.

One former law enforcement official described the scale as extraordinary, noting that the number of HSI agents being sent to Minneapolis is roughly equivalent to the entire HSI workforce assigned to the state of Arizona. ""This is a massive resource allocation,"" the official said, adding that Minneapolis is effectively becoming ""the new Chicago,"" referencing past large-scale federal enforcement deployments in Illinois.

Multiple officials told CBS News the total federal presence could ultimately become even larger, with as many as 600 HSI agents and up to 1,500 ICE ERO officers rotating through the Minneapolis area over the course of the month-long deployment.

CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.

Late last year, ICE launched an immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, targeting immigrants who had been issued deportation orders, including those from Somalia. As of Dec. 19, ICE had carried out nearly 700 arrests as part of the operation, according to DHS.

The new surge comes amid intense state and federal scrutiny of Minnesota following years of high-profile fraud cases involving federally funded programs. They have included some of the largest pandemic-era and post-pandemic fraud schemes in the country, like the Feeding Our Future case, which led to dozens of indictments and convictions.

Federal prosecutors have charged more than 90 people in Minnesota-based fraud cases since 2021, with more than 60 convictions so far, according to court records. Investigators have revealed the alleged schemes span multiple federal programs, including nutrition, housing stabilization and child care assistance, with potential losses estimated in the billions of dollars.

In recent weeks, federal activity across the Minneapolis area has increased, with HSI agents canvassing businesses and ICE officers conducting arrests in and around immigrant-populated neighborhoods. That uptick in law enforcement activity has prompted protests, confrontations and widespread fear among immigrant communities — particularly within Minnesota's large Somali-American population.

President Trump has regularly cited Somalia — often in incendiary terms — to justify his mass deportation campaign. Last month, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia ""garbage"" and said they ""contribute nothing.""

""I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,"" the president said. ""Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.""

At the same time, Minnesota officials led by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz have pushed back on claims that the state failed to act, pointing to audits, third-party reviews, the appointment of a program-integrity director and the creation of a statewide fraud-prevention council.

But Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection to a third term as criticism has boiled over.

Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News that the governor met with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday, as the fellow Democrat considers whether or not to enter the race.

The Department of Health and Human Services has frozen $185 million in federal child care payments to Minnesota, citing ongoing fraud concerns.

Screenshots DHS shared on social media appear to show the hotel operators rejecting the reservations made by enforcement agents at the Hampton Inn in Lakeville, Minnesota – about 25 miles from Minneapolis – because of their affiliation with Immigration Customs and Enforcement. DHS said the agents had booked rooms using official government emails and rates.

“We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property,” a screenshot reads, though email addresses and names were redacted. “If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation.”

“Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property,” the screenshot also reads.

“This is UNACCEPTABLE,” DHS said in its social media post.

The Trump administration says it’s combating suspected fraud involving taxpayer dollars in Democratic-led Minnesota. The Biden administration also investigated fraud there, including theft from Medicaid programs, leading to dozens of arrests and convictions.

Federal prosecutors have charged more than 80 people with being involved in the scheme since 2022, the majority of them U.S. citizens of Somali descent. At least 60 suspects have been convicted.

Minnesota is home to the largest population of people with Somali ancestry, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The population is estimated between 60,000 and 80,000 people.

In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has seized on the scandal, calling out Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who ran against him as the 2024 Democratic vice presidential candidate. The president has also called out the Somali community in the state, at one point calling them ""garbage,"" in comments local officials criticized as racist and un-American.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in late December the administration is exploring the denaturalization of those Somali-Americans in Minnesota responsible for the fraud, a move that would seek to strip U.S. citizenship from those who illegally obtained tax dollars intended for social services.

They also can’t hand over Medicaid data about U.S. citizens or legal immigrants in the 22 plaintiff states, he wrote.
HHS first shared the personal data on millions of Medicaid enrollees in a handful of states in June.
Immigration advocates have said the disclosure of personal data could cause alarm among people seeking emergency medical help for themselves or their children.","NEW YORK (AP) — The nation’s health department starting Monday can resume sharing the personal data of certain Medicaid enrollees with deportation officials, according to a federal judge’s ruling, in a blow to states that had sued the administration over privacy concerns.

But the judge’s decision, issued last Monday, strictly limits the scope of data from the 22 plaintiff states that can be shared — for now only allowing the agency to hand over basic biographical information about immigrants residing in the United States illegally. The states’ lawsuit came after an Associated Press report identified the data sharing policy.

The ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco comes after the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it planned to share the data again as part of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Chhabria in August had initially blocked the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from sharing the personal data, which includes home addresses, with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. In December, he extended that temporary order.

Then, last week, Chhabria ruled that after the temporary order expires on Jan. 5, HHS can resume sharing “basic biographical, location and contact information” about immigrants living in the U.S. illegally with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. He wrote in a court filing that this sharing “is clearly authorized by law and the agencies have adequately explained their decisions.”

While the lawsuit plays out, HHS and CMS aren’t allowed to give detailed, sensitive medical information about enrollees to the Department of Homeland Security or ICE, Chhabria wrote. They also can’t hand over Medicaid data about U.S. citizens or legal immigrants in the 22 plaintiff states, he wrote.

In explaining why he blocked the broader data sharing, Chhabria wrote that the new federal policies “are totally unclear about what that information would be, why it would be needed for immigration enforcement purposes, and what the risks of sharing it with DHS would be.”

It wasn’t clear Monday whether HHS had resumed sharing data on Medicaid recipients living in the U.S. illegally, and a spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Immigrants illegally living in the U.S., as well as some who are lawfully present, are not allowed to enroll in the Medicaid program that offers nearly free coverage for health services. But federal law requires all states to offer emergency Medicaid, a temporary coverage that pays only for lifesaving services in emergency rooms to anyone, including non-U.S. citizens. Medicaid is a jointly funded program between states and the federal government.

HHS first shared the personal data on millions of Medicaid enrollees in a handful of states in June.

In July, CMS entered into a new agreement that gave DHS daily access to view the personal data — including Social Security numbers and home address — of all the nation’s 77 million Medicaid enrollees. Neither agreement was announced publicly.

The extraordinary disclosure of such personal health data to deportation officials in the Trump administration’s far-reaching immigration crackdown immediately prompted the lawsuit over privacy concerns.

Immigration advocates have said the disclosure of personal data could cause alarm among people seeking emergency medical help for themselves or their children. Other efforts to crack down on illegal immigration have made schools, churches, courthouses and other everyday places feel perilous to immigrants and even U.S. citizens who fear getting caught up in a raid.

CMS in November said its intention to provide the data to ICE is “consistent with federal laws” and intended “to advance administration priorities related to immigration.”

The data sharing comes as the Trump administration has implemented an unprecedented immigration crackdown that has looped in agencies across the federal government and which has included sending the military and immigration agents into multiple Democratic-run cities.

The administration has also made other efforts to share data with immigration officials. In May, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants’ tax data with ICE to help agents locate and detain people living in the U.S. illegally.

“This is unacceptable,” the post reads, going on to say that the hotel was helping to “undermine and impede D.H.S. law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws.”

In early December, President Trump railed against Somali immigrants, calling them “garbage” and saying they should return to where they came from. Minnesota is home to a large Somali community.

Hilton, a global hospitality company, encompasses more than 25 hotel brands, including Hampton Inn. As is the case with many branded hotels, the Hampton Inn in Lakeville is independently owned and operated, a Hilton spokesperson said via email, adding that the actions described by Homeland Security were not “reflective of Hilton values.” The company is investigating the incident, the spokesperson added.

“We do not discriminate against any individuals or agencies and apologize to those impacted,” the statement reads.

Immigrant-rights activists in Minnesota have responded to the increased presence of immigration agents with deliberate efforts to make them feel unwelcome, including protesting late at night outside hotels where they suspect agents are staying.

Immigration lawyers Pooja Sundar and Stewart Dalley say Immigration New Zealand often gives offshore applicants vague or no reasons for why their temporary visas, such as visitor or family visas, are declined.

Unlike applicants already in New Zealand, offshore applicants generally cannot appeal decisions or respond to concerns before a decision is finalised.

“Where the officer knows in the back of the mind that nobody can review this decision, that’s not subject to an appeal, there’s no reconsideration, then where’s the incentive to make a proper decision?” Dalley said.

Sundar said the system disproportionately affects families seeking short-term visits for events or holidays, even when applicants provide evidence they will return home. She said offshore applicants often face a cycle of reapplying and paying fees again, with little clarity about what went wrong the first time.

“And in that position, the option is to reapply or to make a complaint. But the complaints process isn’t really going to go anywhere,” she said. “A credible system requires transparency, clear reasoning, and a genuine path to challenge flawed decisions.”

Dalley noted immigration decisions are excluded from investigation by the Human Rights Commission. Judicial review in the High Court is often the only option, but it comes at a high cost.

Immigration New Zealand maintains complaints numbers are now at their lowest since a revised feedback system was introduced in 2017.

What we know:

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) took to social media to blast Hilton Hotels for allegedly refusing service to federal agents.

""When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously cancelled their reservations,"" DHS' social media post read.

In the post, DHS shared apparent screenshots showing an email thread coming from a ""@hilton.com"" address. In the screenshot, the hotel group allegedly said in an email that Hilton has ""found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be canceling your upcoming reservation.""

The other side:

FOX News' Bill Melugin and FOX 11's sister station KMSP-TV in Minneapolis both obtained the following statement below from Hilton in response to DHS' allegations against the hotel group:

""Hilton hotels serve as welcoming places for all. This hotel is independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values. We are investigating this matter with this individual hotel, and can confirm that Hilton works with governments, law enforcement, and community leaders around the world to ensure our properties are open and inviting to everyone.""

Local perspective:

Last summer in Southern California, a small group of protesters were seen blasting music and staging loud demonstrations outside hotels housing ICE agents.

The demonstrations happened as the Trump administration deployed DHS law enforcement for months, and the National Guard for weeks, as part of Trump's push for mass deportations in politically blue U.S. cities.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.
“This is just another example of absolute lawlessness on the part of this administration.” Administration officials were planning later in the week to provide separate briefings on the raid for all members of the House and Senate.","Top Trump administration officials on Monday afternoon were providing the first classified briefing for congressional leaders on the military raid in Venezuela that captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife over the weekend, carried out without informing or consulting with Congress.

The briefing was for a select group known as the Gang of Eight — the House and Senate leaders from both parties, along with the chairmen and ranking members of each chamber’s intelligence committees — which is generally alerted to major military operations before, during or immediately after they occur. In this case, the Trump administration left the lawmakers in the dark, a decision that President Trump has said was made out of concern that they would leak details of the operation before it was carried out.

Those lawmakers were joined at the session by the Republican chairmen and senior Democrats on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were providing the briefing, along with John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, and Attorney General Pam Bondi.

Several lawmakers questioned why senior leaders on Capitol Hill had not been notified in advance about the raid, which captured Mr. Maduro and his wife to face drug trafficking charges in the United States.

By law, the Gang of Eight is supposed to be kept apprised of covert operations, although the Trump administration has not always done so.

“President Trump waged war on a foreign nation without authorization, without notification and without any explanation to the American people,” Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement following the operation.

Mr. Rubio spoke with a number of Republican senators in the hours following the raid. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, an Intelligence Committee member who was among them, later said in a statement that “Congress should have been informed about the operation earlier and needs to be involved as this situation evolves.”

Mr. Rubio has rejected the argument that Congress needed to be consulted about the raid, maintaining in a series of interviews over the weekend that it did not require congressional approval because it was a law enforcement operation rather than a military invasion.

That explanation prompted the top senators in both parties who are charged with overseeing law enforcement matters to complain on Monday that they were not included in the classified briefing about Mr. Maduro’s capture. In a rare joint statement, Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and Dick Durbin of Illinois, the ranking Democrat, said there was “no legitimate basis” for excluding them from the session.

“The administration’s refusal to acknowledge our committee’s indisputable jurisdiction in this matter is unacceptable and we are following up to ensure the committee receives warranted information regarding Maduro’s arrest,” they wrote.

During a news conference hours after the operation was carried out, Mr. Trump said he had circumvented Congress because he did not trust senior lawmakers to keep his plans confidential.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.

Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the president was legally required to brief lawmakers.

“Whether you think Congress leaks or not, the law says you must brief Congress,” he said during an interview on CNN on Sunday. “This is just another example of absolute lawlessness on the part of this administration.”

Administration officials were planning later in the week to provide separate briefings on the raid for all members of the House and Senate.

District Court Opinion on H-1B Fee

A federal district court judge has issued an opinion upholding the legality of the $100,000 fee applied to certain H‑1B petitions, allowing the requirement to remain in effect as litigation continues. The decision rejects arguments that the administration exceeded its authority when implementing the fee through presidential proclamation.

This ruling follows two major policy actions shaping the current H‑1B landscape.

Second, the business community’s challenge to the fee structure, detailed in U.S. Chamber Lawsuit Challenges $100,000 H-1 B Fee, remains ongoing, indicating that additional court activity is still ahead.

What This Means for Employers

The ruling reinforces the government’s broad discretion to regulate the entry of foreign nationals, including through significant fee increases. As a result, employers should continue to plan for the substantial financial and operational impact this fee may have on FY 2027 H-1 B strategies and workforce planning.

Both developments remain subject to ongoing and potential litigation. In addition to those updates, the immediate impact of a September 2025 presidential proclamation requiring employers to pay a fee for filing an H-1B visa petition is narrower than some have assumed.

DC District Court Upholds Presidential Authority Under INA § 212(f)

In a recent decision in Chamber of Commerce v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia upheld a presidential proclamation imposing a $100,000 fee on certain H-1B visa applicants, relying on the president’s broad authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) § 212(f) to condition the entry of nonimmigrants when deemed to be in the national interest.

Although the case was resolved on cross-motions for summary judgment, the court did not approach the matter as a conventional, fact-intensive Administrative Procedure Act challenge.

Instead, the court framed the dispute as one involving presidential authority and applied a deferential standard of review drawn from Trump v. Hawaii. Under this framework, the court expressly declined to weigh competing economic evidence regarding the H-1B program. The court accepted assertions in the proclamation concerning U.S. worker displacement and labor-market effects at face value and did not evaluate or resolve plaintiffs’ contrary evidence and policy arguments.

The court’s analysis focused on whether Congress, through INA § 212(f), delegated sufficiently broad authority to the president to impose conditions on entry. The court did not assess whether the proclamation accurately described the statutory structure or historical purpose of the H-1B program itself. Once it concluded that such authority existed, the court required only a rational connection between the proclamation’s stated objectives and a legitimate governmental interest.

Limitations on the Proclamation’s Scope

While the court’s decision has generated attention from stakeholders, the current proclamation applies in a limited set of circumstances. President Donald Trump’s administration issued the proclamation on Sept. 19, 2025, and it became effective on Sept. 21, 2025. It applies only to H-1B visa applicants seeking entry from outside the United States and only to cases filed on or after Sept. 21, 2025. It does not apply to change-of-status filings within the United States, H-1B extensions, amendments, or transfers for individuals already in H-1B status, or cap-exempt H-1B petitions. As a result, some employers and H-1B workers will not be directly affected.

Litigation Remains Ongoing

The D.C. court decision may not be the final word on the $100,000 fee. Two additional federal lawsuits challenging the fee remain pending in other jurisdictions, and the Chamber of Commerce has decided to appeal the D.C. court’s decision. These proceedings may result in further clarification—or potential limitation—of executive authority in this area. Accordingly, the legal framework governing the fee remains unsettled, and future court rulings may impact its implementation or scope.

DHS Finalizes Wage-Based Weighted Selection Rule for H-1B Cap Registrations

Separately, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has finalized a wage-based weighted selection system for H-1B cap-subject registrations, effective beginning with the FY 2027 registration season. This rule replaces the long-standing random lottery with a system that increases selection odds for higher-wage positions. Under the final rule, registrations tied to Level IV wages will be entered into the selection pool four times, Level III wages three times, Level II wages twice, and Level I wages once.

At the registration stage, employers must disclose the SOC code, area of intended employment, and the highest Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics (OEWS) wage level met or exceeded by the offered wage. For positions involving multiple worksites, the lowest applicable wage level must be used. Wage levels are locked in at the time of registration and must match the subsequently filed petition.

DHS Response to Public Comments

Despite receiving 2,731 public comments, DHS finalized its rule without modifying the regulatory text. The agency rejected requests for exemptions or alternative selection methodologies, emphasizing administrative feasibility, statutory discretion, and policy objectives. DHS concluded that entry-level positions would retain meaningful—though reduced—selection chances; that carve-outs for small businesses, specific industries, or U.S. degree holders would undermine the rule’s goals; and that OEWS wage levels already account for geographic and occupational variation. DHS also emphasized that cap-exempt programs continue to address health care and rural workforce needs.

Projected Selection Outcomes

DHS estimates that under the weighted system, Level I registrations will have an approximate 15.29% chance of selection, compared to 30.58% for Level II, 45.87% for Level III, and 61.16% for Level IV. By comparison, the historical random lottery produced an average selection rate of approximately 29.59% across all wage levels.

Potential for Litigation Challenging the Weighted Selection Rule

Although finalized, the wage-weighted selection rule may also face judicial challenges. Potential claims may include arguments that the INA requires random selection among properly filed petitions, that DHS exceeded its statutory authority, or that the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act. Any resulting litigation may delay the implementation of DHS’s rule, result in injunctions, or require further agency action.

Practical Takeaways for Employers

Employers may need to avoid over-generalizing the reach of the proclamation, which applies only to certain consular-processed H-1B cases filed on or after Sept. 21, 2025. At the same time, employers should consider planning for continued uncertainty, as both the $100,000 fee and the wage-weighted lottery remain subject to ongoing and potential future litigation. Wage strategy and registration accuracy will be critical if the weighted system proceeds as scheduled, and employers may wish to explore alternative visa options and cap-exempt pathways as part of their FY 2027 workforce planning.

The nickname followed the informal name of the state's first detention center, ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" opened a few months earlier.
However, detainees at Florida's Deportation Depot and Alligator Alcatraz may not show up, as they are state-run facilities, according to an ICE spokesperson.","Florida has detained about 20,000 people and transferred them to federal immigration facilities.

The state has opened two of its own detention centers, nicknamed ""Deportation Depot"" and ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

Critics have raised concerns about conditions and due process, which officials have denied.

Florida detained about 20,000 people and transferred them to a federal immigration facility since state and law enforcement agencies in the state partnered with federal immigration enforcement, Gov. Ron DeSantis and other state officials said at a press conference in Sanderson Monday, Jan. 5.

Over 10,000 people were detained in Florida in Operation Tidal Wave, a state-run initiative led by law enforcement agencies coordinating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the rest were arrested by local law enforcement, DeSantis said, adding that 63% of those detained had previous arrests or convictions.

As of Nov. 30, 73.6% held in ICE detention have no criminal conviction, according to available data. Many of those convicted committed only minor offenses, including traffic violations.

The press conference was at Deportation Depot, one of Florida's two state-run immigration detention facilities. The other, nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" is on the edge of the Everglades in South Florida.

Critics have claimed that such detention centers are unsanitary and cruel, that ICE officials have swept up immigrants without criminal records and U.S. citizens in their arrests, and that detainees have been denied their civil rights and due process before being deported. Florida officials and the Department of Homeland Security have denied these claims.

Here's what to know about Florida's detention facilities.

What is Florida's Deportation Depot?

In September 2025, Florida opened ""Deportation Depot"" at the former Baker County Correctional Facility, which was closed due to staffing shortages. The nickname followed the informal name of the state's first detention center, ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" opened a few months earlier.

The center can hold more than 1,300 people, DeSantis said in his initial announcement, but in September an ICE spokesperson in an email to USA TODAY NETWORK said DHS was ""working with the state of Florida to expand ICE detention space by up to 2,000 beds.""

Other similarly named detention facilities that have sprung up in the past few months include the ""Speedway Slammer"" in Miami County, Indiana, the ""Cornhusker Clink"" at the Work Ethic Camp in McCook, Nebraska; and the ""Louisiana Lockup"" at the Louisiana State Penitentiary known as Angola Prison.

DeSantis at a press conference Sept. 2 announced a third planned detention center, to be called the ""Panhandle Pokey,"" somewhere in the western Panhandle but no location or timeframe was mentioned

Where is Deportation Depot?

The former Baker County Correctional Facility is at 20706 U.S. Highway 90 West in Sanderson, about 15 minutes away from the Lake City Airport.

What is Florida's Alligator Alcatraz?

Alligator Alcatraz used to be the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport, a 39-square-mile airport facility with a 10,500-foot runway. In June, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier posted a video on X with a pounding rock beat and a proposal for a temporary immigrant detention center in the Everglades with the promise that migrants arrested by ICE or local law enforcement had ""nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.""

The site was seized by the state, rushed into development and opened in under two weeks, with a planned capacity of 5,000 beds. Merch was offered, President Donald Trump came for a site visit and the site rapidly filled up. It also faced lawsuits and constant protests.

Less than two months after it opened, the Department of Homeland Security started moving people out of the center after a federal judge ordered a stop to new construction and blocked the transfer of any new detainees a preliminary injunction during a lawsuit filed by environmental groups and joined by the Miccosukee Tribe.

The site reopened in September after an appeals court allowed operations to continue until the judicial panel issues a final ruling on the matter.

""The mission continues on immigration enforcement,"" DeSantis said in a videotaped statement on social media. ""Alligator Alcatraz is in fact, like we've always said, open for business.""

Where is Florida's Alligator Alcatraz?

The Alligator Alcatraz facility is in Ochopee, Florida, just north of Everglades National Park, about six miles from Big Cypress National Preserve, about 48 miles east of Naples, 45 miles west of Miami International Airport, and 40 air miles southwest of Boca Raton.

The facility was constructed in 1968 and originally known as the Everglades Jetport or Big Cypress Swamp Jetport, according to the National Park Service. It was intended to be the largest airport in the world, with six runways and a 1,000-foot-wide corridor linking it to both coasts. Most recently it was used as a pilot training facility.

How long do people stay in ICE detention centers?

Detention can run from a few days to more than a year, depending on the immigrant's situation and several other variables.

Immigrants who agree to return to their home country may only stay locked up a few days, experts said. Immigrants who have claimed asylum or have pending court cases may be in for months as cases work through the system. People who receive final orders of removal may be detained for up to 180 days while ICE arranges their deportation but that may go longer if complications come in, such as if the home country won't accept them.

Different organizations have offered different ""average"" stays. In 2019, the American Immigration Council said an average stay was 55 days while people defending themselves in court were regularly held longer than six months. A study in 2012 by TRAC Reports suggested that the group with the largest percentage of detainment over six months were people who were entitled to be in the U.S. and had been detained by mistake.

Is ICE detention the same as jail?

Jails are generally used to detain people awaiting trial or sentencing, and those facing shorter sentences. They are operated by local law enforcement such as sheriff's departments or corrections departments. Once the case is resolved or the sentence is complete, the inmates are released.

Immigration detention centers are facilities where people believed to be in the country illegally are kept until they can either be returned to their home country or another country that agrees to take them, or they prove their status as legal citizens.

There have been multiple reports of ICE rapidly moving detainees to facilities far from where they were captured, drawing accusations of intentionally moving them away from families and attorneys and making locating them more difficult. A report from Amnesty International claimed that detainees are being mistreated at Alligator Alcatraz and at Krome North Processing Center, a federally-run immigration detention and processing center in Miami, with some subject to what they called ""torture.""

State officials have denied these claims.

Can you have your phone in ICE detention?

When a person is detained by ICE, they will go through processing, fingerprints and photographs will be taken, and personal belongings will likely be confiscated

U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service detention standards require detainees to have ""reasonable and equitable access"" to telephones during facility waking hours, with at least one telephone for every 25 detainees held. Detainees will be allowed to make collect calls, or direct calls for:

Local immigration courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals

Federal and State courts where the detainee is or may become involved in a legal proceeding

Consular officials

Legal service providers, in pursuit of legal representation or to engage in consultation concerning the detainee's expedited removal case

A government office, to obtain documents relevant to his/her immigration case

A personal or family emergency, or when the detainee can otherwise demonstrate a compelling need

How do I find if someone has been detained by ICE?

You can use ICE’s online detainee locator at locator.ice.gov/odls/#/search to find people using their date of birth and country of origin, or their nine-digit A-Num.

However, detainees at Florida's Deportation Depot and Alligator Alcatraz may not show up, as they are state-run facilities, according to an ICE spokesperson.

What can I do if I fear an ICE raid?

The National Immigration Resource Center recommends:

Gather important documents for all family members showing how long each one has been in the United States. This can include birth certificates, U.S. income tax returns, utility bills, leases, school records, medical records or bank records. Put copies into a secure online folder or location you can access by phone.

Identify your emergency contacts, memorize their phone numbers and make sure your contact can access all of your documents.

Provide your child’s school or daycare with an emergency contact to pick up your child in case you are detained.

You, your family or emergency contacts can contact the local ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) office to initiate an ICE Case Review process. You can find your local ERO office here. Have supporting documents ready.

Maduro pleaded not guilty to federal drug-trafficking charges in the first hearing of what will likely be a lengthy legal battle, POLITICO’s Erica Orden reports from New York. “I’m innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man, the president of my country,” Maduro told the judge. “I am a kidnapped president, prisoner of war,” he added later.

Must read: “92-year-old judge handling Maduro case ‘doesn’t give a s--t what anyone thinks about him’” by POLITICO’s Josh Gerstein and Erica: Maduro’s case has come before U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a Clinton appointee and 92-year-old judge “with a stubborn streak and an often unorthodox approach to running his courtroom.”

THE CATCH-UP

BACK TO THE HILL: Congress is officially back. And lawmakers are returning to the Hill to a firestorm of different conflicts to manage, both new and old headaches coming together as the 2026 legislative calendar kicks off.

This week alone, both sides of Congress will confront the sudden intervention in Venezuela, a roundtable on the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and hearing on misuse of federal funds in Minnesota, a vote in the House on the expired Affordable Care Act tax credits — and, of course, the small matter of funding the government for the next fiscal year. Buckle in.

Kicking things off: After a bruising clash last year, funding the government for the remainder of this fiscal year could prove to be the least contentious issue, if today offers any indication. In a bicameral breakthrough, top appropriators this morning released the text of the three-bill funding package to pass ahead of the Jan. 30 shutdown deadline, POLITICO’s Jennifer Scholtes and Meredith Lee Hill report. As GOP leaders start to whip votes, they’re planning to put the package to a vote in the House on Thursday.

The compromise comes after more than a month of negotiations, with the deal including funding for the Energy, Commerce, Interior and Justice departments, as well as water programs, the EPA and federal science initiatives until Sept. 30. Speaker Mike Johnson, while decrying the prospects of an “omnibus” package, touted the minibus as spending less than past funding bills. And the deal received ringing endorsements in statements from both top Democratic appropriators — Rep. Rosa DeLauro and Sen. Patty Murray.

But there are still some funding hurdles ahead: Congress has six other spending bills to move forward before the deadline — which include some of the biggest budgets covering the departments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Labor and Education.

The thorny health care debate that drew outsized attention before the break will come up again this week. The discharge petition for a potential three-year extension of the expired Affordable Care Act subsidies could get a procedural vote on Wednesday, with a final vote on passage in the House on Thursday, Meredith reports. But even if it passes the House, it’s likely doomed in the Senate.

Looming over all of this is Venezuela, which will likely dominate much of the discussion on the Hill this week. Top congressional leaders and senior House and Senate members from Intelligence, Armed Services, Foreign Affairs and Foreign Relations committees will be briefed today by top administration officials at 5:30 p.m. Despite general support for the president’s move, internally some Republicans are feeling misled by the administration on the endgame in Venezuela, especially amid mixed messaging over who is actually running Venezuela, POLITICO’s Calen Razor writes.

As lawmakers shuffle back to D.C., they’re returning to crunch time ahead of the midterms. Republicans’ razor-thin majority — which is only getting narrower — will be under ever more scrutiny. But as GOP members start to reflect on the current political temperature, some are questioning a change in leadership if they hold onto power, MS NOW’s Mychael Schnell reports. “Expect the silent majority in the GOP conference to push for entirely new faces, and an entirely new approach, in the next Congress,” one lawmaker told MS NOW. And some GOP lawmakers want 2026 to be about reclaiming Congress’ authority, per NOTUS’ Riley Rogerson.

COME IN, CAP. KELLY: Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced this morning that the Pentagon is taking steps to demote Sen. Mark Kelly’s (D-Ariz.) retirement rank and pay following his participation in a November video telling service members to defy illegal orders, POLITICO’s Leo Shane III and Connor O’Brien report. Hegseth said the video was part of a “pattern of reckless misconduct.” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quickly jumped to Kelly’s defense, calling the move “a despicable act of political retribution.”

FOR YOUR RADAR: Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.) is stepping down as the ranking Democrat on the House China panel, POLITICO’s Nick Wu reports, with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) taking over as ranking member.

7 THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW

1. VENEZUELA FALLOUT: Following a whirlwind weekend of U.S. intervention in Venezuela, around a dozen oil tankers carrying Venezuelan oil have left the country since the start of 2026 — a potential violation of the strict oil blockade that remains in effect after Maduro’s capture, per Reuters. The United Nations Security Council is holding an emergency meeting on the U.S. raid today, with Secretary-General António Guterres saying he is “deeply concerned” about instability in the region, per NYT.

How it’s playing: WaPo surveyed 1,004 Americans on the intervention and found an even split between approval and disapproval of the operation, while a 63 percent majority said it should have required congressional authorization. In South Florida, there’s more hope among Venezuelan Americans and Venezuelans that they might be able to return to the country, NYT’s Patricia Mazzei writes.

The view from Caracas: Venezuelans are struggling to understand what will come next after this weekend’s stunning events, with confusion and some dread about more conflict raging across the capital city, WaPo’s Ana Vanessa Herrero and Terrence McCoy report from Caracas. And while Maduro may be out of power, the country’s top enforcers — Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino — still hold control of the military, and could present a wild card for Trump to deal with, WSJ’s Ryan Dubé writes.

All about the oil: Trump left little room for doubt after declaring that his top priority in Venezuela’s transition would be regrowing its oil industry and exports. But with that objective comes a big test for U.S. firms on how much risk they can tolerate, and how much they will invest without any guarantees on Venezuela’s future, Axios’ Ben Geman reports. China also looms large over the oil equation. It has loaned billions to the country to bring in Venezuelan oil, and now also faces a squeeze and questions about a return on investment, per NYT’s Alexandra Stevenson.

2. THE DON-ROE DOCTRINE: Trump’s ever-expanding foreign policy portfolio and eye toward intervention is raising red flags among world leaders. Danish PM Mette Frederiksen doubled down in defense of Greenland, calling on Trump to “stop the threats” while Greenland retains its right to self-determination, per NYT. Standing with Denmark is one of Trump’s big European allies, British PM Keir Starmer. “Denmark is a close European ally, a close NATO ally, and the future therefore has to be for Greenland [and] for the Kingdom of Denmark,” Stamer said this morning, POLITICO’s Noah Keate reports in London.

Also hitting back: Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who wrote on X this morning, “If you detain a president whom much of my people want and respect, you will unleash the people’s jaguar.” Petro also said he “asked the people to defend the president against any illegitimate violent act,” while the country’s defense minister toed a more diplomatic line, NYT’s Genevieve Glatsky reports.

Troubled waters: Iran has been struggling to quiet a wave of protests in the country that so far has killed 17 people, but Trump’s threats are complicating the country’s options, Reuters’ Parisa Hafezi writes. “These twin pressures have narrowed Tehran’s room for manoeuvre … with few viable options and high risks on every path,” one Iranian official told Reuters. Meanwhile in Nigeria, Muslims in the country are living in fear following the Christmas Day strikes and continued threats from Trump, per NYT.

The big picture: The Atlantic’s Missy Ryan and Ashley Parker outline Trump’s tack on foreign policy with a more, ahem, colorful moniker. We’ll call it the FAFO Doctrine. “In [Secretary of State] Marco Rubio’s telling, the stunning events in Venezuela on Saturday illustrate an essential truth — possibly the essential truth — about Donald Trump’s presidency: Global leaders cross him at their peril,” they write.

3. FIRST IN PLAYBOOK — Ad it up: Texas state Rep. James Talarico is going up with the first statewide TV ad in the Democratic Senate primary. The seven-figure buy frames Talarico as a fighter, with a message focused on fighting against corruption and for affordability. Watch the 30-second spot here

4. HE’S OUT: Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced this morning that he is dropping his bid for reelection, stepping away from the prospect of a third term in office, POLITICO’s Elena Schneider reports. The shock news comes as Republicans have sought to tie him to a spiraling controversy that has resulted in a federal probe into a massive welfare fraud scandal in the state and a crackdown from Trump on the state’s Somali community.

What Walz is saying: “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” he wrote in his statement on X. It’s a remarkable fall for Walz, who gained a national profile in 2024 as the Democratic nominee for vice president.

Who comes next: Walz met with Sen. Amy Klobuchar to discuss the campaign yesterday, Elena reports, and the onetime presidential candidate is “receiving encouragement to run and she’s seriously considering it but has not decided on her plans.” Her entry would be welcome news for Democrats in a competitive state given her past success in running ahead of others in her party. Dean Phillips wrote on X that he won’t enter the race.

What comes next: “2,000 federal agents deploying to Minneapolis in immigration crackdown, fraud probe,” by CBS’ Nicole Sganga and Camilo Montoya-Galvez: “The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations … The plan is for the agents and officers to oversee a 30-day surge in operations in the Twin Cities area, making the region the first major target of the Trump administration’s expanded immigration crackdown in the new year.” CBP Commander Gregory Bovino is expected “to help lead immigration enforcement efforts, along with an unknown number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel.”

5. TRADING SPACES: “OECD Finalizes Agreement on Global Minimum Tax,” by Bloomberg’s Caitlin Reilly and Daniel Flatley: “The US and more than 100 other countries finalized an agreement that would exempt American companies from some foreign taxes, the culmination of a months-long effort to create a carve-out from a corporate global minimum levy. The deal excludes US-based multinational corporations from the 15% global minimum tax negotiated through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development, or OECD. … Under the agreement, other countries would be effectively blocked from imposing additional taxes on foreign subsidiaries of US multinationals.”

6. LIVE FROM NEW YORK: “New York Gov. Kathy Hochul confronts a rising populist tide,” by POLITICO’s Nick Reisman: “Hochul is trying to center her reelection campaign on the cost of living. … She faces left-flank pressure to raise taxes on rich people so that New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s expensive agenda comes to fruition. On the right, Republicans have pledged to exploit any effort to support Mamdani’s goals … Yet the governor is showing signs that she’s willing to blend the policies of both the mercurial president and rookie mayor — making cost concerns a centerpiece for the coming year amid the expectation voters will reward her for sympathizing with their pocketbook problems.”

7. FOR YOUR RADAR: “Man in custody after windows broken at JD Vance’s home, Secret Service says,” by WaPo’s Jennifer Hassan: “U.S. Secret Service agents assigned to the Ohio home of Vice President JD Vance ‘physically detained’ a man at the property early Monday shortly after midnight after windows were broken there. … The Secret Service said it is coordinating with the Cincinnati police and the U.S. attorney’s office as charging decisions are reviewed.” What Vance is saying: “As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows,” he wrote on X. “I’m grateful to the secret service and the Cincinnati police for responding quickly. We weren’t even home as we had returned already to DC.”

TALK OF THE TOWN

IS THE BROMANCE BACK? — Elon Musk had dinner this weekend with Donald Trump and Melania Trump. “2026 is going to be amazing!” he posted on X.

THE LATEST D.C. DATA — “For the second year, D.C.’s annual homicide toll declined,” by WaPo’s Emma Uber: “In 2025, for the first time since 2017, fewer than 150 people were slain in D.C., continuing a decline in violent crime that began in 2024. D.C. experienced a 32 percent drop in homicides for the second consecutive year, according to city data, with police investigating 127 homicides in 2025 compared to 187 in 2024 and 274 the year before, the deadliest year in more than two decades. There were also fewer shootings, robberies, carjackings and instances of sexual abuse reported last year, data shows.”

TRANSITIONS — Evan Nash is now political director for Eric Conroy’s congressional campaign in Ohio. He previously worked in Sen. Bernie Moreno’s (R-Ohio) office. … Donald Gips and Francine Lamoriello are joining DGA Group. Gips, a former ambassador, previously led the Skoll Foundation. Lamoriello previously worked at the Personal Care Products Council. … Manny Orozco is joining Richard Lamondin’s congressional campaign as campaign manager. He previously worked for Miami-Dade County.

DHS shared a screenshot of two emails allegedly sent from an employee with Hilton Hotels. The first email informed the booker that the hotel was “not allowing any immigration agents” to stay at any of their properties.

“We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property,” the undated email stated.

“If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation.”

A follow up email sent on January 2 informed the booker that their reservation was cancelled.

“When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously CANCELLED their reservations,” Department of Homeland Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin wrote on X. “This is UNACCEPTABLE. Why is Hilton Hotels siding with murderers and rapists to deliberately undermine and impede DHS law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws?”

A spokesperson for Hilton Hotels said the hotel which cancelled the reservations is ""independently owned and operated"" but that Hilton Hotels is investigating the matter.

""Hilton hotels serve as welcoming places for all,"" the spokesperson said in an email. ""This hotel is independently owned and operated, and the actions referenced are not reflective of Hilton values. We are investigating this matter with this individual hotel, and can confirm that Hilton works with governments, law enforcement and community leaders around the world to ensure our properties are open and inviting to everyone.""

Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term, federal immigration crackdowns have taken place in major cities across the country such as Chicago, New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C.

And now in light of the uncovering of rampant fraud within Minnesota’s social services and Medicaid programs, DHS has sent Homeland Security Investigations to the state.

Minnesota is home to the largest Somali population in the United States with upwards of 100,000 people who are a part of the Somalian diaspora. The Trump administration said it is looking into revoking the citizenship of Somalians linked to the fraud.

Amid the controversy, state lawmakers and members of Congress were allowed to visit the facility, though Democrats said the visit was tightly controlled and left unanswered questions.
In addition to citing laws about legislators having access to correctional facilities, the lawsuit also raised constitutional separation-of-powers arguments.
The case about the legislators’ access has been assigned to Leon County Circuit Judge Jonathan Sjostrom.","Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration has fired back at a lawsuit filed by Democratic lawmakers seeking access to a controversial immigrant-detention center in the Everglades, saying they don’t have a legal right to enter the facility “at their pleasure.”

Five lawmakers filed the lawsuit in July after they made an unannounced visit to the facility dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz” but were denied access. They contended the denial was unconstitutional and violated state laws allowing access by legislators to correctional institutions.

But attorneys for DeSantis and state Division of Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie, in a response filed last week in Leon County circuit court, said the laws that the Democrats “invoked do not entitle them as individual legislators to enter Alligator Alcatraz at their pleasure.”

In part, the response said the access laws do not apply to the immigrant-detention facility.

“The facility is not a ‘state correctional institution’ because it is not a ‘prison’ or ‘other correctional facility,’” the response said, partially quoting one law. “‘Prisons’ and ‘correctional facilities’ describe facilities that are part of the criminal justice system. Instead, Alligator Alcatraz is a short-term civil detention facility in which illegal aliens are held under the authority of the federal government and processed for deportation.”

Sen. Shevrin Jones, D-Miami Gardens, Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, Rep. Anna Eskamani, D-Orlando, Rep. Angie Nixon, D-Jacksonville, and Rep. Michele Rayner, D-St. Petersburg, went to the center on July 3 “to inspect the state detention facility, evaluate the use of taxpayer funds and assess safety pursuant to Florida statutory guidelines,” the lawsuit said.

“The petitioners (the lawmakers) attempted to arrive unannounced so that they could observe the unadulterated conditions of the facility,” the lawsuit said. “The unannounced inspection of the facility falls squarely within the petitioners’ purview and oversight duties as state officers and members of the Florida Legislature.”

The lawsuit was filed at the Florida Supreme Court on July 10, seeking what is known as a “writ of quo warranto” directing DeSantis and Guthrie to allow lawmakers unannounced access to the facility. The Supreme Court, without offering an opinion about the lawmakers’ arguments, sent the case to the circuit court.

Amid the controversy, state lawmakers and members of Congress were allowed to visit the facility, though Democrats said the visit was tightly controlled and left unanswered questions.

In addition to citing laws about legislators having access to correctional facilities, the lawsuit also raised constitutional separation-of-powers arguments.

“The denial of the petitioners’ access to the ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ detention facility was an unconstitutional executive overreach because it prevented the duly elected members of the Florida Legislature from exercising their powers,” the lawsuit said. “The petitioners’ denial of entry and access restricted the Legislature’s independence as a coequal branch of government.”

But in the response last week, the DeSantis administration attorneys said the state Constitution gives the Legislature oversight authority, and a law authorizes legislative committees to carry out investigations. But the administration attorneys said individual lawmakers don’t have such powers.

“Far from the governor or FDEM (the Division of Emergency Management) usurping the authority of another branch of government, it is petitioners who attempt to usurp the authority of the Legislature and its committees by taking matters into their own hands,” the response said.

The state opened the detention center this summer at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, which had long been used for flight training, as DeSantis and other Florida Republican leaders sought to assist President Donald Trump’s mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. The facility, which is surrounded by the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve, has also led to separate legal battles in federal court.

It was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests,” Cypress wrote.
The Tribe said it will continue to collaborate with Congress and the Florida delegation and the federal government.
The statement from Talbert Cypress pointed out that former longtime Chairman Billy Cypress “enjoyed a friendship with President Trump and was an early supporter of his campaign in 2016.”","The Miccosukee Tribe is rejecting President Donald Trump’s claim that the tribe worked against his administration’s immigration efforts, the basis he used to veto a flood protection project in the Everglades.

Trump vetoes Miccosukee flood protection, citing tribe’s opposition to ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

In a statement to the Phoenix, the tribe wrote that it has “long supported President Trump’s commitment to Everglades restoration for the benefit of America’s public lands.”

“The Tribe has a constitutional duty to protect and defend the Everglades ecosystem, our traditional homelands. We never sought to obstruct the President’s immigration agenda. Instead, we have taken action to ensure sufficient environmental due diligence is performed to protect federal restoration investments,” Chairman Talbert Cypress wrote.

He added that the tribe was “disappointed to learn that the White House vetoed a measure intended to mitigate restoration impacts on a Tribal village.”

The bill, HR 504, called upon the Secretary of the Interior and the tribe “to take appropriate actions to safeguard structures within the Osceola Camp from flooding events.”

Trump vetoed the bill by Miami Republican Rep. Carlos Giménez despite widespread congressional support.

Politico reported Monday that the House will vote Thursday whether to override two vetoes, one being HR 504. That outlet reported “senior House Republicans and Democrats generally expect the chamber will approve the overrides in a rare rebuke of Trump.” However, “Less clear is whether either override vote would have enough support in the Senate.”

The second veto was a bill relating to federal funding for a Colorado water pipeline, also sponsored by a Republican. Democrats there believe the veto was politically motivated, Colorado Newsline reported.

In his veto letter, the president blamed the tribe for having “actively sought to obstruct reasonable immigration policies that the American people decisively voted for when I was elected.”

The tribe is part of a lawsuit against the state, claiming planners behind an immigration detention center in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” failed to follow federal environmental regulations in constructing the 3,000-bed facility.

“The measure reflected years of bipartisan work and was intended to clarify land status and support basic protections for tribal members who have lived in this area for generations — before the roads and canals were built, and before Everglades National Park was created. It was not about special treatment, but about public safety, environmental stewardship, and honoring long-recognized tribal interests,” Cypress wrote.

Trump, via his veto letter published Dec. 30 by the White House, said the tribe during former President Joe Biden’s administration sought “special treatment from the Federal Government.”

“My Administration is committed to preventing American taxpayers from funding projects for special interests, especially those that are unaligned with my Administration’s policy of removing violent criminal illegal aliens from the country,” Trump wrote.

The Tribe said it will continue to collaborate with Congress and the Florida delegation and the federal government.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.","Top Trump administration officials are scheduled on Monday afternoon to provide the first classified briefing for congressional leaders on the military raid that captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife over the weekend, carried out in Venezuela without informing or consulting with Congress.

The briefing is to include a select group known as the Gang of Eight — the House and Senate leaders from both parties, along with the chairmen and ranking members of each chamber’s intelligence committees — which is generally alerted to major military operations before, during or immediately after they occur. In this case, the Trump administration left the lawmakers in the dark, a decision that President Trump has said was made out of concern that they would leak details of the operation before it was carried out.

Those lawmakers are to be joined by the Republican chairmen and senior Democrats on the Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are scheduled to provide the briefing, along with John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, and Attorney General Pam Bondi, according to multiple people familiar with the planned meeting who were not authorized to discuss it.

Several lawmakers questioned why senior leaders on Capitol Hill had not been notified in advance about the raid, which captured Mr. Maduro and his wife to face drug trafficking charges in the United States.

By law, the Gang of Eight is supposed to be kept apprised of covert operations, although the Trump administration has not always done so.

“President Trump waged war on a foreign nation without authorization, without notification and without any explanation to the American people,” Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement following the operation.

Mr. Rubio spoke with a number of Republican senators in the hours following the raid. Senator Susan Collins of Maine, an Intelligence Committee member who was among them, later said in a statement that “Congress should have been informed about the operation earlier and needs to be involved as this situation evolves.”

Mr. Rubio has rejected the argument that Congress needed to be informed, and said in a series of interviews over the weekend that the operation did not require congressional approval because it was a law enforcement operation rather than a military invasion.

During a news conference hours after the operation was carried out, Mr. Trump said he had circumvented Congress because he did not trust senior lawmakers to keep his plans confidential.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.

Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the president was legally required to brief lawmakers.

“Whether you think Congress leaks or not, the law says you must brief Congress,” he said during an interview on CNN on Sunday. “This is just another example of absolute lawlessness on the part of this administration.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2026/01/05/multimedia/05us-venezuela-gang-of-eight-twgj/05us-venezuela-gang-of-eight-twgj-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 16:57:27.813500

Ron DeSantis is set to hold a press conference on Monday morning at the Baker Correctional Institution, the facility officials call “Deportation Depot.”

State Capitol reporter Forrest Saunders continues to cover Florida's second migrant detention and deportation center, which Gov. DeSantis has heralded, while civil rights and immigration advocacy groups have condemned the facilities. Those groups have been seeking closure of both migrant detention centers in Baker County and the Everglades, as well as more transparency over their operations.

At a news conference at the Baker Correctional Institution’s “Deportation Depot,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said Florida is leading the nation in immigration enforcement through close coordination with the Trump administration. He announced that Operation Tidal Wave has topped 10,000 arrests of undocumented, with officials claiming about 63% involved people with prior criminal records, and nearly 20,000 arrests statewide when local efforts are included.

DeSantis and Florida Cabinet members described Florida’s detention sites as temporary support to speed deportations while DHS expands capacity, confirming nearly 100 deportation flights so far from Baker alone. He said two additional detention facilities (the ""Panhandle Pokey"" and a yet-to-be-determined South Florida site) are pending federal approval. Speakers across state agencies touted arrests tied to violent crime, fraud, and trafficking, and argued that the strategy deters illegal immigration and improves public safety. They framed Florida’s approach as a model for other states.

DeSantis also said to expect details on his upcoming legislative priorities, like property insurance and tax relief, later this week.

In his first comments on the ouster, DeSantis said Venezuela was devastated by what he called Marxist rule under Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro, arguing the country went from prosperous to repressive and poor. He claimed Maduro is tied to drug trafficking and accused his government of releasing prisoners and sending people toward the U.S. border under the Biden administration. DeSantis pointed to South Florida’s large Venezuelan community as proof of the regime’s failures and said he hopes Venezuelans can ultimately free themselves from Maduro’s rule.

My office has long condemned serious human rights violations by the Venezuelan authorities.
When a state violates the human rights of its people, my office is among those who are charged with raising the alarm.
The human rights of Venezuelans are not a bargaining chip, or a point to be scored.
This is not about choosing between unilateral intervention that runs contrary to international law, or ignoring years of human rights violations.","The US military operation in Venezuela undermines a fundamental principle of international law, agreed after the horrors of two world wars and the Holocaust: states must not use force to pursue their territorial claims or political demands.

I am deeply disturbed by these events – and by some of the reactions I have seen. A narrative is emerging that seeks to justify the US military intervention as a response to the Nicolás Maduro government’s appalling human rights record.

My office has long condemned serious human rights violations by the Venezuelan authorities. We have reported, monitored and warned about the situation inside Venezuela – most recently, just before Christmas. We have consistently called for an end to unfair trials, arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances, the persecution of political opponents and sweeping restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly. We have urged independent investigations and accountability. For many years, my team in Venezuela advocated for the release of human rights defenders, monitored trials and engaged with civil society and the opposition, as well as state institutions.

Our detailed monitoring and reporting were intended to prompt action. When a state violates the human rights of its people, my office is among those who are charged with raising the alarm. It is up to the international community to use the lawful tools and mechanisms at its disposal, so that states respect their human rights obligations. These tools could include diplomatic leverage and investments in accountability. But these tools and mechanisms were not deployed effectively to influence the government of Venezuela.

Far from being a victory for human rights, this military intervention – in contravention of Venezuelan sovereignty and the UN charter – damages the architecture of international security, making every country less safe. It sends a signal that the powerful can do whatever they like, and weakens the only mechanism we have to prevent a third world war, namely the United Nations. No amount of deception and distraction can alter these facts.

Beyond the legal arguments, history teaches us that while attempts at regime change may initially be greeted by relief, they often lead to massive human rights violations, dangerous chaos and protracted violent conflict.

The human rights of Venezuelans are not a bargaining chip, or a point to be scored. I have visited Venezuela and spoken with its people, and I feel deeply for them at this moment. I feel for those waiting desperately for news about their loved ones; for families who have been separated; and for all those with empty places at their tables during this holiday season. Human rights need to be central to Venezuela’s future – not an afterthought, taking a back seat to negotiations around the exploitation of fossil fuels. The country’s future must be decided by its people.

More broadly, human rights cannot be treated like an ideological ping-pong ball. We cannot afford for our rights to be instrumentalised: invoked when they’re convenient, and vilified when they’re not. I fear for people in the region and around the world who are deeply alarmed by what this breach in international law means for their own safety and security. This is not about choosing between unilateral intervention that runs contrary to international law, or ignoring years of human rights violations. We need more fidelity to human rights law around the world, not less.

Venezuelan society needs healing. It needs justice to overcome polarisation and to repair its social and economic fabric. It does not need militarisation, violence or further uncertainty and instability.

Above all, Venezuela needs the international community to stop paying lip service to human rights, and to stand up for the UN charter and for international law. The alternative will have terrible consequences around the world.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b786fa786d8511bb32ce4b7ff102aa27b8cdb70f/323_87_2690_2153/master/2690.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=da55f6c6c51d045046019b065e430d27",N,,2026-01-05 18:58:05.143354

Florida officials were waiting for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to sign off on the third detention center in the state's Panhandle, DeSantis said at a news conference outside the facility which was Florida's second immigration detention center, dubbed “Deportation Deport,” at the former Baker Correctional Institution in northeast Florida.

“So, if they approve, we will open,” DeSantis said. “If they don't, then we will stand by, and that's fine. But I think it should be approved since I don't think they're where they need to be on detention space.”

The governor said there was “another option potentially” in South Florida, where state officials already have constructed an immigration detention center dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” at a remote airstrip in the Florida Everglades.

When asked by email about the specific locations of the two potential detention facilities, DeSantis press secretary Molly Best said the Panhandle location would be announced once it's approved by federal officials.

“Until this and the proposed additional South Florida location have been approved and finalized, we are unable to provide additional details. Stay tuned!” Best said.

DeSantis said that there had been 10,000 arrests of people in the U.S. illegally in Florida during the past year through a state initiative with federal law enforcement, and that local law enforcement had made an additional 10,000 arrests for a total of 20,000 arrests. Under the state initiative, 63% of those arrested had a criminal arrest or conviction, DeSantis said.

Florida has led other states in constructing facilities to support President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, with DeSantis saying the Trump administration needs the additional capacity to hold and deport more immigrants. The Trump administration has trumpeted the Republican governors’ efforts to expand their immigration detention capacity, calling Florida’s partnership a model for other state-run holding facilities.

Attorneys for detainees at the Everglades facility have called the conditions deplorable, writing in court documents that rainwater floods their tents and officers go cell-to-cell pressuring detainees to sign voluntary removal orders before they’re allowed to consult their attorneys.

Three federal lawsuits in Florida are challenging practices at the Everglades facility.

In one lawsuit, detainees are asking for the facility to be closed since immigration is a federal issue, and Florida agencies and private contractors hired by the state have no authority to operate it under federal law. In a second lawsuit, detainees were seeking a ruling that would ensure that they have access to confidential communications with their attorneys.

In the third lawsuit, a federal judge in Miami last summer ordered the facility to wind down operations over two months because officials had failed to do a review of the detention center’s environmental impact. But an appellate court panel put that decision on hold for the time being, allowing the facility to stay open.

Spain isn’t naïve about immigration.

It has border pressure, racism, and a loud far-right party.

What Spain does not have is the American habit of pretending immigration is an existential threat instead of an economic and demographic opportunity.

After living in Spain for two years, the contrast is impossible to ignore: Spain integrates immigrants more effectively than the United States and, in many ways, better than parts of Northern Europe.

Not because it’s kinder, but because it’s more honest.

And that honesty offers a blueprint for what a serious, winnable U.S. progressive immigration platform could look like, without the open-borders delusion or culture-war bait.

1. Spain Says the Quiet Part Out Loud

Spain openly acknowledges something U.S. politicians treat like contraband:

Immigrants are necessary for the country to function.

Spain has one of the lowest birth rates in the world (1.16 births per woman in 2023, according to Spain’s National Statistics Institute), a rapidly aging population, and a pension system that relies on workers. The math isn’t ideological — it’s demographic.

The U.S. is in the same position:

U.S. birth rates are near historic lows (CDC).

Workforce aging is accelerating (U.S. Census Bureau).

Social Security faces long-term solvency challenges (SSA Trustees Report).

Meanwhile, immigrants account for a large share of labor force growth (Brookings), start businesses at higher rates than native-born Americans (NBER), and contribute more in taxes than they consume in benefits overall (National Academies of Sciences).

Spain frames immigration as workforce infrastructure.

The U.S. frames it as a cultural threat.

Only one of those approaches is grounded in reality.

A Hilton-branded hotel in Minneapolis is facing scrutiny after allegedly canceling reservations made by federal immigration agents, prompting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to publicly question the decision.

Emails that ICE shared on social media appear to show staff at the Hampton Inn by Hilton Lakeville Minneapolis informing individuals associated with reservations for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) that the property would not allow ICE or other immigration agents to stay.

Hilton did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment.

""We have noticed an influx of GOV reservations made today that have been for DHS, and we are not allowing any ICE or immigration agents to stay at our property. If you are with DHS or immigration, let us know as we will have to cancel your reservation,"" an email from a staff member at the Hilton-branded hotel allegedly reads.

""Please pass on this info to your coworkers that we are not allowing any immigration agents to house on our property.""

A follow-up email several hours later then allegedly stated, ""After further investigation online, we have found information about immigration work connected with your name and we will be cancelling your upcoming reservation. You should see a proper cancellation email in your inbox shortly from Hilton.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News Digital in a statement: ""Hilton has launched a coordinated campaign in Minneapolis to REFUSE service to DHS law enforcement. When officers attempted to book rooms using official government emails and rates, Hilton Hotels maliciously CANCELLED their reservations.""

""This is UNACCEPTABLE,"" said McLaughlin. ""Why is Hilton Hotels siding with murderers and rapists to deliberately undermine and impede DHS law enforcement from their mission to enforce our nation’s immigration laws?""

The exchange prompted the official ICE account on X to post screenshots of the conversation.

American Victimhood In November, the Trump administration released its National Security Strategy.
That’s also why the Trump administration resumed its Guantánamo operations after the ruling by sending 22 Cubans to the base.
In March, Judge James Boasberg ordered planes carrying migrants to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison to turn around and return to the United States.
But even if Noem and the Trump administration are found to be in criminal contempt, we can hardly imagine any administration officials facing any semblance of accountability.","At a press conference on January 3, President Donald Trump announced that the United States had carried out strikes on Venezuela and captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. Trump alleged that Maduro oversaw the Cartel de los Soles and had sent members of the Tren de Aragua gang to the United States to terrorize Americans. Unlike previous U.S. presidents, who typically denied ulterior motives behind similarly brazen acts of regime change — such as access and exploitation to natural resources — Trump was explicit about the U.S.’s interest in Venezuelan oil. Notably absent from the press conference, which also featured remarks from Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Dan “Raizin” Caine, was any reference to the law or to what legal authority could possibly justify the strikes on Venezuela or the abduction of Maduro and Flores. Despite this absence of legal justification, Trump asserted that Maduro and his wife would “soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil.” In this conception of American “justice,” the contradiction of violating the law in order to achieve justice is something that the U.S. need not reckon with.

“Kill everybody” was the command that Hegseth reportedly issued on September 2 to authorize a double-tap strike on a Caribbean boat the U.S. claimed was carrying drug traffickers. As additional strikes followed, controversy escalated over whether the September 2 attack constituted a war crime — prompting both Democrats and some Republicans to call for a formal investigation. However, the discussion about whether or not a war crime had been committed allowed a central myth behind the U.S.’s murderous actions to be ignored — that is, that the U.S. was not at war with Venezuela. Thus, what was committed was a crime — and one that no one in the administration will presumably be held accountable for. This because the Trump administration has demonstrated over and over again that laws often function less as constraints than as optional guidelines for those in power. In an op-ed for The Hill titled “War is hell, but that should never excuse war crimes,” Marine Corps veteran Jos Joseph condemns Trump and Hegseth’s actions and points to past abuses during the “war on terror” — such as the Haditha massacre in Iraq — as stark examples of what happens when legal limits are completely disregarded. Yet war crimes remain meaningful only to the extent that there is a will to enforce accountability and to acknowledge that such violations exist in the first place. When “Meet the Press” recently asked Trump whether the president is obligated to uphold the Constitution, his response — “I don’t know” — laid bare his view of the law not as a binding force, but as something malleable for those who wield state power. Moreover, given the almost near certainty that any government officials could be or will be held accountable for war crimes, the possibility of being held accountable for other crimes is nonexistent.

American Victimhood

In November, the Trump administration released its National Security Strategy. Beyond celebrating and applauding Trump’s leadership and providing a definition of “American strategy,” the document includes a section titled “What should the United States want.” The section starts with the following sentence: “First and foremost, we want the continued survival and safety of the United States as an independent, sovereign republic whose government secures the God-given natural rights of its citizens and prioritizes their well-being and interests.” Strongly rooted in the construction of the United States as a perpetual and unwarranted victim, the section outlines the need for the U.S. to protect its territory, to have full control over its borders, and to have a well-oiled military machine to protect its interests. This victim narrative, particularly utilized in the articulated right of the United States to protect its territory, rings especially violent after Venezuelan sovereignty was completely violated by U.S. strikes on the country and the abduction of Maduro and his wife.

This rhetoric of victimhood is not unique to Trump and his administration. It has been a strategic throughline of the “war on terror” — used to legitimize otherwise indefensible policies and legal interventions. In her article “Legitimizing the ‘War on Terror’: Political Myth in Official-Level Rhetoric,” scholar Joanne Esch explains how narratives of U.S. victimization draw on the myth of American exceptionalism: the belief that the United States is a uniquely aggrieved nation entitled to extraordinary responses. Similarly, scholars Jessie Barton Hronešová and Daniel Kreiss describe this manipulation of grievance by those in power as “hijacked victimhood,” a tactic through which dominant groups frame themselves as under attack in order to justify the expansion of coercive state power.

According to Hronešová and Kreiss, “Hijacked victimhood narratives delegitimize the victimhood of those whom they characterize as threats to the power of dominant groups — refugees, minorities, historically oppressed groups, and those who represent them — and dilute efforts at redress and justice.” Hijacked victimhood narratives have served as a powerful and convenient tool for Trump and his administration to justify state violence under the guise of protecting the United States — or, more specifically, white Americans — from the existential threat that they claim immigration, immigrants, and now so-called “narco-terrorists” pose to the country. Constructing immigration as an existential threat has provided not only an ideological vehicle for violence, but also a license to subvert and break the law.

By positioning itself as the perpetual victim, the United States government rhetorically renders all its violence as defensive, the violation of human and civil rights as necessary, and every legal constraint as an existential obstacle to national survival. In this way, hijacked victimhood becomes the political and moral engine that normalizes state violence.

Trump 2.0

During a recent cabinet meeting at the White House, Pete Hegseth, who was defending himself against allegations that he had committed war crimes, claimed that the boat strikes were a consequence of the “fog of war,” and the uncertainty that comes with combat. In environmental terms, fog eventually lifts and becomes invisible vapor. In the context of war, when the fog clears, the same thing happens: accountability evaporates, leaving those responsible for violence unscathed and armed with narratives that condone their actions. The “fog of war” is not a plausible explanation for U.S. boat strikes on survivors; rather, what seems central here is the fact that Trump and members of his administration feel emboldened to break the law with the certainty that they will face no consequences.

Trump’s new reign of lawlessness began on January 20, 2025, the day of his second inauguration. Immediately wielding his pen to sanction state violence, he fulfilled his promised anti-immigrant agenda by signing multiple executive orders aiming to significantly restrict birthright citizenship, implement travel bans with enhanced vetting, suspend the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, mandate detention expansion and expanding expedited removal authorities, among others. The executive order titled “Designating Cartels And Other Organizations As Foreign Terrorist Organizations And Specially Designated Global Terrorists” specifically named Tren de Aragua and MS-13 as foreign terrorist organizations. A little over two weeks later, backed by another executive order directing the secretary of defense and the secretary of homeland security to expand migration operations at Guantánamo Bay, Trump sent the first group of migrants to Guantánamo, claiming that they were part of the Tren de Aragua gang.

On December 5, Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan ruled that the policy of holding migrants at Guantánamo was a violation of their Fifth Amendment due process rights that was decidedly not authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act. While this decision was a victory, the fact that the Trump administration was able to send migrants to Guantánamo at all is a reminder that the law was not enough to stop the violation of rights in the first place — much less dictate any actual consequences after its infraction. That’s also why the Trump administration resumed its Guantánamo operations after the ruling by sending 22 Cubans to the base. The identities of the migrants are still unknown, and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has refused to disclose any information as to whether or how it might facilitate the individuals’ return to the custody of their government.

In his article titled “Citizen in Exception: Omar Khadr and the Performative Gap in the Law,” author Matt Jones writes about how the law gets manipulated, including through legal subjunctives. Jones describes legal subjunctives as situations where “an actor behaves ‘as if’ their actions were legal even if they are aware that their interpretation will not ultimately be recognized as legal. Though a subjunctive claim of this kind may ultimately be struck down, it may nonetheless hold open a temporary gap in the legal system in which an individual or group is, for a time, deprived of their rights.” Though confidence in the U.S. legal system often rests on the belief that the rule of law will ultimately prevail, this belief exists against the reality that the law is treated as something to be bent, circumvented, or openly violated. But the rule of law simply does not and cannot exist without accountability.

In March, Judge James Boasberg ordered planes carrying migrants to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison to turn around and return to the United States. Disregarding his order, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem instructed the two flights carrying migrants to continue their journey to El Salvador. In November, Judge Boasberg, who had previously argued in April that there were grounds to hold the government in criminal contempt, resumed his inquiry. But even if Noem and the Trump administration are found to be in criminal contempt, we can hardly imagine any administration officials facing any semblance of accountability. Moreover, accountability for perpetrators is only one side of the equation — victim redress is the other. In other countries, this brand of lawlessness would be called corruption plainly (and could be used to justify sanctions or immigration bans), yet in the United States, the facade of legality is maintained through the mere declaration that actions are lawful. In other instances such as the strikes on Venezuela and the kidnapping of Maduro and his wife, the U.S. government attempts to conflate justice and legality — capitalizing on American ignorance — so that they are constructed as being one in the same.

On December 16, Trump issued a presidential proclamation titled “Restricting and Limiting the Entry of Foreign Nationals to Protect the Security of the United States.” Adding to Trump’s previous proclamation in June — which banned nationals from Afghanistan, Burma, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen — the new ban adds Palestine (the ban does not say Palestine or Palestinians, but instead refers to Palestinian Authority documents), Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, and Syria. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld Trump’s 2017 travel ban in the case of Trump v. Hawaii, with the majority (5-4) arguing that the president’s ban was based on legitimate national security concerns as opposed to religious discrimination — at least as it pertained to the actual text of the ban and the process of determining the list of countries, not his demonizing and Islamophobic rhetoric. On the heels of his previous win, we can hardly expect the deferential Supreme Court, composed predominantly of Trump loyalists, to stand in his way of accelerating his anti-immigrant agenda and these new set of proclamations banning nationals from countries across the globe — whether rooted in Islamophobia, anti-Blackness, or anti-immigrant sentiment more broadly.

Who Has the Right to Have Rights?

In a postcard dated August 2002 and written to his family, one of the formerly incarcerated Muslim men at Guantánamo, Nizar Sassi, said of the prison: “If you want a definition of this place, you don’t even have the rights to rights.” Of course, what Sassi was describing was a context in which rules and protocols were being constructed specifically to evade the legal norms in place and to render any semblance of rights for those detained nonexistent. As the case of Guantánamo and the ever-expanding post-9/11 national security infrastructure has long revealed, the exercise of human and civil rights is relegated to the whims of those in power, and because they are most often pitted against the rights of the state, the battle for these rights becomes a battle between a canon and a knife — all while the cannon constructs the knife as a threat to its existence.

Trump’s National Security Strategy asserts that “the purpose of the American government is to secure the God-given natural rights of American citizens.” Ironically, this claim rests on a theory of rights that understands them as inherent to human beings rather than granted by the state. Yet the same document justifies empowering government institutions with “fearsome powers” that effectively authorize the suspension and violation of law in the name of protecting those rights. In this formulation, the rule of law is imperiled not only by the state’s abuse of legal authority, but by the explicit authorization to break the law itself.

There is little reason to believe that the legal system will ultimately prevail, as it often fails to — especially in the realm of national security and when it comes to preventing abuses in the first place. We must also remember that Trump did not inherit a clean slate; rather, the administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden demonstrated that the defining continuity of the “war on terror” has been a persistent lack of accountability, whether they committed war crimes or other crimes.

If states like the United States have taught us anything, it’s that they can easily (and often do) disregard the law altogether or weaponize and manipulate the law to protect their own rights at the expense of human rights. Given this reality, how can the state be an adjudicator of our rights when its interest is fundamentally about protecting its own rights at the expense of human rights? Nevertheless, against the state’s insistence that violence is necessary to secure rights and its corresponding refusal of accountability, we must understand our rights to exist beyond and against the nation-state framework. We do not have rights because of the state; we have rights in spite of it. We must also build our collective power to challenge the state so that what controls its ability to govern is the people united in their inherent rights, dignity, and categorical demands for justice for all. Internalizing our rights in this way challenges the legitimacy of the state and its violence, while continuing to build transnational solidarity and a path toward abolitionist futures.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254125982.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 15:57:30.469901

Matsunaga and CCoHOPE emphasize this mission as a strategy that fosters the power of a united community capable of transforming concern into action.","Croton-on-Hudson, approximately four and a half miles from Peekskill, will become the epicenter of a profound debate on immigration, a topic that transcends headlines and affects real lives. The event will take place on Saturday, Jan. 10, beginning at 2:30 p.m. The Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Hudson Valley, located at 2021 Albany Post Road, will host the symposium, titled The Real Immigration Crisis: Why It Matters and How You Can Help, featuring Nancy Matsunaga of the CCoHOPE Indivisible Immigration Justice Committee. The focus of the presentation will be to provide a comprehensive overview of the immigration situation in the United States and the ways in which the community can become involved.

The purpose of the presentation is to explain the complexity of migration pathways, legal obstacles, and reforms that aim to protect immigrant residents in New York. Matsunaga will address topics such as the NY4All legislation (protects state immigrant residents, including suspension of deportation in certain cases) and the Dignity Not Detention Act (limits immigrant detention and promotes dignified treatment), initiatives that, according to their sponsors, seek to safeguard basic rights and reduce the impact of detention and deportation policies on immigrant families. The event will combine an informative presentation with a question-and-answer session for attendees.

This community dialogue occurs within a broad and dynamic immigration context. According to estimates from the Pew Research Center, the population of unauthorized immigrants in the United States reached a record 14 million in 2023, including both those who entered without documentation and those who subsequently lost their legal status, representing approximately 4 percent of the total population at that time. By January 2025, the total immigrant population exceeded 53 million. However, changes in immigration policies and increased deportations showed a reduction of more than one million people in the first half of the year.

The backlog of cases in U.S. immigration courts exceeds 3.7 million pending files, according to official data and analysis of the immigration judicial system, reflecting years of delays in decision-making on asylum requests, deportation, and other administrative immigration processes. This figure represents one of the highest levels of accumulated cases in the system’s history, with many applicants waiting years — sometimes more than four — for their case to be resolved by a federal court.

Thus, the symposium will address these aspects and statistics that illustrate a migration flow that has changed over time, but, above all, policies that are constantly adjusted, increasing the urgency to understand not only the data but the human stories behind them. According to organizers, community participation is a fundamental element of the event, which will last approximately one and a half hours.

The event is open to the public but requires advance registration. Those interested in attending must send their name and email address to ccohopeijcrsvp@googlegroups.com. The venue has limited parking, so attendees are advised to arrive early and, if possible, share transportation.

The Trump administration created the Gold Card to allow foreign nationals to purchase legal status in the United States for $1 million, and the portal for applications went online on Dec. 10.
“In the Gold Card program, it’s a straight-up gift to the United States,” Kapuria said.
“So if you have a family of four, that’s $4 million,” Kapuria said.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security referred a request for comment on inquiries related to the Gold Card to the Commerce Department, which didn’t respond to a request to comment.","President Donald Trump’s recently launched Gold Card initiative has generated interest among foreign nationals, immigration attorneys say, even though many details are uncertain and wealthy applicants face pros and cons in pursuing this path to the United States.

The Trump administration created the Gold Card to allow foreign nationals to purchase legal status in the United States for $1 million, and the portal for applications went online on Dec. 10.

Steven Reingold, a trial attorney with law firm Saul Ewing, said the Green Card substantively appears to be an alternative to the EB-5 visa, which grants foreign investors permanent residency in the United States if they agree to invest high-level capital into a U.S. commercial enterprise that creates or preserves jobs.

One key difference between the two, however, is the Gold Card isn’t a job creation initiative and is essentially a $1 million gift to the United States, while the EB-5 payment requires an $800,000 minimum investment in a U.S. business, although the federal government extracts some of that money for fees.

Rohit Kapuria, a Chicago-based attorney who has worked with clients who have sought EB-5 visas at Saul Ewing, said he expects “some level of competitiveness” between the EB-5 and the Gold Card initiatives but the fate of those funds is one of the key differences.

A foreign national has an opportunity to recoup the EB-5 investment if it was a good bet. “In the Gold Card program, it’s a straight-up gift to the United States,” Kapuria said. “You’re not going to see it again.”

At the same time, Kapuria said, the Gold Card has a provision that looks like “some sort of fast track” that might make that a more attractive option.

Another difference, Kapuria said, is the EB-5 initiative allows for derivative applicants, which means a spouse or children could come in with the same investment, but the Gold Card means $1 million per person.

“So if you have a family of four, that’s $4 million,” Kapuria said. “So that’s a gatekeeping issue, probably for a lot of investors.”

Kapuria said he also expects the Gold Card to pull applicants from the EB-2 visa, which is the vehicle for highly skilled individuals with advanced degrees to enter the United States. The EB-2 program is currently experiencing a backlog from applicants in China and India, he said.

The legal framework for the Gold Card is rooted in existing immigrant categories under the EB-1A and EB-2 NIW visas, which are available for foreign applicants with top skills and advanced degrees and require applicants to demonstrate exceptional abilities that they can contribute to the United States.

George Fishman, senior legal fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, said he could envision a scenario in which the judiciary would overturn the Gold Card as unlawful, even though the initiative as launched is based on requirements for EB-2 visas established by statute.

“Is the administration going to be able to convince a federal judge that simply writing a check for a million dollars satisfies the statutory requirements of international claim for your achievements?” Fishman said. “I think that that’s going to be a vulnerability in court in a lawsuit.”

Fishman said a potential plaintiff who would have the legal right to file such a lawsuit is an “open question,” but he speculated that foreign nationals who applied for an EB-2 visa but were unable to immigrate to the United States because of numerical caps would “have standing to sue because they would be negatively impacted personally by this.”

Reingold said the Gold Card initiative has “quite a number of kinks to work out,” including congressional authorization and the regulatory process.

,Policy,2026-01-05 17:22:51+00:00,Tribal Business News,Congress rejects nearly $1B in proposed tribal cuts in bipartisan FY26 funding package,Brian Edwards,,,,,https://tribalbusinessnews.com/sections/policy-and-law/15432-congress-rejects-nearly-1b-in-proposed-tribal-cuts-in-bipartisan-fy26-funding-package,"The package would preserve funding for health care, public safety, education, infrastructure and treaty obligations across Indian Country.
The three-bill package combines the Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water Development, and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bills — a so-called “minibus” funding package covering most federal programs that fund tribal governments, tribal enterprises and treaty-based obligations.
It also preserves funding for tribal public safety and justice programs, including initiatives addressing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons.
Construction and sanitation funding for tribal health facilities is maintained, along with operational funding for existing and newly opened clinics.
“This bipartisan, bicameral package reflects steady progress toward completing FY26 funding responsibly,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)","WASHINGTON — Congress released bill text Monday for a bipartisan, bicameral package of three fiscal year 2026 appropriations bills that would reject nearly $1 billion in proposed cuts to tribal programs sought by the Trump administration, according to congressional negotiators. The package would preserve funding for health care, public safety, education, infrastructure and treaty obligations across Indian Country.

The three-bill package combines the Commerce, Justice, Science, Energy and Water Development, and Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bills — a so-called “minibus” funding package covering most federal programs that fund tribal governments, tribal enterprises and treaty-based obligations. The agreement reflects negotiations between House and Senate appropriators from both parties and now moves toward floor votes in both chambers, as congressional leaders work to pass full-year funding ahead of a looming government shutdown deadline.

For tribes, the agreement represents a significant reversal of the administration’s budget request, which would have sharply reduced funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, tribal public safety programs and environmental initiatives. Appropriators instead largely maintained existing funding levels, rejected proposed reductions and fully funded legally required tribal payments that support the day-to-day operation of tribal governments.

In a summary released by Democratic appropriators, the package is described as delivering essential funding to support tribes and treaty obligations, rejecting what they characterized as President Trump’s “push to slash funding” for tribal programs by nearly $1 billion.

Patty Murray (D-Wash.), the vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the legislation would “help ensure Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent.”

The Interior bill provides continued support for core tribal government services through the Bureau of Indian Affairs, including roads, housing improvement, natural resource management and tribal courts. It also preserves funding for tribal public safety and justice programs, including initiatives addressing Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons.

One of the important outcomes for tribes is full funding for Tribal Sovereignty Payments, including contract support costs and Section 105(l) lease payments tied to self-determination and self-governance agreements. Those payments, which are required under federal law, have become increasingly important to tribal budgets following recent court rulings.

Indian Health Service funding is also preserved, including advance appropriations that provide tribes and tribal health systems greater budget certainty for staffing, hiring and service delivery, a mechanism first adopted in fiscal 2023. Construction and sanitation funding for tribal health facilities is maintained, along with operational funding for existing and newly opened clinics.

Energy and water provisions continue funding for tribal water rights settlements and infrastructure projects, while the Environmental Protection Agency accounts include support for tribal assistance grants and Alaska Native contaminated lands cleanup programs.

House Republican leaders emphasized the bipartisan nature of the agreement and the return to regular appropriations after reliance on continuing resolutions.

Senate Republicans also emphasized the bipartisan scope of the agreement. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, described the package as fiscally restrained while maintaining core federal investments. “It provides investments in our public lands and upholds our commitments to tribal communities,” Collins said in a statement.

House Republican leaders emphasized the bipartisan nature of the agreement and the return to regular appropriations after reliance on continuing resolutions.

“This bipartisan, bicameral package reflects steady progress toward completing FY26 funding responsibly,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said in a statement Monday addressing the FY26 appropriations process and the next set of bills expected to reach the House floor this week. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole (R-Okla.), an enrolled member of the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma, said the bills demonstrate how regular order can deliver “critical community projects nationwide.”

If enacted, the package would restore congressional control over tribal funding by reinstating detailed spending directives and preserving advance appropriations and legally required payments the administration had proposed cutting.

The past year was defined not by holiday cheer but by uncertainty, fear and loss, tempered only by a growing resolve to stand together.

Yet for many local families, this moment of togetherness arrived under a heavy shadow. The past year was defined not by holiday cheer but by uncertainty, fear and loss, tempered only by a growing resolve to stand together.

What these past 12 months have revealed for our Latino and immigrant neighbors is not a series of isolated hardships, but the steady force of federal and local policies that have repeatedly and profoundly reshaped daily life in our community. This reality is reflected in a recent study by the Pew Research Center.

The data confirms that the predominant sentiment among Latinos in the United States is one of increasing dissatisfaction and pessimism. More than 5,000 people surveyed by Pew expressed concern about the economy and immigration policy, as well as increasing fear of deportations, discrimination, and violence. Almost nine out of 10 said their daily lives have become more difficult, according to the study.

On the East End, this statistic translates into empty streets, paralyzed businesses, and families living in constant fear.

Throughout 2025, multiple federal operations and arrests were reported in Riverhead, Flanders, Hampton Bays, Westhampton, Greenport, East Hampton, and other Long Island towns. Reports of relatives suddenly disappearing and operations carried out in everyday spaces—bakeries, parking lots, delis, cars and bus stops—have sown panic among workers and families who, in most cases, are essential members of the community, contributing and raising their families in their towns for decades.

And over the past six months, the sense of concern has only worsened as enforcement tactics have become more visible and unpredictable. Masked federal agents in full tactical gear from ICE, ERO, and other agencies have been using public parking lots at local firehouses, Suffolk County Police precincts, Home Depots, a State Police barracks and other public and business locations as makeshift bases of operation, intensifying confusion and mistrust within the community.

Fire departments, local police departments, and state police spokespeople have repeatedly denied involvement in or assistance with any ICE operations, but advocates and members of the local community have raised questions about why and how their parking lots are being used, and what that message sends.

While President Trump claims he is deporting the “ worst of the worst,” the actual data indicates ICE is mostly detaining individuals without any criminal records – not even a pending charge, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, a nonpartisan research center at Syracuse University that provides public access to detailed information on U.S. federal government enforcement, spending, and activities.

As of Sept. 26, about 71.5% of people held in ICE detention had no criminal convictions, according to TRAC.

This is because the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are law-abiding people. Like those who arrived on America’s shores in the 19th and early 20th centuries — at a time when “legal” immigration meant little more than a brief interview and health check at Ellis Island — they are fleeing poverty, famine, political repression and in some cases, violence or war. The common thread binding our immigrant ancestors to the new immigrants has been and remains seeking the chance to live a better life.

The stark difference is how very difficult or even nearly impossible it is to legally immigrate today from certain regions of the world. The U.S. immigration system has been broken for decades, with very few meaningful attempts to fix it since 1986. In all my reporting, not once have immigrants told me they chose to stay undocumented. There are simply very few paths to come or stay documented, even when they try to do so over and over again.

In the face of the constant threat under which immigrants live in the U.S. today — whether documented or not — a collective voice has also emerged in recent months. People have said, unmistakably, that enough is enough. Community protests, demonstrations, and events of all kinds have taken place throughout the region, signaling a turning point. And this dissatisfaction among the community has not been limited to the streets.

Local organizations, advocates, and community members of all races and backgrounds have launched rapid-response networks, established WhatsApp and Signal groups as preventive and alert measures, launched ICE trackers, held dozens of workshops to inform the community about their human and civil rights, documented federal enforcement activities, held impromptu and scheduled protests, and organized in response to enforcement actions they say lack transparency.

“No one should fear being taken from their home or neighborhood by armed individuals wearing masks who refuse to identify themselves, or be left uncertain about whether those detaining them are acting under lawful authority,” said Anita Boyer, an organizer of several protests across the East End, in a recent interview with Tu Prensa Local at a demonstration in Hampton Bays.

Neighbors, organizations, and community leaders have appealed directly to town boards, demanding explanations, transparency, and protection for immigrant neighbors.

East Hampton Town issued an official statement condemning the actions of masked federal agents, calling the arrests a source of “profound fear and uncertainty” and denouncing “inhuman” policies that undermine human dignity and due process.

The concern has also spread to schools, leading several districts to issue statements on the matter. The Riverhead Central School District was among the first on the East End to send a letter earlier this year reaffirming that schools must remain safe and trusted spaces for all students and that any immigration enforcement actions on school grounds can be carried out only with appropriate legal documentation, in accordance with New York State law.

This climate of persecution has profound and measurable consequences. Businesses have seen their sales drop by as much as 80%, according to local store owners. Professionals and community advocates report an increase in the number of parents requesting custody letters and powers of attorney out of fear of being detained. At the same time, food pantries and community centers are serving fewer immigrant families, not because the need has decreased, but because fear keeps them confined to their homes.

This fear is reinforced by cases like the one recently reported by Newsday, in which a federal judge condemned the treatment of a man detained by ICE in a holding cell in federal district court in Central Islip as “inhuman and unlawful.”

District Court Judge Gary Brown, a Trump appointee, described how the man, Erron Anthony Clarke, spent several days crammed with eight other men in a “putrid and cramped,” freezing-cold holding cell — a room designed to temporarily hold one person for a brief time — under bright lights 24 hours, forced to sleep on the floor around an open toilet in the middle of the cell. The man had entered the U.S. legally under a work visa. “He has no record of violence, drug use or criminal history,” the judge wrote. On Dec. 5, ICE agents arrested and detained him.

The behavior of federal officers during the court proceeding was almost as shocking as the condition of the man’s detention.

Judge Brown wrote that ICE removed Clarke from the Central Islip Courthouse and transported him to a private detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, hours before he was supposed to appear in court, despite an order to produce him for a hearing. He also criticized what he described as false statements and repeated failures to follow court directives.

Other tactics employed by the federal government are just as deceptive. I’ve learned from family members of several men who have been arrested and disappeared, after reporting to an immigration processing office in Hauppauge for a “check-in” or other mandatory appearance required for their pending applications for permanent residence. Upon leaving the office, they were followed, detained and arrested by masked federal agents, and quickly removed to out-of-state detention centers. Their only “crime”? Attempting to follow established procedures on the path to legal residency.

These events confirm that the fear is not exaggerated: it is a logical response to an increasingly visible reality.

The climate of anxiety and uncertainty extends far beyond individual households. The labor of the Latino community sustains agriculture, construction, restaurants, offices, health care, and more.

When an entire group is forced to live under constant threat, trust erodes, and everyone feels the consequences. Businesses struggle to find workers, communities grow more divided, U.S.-born children are left stranded or traumatized after immigration enforcement operations, and the entire local economy weakens.

Still, even among the fear and uncertainty that have defined this past year, something else has also taken hold on the East End.

It can be found in the watchful neighbor, the deli owner who keeps a sign of support on their door, the message sent late at night to warn others to be careful. These gestures do not erase the harm, nor do they pretend that the danger has passed, but they speak to a deeper truth. Communities endure not through force or fear, but through care.

As another year begins, the question that remains is not only how much our community has been affected so far, but, more importantly, what kind of place the East End chooses to be and who it chooses to protect. The decisions made by local leaders, law enforcement and residents will have lasting effects in the years to come.

Will we stand with our immigrant neighbors with compassion and humanity, or will we be indifferent, and in some cases even celebrate their suffering?

As Republican lawmakers look ahead to the next year of the Trump administration, some have started to appear more comfortable criticizing the president’s most controversial policies, including his administration’s military escalation in Venezuela.

It’s unclear, however, whether the Republican majorities in both chambers are prepared to take the next step and reclaim the full extent of Congress’ authority this year. Several Republicans told NOTUS that they hope so.

“Everyone ought to be cognizant of the job we have, the role and responsibility we have,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick told reporters in December. “You got to represent your districts. You got to defend and protect the institution and Article I. We have a role to play in this government. It’s an important one.”

After last week’s strike in Venezuela, in which U.S. forces went into the country and captured President Nicolás Maduro and Trump declared the U.S. would indefinitely “run” the country, Fitzpatrick was firm.

“The only country that the United States of America should be ‘running’ is the United States of America,” he said in a statement, adding, “We must all place paramount importance on lawful process and constitutional responsibility.”

Fitzpatrick has been a leader in the insurgent fight to claw back legislative power. In July, he was one of just two House Republicans to oppose a $9 billion rescission package that gutted congressionally approved foreign aid and public broadcasting programs. More recently, he co-led a bill to restore federal workers’ bargaining rights that passed the House with 20 Republican votes.

But for the most part, Fitzpatrick’s fights have been lonely or unsuccessful ones. While a smattering of other House Republicans have called for Congress to provide a check on Trump, they haven’t typically aligned on the same set of issues. Their lack of resistance has only emboldened the president.

On the last legislative business day of 2025, for example, Trump declared that the trustee board of the Kennedy Center would rename the iconic performing arts center the “Trump Kennedy Center.”

The decades-old laws that established the Kennedy Center outright ban changing the building’s name. Two Republican lawmakers, Reps. Bob Onder and Mike Simpson, recently introduced laws to change the name in Trump’s honor, apparently acknowledging the role of Congress in the matter. After all, renaming even a post office requires a formal act of Congress.

As with other moves this year, including his rebranding of the Department of Defense as the “Department of War,” Trump did not see fit to seek congressional approval to rename the historic federal building.

When historians assess the first year of Trump’s second term, the Kennedy Center’s name might amount to little more than a footnote in his relationship with Congress. Under Trump’s direction, the executive branch has circumvented the legislative branch’s authority on appropriations, tariffs, war powers and myriad other issues. While some Republican lawmakers have offered objections, for the most part, the GOP-controlled Congress has been a willing partner in its own subordination.

Next Congress, the dynamics might be different, particularly on tariffs.

“We’ve been diminished, and we should be an equal branch,” Rep. Don Bacon told NOTUS in December.

“We should be directing immigration policy, tariff policy, doing a lot more on foreign affairs,” he added. “I mean, the president, the secretary of state works for him, but we have a role in it. So we should be more directive, I believe.”

After the operation in Venezuela, Bacon supported Maduro’s ouster but raised similar concerns with NOTUS about the role of Congress.

“There was little effort by the administration to inform Congress on mission or intentions,” he said. “I don’t condone that. Are we better off with Maduro gone? Yes, but I don’t defend the lack of coordination with Congress.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who frequently bucks the Trump administration, said in a post on X that she was “hopeful” his capture made the world a “safer place,” but she took issue with the lack of congressional authority.

“Late last year, I voted to proceed to debate on two resolutions that would have terminated the escalation of U.S. military operations against Venezuela absent explicit authorization from Congress,” she said. “I took these votes because I believed the administration failed to provide Congress with the information necessary to fully evaluate the legal basis for these escalating actions. That was true then, and it remains true today.”

While it’s unclear how Congress will proceed on the Venezuela matter, the legislative branch may get the opportunity to assert itself on the tariff issue next year. The House voted in September to block challenges to Trump’s global tariffs through March 2026, when Congress will have to vote on the matter again unless the Supreme Court deems the tariffs unlawful.

But Speaker Mike Johnson did not sound eager to stand in Trump’s way during a recent interview with Fox Business.

“I’m a jealous guardian of Article 1 of the Constitution. I mean, the legislative branch is the most important,” Johnson said. “And I’m in charge of that in the House, but I don’t think the president has overstepped his bounds. I think he’s used that tariff authority wisely. And it’s given him leverage in the strategy on these trade agreements. A lot of good has come out of that. I think the court should give deference to the Article 2 branch. And hopefully it continues.”

Congress will also have the chance to pass full-year appropriations bills in 2026. After Elon Musk and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought slashed billions of dollars in federal programs without congressional approval, Republicans only codified a fraction of the cuts.

One senior House appropriator, Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, did try to add a provision blocking the administration’s so-called “pocket rescissions” to a spending bill. The strategy, masterminded by Vought, involves Trump requesting to withhold congressionally approved money. But the request reaches Congress so late in the fiscal year that the legislative branch doesn’t have enough time to act, and the administration considers the money rescinded.

The White House intervened to stop Díaz-Balart, as NOTUS reported, and the provision never saw the light of day.

But appropriators told NOTUS that they believe a complete, Republican-led appropriations process that clearly directs the White House’s spending is the best way to rein in Trump. After all, most of the government is operating off of a budget passed during the Biden administration, making it easy for White House officials to argue they need to take government spending into their own hands.

“If your aim is to put limits on executive power, the best way to do that is to pass appropriations, in my view,” Appropriations Chair Tom Cole told reporters.

It’s not just moderates and appropriators in the conference noticing the amount of authority Congress has handed to the White House.

When NOTUS asked Rep. Darrell Issa, a leadership ally, about the Trump administration releasing an application process for “gold card visas” without congressional involvement, he blamed the House for not taking up H-1B reform, which, he said, allowed the Biden administration to increase revenues and fees without Congress.

“Is it another potential passing of authority from Congress to the other branch by benign or not-so-benign neglect?” Issa asked. “Yes.”

“But who are we to blame but ourselves?” he continued. “If we’d passed our H1-B reform, we’d have not only more revenue, but we would have a clear statement from Congress. But we don’t have that.”

If and when all else fails, some House Republicans have explored another avenue of reclaiming their power — discharge petitions.

Frustrated by GOP leadership refusing to advance legislation that would compel the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, Rep. Thomas Massie offered a petition to force a vote on the floor. Massie’s months-long campaign was successful, and his bill forced the Department of Justice to release hundreds of thousands of documents.

Massie is not alone in deploying the discharge petition strategy. A handful of Republicans have led or signed on to measures ranging from banning congressional stock trading to extending Affordable Care Act tax subsidies.

That model, Massie told NOTUS, could be used similarly to force leadership to push back on the Trump administration.

“Mike Johnson has given the keys to the car to President Trump, but we wrestled the keys back and took them for a spin and got the Epstein Act passed right,” Massie told NOTUS. “There may be more discharge petitions, as long as the speaker keeps things bottled up and just does whatever the president does and keeps everything else from happening.”

And as 2026 begins, more Republican lawmakers sound open to Massie’s ideas.

In 2022, nearly 90% of undocumented immigrants were of working age (between 16 and 64 years old), compared to 61.3% of the U.S.-born population.
In addition to the labor market, the U.S. economy is suffering from the drop in income.
Contrary to popular belief, undocumented immigrants do pay taxes.

Labor shortages, the closure of successful businesses, the loss of tax revenue from immigrants, and a drop in consumer spending are some of the consequences economists are warning about, which were already being felt in 2025 and are expected to worsen in 2026. Even the new 1% tax on remittances, which went into effect on January 1, could harm the U.S. economy — a bad omen for someone like Trump, who won the election on the promise of improving the financial situation of his voters.

The most immediate effects of law enforcement operations against migrants were felt in the labor market, where arrests, deportations, and fear of going to work due to raids have led to labor shortages. Edward Flores, associate professor of sociology and director of the labor center at the University of California, Merced, demonstrates in a recent study the relationship between increased operations by federal agents and the decline in employment. He uses as examples California, one of the states with the largest immigrant populations in the country, and Washington, D.C., where last summer Trump ordered the deployment of the National Guard to combat a supposed rise in crime that statistics refuted.

In California, private sector employment fell by 2.9% between May and September. There was a recovery in August due to the halt in raids after a judge prohibited racial profiling by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), but employment declined again when law enforcement operations resumed in September.

In the District of Columbia, which Flores uses as a reference, private sector employment fell 3.3% through August, but increased 0.5% in September, coinciding with the end of federal control of the local police.

“The effect of stricter immigration controls on the labor market is comparable to that of the Great Recession and the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic,” Flores states. “The continued tightening of immigration controls suggests the need for policy interventions to mitigate the negative economic consequences.”

In addition to deportations and absenteeism due to fear of raids, the United States has lost some of its appeal to foreigners, who fear being targeted by the crackdown. Furthermore, the administration has put up even more barriers to hiring foreigners by eliminating automatic renewals of temporary work permits (EWPs) in October.

More than 100 business leaders went to the Capitol in October to urge members of Congress to take action to prevent their businesses from going bankrupt due to job losses. The American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC), a bipartisan coalition of more than 1,700 CEOs, business owners, and trade associations in 17 states, led the group. This was not their first such visit; they have been warning for months about the catastrophic consequences of the administration’s immigration policies. According to the coalition, there are eight million unfilled jobs nationwide, which is “driving up prices across the economy, from food to construction materials, and limiting access to everyday products and services for Americans.”

Agriculture, hospitality, and construction

The impact is not the same across all sectors. Fifty-one percent of dairy workers are immigrants, as are 45% of meatpacking workers and 29% of construction workers. A significant portion of these immigrants are undocumented, the target (at least rhetorically) of the Republican president’s deportations. They represent approximately 5% of the U.S. workforce, a figure that skyrockets in some key sectors such as agriculture (45%), construction (14%), and hospitality (7%). Other service sectors, such as nursing homes, are losing staff and facing labor shortages, which jeopardizes the quality of care they provide to the public.

For the first time in more than 50 years of growth, the migrant worker population is declining. According to the Pew Research Center, in January 2025 there were 53.3 million migrants living in the United States, representing about 16% of the country’s population. By June, the country’s migrant population had decreased by more than one million, to 51.9 million, and this decline has likely continued. This is not good news for a market where the age of the workforce is a factor favoring migrants.

In 2022, nearly 90% of undocumented immigrants were of working age (between 16 and 64 years old), compared to 61.3% of the U.S.-born population. Additionally, an estimated 1.1 million undocumented entrepreneurs in the United States typically open small, local businesses such as gas stations, hair salons, dry cleaners, and grocery stores.

In addition to the labor market, the U.S. economy is suffering from the drop in income. Contrary to popular belief, undocumented immigrants do pay taxes. According to the American Immigration Council, undocumented immigrant households paid $46.8 billion in federal taxes and $29.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022. They also contributed $22.6 billion to Social Security and $5.7 billion to Medicare, programs for which they are not eligible.

“In 40 states, they pay state and local income taxes at a higher rate than almost any other taxpayer, sometimes even more than the top 1% of income earners. This is because they are not eligible for most tax credits, and many of these taxpayers do not claim refunds,” notes a report from the National Immigration Forum, an organization that advocates for immigrants.

Lower consumption

According to the same source, the purchasing power of undocumented immigrants amounted to nearly $300 billion in 2023. Deportations represent a considerable cost to U.S. businesses, as they spend money in the country, buying goods and services and contributing to the economy. Economists have estimated that mass deportations would cause a loss of between 4.2% and 6.8% of the U.S. annual GDP, equivalent to between $1.1 trillion and $1.7 trillion in 2022 values. By comparison, U.S. GDP contracted by 4.3% during the 2007-2009 recession.

GoFundMe to pay for food

The deportation campaign has left many families in dire straits, with the primary breadwinner unable to work or having been deported. The GoFundMe platform has revealed that a growing number of families are turning to this method to seek help covering basic needs. The company, which allows anyone to open an account to raise funds, has seen a 20% increase in donations this year.

Another administration initiative that could backfire is the 1% tax on remittances, which went into effect on January 1 and was included in Trump’s budget bill. Experts believe it could incentivize irregular immigration in receiving countries due to the drop in income sent by relatives from the U.S. Furthermore, migrants sending remittances will have less money available for goods and services, and the tax will encourage sending remittances through informal channels, leaving them vulnerable to fraud.",https://imagenes.elpais.com/resizer/v2/EWPQZLBBZZLG5GBZBHEOSFGHH4.jpg?auth=cea0fd54e8ae39777dd13dda5183f041adfc55bc2421a2d0a54ce9478f5d6e00&width=1200,N,,2026-01-05 12:56:57.477193

Regarding birthright citizenship, Frost and Eason’s meticulous archival research now provides them with an opportunity to get on the right side of history.","Chief Justice John Roberts has never had much use for legal scholarship, but a new article about birthright citizenship may well cause him to change his mind. An exhaustive study by two researchers from the University of Virginia significantly undermines the Trump administration’s theory for excluding the children of temporary residents and so-called illegal entrants.

On the first day of his current term, President Trump issued an executive order ostensibly restricting birthright citizenship to children with at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.

Cases challenging that order have now reached the Supreme Court, where the justices will have to decide whether to uphold a 129-year-old precedent, conferring citizenship on all children born in the U.S., with only a few extremely narrow exceptions, or to accept Trump’s contention that the parents’ immigration status can deprive their American-born children of citizenship.

Under the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, “All persons born … in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.”

In 1897, in Wong Kim Ark, the Supreme Court noted that the “main purpose” of the provision was to “establish the citizenship” of African Americans, thus overruling the infamous Dred Scott decision. The limitation of the “subject to jurisdiction” clause, the court held, applied only to the children of foreign diplomats and the children of “alien enemies” born during “hostile occupation.”

The Trump administration’s novel argument is that ”jurisdiction” actually means “primary political allegiance,” which excludes “the children of temporary visitors or illegal aliens,” even if they are fully subject to U.S. law.

It seems virtually certain that the three liberal justices will opt for the time-honored view of birthright citizenship, finding no reason to upset the rule established by Wong Kim Ark.

But what of the six conservative justices, who style themselves originalists and seek the Constitution’s meaning in our “history and tradition”? How will they determine the “original public meaning” of the 14th Amendment’s citizenship clause?

The ratifiers of the 14th Amendment could not have contemplated excluding the children of unlawful entrants, because the concept did not yet exist in 1868. There were no visas or standardized passports, or other official travel documents, and thus no defined legal categories of immigrants. The first general entry restriction — a blatantly racist law that applied only to Asians — was not enacted until 1882.

There were, however, many temporary residents, the other group subject to Trump’s executive order. Naturally, some of them produced children.

As Professor Amanda Frost and her student coauthor, Emily Eason, brilliantly determined, at least a dozen members of Congress in the years 1865 to 1871 may have been the American-born children of temporary residents, whose citizenship would therefore have been “suspect under President Trump’s interpretation” of the 14th Amendment.

And yet, there were no challenges to their qualifications to sit in Congress, for which citizenship is a constitutional requirement.

Borrowing from Sherlock Holmes, Frost and Eason call this an example of a “dog that didn’t bark,” meaning that the absence of expected evidence can render a claim or theory implausible or invalid. In this instance, it cogently suggests that the parental “allegiance” theory of birthright citizenship was not within the original understanding of the 14th Amendment.

To put it another way: If parents’ temporary presence had been a bar to birthright citizenship, why wasn’t that raised regarding any of the dozen or so congressmen who were potentially subject to such a disqualification?

The Supreme Court recently used a similar analysis to interpret the Constitution. The six-justice majority opinion in the 2022 Bruen case, written by arch-originalist Justice Clarence Thomas, cited the absence of certain gun control laws in the early republic to declare a New York gun control statute unconstitutional, because it was not consistent with the “history and tradition” of firearms regulation.

Likewise, the absence of congressional challenges during “the politically fraught Reconstruction era” indicates that there has been no “history and tradition” of considering parents’ immigration status in determining birthright citizenship.

Importantly, both provisions of the Trump executive order — denying citizenship to the children of temporary residents and unlawful entrants — rest on the same legal theory, equating jurisdiction with the parents’ posited political allegiance.

If the theory is wrong regarding the temporary resident provision, it must also be wrong for undocumented entrants.

Roberts and the other conservative justices have previously invoked dubious historical sources to oppose constitutional rights to abortion and same-sex marriage. Regarding birthright citizenship, Frost and Eason’s meticulous archival research now provides them with an opportunity to get on the right side of history.

Trott of Michigan cited Mr. Trump as a factor in his decision to announce his retirement in September 2017.","Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, once a fierce ally of President Trump, is set to depart Congress on Monday as a vocal critic of him and his administration. She used her final weekend in office to lament that Mr. Trump’s military intervention in Venezuela was “what many in MAGA thought they voted to end.”

She is far from the only Republican lawmaker to speak in markedly blunter terms about Mr. Trump just as they were leaving Congress or eyeing the exit.

Lawmakers in both parties, of course, tend to be loath to undercut their leaders; it took a catastrophic debate for top Democrats to turn against former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. And some prominent Republican skeptics of Mr. Trump, including Mitt Romney and Jeff Flake, were able to remain in office, at least for a while.

But Mr. Trump’s grip on the Republican Party is so strong that for many of its lawmakers, even mild criticism frequently goes hand in hand with a retirement announcement.

During Mr. Trump’s first term, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee broke with him over the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, when the president said there were “very fine people on both sides.”

Mr. Corker told reporters that “the president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability nor some of the competence that he needs to demonstrate in order to be successful.” Mr. Trump responded by attacking Mr. Corker on Twitter, and the senator announced the next month that he would not run for re-election.

Representative Susan Brooks

The next month, she was one of four Republicans who voted with Democrats on a resolution to condemn Mr. Trump’s social media posts telling four Democratic congresswomen of color to “go back” to the countries they came from. (In fact, three of the four were born in the United States.)

“I voted to condemn the racially offensive remarks the leader of our country made,” Ms. Brooks wrote on Twitter at the time.

Representative Ryan Costello

Representative Ryan Costello of Pennsylvania announced in March 2018 that he would not run for re-election after a court-ordered redraw of a congressional map made his seat much more difficult to defend.

But he was quick to cite Mr. Trump’s style as a reason he felt compelled to leave. “Whether it’s Stormy Daniels, or passing an omnibus spending bill that the president threatens to veto after promising to sign, it’s very difficult to move forward in a constructive way today,” he told a local newspaper.

During his time in Congress, Representative Dave Reichert of Washington, a moderate Republican, was not a particular fan of Mr. Trump.

However, it was not until Mr. Reichert announced his retirement in September 2017 that he unleashed a more scathing criticism. In an interview with Vice days later, he mentioned Mr. Trump’s “Access Hollywood” comments about groping women and said he would have felt compelled to take action if Mr. Trump had made them in Seattle when Mr. Reichert was the sheriff.

“If the statute of limitations was still in existence, and he made those comments in King County, and you know it happened in King County, that’s a person that I would have to arrest,” Mr. Reichert said.

Representative David A. Trott of Michigan cited Mr. Trump as a factor in his decision to announce his retirement in September 2017. That November, speaking more freely without the restraints of a re-election campaign, Mr. Trott told CNBC, “We have different styles and I sometimes don’t understand some of the things he does and says.”

He added, “It’s a very partisan environment and I think that problem has been exacerbated under President Trump.”

Representative Charles W. Dent

The next April, Mr. Dent introduced a bill aiming to protect the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III from any attempts by Mr. Trump to remove him as he investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election. Days later, Mr. Dent said he would resign early and leave his seat in a matter of weeks, rather than serve out his term.

“The spontaneity and lack of impulse control are areas of concern for lots of members on both sides of the aisle,” Mr. Dent said of Mr. Trump that month. “Disorder, chaos, instability, uncertainty, intemperate statements are not conservative virtues in my opinion.”

Representative Paul Mitchell

Like Ms. Brooks, Representative Paul Mitchell of Michigan criticized Mr. Trump for his tweets in July 2019 about the four Democratic congresswomen of color. Tagging the president on Twitter, Mr. Mitchell told him “we must be better than comments like these. I share the political frustrations with some members of the other party, but these comments are beneath leaders.”

A week later, Mr. Mitchell said he would not run for re-election, telling Politico that the “rhetoric and vitriol” had become overwhelming. In December 2020, he said he was leaving the Republican Party over its refusal to accept Mr. Trump’s election defeat that year. He died of cancer in 2021.

In July 2019, Representative Pete Olson of Texas wrote on Twitter that Mr. Trump’s tweets about the Democratic congresswomen of color were “not reflective of the values of the 1,000,000+ people in Texas 22,” referring to his congressional district.

“I urge our President,” he added, to “immediately disavow his comments.”

Missiles rained down on army bases, airfields and key infrastructure across the capital Caracas and the surrounding region. By 2 a.m., U.S. special forces reached Maduro’s residence and abducted him along with his wife. They were then boarded onto a U.S. warship and flown to the U.S. President Trump posted an image of Maduro bound and blindfolded aboard the USS Iwo Jima. Maduro and his wife were later held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York, to face criminal charges of narcoterrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy and weapons offenses. They are now being flown by helicopter to Lower Manhattan to appear in federal court today. Shortly after the operation, President Trump praised U.S. forces for abducting Maduro and his wife, and promised to run Venezuela and seize the country’s oil. Venezuela has the world’s largest reserves of crude oil.

President Donald Trump: “The oil companies are going to go in. They’re going to spend money. They’re going to — we’re going to take back the oil that, frankly, we should have taken back a long time ago. A lot of money is coming out of the ground.”

After the operation, Venezuela’s Supreme Court officially designated the country’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, as interim president. On Saturday, Rodríguez denounced the abduction of Maduro and his wife and vowed that Venezuela was ready to defend itself against the United States.

Vice President Delcy Rodríguez: “We demand the immediate liberation of President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores — the only president of Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro. … Everything within the Constitution, we learned it from Commander Chávez in the face of adversities, in the face of coup d’état, in the face of oil sabotages. We are ready to defend Venezuela. We are ready to defend our natural resources that must be for national development.”

Soon after her comments, President Trump issued a warning to Rodríguez, telling The Atlantic, “If she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” By Sunday, Rodríguez posted a more conciliatory message on Instagram saying that her government is ready to work with the U.S. She wrote, “We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence.”

Meanwhile, Semafor is reporting that The New York Times and The Washington Post knew of the secret U.S. raid on Venezuela before it was scheduled to begin Friday night, but held off on publishing the story to avoid endangering U.S. troops. A senior Venezuelan official speaking to The New York Times said that at least 80 people, including civilians and soldiers, were killed in the U.S. attack on Saturday. The Cuban government said 32 of its citizens had been killed, including military and intelligence personnel. This is Jonatan Mallora, whose home was damaged by U.S. airstrikes.

Jonatan Mallora: “I don’t agree with this, no matter what happened, whatever it was. Look at everything that happened there, inside, over on that side, too, and in the back, as well, all of that. We have to be aware. We have to have principles. Now I’m hoping for a quick response from the government to help my family, my children, because they nearly killed my kids here. You know, my kids were almost killed. Up there, there were families, too. Two elderly women died because of these acts that never should have happened, because we aren’t to blame for what happens in this world. They have their problems, and we have ours. Now look at all this chaos. I don’t agree with this, gentlemen.”

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has congratulated President Trump on what he called a “perfect operation” in Venezuela. He spoke Sunday from an Israeli Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu: “Regarding Venezuela, I want to express the entire government’s support for the determined decision and action of the United States to restore freedom and justice to that part of the world, as well. I must say that across Latin America right now we are seeing a transformation in several countries that are returning to the American axis and, not surprisingly, also to a connection with the state of Israel. We welcome this. We congratulate President Trump on his decision. We also salute the American military forces who carried out a perfect operation.”

Netanyahu’s praise for the U.S. assault on Venezuela came as Israeli forces occupying the Gaza Strip shot and killed at least three Palestinians in separate attacks over the weekend. Among the dead were a fisherman and a 15-year-old boy. Their deaths bring the number of Palestinians killed by Israel in Gaza since the October 10 ceasefire was declared to 414, with more than 1,100 injured.

The power has come into force days after the prime minister suffered a blow when new figures showed 41,472 people arrived in the UK on a small boat last year – the second-highest number on record.

On Sunday, the Labour leader announced he had stepped up his bid to ease the crisis – and had ordered the Home Office to close asylum hotels before the current 2029 deadline, although he would not be drawn on a new date.

Officers will begin taking electronic devices from people at Manston processing centre in Kent, to download data they believe will help them gather intelligence on people smugglers.

The new powers for law enforcement agencies are designed to speed up investigations and come after Labour’s new Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Act became law in December.

Border security minister Alex Norris said: “We promised to restore order and control to our borders which means taking on the people smuggling networks behind this deadly trade.

“That is exactly why we are implementing robust new laws with powerful offences to intercept, disrupt and dismantle these vile gangs faster than ever before and cut off their supply chains.

“These operational measures sit alongside sweeping reforms to the system, to make it less attractive for migrants to come here illegally and remove and deport people faster.”

Last week, official 2025 figures were 13 per cent higher than the numbers recorded in 2024, when 36,816 migrants made the perilous journey, and 41 per cent higher than 2023's total of 29,437. It was also just 9 per cent below the all-time high of 45,774 in 2022.

On Sunday, Sir Keir said Britons would start to see ‘evidence’ of asylum hotel closures in the coming months.

Their use was highlighted this summer with a wave of protests centred around the Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, after an asylum seeker who had arrived by small boat in the UK was temporarily housed and later charged, jailed and deported for sexually assaulting a woman and a 14-year-old girl.

The prime minister said he was “determined” to close the hotels but could not give a date when that might happen.

He told the BBC’s Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme: “I’ve said to the system, to the relevant departments, I want to see that brought forward as soon as possible, but no longer the end of parliament. Bring it forward.

“I want us to close hotels. I think over coming months you’ll see evidence of that.”

Sir Keir said he did not want to “set a date” until “we’re absolutely sure that we can meet that date”.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused ministers of “cosmetic tweaks” and said there was no deterrent to those crossing the Channel, as he reiterated his party’s call for the UK to quit the European Convention on Human Rights.

The government’s new law also introduces new criminal offences, such as up to 14 years in jail for storing or supplying boat engines to bring migrants to the UK via the English Channel smuggling route.

Smugglers downloading maps on where to depart on small boats or researching the best places to buy equipment for the dinghies could also face up to five years in prison.

Of these, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration in 20 and against it four times.","Courtly Observations is a recurring series by Erwin Chemerinsky that focuses on what the Supreme Court’s decisions will mean for the law, for lawyers and lower courts, and for people’s lives.

At the start of the new year, it is impossible to talk about the Supreme Court in 2025, or begin 2026, without focusing on the justices’ handling of matters concerning the Trump administration. No president in history has challenged constitutional limits or sought to increase presidential power in the way that President Donald Trump has in this term in office.

Not surprisingly, hundreds of lawsuits – 358 up until the end of December – were brought challenging Trump’s actions in 2025, and already some came to the Supreme Court. Never before has the court been asked to rule on the legality of so many presidential actions in such a short period of time.

During the first year of this Trump presidency, the Supreme Court overwhelmingly sided with the Trump administration. The court ruled in favor of the Trump administration in the one case in 2025 decided after briefing and oral argument: Trump v. CASA. The court, in a 6-3 decision, held that federal district courts cannot issue nationwide injunctions. Although the court did not declare nationwide injunctions unconstitutional as the solicitor general urged, it held that federal district courts lack the statutory authority to issue such relief. This was a major victory for the Trump administration, and for future presidents, in that it will make it much harder for federal courts to stop unconstitutional or illegal actions, at least through seeking nationwide injunctions.

By my count, based on the SCOTUSblog website, there were at least 24 other rulings in 2025 on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket involving Trump administration actions. Of these, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Trump administration in 20 and against it four times.

Only one of these 24 emergency docket cases was unanimous: the court’s recent ruling in Margolin v. National Association of Immigration Judges, a challenge to a policy limiting speech by immigration judges. The court did not grant the solicitor general’s request for a stay of the United States Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit’s order, sending the matter back to the district court for additional fact-finding. This was likely the only instance in which Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito voted against the Trump administration on the emergency docket.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson voted against the Trump administration in every one of the 24 cases. Justice Sonia Sotomayor did so in 22. Only Jackson dissented in Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees, in which the court stayed a district court’s injunction barring the executive branch from formulating and implementing plans to initiate large-scale reductions of the federal workforce. Also, only Jackson voted no in Noem v. National TPS Alliance in May, which involved the Trump administration’s effort to end the Temporary Protected Status for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals.

Justice Elena Kagan voted against the Trump administration in 21 of the cases. She did not join Sotomayor and Jackson in dissent in Noem v. Doe, in which the court stayed a district court’s holding that the Secretary of Homeland Security lacked the authority to revoke the categorical grant of parole to 532,000 non-citizens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. In Department of Homeland Security v. D.V.D., Kagan initially joined Sotomayor and Jackson in dissenting from the court’s decision to stay a district court’s order preventing the deportation of individuals from several countries to South Sudan. But when the matter came back to the Supreme Court a few weeks later, only Sotomayor and Jackson dissented.

The Supreme Court’s many rulings in favor of the Trump administration on the emergency docket have also included orders by the justices that have paused lower court orders stopping the firing of agency officials, ordering the reinstatement of terminated federal grants, keeping the military from excluding transgender individuals, forbidding deportations to South Sudan of individuals lacking any contact with that country, preventing ICE agents from stopping people without reasonable suspicion based on certain factors, and keeping the State Department from requiring that passports list the holder’s birth sex rather than gender identity.

There were only three other instances, besides Margolin v. National Association of Immigration Judges, in which the Trump administration lost in the Supreme Court in emergency docket rulings in 2025. In one area – challenges to the termination of federal funding – the Trump administration initially lost, but it subsequently prevailed in two cases on the emergency docket. Notably, this is the one place where Chief Justice John Roberts joined with the liberal justices in dissent.

The Trump administration has cut off billions of dollars of federal funding appropriated by federal statutes. In the initial case to come to the court, Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the court, by a vote of 5-4, turned down the Trump administration’s request to stay a district court order requiring the executive branch to pay nearly $2 billion in reimbursements to nonprofits and businesses that receive federal foreign assistance. Alito wrote a vehement dissent, joined by Thomas, Justice Neil Gorsuch, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

A month later, on April 4, in Department of Education v. California, the court, again by a vote of 5-4, stayed a federal district court’s temporary restraining order preventing the termination of $65 million of teacher training grants. In a short, unsigned opinion, the court said that federal grants are like contracts and claims for breach of contract against the federal government must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. The court also expressed concern that the federal government might not be able to recover the funds if it ultimately prevailed in the litigation. Kagan wrote a dissent, as did Jackson, who was joined by Sotomayor. Although Roberts did not join either dissenting opinion, he indicated that he would deny the Trump administration’s application for a stay.

On Aug. 21, the court came to a similar conclusion, by the same margin, in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association. A federal district court found that the termination of grants by the NIH was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The Supreme Court, by a vote of 5-4, stayed this order, again stressing that the matter needed to be filed in the Court of Federal Claims and expressing concern with whether the federal government could later recoup the money.

Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion chastising the district court for not following the court’s ruling in Department of Education v. California. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote the pivotal opinion saying that the challenge to the termination of the grants had to go to the Court of Federal Claims, but the challenge to the policy directives to cut off funding could be heard in the federal district court. Jackson wrote a blistering dissent that invoked the cartoon “Calvin and Hobbes”: “This is Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist. Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.” Roberts again joined the three liberal justices in dissent, though he did not join Jackson’s opinion.

The two other cases on the emergency docket in which the Trump administration lost were both significant. In A.A.R.P. v. Trump, the court, in an apparent 7-2 vote, stopped the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport individuals from Venezuela to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The Alien Enemies Act allows summary deportations of “natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of [a] hostile nation or government” over the age of 14 who are not naturalized when the United States is in a declared war or faces imminent invasion from that nation. Before 2025, the Act had been invoked only three times in U.S. history: the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. On remand, a divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the requirements of the Alien Enemies Act have not been met and it cannot be used to deport individuals.

And on Dec. 23, in Trump v. Illinois, the Supreme Court ruled, in a 6-3 vote, that Trump lacked the authority to federalize the National Guard in Illinois. The majority was comprised of Roberts, Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett, and Jackson. Kavanaugh concurred in the judgment, while Alito wrote a dissent joined by Thomas, and Gorsuch wrote a separate dissent.

The Supreme Court interpreted two federal statutes in coming to this conclusion. One law, 10 U.S.C. § 12406(3), empowers the president to federalize members of a state’s National Guard if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.” The Supreme Court said that this means that a president can federalize a state’s guard only if it can be shown that the armed forces of the United States cannot provide adequate protection.

This, in itself, is obviously a major limit on the ability of the president to federalize National Guard troops. But the Supreme Court went even further. It said that the president could only federalize a state’s guard in a situation in which the U.S. military legally could be used but would be insufficient. This is because the Posse Comitatus Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1385, adopted in 1878, prohibits the United States military from being used for domestic law enforcement except in very limited circumstances, such as when there is an insurrection in a state.

In other words, the Supreme Court said that a president can federalize the National Guard only in the rare circumstances in which the Posse Comitatus Act allows the military to be used for domestic law enforcement and only then if the United States military would be inadequate. The court declared: “[B]efore the President can federalize the Guard under §12406(3), he likely must have statutory or constitutional authority to execute the laws with the regular military and must be ‘unable’ with those forces to perform that function.”

This is an enormously important ruling, especially because Trump had indicated a desire to deploy the National Guard in cities across the country. It also is important, coming at the end of a year in which Trump prevailed in almost every matter in the Supreme Court, in showing that at least occasionally a majority of the justices will say no.

This year, the court will decide cases on the merits docket about the president’s power to remove agency heads, the legality of Trump’s tariffs, and the constitutionality of his executive order on birthright citizenship. There are sure to be many more matters on the emergency docket and likely others on the merits docket, as well.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-1258551194.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 11:56:54.758995

""The deportation rate rose from 19 percent in 2023 to 27 percent in the first three quarters of 2025,"" Brunner highlighted, adding, however, that this increase was ""still far from sufficient"" to keep net migration in the EU within manageable rates.

""We must combat illegal migration on all fronts,"" Brunner said, explaining that this requires consistency in upholding and increasing deportation rates of people who have lost the right to remain in the EU.

He added that the EU also had to do more to move towards ""swiftly rejecting people with little prospect of receiving asylum.""

Both aspects of migration management, he stressed, require close cooperation with third countries.

Focus on deterring would-be migrants through policy

Furthermore, Brunner also highlighted the role that third-country partnerships play in ensuring that people do not embark on dangerous migrations in the first place, emphasizing the importance of deterring prospective migrants.

Brunner's remarks are backed up by recent legal changes to the way the EU handles migration: Its member states agreed on several far-reaching measures to limit migration and speed up returns last month in Brussels as part of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) that will go into effect throughout the EU starting in June 2026.

As part of those agreements, they thrashed out terms to increase the pressure on rejected asylum seekers to go back home while also streamlining deportation procedures in general.

To this end, they also agreed that return hubs can and will be set up in third countries located outside the EU — without highlighting thus far which particular countries the bloc is eyeing as potential partners in this endeavor.

Some EU member states like Denmark, however, have expressed that they do not find the scope of these agreements and the timeline of their implementation entirely sufficient.

Return hubs: Exporting migration management to outside the EU

Such return hubs outside the EU will serve multiple purposes: One main purpose of a third country hub would be to intercept migrants before they reach the EU and take them to these hubs to process their cases.

Those with legitimate asylum claims could be distributed among EU member states for protection, while those whose applications are rejected could be returned to their home countries without being admitted into the European Union.

A solidarity mechanism for member states that do not wish to take in more asylum seekers to opt out by paying 20,000 euros per rejected migrant will also be part of that plan.

In addition to that, there are also numerous cases of asylum seekers already in the EU, whose asylum claims are rejected, and these failed asylum seekers are therefore technically due to be deported back to their home countries; however, in the absence of return agreements with certain nations, they cannot be sent back.

A return hub could serve as a place to house them alternatively for an indefinite amount of time, with hopes of encouraging them to voluntarily return to their country of origin from there.

Above all, these return hubs are meant to discourage people from embarking on migration routes in the first place and therefore destroying the business model of smugglers.

European nations join calls to alter ECHR to enable sweeping asylum restrictions -- but how?

Reinterpreting — not changing — ECHR

Return hubs in third countries have long been floated as a possible tool for EU migration management; however, various proposals and plans were rejected or stymied under previous governments.

With a move to the right across various EU member states, the idea of third-country return hubs has gained momentum in the past year and was eventually signed into law in December.

Among the nations at the forefront of pushing the idea of such return hubs are Italy — which has opened its own hubs in Albania, albeit under ongoing legal problems with fully implementing the use of these facilities — and Denmark.

Both countries are at the forefront of pushing for a reinterpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in the context of migration.

Giving into pressure amid the new EU agreements signed last month, a majority of the signatories to the convention endorsed the idea of allowing a different and somewhat more flexible interpretation — and implementation — of the ECHR in the migration context; however, any changes will still have to go through the court of the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR).

All 27 EU member states are signatories to the ECHR, as are 19 other states.

Denmark willing to overstep convention

Despite a joint backing for a reformed interpretation of the ECHR, the Danish government has announced it will not wait for the court to change its practices.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, in her New Year's Address, announced a ""comprehensive reform on deportation"" including harsher methods to deport foreign nationals who receive criminal convictions, regardless of their connection to Denmark. This could mean Denmark violating the existing interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

""Instead of waiting several years, (…) we are taking the lead and implementing legislation before the summer,"" she announced.

Denmark's Minister for Integration, Rasmus Stoklund, acknowledged that Denmark could run a ""procedural risk"" of breaching international law by not waiting for the court.

Denmark: Reforms before elections

Frederiksen said that her government's deportation reform will see ""even more foreign criminals … deported from Denmark,"" explaining that those who are sentenced to at least one year in prison — regardless of their ties to Denmark — should face deportation.

""Thanks to a strict Danish immigration policy – and our willingness to push the boundaries of convention – we are already deporting many foreign criminals,"" she said in her last New Year's speech as prime minister of the current coalition government; in November, the Nordic nation is expected to go to the polls amid a recent dip in support for her party.

Frederiksen went as far as identifying quite specific boundaries of when people with a foreign background should — or shouldn't — be welcome in the Scandinavian nation; the Danish prime minister said her country would refuse to embrace to those who came from a ""culture of domination.""

Without making direct references to any particular group, the comment is seen as a rejection of certain groups of Muslims living in Denmark, whose cultural and tribal structures are widely seen as conflicting with Danish values, i.e. those with traditional, conservative, hierarchical and male-dominant structures, which often are found to be in disregard of women's and minority rights.",https://scd.infomigrants.net/media/resize/my_image_small/58235db716d62b39905cd2facb71828fb089da5d.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 09:57:19.156762

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

U.S. forces killed at least 80 people, including civilians, during the military operation to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in Caracas on Saturday, according to a senior Venezuelan official. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said yesterday that 32 Cuban military and intelligence personnel were killed in the U.S. attacks. According to two U.S. officials, around 6 U.S. soldiers were injured. Isabela Espadas Barros Leal and Genevieve Glatsky report for the New York Times; Jack Nicas reports for the New York Times.

President Trump yesterday evening reiterated that the United States was now “in charge” of Venezuela, following the capture of Maduro on Saturday morning. When asked by reporters what he needed from the current acting leader of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, Trump said, “We need total access. We need access to the oil and to other things in their country that allow us to rebuild their country.” Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier on Sunday that the Trump administration would keep a military quarantine in place on the country’s oil exports to exert leverage on the new leadership there. Rubio said in an interview that people were “fixating” on Trump’s declaration on Saturday that the U.S government would run Venezuela, adding “it’s not running – it’s running policy, policy with regards to this.” Edward Wong reports for the New York Times.

“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development,” Rodríguez said yesterday on social media, having earlier condemned the U.S. attack on Saturday as an illegal grab for the country’s national resources. Rodríguez added, “President Donald Trump, our peoples and our region deserve peace and dialogue, not war.” Trump told The Atlantic Sunday, “If [Rodríguez] doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” as he raised the possibility of another strike. Reuters reports; Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, are scheduled to appear today before a federal judge in New York. Trump administration officials have portrayed Maduro’s capture as a law-enforcement action to hold Maduro accountable for criminal charges filed in 2020, accusing him of narco-terrorism conspiracy. In a new indictment, unsealed on Saturday, prosecutors allege that Maduro personally oversaw a state-sponsored cocaine trafficking network that partnered with some of the world’s most prolific drug trafficking groups. Jack Queen reports for Reuters.

Trump said on Saturday morning that he fully expects U.S. oil companies to be “very strongly involved” in Venezuela’s oil industry. Administration officials have told oil executives in recent weeks that if they want compensation for their seized property, then they must be prepared to go back into Venezuela and invest heavily in its petroleum industry, two sources told POLITICO. “They’re saying, ‘you gotta go in if you want to play and get reimbursed,’” said one industry official familiar with the conversations, adding that the offer has been on the table for the last 10 days. Ben Lefebvre, Zack Colman, and James Bikales report; Ben Geman reports for Axios

Trump administration officials are set to provide a briefing this afternoon on the military operation to capture Maduro to the Gang of Eight, as well as Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senate Armed Services Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Armed Services Committee, according to an official briefed on the plans. When asked why he had not sought Congressional authorization for the attack, Trump said on Saturday that he did not trust its members to keep the plans confidential. Annie Karni reports for the New York Times.

The U.N. Security Council is due to meet today following the U.S. attack on Venezuela. Colombia, backed by Russia and China, requested the meeting of the 15-member council, diplomats said. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

“Cuba looks like it’s ready to fall,” and “Colombia is very sick too,” Trump said yesterday on board Air Force One. Trump rejected the possibility that his administration might use U.S. forces to hasten the Cuban government’s demise, explaining that Venezuela was Cuba’s main economic backer. Trump also added, “We need Greenland from a national security standpoint…The EU needs us to have Greenland.” Earlier on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, “It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the US needing to take over Greenland. The US has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Danish kingdom.” Sophia Cai reports for POLITICO; Rebecca Falconer reports for Axios.

“If Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go,” Trump posted on social media on Friday. A rights group said yesterday that at least 16 people have been killed in last week’s protests. Deaths and arrests have been reported by both state media and rights groups, though the figures differ. Barak Ravid reports for Axios; Elwely Elwelly reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR – INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

Trump said yesterday that U.S officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week. Darlene Superville and Aamer Madhani report for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

Israeli forces yesterday shot and killed three Palestinians in separate incidents in Khan Younis, Gaza, according to local health authorities. Medics reported that those killed included a 15-year-old boy, a fisherman on the Palestinian side of the Yellow Line, and a third man who was shot east of Khan Younis in an area under Israeli control. Nidal al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s revocation of licences for 37 international non-governmental organizations working in Gaza and called for the measure to be reversed, according to a statement on Friday. “[Israel’s] announcement comes on top of earlier restrictions that have already delayed critical food, medical, hygiene and shelter supplies from entering Gaza,” the statement added. Daphne Psaledakis reports for Reuters.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Saudi-backed Yemeni government forces recaptured the port city of Mukalla and much of Hadramout over the weekend. The city had been seized last month by the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council. Two residents of the Hadramout towns of al-Qatn and Seiyun told AP News that the STC had withdrawn from military camps. Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry said on Saturday that it will host a conference in Riyadh to bring together all southern factions in Yemen “to discuss just solutions to the southern cause.” Fatma Khaled reports; Saeed Al-Batati and Vivian Nereim report for the New York Times.

British and French war planes over the weekend bombed an underground facility in Syria that was used by Islamic State militants to store weapons, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. Malaika Kanaaneh Tapper and Jim Pickard report for the Financial Times.

Senior Syrian and Israeli officials will meet today in Paris to resume negotiations on a new security agreement, according to an Israeli official and another source. The talks are expected to take place over two days, with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shaibani participating opposite a new group of Israeli negotiators. The resumption of talks is the direct result of a request from President Trump to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met last Monday in Mar-a-Lago, according to the source. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Chinese cyberattacks on Taiwan’s key infrastructure rose 6% in 2025 from the previous year to an average of 2.63 million attacks a day, according to a report published by Taiwan’s National Security Bureau yesterday. The report said China’s “cyber army” timed operations to coincide with military and political coercion. For instance, China launched 40 “joint combat readiness patrols” by sending military planes and ships close to Taiwan, and cyberattacks escalated on 23 of those occasions. Yimou Lee reports for Reuters.

Unidentified gunmen on Saturday evening killed at least 30 people and abducted several others in attacks on two neighbouring villages in Nigeria, a Nigerian government official said yesterday. Saikou Jammeh, Ismail Alfa, and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

ICE officers are using Mobile Fortify, a facial recognition app, to speed up arrests by allowing officers to identify individuals and their immigration status by taking a picture, according to U.S. officials. The app has access to several government criminal databases. The data includes previous encounters with immigration officials, such as if an immigrant was arrested at the southern border or entered at a legal entry point, officials said. Sources said it also taps into publicly available sources, including social media posts. A spokesperson for the Homeland Security Department denied this. Michelle Hackman, Arian Campo-Flores, and Hannah Critchfield report for the Wall Street Journal.

Hannah C. Dugan, a Wisconsin state judge convicted of obstructing federal agents attempting to arrest an undocumented migrant, resigned her position on Saturday. Julie Bosman reports for the New York Times.

U.S DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The FBI said on Friday that it disrupted a plan by 18-year-old Christian Sturdivant, inspired by the Islamic State, to attack a grocery store and fast-food restaurants in North Carolina. In recent weeks, the FBI has arrested a number of other individuals alleged to have been plotting terrorist attacks on or around New Year’s Eve. Many of the investigations, including the one that led to charges against Sturdivant, involved undercover agents or officers offering encouragement and, in some cases, suggestions on carrying out the attacks.

Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“On the Docket”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“The One First ‘Long Read’”); and some Court-related trivia.

And for those who want to start 2026 with a bang, you might also consider whether a gift subscription would be a welcome present (or, at least, an amusing gag) for a friend or family member:

Not surprisingly, there was exactly one newsworthy development out of the Supreme Court last week—the clockwork release, at 6 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, of the Chief Justice’s “Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary.” I’ve written before about both the history of this tradition and how Chief Justice Roberts has meaningfully departed from the practice of his two immediate predecessors by no longer asking Congress for … anything. Indeed, the Roberts reports have typically been remarkable only for their unremarkability, elevating to a fine art pablum packaged as historical anecdotes.

Against that backdrop, the 2025 year-end report is fascinating for its subtleties. Reading between the lines, one can find the Chief Justice of the United States standing up for immigrants; extolling the continuing aspirations of the Declaration of Independence; and reiterating the importance of judicial independence—three messages that are certainly welcome as we look ahead to the second year of the second Trump administration. The problem, though, is that one has to read between the lines to find those takeaways. Given the year that just transpired—not just the substantive behavior of the executive branch but its unprecedented hostility toward, threats against, and defiance of federal judges—this would’ve been a golden opportunity for Chief Justice Roberts to make the kind of statement that might’ve resonated across the political/ideological spectrum. By opting for subtlety, it seems worth asking exactly who the Chief Justice views as his audience these days. Not only am I increasingly unsure of the answer, but, far more importantly, I wonder if he might be, too.

More on that in a moment.

On the Docket

There were no formal rulings out of the full Court last week. Besides the Chief Justice’s year-end report, the only noteworthy action was the release, on Friday, of the oral argument calendar for February—a surprisingly light session with only seven arguments across six days, only one of which (the Hemani Second Amendment dispute) is likely to be of broader significance to non-lawyers.

The justices are next set to meet in person this Friday, when they are scheduled both for their regular Conference and for what the Supreme Court’s website calls a “non-argument session” on the bench. Those sessions can sometimes include the handing down of decisions in argued cases, but they don’t have to; no opinions came down during such a session on November 21. We’ll know more later this week, either because the Court will announce that it is expecting to hand down opinions on Friday—or because it won’t. The next regular Order List is expected next Monday at 9:30 ET, after which the Court will begin the January 2026 argument session.

Finally, on a more personal note, I’ve posted to SSRN a revised version of my attempt to look holistically at the Court’s behavior on Trump-related emergency applications during the October 2024 Term. You can download the essay, which is forthcoming in the Supreme Court Review, for free at this link. And although it’s not directly Supreme Court-related, I’ll be one of the witnesses this Wednesday afternoon at 2:30 ET, when the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Federal Courts, Oversight, Agency Action, and Federal Rights is set to hold a (twice-postponed) hearing on “Impeachment: Holding Rogue Judges Accountable.” Something tells me there will be some disagreements.

The One First “Long Read”:

An Audience of … One?

The foil for Chief Justice Roberts’s 2025 year-end report is an obvious one: this year’s 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. But the way he decided to introduce his protagonist (Thomas Paine) is quietly revealing: “Two hundred fifty years ago this week, a recent immigrant to Britain’s North American colonies put the finishing touches on a manuscript in which he hoped to express ‘plain truths’ about his newly adopted home.” As Roberts puts it, Paine’s (anonymous) January 1776 publication of “Common Sense” “electrified the country and played a crucial role in stimulating a vote for independence in the Second Continental Congress six months later.” (While reading it, I could almost hear the line from Hamilton: “immigrants—we get the job done.”)

Briefly recapping the history of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence and the provenance of its signers, Roberts pointed to that document as one that “enunciated the American creed, a national mission statement, even though it quite obviously captured an ideal rather than a reality, given that the vast majority of the 56 signers of the Declaration (even Franklin) enslaved other humans at some point in their lives.” As Roberts notes, many of the Declaration’s signers were lawyers and future judges—a subtle but unmistakable nod to the role of the rule of law in promoting that “American creed.”

But Roberts didn’t stop there. Connecting the Declaration to the Constitution that followed a little more than a decade later, the Chief Justice pivoted to the role of the courts, specifically, in achieving the Declaration’s aspirations, noting that “[t]he connection between these two foundational documents could not be clearer when it comes to the judicial branch,” and describing the Constitution’s enshrinment of an independent judiciary as an “arrangement, now in place for 236 years, [that] has served the country well.”

Extolling the virtues of judicial independence is not a new theme for the Chief Justice’s year-end report, but it seems like no accident here; more than any specific substantive point, the year-end report seems centered on defending for the basic structure of our government—and the role of the courts in that structure—closing with a quote from, of all people, President Calvin Coolidge, in marking the 150th anniversary of the Declaration in 1926:

“Amid all the clash of conflicting interests, amid all the welter of partisan politics, every American can turn for solace and consolation to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States with the assurance and confidence that those two great charters of freedom and justice remain firm and unshaken.” True then; true now.

Thus, if one looks hard enough, one can find in these seven pages an outwardly reassuring message from the Chief Justice.

The problem is … everything else that’s happened over the last 12 months. Whatever one thinks about the Trump administration, the following six points are, in my view, objectively undeniable:

The Trump administration has pushed the substantive boundaries of executive power under both statutes and the Constitution to a degree unmatched by any of its predecessors;

Congress has sat entirely on the sidelines while that’s happened, even in contexts in which the executive branch has usurped legislative power;

We’ve seen an unprecedented number of rulings from federal district courts and courts of appeals (including judges from across the ideological spectrum) blocking the Trump administration’s actions—many of which have raised alarm bells about the executive branch’s substantive and litigation behavior;

We’ve seen an unprecedented degree of hostility to those rulings from the executive branch—including (a) calls for the impeachment of judges who have ruled against the government; (b) the filing by the Attorney General of frivolous misconduct complaints against some of those judges; (c) the Deputy Attorney General referring to a “war” between the executive branch and the federal courts; (d) the White House Deputy Chief of Staff referring to judges who rule against the administration as being part of a “judicial insurrection; and (e) multiple cases in which the executive branch has openly defied coercive court orders instead of (or while) appealing them;

That hostility has manifested in a sharp rise in threats against the physical safety of federal judges—and not just through the insidious practice of “pizza doxxing” (where pizzas in the name of the murdered son of New Jersey federal district judge Esther Salas are regularly being delivered to the unlisted home addresses of myriad federal judges). Indeed, as a coalition of retired federal judges has noted, “The United States Marshals Service and other law enforcement agencies have determined that many of these threats have posed a credible danger to the judges, their loved ones, and their court staff”; and

While all of this has been happening, the Supreme Court has largely enabled the Trump administration’s behavior in the small (and carefully self-selected) subset of cases the Justice Department has taken up—not just rewarding the executive branch’s behavior but, in several cases, chastising those same lower courts for failing to divine the justices’ intent from un- (or thinly) explained rulings.

In other words, it seems fair to describe 2025 as a year of unprecedented assaults on the very constitutional structure and judicial independence the Chief Justice appears to be so invested in publicly defending. Against that backdrop, the fact that his year-end report doesn’t even indirectly allude to any of those assaults (unlike last year’s, which was at least elliptically critical of some elected officials) is, frankly, inexcusable. However much praise the Chief Justice deserved for his rare public statement last March pushing back against President Trump’s calls for impeachment of federal judges, the reality is that he has said literally nothing on that subject (or any related topic) since. Here was a golden opportunity for the Chief Justice to at least return to that theme. Instead, as someone who doesn’t do anything by accident, he passed.

All of this brings us back to the question with which I started the post: Who does the Chief Justice view as his audience? It certainly isn’t the Court’s critics—for whom the paeans to the role of immigrants in our Founding story and the indirect defense of judicial independence will be far too subtle and un-specific to be remotely mollifying. And it certainly isn’t the Trump administration (or Congress, for that matter), who somehow avoided even indirect criticism notwithstanding the events of the past 12 months. Nor is it Roberts’s colleagues in the federal judiciary—who won’t find a single word in the report that responds to their mounting (and increasingly public) frustration with the Supreme Court’s behavior.

That leaves as the potential audience (besides the Chief Justice himself) folks who support the current Supreme Court but not the Trump administration—a small cohort of conservative lawyers who might view themselves as “never Trumpers,” but who have been just as reticent to speak out against the alarming patterns described above as the Chief Justice has been. For them, reminding everyone that Thomas Paine was an immigrant and that our country was founded entirely on the premise that ours is a government of laws, and not of men, may be reassuring. But as the calendar turns to 2026, and against the backdrop of everything that has happened (and is happening), that degree of subtletly is, and will be, lost on everyone else.

SCOTUS Trivia: Chief Justice Rehnquist’s 1997 Report

The Supreme Court’s website, which really is a wonderful resource for so many things, includes digital copies of the Chief Justice’s year-end report for every year dating back to 2000. Alas, it doesn’t have Chief Justice Rehnquist’s 1997 year-end report—which provides a useful illustration of how the year-end report could be used to send a message that other government institutions receive.

In that report, Rehnquist took on the growing problem of judicial vacancies—which was exacerbated by the refusal of the Republican-controlled Senate to vote up or down on many of President Clinton’s nominees. As the New York Times reported on January 1, 1998, Rehnquist wrote that the “vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice.” And although he noted that delays by President Clinton in sending nominations to the Senate had contributed to the problem, his main criticism fell on the Senate itself. “The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee,” Rehnquist wrote, “but after the necessary time for inquiry, it should vote him up or vote him down.” To let nominees languish, Rehnquist concluded, would imperil the federal judiciary’s ability to operate.

Rehnquist’s critiques—and the significance of a Republican-appointed Chief Justice criticizing Senate Republicans—had their desired effect; although President Clinton still struggled to get all of his judicial nominees through the Senate, the Rehnquist report helped pressure the Senate into at least moving a bit more formally on those nominations that were submitted. And it remains today a powerful example of how the year-end report, for all of its shortcomings, can be an effective opportunity for the Chief Justice to put himself (and the judiciary) above partisan politics. He just has to want to do so.

TRANSCRIPTION:

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU, and we don't need to tell you--federal immigration policy has impacted a great number of people around the country and right here in our community. I'm David Fair, and welcome to the first Washtenaw United conversation of 2026. Washtenaw United--it's our weekly exploration of equity and opportunity in our community. And I can tell you there are a good number of people who feel opportunity is being taken away. Our first guest of the New Year has been working these issues in an up-close and personal way. Christine Sauve is policy engagement and communications manager at the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. And thank you for making time for us today! And Happy New Year, Christine!

Christine Sauve: Happy New Year! Thanks for having me!

David Fair: In the first 11 months of the second Trump presidency, more than 1.6 million immigrants have lost their legal status in the United States. NPR reported that's a number larger than the entire population of Philadelphia. Could you have imagined that, in this day and age, that this is where we would find ourselves?

Christine Sauve: You know, after the results of the 2024 election were clear, we knew that 2025 would be hard. I would say, even though we knew it would be challenging, experiencing those challenges and seeing families affected is another matter. So, again, expecting some of the policies that have happened still doesn't minimize the hurt and the suffering.

David Fair: For those unfamiliar with the work of the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, would you give us a brief synopsis of the services your organization provides?

Christine Sauve: Yeah. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is a legal resource center for low-income immigrants across the state. We provide immigration legal services for free, and we serve unaccompanied children in federal custody, as well as those released. We serve farm workers, people applying for asylum or naturalization. We also serve folks who are in detention or facing deportation.

David Fair: And that has become more difficult to do. Funding is at a premium. The number of people who are requiring assistance has gone up. How has federal government cutting resources impacted your ability to help as many as you can?

Christine Sauve: Yes. So, we have seen some very serious funding cuts at the same time that the need for services has just skyrocketed. So, MIRC was affected by some of the Trump Administration's efforts to eliminate funding for long-standing, legal orientation programs. For example, we ran a help desk in Detroit's immigration court. That program was ended. The administration did attempt to end funding for unaccompanied children's legal services. Our country had historically said, ""We should provide lawyers for children to face their cases in court."" Thankfully, due to litigation, most of that funding has been restored, but the future looks shaky. And this has caused great instability for organizations like ours. At the same time, our call volume is way up. We've received over 5,000 calls the past year. Our calls from detention are up threefold. And people are calling us for good reason, because having a lawyer really makes a difference in immigration court. 62% of people with a lawyer were deported, compared to only 27% of those who had a lawyer. So, it makes a big difference.

David Fair: This is 89.1 WEMU's Washtenaw United, and we're talking with Christine Sauve from the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center. With all of the increased immigration and customs enforcement operations taking place here in Washtenaw County, around the state and around the country, are you finding that more immigrants are refusing to show up for court?

Christine Sauve: You know, that's an interesting question that has been in the news recently. Historically, the data has shown that the majority of people show up for their appointments. And that's even more so true if you have legal counsel. So, between 96 and 98% of children and families with legal counsel show up their court appointments. So, looking at some of the recent numbers just over this past year, there has been an increase in some of those rulings without someone there. And I think that's, in large part, due to the increase in immigration enforcement that we're seeing at the court. So, specifically, ICE is targeting and arresting and detaining people at their court appointments. But I can say for our clients, the vast majority of our clients, do show up for their appointments again because they know that's the only way that they can actually achieve the outcome that they're seeking in their case.

David Fair: I was going to say. Do the repercussions become worse should they miss those court dates?

Christine Sauve: Yes. And we're seeing that play out because if you miss your court hearing, the ruling will be made against you for removal. And that opens up more people who are then targeted for ICE detention and removal. We've seen an increase in the detainment of individuals with pending application, so some of our clients who have a pending application for asylum, even some of our child clients who had pending applications and were really just waiting for their green card. And so, the detention centers are almost at capacity, and it really pushes people to the brink. People are being detained for longer periods, and it puts a strain physically, mentally, spiritually. And that, sadly, is pushing some people to choose to self-deport or what's known as voluntary departure.

David Fair: You know, this used to be a country that prided itself on being so welcoming. Inside the pedestal of the Statue of Liberty, there's a plaque with the Emma Lazarus poem called ""The New Colossus"". It contains the following words: ""Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free."" And that had become a part of the American identity. It offered promise that the American Dream was not only real, but accessible. How would you assess the state of the American Dream in 2026?

Christine Sauve: I'd say it's in tatters. You know, so many individuals have placed their faith in our immigration system only to see the rules changed midway. So many lawful programs that people have been participating in waiting for their final outcome in court, those programs were ended. And their status is now tenuous, and they can be arrested and detained. So, I think of that quote often myself because my great-grandfather came here as, what would today be called, an unaccompanied child. And I don't think he would be welcomed in the same way that he was at that period and able to start a life here. And that's what just so many people who are coming recently have wanted was a chance at opportunity or better opportunities for their kids. And I have been the beneficiary of that. And I truly believe that it's still at the core of what has made this country great and part of our American values.

David Fair: Well, 2026 is shaping up to be a year of potentially even harsher immigration policy and enforcement. So, how is the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center shaping up to deal with that reality?

Christine Sauve: We are doing the best we can with the resources that we have. There are 31,000 cases pending in immigration court, and only about a third of those individuals have a lawyer. So, people need attorneys, and our nonprofit immigration legal system is under-resourced. So many of our partners have been very kindly holding community fundraisers to raise more resources to provide attorneys for those who need them. Because, in immigration court, you're not provided an attorney if you can't afford one, unlike in the criminal court process. So, we're also just trying to share information with the community, so that people are aware of their rights and can be better informed. But the real difficulties that we're seeing are, again, stemming from the massive numbers of people who are now detained, and that's creating, essentially, a second child separation crisis. Because as more parents are detained, their children, many of whom are U.S. citizens, are suffering at home separated from their parents.

David Fair: You know, you're pointing it out with your answer there, but we tend to have these kinds of conversations in a very political context: who's on what side and why and how many are affected. But we're talking about people, families, and community. And too many voices are being silenced out of fear. How do we, as a community at whole, help address those fears and move us forward instead of regressing?

Christine Sauve: You know, it really takes discussion, and I know many people have just maybe had some of those conversations over the holidays with their loved ones, but people have different access to different information these days. So, helping get the word out about what's really happening in their communities can help the conversation. You know, what's so striking working so close to this issue and having the vantage point we do is that, most Americans, what they say they want in the immigration system, this administration is doing the exact opposite. So, most Americans say they wants fairness. And it's not really fair to arrest and detain people who have been playing by the rules. Most people say they want order, but instead we're seeing lawlessness--agents without identification, misuse of force. And then, most people say that they want affordability. They want a cost of living to be addressed. And instead, we're spending billions on detention and enforcement. So, I think if we go back to our core values, we can have some of these conversations and maybe look at some real policy changes.

David Fair: We will have opportunity to have many more conversations over the course of the next year. I appreciate your time today and look forward to our next conversation, hopefully with a little more optimism.

Christine Sauve: Thank you so much! Appreciate it!

Detainees report widespread depression, anxiety, insomnia, and emotional breakdowns.","Eighty asylum seekers detained in preparation for being returned to France under the UK government’s controversial “one in, one out” scheme have called on UN bodies to investigate their treatment. claiming they have suffered “fear, humiliation, and psychological distress” at the hands of the Home Office since arriving in the UK in small boats.

The detainees have compiled a document, “Report on conditions and treatment at Harmondsworth immigration removal centre”, which claims they have been treated unjustly by the Home Office since arriving in the UK on small boats. Harmondsworth is one of two detention centres close to Heathrow airport in London.

The asylum seekers, who come from a variety of conflict zones including Sudan, Afghanistan and Iran, accuse the Home Office of subjecting them to arbitrary detention, denial of legal representation, inadequate medical care, degrading treatment and severe psychological harm. They say they came to UK “in the pursuit of safety, dignity, and a chance to live a peaceful life”.

They are calling on the UN and human rights groups to urgently investigate conditions that people detained for deportation under the “one in, one out” scheme are held in.

The report’s circulation coincides with new government powers coming into force to seize mobile phones carried by people who arrive in the UK on small boats to examine them for information about people smugglers. One offence that under the new powers could lead to a sentence of up to five years in jail is “collecting information that is of use to those planning an illegal crossing”, which could include checking the weather forecast to identify favourable times to cross the Channel.

Despite a raft of measures to tackle people smuggling gangs using small boats to bring asylum seekers to the UK since Labour came to power, 2025 had the second-highest number of crossings on record with more than 41,000 people reaching the UK on small boats.

According to the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM), the number of deaths among those in northern France hoping to reach UK was significantly lower than in 2024 despite the increase in crossings. More than 36,000 crossed in 2024 and at least 85 deaths were recorded, while 36 deaths were documented in 2025.

The first return flight to France of 2026 under the “one in, one out” scheme is due on Wednesday. According to the most recent figures issued by the Home Office, 193 people have been sent to France in the first three months of the scheme, while in turn 195 have been brought here legally. This represents less than a quarter of the 803 people who crossed the Channel in small boats in a single day on 20 December.

According to the report, detainees say they were not given sufficient time to rest, recover or receive psychological support following traumatic journeys and their Home Office interview, with some not having seen or spoken to their families since detention began.

They add that along with not receiving adequate medical treatment for a range of physical ailments the psychological impact of detention has been profound. The report states: “Many detainees are young adults between the ages of 17 and 30. Detainees report widespread depression, anxiety, insomnia, and emotional breakdowns.

“There have been multiple incidents involving individuals experiencing severe mental health crises, including self-harm attempts. Detainees report being placed in isolation or disciplinary units. This environment has created constant fear, despair, and uncertainty, with detainees expressing that they feel dehumanised and invisible.”

According to law enforcement, Porter — a father of two — fired celebratory gunshots into the air with an AR-15-style rifle outside his apartment complex on New Year’s Eve. An off-duty ICE officer who lives at the complex heard the gunfire and responded, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The ICE officer, who has not been identified, exchanged gunfire with the shooter, DHS said. Porter was pronounced dead at the scene.

""He was a great Black man. He was a girl dad,"" said Porter’s cousin, Jsane Tyler.

Chants of ""Say his name, Keith Porter"" echoed through the street Sunday evening as family members, neighbors, and activists mourned Porter and called for an independent investigation into the shooting.

In its statement, DHS said, ""On December 31, an off-duty ICE officer bravely responded to an active shooter situation at his apartment complex. In order to protect his life and that of others, he was forced to defensively use his weapon and exchanged gunfire with the shooter. Fortunately, our brave officer was not injured while protecting his community.""

An LAPD report states the off-duty federal officer confronted Porter, identified himself as law enforcement, and claims Porter fired toward him, prompting the officer to return fire.

Family members and community leaders dispute that account and say Porter was not a threat.

""This is not someone who was out to harm anyone,"" said Melina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Los Angeles. ""Police lie, and it’s disgusting the way they assassinate Black life.""

Some at the vigil acknowledged that firing a weapon into the air is dangerous but questioned whether deadly force was justified.

""It’s not the smartest thing to do if that was the case,"" said neighbor Carter Nunez. ""But regardless, is that punishable by death? I don’t think so. We have due process in this county.""

As the vigil continued, community members renewed calls for an independent investigation.

""He was off duty. Protocol states he was supposed to stay in that house and call 911 if he thought Keith was a danger to anyone else,"" Tyler said.

Sunday evening, a crowd of about 50 gathered on wet asphalt outside the Village Pointe apartment complex in Northridge to grieve Keith Porter Jr. The group included activists, family members and Porter’s co-workers from Home Depot. The Compton man was shot at the complex on Dec. 31 by an off-duty Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, according to authorities.

Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles — of which Porter was a member — said in a news release that the vigil was organized to memorialize the 33-year-old father and call for an independent investigation into his death.

“We want to recognize that one of the worst imaginable injustices has been committed, and there will be time for us to protest,” Melina Abdullah, a co-director of Black Lives Matter Grassroots, said during the vigil. ”This is a time for grief. … We are not going to be quiet.”

In a statement after the incident, Homeland Security officials said the agent was “forced to defensively use his weapon” and opened fire “to protect his life and that of others.” Officials said Porter was an “active shooter” threat.

According to a statement from the civil rights organization Project Islamic Hope, Porter was celebrating the new year by firing a rifle into the air when an “overzealous” off-duty agent shot him.

Firing guns into the air, which poses the risk of people being injured or killed, is a felony. The fatal shooting of Porter is under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department’s Robbery-Homicide Division, officials said. The FBI, the U.S. Department of Justice and Homeland Security Investigations also are handling the case because a federal agent was involved.

On Sunday evening, mourners crouched around a makeshift memorial and wrote heartfelt messages to Porter and his family on a small board above his photo. Porter is survived by a 9-year-old daughter.

Bishop Jack Wilson, a friend of Porter’s mother, was on hand for the gathering. The Solid Rock Mission Church official said he remembered Porter as a child, when he was always smiling and had the manners of an old Southern gentleman.

“He was full of life, and always smiling,” Wilson said. “It hurts me that he didn’t take his last breath, but his last breath was taken from him.”

Abdullah said Black Lives Matter Grassroots, an activist group within the BLM movement, would meet with L.A. County Dist. Atty. Nathan Hochman on Tuesday morning to demand that there be a federal investigation into the agent responsible for the killing. Authorities had yet to identify the agent Sunday.

Hochman “was elected from the backing of police associations that came from murderous cops, like the one who stole Keith’s life,” Abdullah said. “The people have the power, and the people have a demand.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5a83e8e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3984x2092+0+282/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F75%2Fff%2F2aecc49b4ac688e24e612c43ad0c%2F1536595-me-ice-agent-shooting-northridge-jja-0002.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:02:17.149315

Virginia’s outgoing Attorney General Jason Miyares quickly agreed to a consent decree to resolve a Justice Department lawsuit filed against the state in late December challenging laws allowing students in the country illegally to qualify for in-state tuition and financial aid at public colleges and universities.

“In a joint court filing, Miyares and lawyers for the Justice Department asked a federal judge to declare the Virginia Dream Act invalid and bar state authorities from enforcing it. If approved, the joint consent decree order would make Virginia the fourth state to scrap its policies that allow eligible undocumented students to pay the lower in-state tuition rate,” Inside Higher Ed reported Jan. 2.

“The joint agreement came just one day after the Trump administration sued Virginia over its in-state tuition policies—the seventh such lawsuit.”

A Dec. 30 news release from the Justice Department announcing the lawsuit had stated: “These laws unconstitutionally discriminate against U.S. citizens who are not afforded the same reduced tuition rates, scholarships, or subsidies, create incentives for illegal immigration, and reward illegal immigrants with benefits that U.S. citizens are not eligible for, all in direct conflict with federal law.”

A Jan. 1 social media post by Miyares echoed that notion.

“It is clear that the Northam-era statute on in-state tuition eligibility is preempted by federal law,” he posted on X. “Illegal immigrants cannot be given benefits that are not available to American citizens. Rewarding non-citizens with the privilege of in-state tuition is wrong and only further incentivizes illegal immigration. I have always said I will call balls and strikes, and I am proud to play a part in ending this unlawful program.”

According to Axios, the Virginia lawsuit represented the “latest example of the DOJ’s push to limit states from offering tuition benefits to undocumented immigrants, without which higher education could be inaccessible to the nation’s estimated 850,000 undocumented minors.”

Reuters reported that under President Donald Trump, the Justice Department has also “filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.”

“Texas and Oklahoma, both led by Republican governors, quickly settled by agreeing to consent decrees blocking enforcement of their state laws.”

Similarly, Virginia followed suit, prompting an appeal, WRIC reported: “In a Dec. 31 joint press release, the Legal Aid Justice Center, the ACLU of Virginia and the Dream Project announced that they had filed an emergency motion to intervene in a federal lawsuit that took aim at both undocumented and refugee students in Virginia.”

“The Attorney General of Virginia has abandoned his duties to defend Virginia law and the people of the Commonwealth, so we must,” said ACLU-VA Senior Immigrants’ Rights Attorney Sophia Gregg in the release. “Attorney General Jason Miyares has sided with the Department of Justice — intentionally working in secrecy and over a holiday weekend — to manufacture a predetermined outcome to deprive Virginian students of not only their futures but their day in court.”",https://www.thecollegefix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Lawsuit.kanchanachitkhamma72.png,N,,2026-01-05 04:56:51.140279

Andy Kim denounced the U.S. military’s surprise weekend raid on Venezuela as illegal, pledging to move quickly when Congress reconvenes this week to check President Donald Trump’s power to start wars.

Hours after approving an operation to seize Venezuela’s autocratic leader Nicolás Maduro, Trump said Saturday the U.S. would seize oil deposits in the South American country and “run” the nation for an unspecified period. “We are going to run the country for some time,” Trump said, adding that he was not afraid of “boots on the ground.”

Confusion continued as to who is running Venezuela after Trump’s declaration. Secretary of State Marco Rubio contradicted Trump on Sunday, saying the U.S. would not assume daily responsibility for governing Venezuela and instead force an “oil quarantine” to press for changes in the oil-rich nation.

Foreign heads of state denounced the attack — a roughly two-and-a-half-hour operation, according to U.S. military officials — that jolted the Venezuelan capital city of Caracas and killed dozens, while legal experts said it broke international law.

Congressional Democrats including Kim, a Democrat who held national security posts in the Obama administration, publicly fumed that Congress had not been briefed before the attack.

Asked why Congress was not briefed, as is required for significant military operations, Trump said: “Congress has a tendency to leak.”

The dark-of-night operation marks the most aggressive use of military force against Venezuela since the Trump administration mounted a campaign to topple the Maduro government last year. It also drew immediate comparisons with other U.S. military campaigns to overthrow overseas governments or invade foreign nations, including Panama in 1989, Kuwait in 1990 and Iraq in 2003.

For months, Trump has been threatening regime change in Venezuela and military forces have been conducting missile strikes on suspected drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean.

Before Congress broke for the holidays, Congress passed legislation that became law to limit the president’s legal authority to attack other countries. In a significant shift, the law repealed two legal justifications presidents have used top deploy troops for decades — officially called “authorizations for the use of military force,” or AUMFs.

Though Congress passed that legislation, further efforts to limit presidential war powers in Washington, where Republicans control the House, the Senate and the White House, face a rocky future as Republican allies continue to back Trump.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, both Democrats from New York, demanded briefings this week. Republicans largely lauded Maduro’s capture. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, called the operation “decisive and justified,” and said the Trump administration was “working to schedule briefings for members as Congress returns to Washington.”

Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said he will force a vote this week to block further military actions against Venezuela absent congressional approval.

Kaine tried to muster support for his resolution without success last year. Kaine’s measure and other efforts to limit Trump’s military options, would need to clear both chambers of Congress, and Trump would have to sign them, to enter into law.

“We’ve entered the 250th year of American democracy and cannot allow it to devolve into the tyranny that our founders fought to escape,” Kaine said.

Almost all Democrats and a few Republicans are expected to vote for his resolution.

A deepening entrenchment of the U.S. military abroad threatens to splinter wings of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill, where many diehard Trump-supporting lawmakers prefer an isolationist approach to foreign policy over a hawkish stance more traditional with Republicans.

“This is the same Washington playbook that we are so sick and tired of that doesn’t serve the American people, but actually serves the big corporations, the banks and the oil executives,” Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said on Sunday in an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.”

Greene, a devotee of the “America First” brand of politics that favors withdrawal from the global stage, is retiring from Congress this month after breaking with Trump over publication of government files about the deceased sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein.

Trump himself has criticized U.S. lethal intervention in foreign lands. At a 2016 Republican presidential debate he described the Iraq war that the U.S. began in 2003 as a “big, fat mistake.”

Speaking on Fox News on the weekend, Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, confirmed and defended the decision the administration made not to brief lawmakers. “That’s probably one reason it didn’t leak over these four days as they were waiting for the right weather,” Cotton said.

In posts online, Kim said Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth “blatantly” lied to Congress during recent briefings about the Trump administration’s goals in Venezuela, which they said did not amount to regime change.

The action to seize Maduro was “disastrous,” Kim said. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war,” he wrote.

“President Trump ran on an America First platform that opposed regime change wars, yet this operation shows a clear shift from that position,” Rep. Donald Norcross (D-1st), a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said in a statement. “Even more concerning, Congress was not informed beforehand, which is a clear violation of our Constitution.”

After American warplanes early Saturday bombed Caracas, U.S. forces abducted Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported them to New York, where the Trump administration is pursuing criminal charges against the pair.

In its indictment, the Justice Department accused Maduro of leading a “corrupt, illegitimate government” powered through a broad drug-running network that inundated the U.S. with tons of cocaine.

Rep. Jeff Van Drew (R-2nd), a steady Trump ally who has criticized U.S. military involvement abroad, said Maduro “helped fuel the poison drug trade that’s killing Americans and destroying families.”

“America has a responsibility to stop this poison at the source before more Americans are murdered,” Van Drew said.

Maduro is being held in Brooklyn at a prison opened in the 1990s called the Metropolitan Detention Center, or MDC. He faces federal drug and weapons charges in the Southern District of New York, a jurisdiction known for high-profile criminal prosecutions, along with his wife, son and three other individuals.

In a joint statement, Spain, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay rejected the attack of Venezuela as a threat to stability in the region. “These actions constitute a dangerous precedent for peace, regional security and pose a risk to the civil population,” the joint statement added.

On Sunday, 26 members of the European Union urged restraint from all sides.

Bay Area congressional representatives on Saturday denounced the United States’ military action against Venezuela by the administration of President Donald Trump overnight Friday, calling it in turns “illegal” and “unconstitutional”.

Trump announced Saturday that the U.S. military struck Venezuela and a ground force entered the country and took Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro and his wife into custody on what Trump said were drug trafficking-related indictments from the U.S. Department of Justice dating back to 2020.

He said the United States and a group of unnamed oil companies would run the country until a leader reliably sympathetic to U.S. interests could be installed and said military occupation was a possibility, without offering specifics. Trump said Venezuela’s vice president was leading the country in the meantime and was taking direction from the U.S.

Protests were planned around the region Saturday by antiwar groups including the Answer Coalition and Sonoma County Veterans for Peace. Events were planned in San Francisco, Santa Rosa, Santa Cruz and other cities to voice objection to the action, which was called a “dangerous precedent” by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.

U.S. Rep. John Garamendi (D-Fairfield) said the attack raised two questions, including what constitutional authority the president used to justify the action, and what the administration’s plan was after forcibly removing Venezuela’s leader.

“Last night, in direct violation of the United States Constitution, President Trump illegally attacked Venezuela’s capital and seized Nicolas Maduro,” Garamendi said in a statement.

He said Congress must assert its authority to restrict such unilateral military action by the executive branch.

Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) called Maduro an “illegitimate leader” but questioned the Trump administration’s reliance on allegations of drug trafficking as a justification of force and said the administration had not proven Maduro represented an urgent threat to the United States.

“If the President grounds his actions on the basis of drug trafficking charges, it is entirely hypocritical in light of his recent pardon of former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez who was responsible for bringing more than 400 tons of cocaine in the United States in order to ‘shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos,'” Pelosi said in a statement.

“The Administration says Maduro will be tried for drug trafficking in a U.S. court – but Hernandez was convicted of the same crimes by an American jury and Trump pardoned him,” she said.

U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Livermore) similarly said in a press conference Saturday that Maduro was an illegitimate leader, but said that the administration’s actions were unconstitutional.

Maduro has been accused by the International Criminal Court of crimes against humanity and political repression starting in 2014, and of remaining in power despite allegedly losing an election in 2024, according to Human Rights Watch and the Carter Center, a U.S.-based non-profit organization that monitors elections.

An arrest warrant was issued in 2024 for Maduro in Argentina, using any country’s ability to bring human rights charges under a principle called “Universal Jurisdiction”. But Trump did not cite international law in the U.S. operation and Guterres said the action threatened international law.

“He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected,” said Guterres’ spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.

The U.N. said the action had been denounced by Venezuela’s government and that casualty figures from the operation, which involved military strikes, were unclear as of Saturday afternoon. Trump said there were no U.S. casualties.

Swalwell said nobody wanted to see Maduro in charge of Venezuela but said Trump’s unilateral military actions had been taken without legal congressional authority.

“What this president has done, in the shortcuts that he has taken, is he’s going to, one shortcut at a time, put us in a fascist cul-de-sac. That’s where he’d taken us, that’s the objection. It’s not a process objection; it’s an objection for acting in such a fascistic way,” he said.

Swalwell would not rule out funding an occupation of Venezuela, saying that too much was unknown, including how long any troop deployments would last and what they could cost. But he said the president had put Congress in a “tough position” and the Democratic caucus would meet soon to try to determine its stance.

Swalwell, the Dublin native who is running for governor of California, did not rule out impeachment actions when asked and said all options were on the table.

U.S. Rep. Lateefah Simon (D-Oakland) said the president had started an illegal war.

“The President launched a war last night without the consent of Congress. That is unconstitutional and illegal,” Simon said in a statement.

She cited other past U.S. military actions in South and Central America and said Trump’s repeated mentioning of oil as the motivation for the coup disproved the administration’s claim that Maduro’s removal was about narcotics trafficking.

“This administration tells Americans there is no money for housing. No money for health care. No money to feed hungry children. But there is always money for war,” Simon said. “Congress must reassert its Constitutional power to declare war and reign in this Administration. We must use every tool to hold this President accountable and to defend the principle that in the U.S., we do not let one man choose war.”

Mario Guevara spent over 20 years covering the Latino community in Metro Atlanta. Last summer, he was arrested by Doraville police at a ""No Kings"" rally in DeKalb County and later turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, also known as ICE.

Guevara spent more than 100 days in ICE custody before being deported to El Salvador.

Now, three months later, he says he is still receiving tips and questions from people across Metro Atlanta.

""Every day I receive tips from the community,"" Guevara said. ""When people contact me, they want to know what is going on in their area.""

Proposed detention facility raises concerns

One of the biggest questions right now centers on Social Circle, a small city of about 5,000 people located roughly 45 miles east of Atlanta.

Local leaders say they were surprised after The Washington Post reported that the Trump administration is considering turning large warehouses in several cities into holding centers for detained immigrants.

The draft proposal reportedly includes facilities that could hold between 5,000 and 10,000 people each.

City leaders say they were not contacted

David Keener said the city did not receive any notice from the federal government before the report came out.

""We do not have the water and sewer capacity,"" Keener said. ""That's probably the biggest reason. And most people in town are opposed to this facility locating here.""

City officials say only one building in Social Circle might even be large enough to handle something like this.

What power do cities have?

Eric Taylor said the city is now trying to figure out what legal options it has.

""The city is actively trying to figure out what authority we have,"" Taylor said. ""Unfortunately, the U.S. Constitution has a supremacy clause, which means the federal government is often not subject to city or state laws.""

CBS News Atlanta reached out to ICE for comment but has not yet received a response.

Guevara speaks from experience

Guevara says the community's biggest concern should be how long people would be held inside and what conditions would be like.

""Nobody in jail expects a five-star hotel,"" he said. ""But the food and conditions need to be tolerable.""

He says he saw those conditions firsthand during the more than 100 days he was detained in Georgia.

Why it matters: Roughly 600,000 Venezuelans living legally in the U.S. under TPS face potential deportation to a nation whose future government remains deeply uncertain.

The big picture: Asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" if Venezuelans should remain in the U.S. given the instability, Noem argued that Venezuela is ""more free today than it was yesterday"" and insisted TPS holders can apply for refugee status instead.

""We need to make sure that our programs actually mean something and that we're following the law,"" Noem said when pressed about forced returns during political upheaval.

The backdrop: The Trump administration terminated TPS for Venezuelans earlier this year. The Supreme Court allowed the termination to proceed while litigation continues.

President Trump also halted asylum applications from 19 countries, including Venezuela, after a shooting incident in D.C.

Newly elected Miami Mayor Eileen Higgins called the TPS termination ""reckless, dangerous and wrong"" on Saturday, urging Trump to reinstate the program.

What they're saying: While some Venezuelans celebrated Maduro's ouster in Miami's streets, others stayed home fearing immigration raids, according to news reports.

""We are victims of the Nicolás Maduro regime, but we are also victims of the Trump administration policies,"" Adelys Ferro of the Venezuelan-American Caucus told The New York Times.

The president suggested Saturday that some Venezuelans ""want to stay, and some probably want to go back.""

MENDOCINO, CA — The first rapid response network and watch hotline for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity in Mendocino County has launched with the help of several local volunteers.

Anyone who sees ICE agents in the area can call (707) 621-8220 to report sightings to the Mendocino County Rapid Response Network, which has volunteers trained and ready to quickly identify, verify, and inform the community if ICE is conducting raids or detaining immigrants locally.

The network also works to dispel false rumors of ICE sightings, share verified information with local news outlets, and post updates about ICE activity on social media. The network officially launched in early December, but the group has been recruiting volunteers and organizing trainings since the spring of 2025.

Rapid response networks are volunteer-led community organizations that monitor ICE activity and support immigrant communities. These networks largely came to prominence during President Donald Trump's first term, following his administration's increased targeting and removal of immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

According to a press release from the Mendocino County network, ""An important part of the network is the sharing of community education so people know their rights and how to protect themselves.""

Judy Abeja Hummel of Boonville, a volunteer and member of the network's steering committee, said in an interview that one of their goals is to support local immigrant neighbors and friends who are fearful of ICE raids.

""I hope that ICE does not come to this community, but if they do, I want us to be ready to stand up in solidarity with all of our neighbors. To me this isn't a question of immigration, this is a question of civil rights, human rights, and human decency,"" Hummel said. ""Many of my Latino neighbors have been afraid to leave the house, or they just go to work and come straight home. There have been many false alarms and rumors that keep re-traumatizing people. One important thing we offer is checking every rumor that comes along and verifying or debunking it as quickly as possible, so that people can go on living their lives.""

Hummel also said the network has trained 125 local volunteers to help monitor and verify ICE sightings. She said the steering committee has about six to eight people leading the group's efforts. The network is still looking for a local volunteer coordinator for the Round Valley region.

""We are divided into five regions -- Ukiah, Willits, Anderson Valley, North Coast, and South Coast, and each area has a local volunteer coordinator organizing, vetting, and bringing volunteers onboard,"" Hummel said.

The Mendocino County Rapid Response Network will also be hosting ""know your rights"" trainings in Spanish and English, has a program to support businesses in being prepared for immigration raids, and is developing a group of volunteers to accompany immigrants to their court hearings.

Perhaps the most ominous feature of Trump’s foray in Venezuela is that it took place less than a year into Trump’s term.","“The action against Venezuela is manifestly illegal under international law, and cannot plausibly or by any reasonable standard be characterized as a law enforcement action,” Philippe Sands, an expert on international law, told me in the wake of the military action.

“What now is the plan?” he continued. “One need only to think of Nicaragua, Afghanistan and Libya, amongst others, to imagine what the consequences might be, and the encouragement it will surely give to others to act with such brazen disregard for the international legal norms that bind us all.”

Trump, of course, is not the first U.S. president to sideline Congress on matters of war and peace. Stretching the bounds of executive authority on military action may be especially tempting as many lawmakers appear increasingly eager to shirk the responsibility of such decisions. But the latest episode appears unique compared to previous interventions; more on that below.

Meanwhile, the average American might be shocked by the turn of events, but no one in Washington can seriously claim to be surprised.

The Trump administration spent months openly flaunting lethal and illegal boat strikes against alleged drug traffickers and threatening to topple the Maduro regime. When even the boat strikes became impossible to defend under the law after the revelation in November about a “double tap” strike that killed survivors clinging to a boat, the administration stonewalled. Despite the apparently indefensible nature of that attack, Republicans in Congress eventually rallied around Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. There is a famous children’s book about what happens in these sorts of situations.

Trump declared in November that the airspace above and around Venezuela was closed, and weeks later he ordered a blockade of the country. Both of these actions were essentially acts of war — or, at a bare minimum, very clear statements of the administration’s intentions about what was coming.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration never made an honest and coherent case to the American public about what they were doing and why. Trump has repeatedly peddled the transparently ridiculous claim that each boat strike saved 25,000 American lives from drug overdoses. An emerging journalistic consensus now holds that administration officials coalesced around ousting Maduro based on three rationales — oil, drugs and immigration — but three different bad reasons to launch an illegal regime change war do not add up to one good one.

The idea that this reflects a serious effort to stymie drug trafficking was already rendered a farce by Trump’s decision last month to pardon former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, who was serving a 45-year prison sentence after being convicted of trafficking hundreds of tons of cocaine into the U.S. — pretty much the exact same thing that Maduro is now accused of. You also cannot legally depose a sovereign nation’s leader because the country’s citizens are illegally immigrating to your country or because you want to seize their natural resources.

The Trump administration’s intellectual shell game should have been familiar to anyone who lived through the run-up to the Iraq war, when President George W. Bush’s administration offered up shifting and factually unsupported claims in the months before they took the country into war. That war is now widely understood as a historic mistake — something that Trump himself used to get elected in 2016 — but this obvious parallel appears to have eluded many in recent months.

What happens next on the ground in Venezuela is anyone’s guess at this point, but it is also a logical consequence of our current political situation — one in which Congress and the Supreme Court have largely let Trump have his way since returning to office. There is, however, nothing permanent about this arrangement, and the public has the power to change it.

Already, there have been efforts by administration defenders to draw legal comparisons between Trump’s actions in Venezuela to those of other presidents in different contexts. The comparisons are premature at best and facile at worst.

“This pushes precedents very far, but we don’t know just how far yet, because so many facts and plans are unclear,” Matthew Waxman, a Columbia Law School professor and former George W. Bush Administration official, told me.

“All modern presidents have claimed broad power to use substantial military force without congressional authorization,” he continued. “Some of those contemplated regime change. One might call any of these violations of Congress’ prerogatives, but because these questions don’t get litigated in court, it falls to Congress to defend its own powers.”

The supposed precedents include Trump’s first-term strike against Qasam Soleimani, Barack Obama’s NATO-led bombing campaign in Libya, Bill Clinton’s participation in the NATO campaign against Yugoslavia and George H.W. Bush’s arrest and prosecution of the onetime Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.

There are obvious factual distinctions. Soleimani was a senior military leader in Iran but not the head of state, and Trump did not decide that we would “run” the country afterward. Obama and Clinton each had the support of a robust international coalition and a legitimate humanitarian rationale for their decisions. (Obama, in any event, has said that his worst mistake in office was “failing to plan for the day after” the Libya intervention.)

Bush’s invasion of Panama in 1989 and arrest of Noriega appears most on point, but in that case the U.S. facilitated the swift installation of an opposition leader who had won a presidential election. Waxman acknowledged that the episode provided “some parallels and precedent” as a legal matter, but he noted that even “that operation strained constitutional and international law.” On top of that, “if this really does turn into a protracted occupation of Venezuela, it could far exceed the Panama case in terms of presidential unilateralism,” Waxman said.

Sometimes, however, a fine-grained legal analysis can obscure just as much as it illuminates.

Even if there were no distinctions between Trump’s actions in Venezuela and those earlier military campaigns, what would that prove? Many Americans were not even alive when some of those events happened, and all of those actions — by Trump, Obama and the first Bush — appear to have been illegal under U.S. law, international law or both.

What many people are really talking about when they invoke these comparisons is whether as a matter of policy, those interventions were as good or as bad as what Trump just did — not whether they were lawful. That is a different and legitimate discussion, but it is not one that legally vindicates the Trump administration.

We should have seen something like this coming — Congress, the press corps and the rest of official Washington.

Trump has spent the last year running roughshod over the American public’s representatives in Congress, with the Republican majority happy to play ball. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a prominent anti-interventionist Republican, underscored this approach after the strikes on Venezuela — raising concerns with the move’s constitutionality only to back off two hours later.

Democrats, for their part, have been focused in recent months on releasing millions of pages of unvetted information from the Justice Department’s criminal investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein. In the process, they have generated even more conspiracy theories that will probably exist in perpetuity, and they have positioned the party behind the irresponsible and thus-far unsupported claim that there is a large “Epstein class” of rich and powerful criminals who will be decisively taken down once the public scours through everything that the Justice Department missed or intentionally covered up under both the Trump and Biden administrations.

This is not to equate the Democrats’ actions with the Republican Party’s institutional backing of the Trump administration, but if these are the adults in the room, I would hate to see the children.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court justices — the six Republican appointees, more specifically —bear considerable responsibility for Trump’s actions and the chaotic state of American politics today.

Trump likely would not have been reelected without their intervention during the 2024 campaign had the court not rewritten the Constitution to grant him sweeping criminal immunity and effectively shut down the Justice Department’s prosecution over Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election results.

The decision — which immunizes Trump from future prosecution for pretty much anything that he can plausibly structure or describe as an “official act” of the presidency — has clearly emboldened Trump in his second term. How could it not?

On top of that, the Republican appointees on the court have facilitated Trump’s executive overreach and power grabs for most of the last year. The court has only recently started to put up the most basic effort to maintain some democratic guard rails. Last week, they finally brushed back Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in major U.S. cities run by Democrats after nearly a year of needless chaos and uncertainty. The justices also appear poised to invalidate Trump’s “emergency tariffs” after wasting several months taking up the dispute in the first place — and after a year of Trump antagonizing U.S. allies and adversaries alike and destabilizing the U.S. and global economies in the process.

Perhaps the most ominous feature of Trump’s foray in Venezuela is that it took place less than a year into Trump’s term. There are three more years to go and countless opportunities for more international interventions that are illegal, unwise or both.

Are there any checks that can be put on Trump? There is nothing the public can do about the Supreme Court (at least in the very short term), and American voters may have to overcome even more legal obstacles from the Republican appointees on the Supreme Court before the midterm elections. But the public will have an opportunity to change the composition of Congress in November, and it is possible that fact will weigh on GOP lawmakers even before then.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc0%2Fd4%2F0fed193240479ba829c2105153bf%2Ftrump-us-venezuela-27916.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:12:24.951333

U.S. VENEZUELA ATTACK CASUALTY COUNT: At least 40 people were killed in the U.S. attack on Venezuela, according to New York Times, citing a Venezuela official.","Warning: This article contains details that may be disturbing for some readers.

Nestled near the mountains, far from any settlement, stands a prison ostensibly made for the most dangerous terrorists and criminals.

Some consider the El Salvadorian institution one of the strictest prisons in the world.

“Welcome to hell,” said the prison director to over 200 newcomers. “You will leave it only dead.”

Andry Omar Blanco Bonilla, from Valencia, Venezuela, had seen videos about this place on YouTube.

Now, he asked himself: what has gone wrong in his life for him to end up here?

Andry was among 252 Venezuelans who were sent by Trump’s order to the maximum-security prison in El Salvador, known as the Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.

They were accused of being members of the Venezuelan criminal gang Tren de Aragua, though no one provided any evidence. People with no criminal record, who were fleeing poverty, ended up confined in inhumane conditions alongside 40,000 dangerous criminals.

At the prison, they were tortured and abused, including sexually, according to Human Rights Watch. One detainee was allegedly forced to have oral sex with one of the prison’s guards, while the others were called homophobic slurs.

The event formed the basis for hostile ties between the U.S and Venezuela, which culminated Saturday with the American bombing of Caracas.

It was a sign that Trump’s ambitions are to enforce a ‘might-makes-right’ philosophy in the Western hemisphere – where migration itself is treated as a crime and a military intervention to any country is justified.

For Andry, making ends meet in Venezuela was almost impossible.

Still, his growing up there had some brightness. His youth was filled with the loud sounds of motorcycle engines. It was a passion that led to him meeting his partner, Susana, at a motorcycle exhibition.

“We dated for a couple of months, getting to know each other. Over the years, our feelings grew stronger. What caught my attention most about her? Her gaze, her smile, her laugh,” Andry said.

Just 20 years ago, Venezuela was a promising country because it held the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Today, it is associated with economic crises, hyperinflation, repression, and a humanitarian catastrophe. The situation worsened after the political crisis in 2019, when Nicolás Maduro usurped power following rigged elections.

So Andry found himself at the U.S. border at the end of 2023. He did not have a work permit, so he immediately surrendered to border authorities and filed for asylum, hoping to be able to work in the U.S. legally.

After a month, Andry visited the immigration center to update his address. Fortune was not on his side.

“Do you have any tattoos on your body that are not visible?” the officer asked while processing his address change.

“Yes,” Andry replied as his chest, back, and leg were partially covered with ink. He explained the personal meaning of each. The drawing of a clock showed the time of his mother’s birth.

The officer was unsatisfied.

“The officer practically wanted to force me to affirm something that was totally a lie, to say I belonged to a gang,” Andry recalled. “He just said, ‘You’re detained.’”

Among Venezuelans, tattoos have sometimes been associated with the transnational criminal organization Tren de Aragua, which is involved in drug, weapons, and human trafficking.

The supposed fight against this organization became a focus of Trump’s second term. In February, the Trump administration designated Tren de Aragua as a foreign terrorist organization. From that point on, the United States attacked Venezuelan infrastructure and conducted military operations – culminating in Saturday’s capture of Maduro.

More than one hundred Venezuelans have already been killed in boat strikes, even though the Trump administration has so far failed to provide evidence that these boats belonged to cartels or were carrying drugs.

A similar thing can be said of Andry: there was no evidence of his involvement in a criminal gang — other than the government’s interpretation of his tattoos.

The U.S. detained Andry for five months, labeling him as a “danger to society.”

“I’ve been a person with an impeccable record. I’ve never been detained, never been imprisoned, never had a legal problem in the U.S., not even a traffic ticket the whole time I was there,” he said.

Venezuela and the United States have severed diplomatic relations. When it became clear that deportation directly to his home country was impossible, the court released him on bail for several months.

Andry bought himself a plane ticket to return home to Venezuela in April 2025. He did not want to wait for ICE to come and deport him. But in February 2025, they acted first.

He was told to appear at an ICE office the next day to update his data. It was a ruse. When he showed up, he was detained. They put handcuffs on Andry, “violently, like a criminal,” he recalled.

When Andry said that he already had a ticket to Venezuela and could exchange it to the nearest date, the officer responded: “You should have left when you could.”

What followed was a nightmare most of us can barely imagine. After another month of detention with no clarity on his future, he thought he was returning home.

Andry boarded a military plane and was told not to raise the window shades.

When the plane landed, instead of being back home in Venezuela, he saw the El Salvador flag. He was pulled off a bus in front of a massive fortress-like building surrounded by electric fences and dozens of watchtowers.

Trump had sent him, along with other Venezuelans, to El Salvador by invoking an 18th-century military law that allowed the deportation of people without judicial review.

“They told that we were ‘welcome’ to the CECOT, what they now call the concrete hell,” recalled Andry.

The only option was to resign himself to a suffocating cell, a bed without a mattress, and white prison clothing. He had no way to contact either his family or a lawyer. There were days that he did not know if there would be a tomorrow, due to severe hypertension and a lack of adequate medical care.

“I was being beaten, treated verbally and physically very badly. I questioned myself a lot about why I was there,” Andry said.

Inside the cells, detainees had no access to proper hygiene: each cell had only two sinks and two toilets, without any partitions. The lights in the cell were not turned off at night. The food was always the same and had to be eaten by hand.

According to Human Rights Watch, the guards took the detainees from the cells every day to search them. The deportees were forced to kneel and were beaten with kicks and fists, as well as batons.

There were ten people in their tiny cell, which was designed for 80. They were already losing their minds, but perversely prison staff told them to be grateful. Other cells like theirs held 150–200 people, they’d say.

From his first day in El Salvador, Andry felt like he had been kidnapped. Deprived of any human rights, he was trapped in a cell as if he were a dangerous criminal. However, the most difficult for him was not knowing what was happening to his family, if they even were aware he was detained in a prison for terrorists. He tried to support himself day by day by talking to his companions in the cell and recalling warm-hearted moments about his youth and family.

At CECOT, prisoners are not allowed to do any activities outside of their cells besides half an hour of physical exercise in handcuffs. During the remaining 23 and a half hours, they are left with only two Bibles per cell. That was the only thing that saved Andry, who had felt distant from God until he found himself in hell.

“All our time there passed in uncertainty, not knowing when we would have the opportunity to see light again. We were detained inside the cell every single day. They never took us out to get sun or fresh air,” Andry recalled.

His freedom was to come unexpectedly in the early morning hours of July 18, 2025, at approximately 1:30 a.m.

Andry was already sleeping because of his curfew, which required him to be in bed by 9 p.m. each night. The prison director entered, together with other officers, who were banging on the cell bars and saying to get up, bathe, and dress.

“You’re returning to your country, your hell is over,” Andry heard from the CECOT director.

They were traded for Venezuelan political prisoners and ten American detainees who were held in the country. Andry reunited with his family in Venezuela, and is now back home in Valencia.

But his arrival in Venezuela now coincides with the next stage of escalation, when the U.S. has attacked his country directly.

“There’s a bit of fear about what could happen. There’s no war or intervention where there hasn’t been some loss of human life,” he said.

At least 40 people died, including civilians, as a result of yesterday’s American attack on Caracas, the capital of Venezuela. Besides striking military infrastructure the U.S. also hit a three-story residential complex in a coastal area of the city.

Andry is currently safe with his family, but a period of political instability looms. The United States – the country which sent him to a prison hell – is now claiming that they will “run” Venezuela for the foreseeable future.

Competing claims for power in Venezuela could lead to civil war, prolonged conflict, or an even worse situation than he was trying to escape years ago.

«[The war is not] what I.. want for my country either. It would destabilize the country much more than it’s already destabilized today,” he said.

NEWS OF THE DAY:

By Oksana Stepura

Good morning to readers; Kyiv remains in Ukrainian hands.

NUMBER OF WOMEN IN ARMY SURGES: The share of female officers in the Ukrainian army has jumped from 4% to 21% over the past 2 years, Oksana Hryhorieva, the Ukrainian army’s gender adviser, told Hromadske Radio.

While women in the army have become captains and majors, due to a lack of training no woman in the army has risen to the rank of combat general.

NO STRIKE RESTRICTIONS, NO NEW WEAPONS: Following a meeting with foreign security advisers, Zelenskyy said that allies are no longer imposing restrictions on strikes inside Russia, but are instead withholding certain types of weapons from Ukraine to prevent these strikes.

Zelenskyy noted that Ukraine is currently in a phase of “use what we have”, while the equipment that partners don’t want to be used by Ukraine isn’t being delivered.

U.S. VENEZUELA ATTACK CASUALTY COUNT: At least 40 people were killed in the U.S. attack on Venezuela, according to New York Times, citing a Venezuela official. There were no U.S. casualties but about six American troops were injured during the operation which captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

The NYT’s sources in the U.S. government said that Maduro rejected an American proposal that would have allowed him to flee to Turkey. This was allegedly offered as a counter-proposal after Maduro offered the U.S. access to his country’s oil, in an attempt to prevent an American raid.

VENZUELA’S DIRTY, EXPENSIVE OIL: The infrastructure needed for peak oil production in Venezuela would cost $100 billion and take about ten years, The Washington Post reported. The challenge comes with ensuring sufficient security and stability to make such long term investments worthwhile and profitable.

The oil in the country is also a form of heavy crude which is more difficult to process and refining the oil requires more carbon emissions than other types of oil. There are also concerns about the resilience of Venezuela’s energy grid, as oil production is extremely energy-intensive.

Mr. Himes said he had spoken with Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, who had also received no phone call from the administration.
How much is it going to cost, what are the boundaries?” Mr. Jeffries, speaking on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” said he did not trust Mr. Trump to run one country, much less two.

“I’m a member of the Gang of Eight, and I have yet to get a phone call from anybody in the administration,” Representative Jim Himes, the Connecticut Democrat who serves as the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said on Sunday on CNN. The Gang of Eight refers to the Republican and Democratic leaders in the House and Senate, as well as the chairs and ranking minority members of each chamber’s intelligence committees. Together, the group is typically briefed on classified matters.

Mr. Himes said he had spoken with Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the House minority leader, who had also received no phone call from the administration.

In the wake of President Trump’s announcement on Saturday of the attack on Venezuela and the extraction of Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, Mr. Jeffries and Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat who is the Senate minority leader, called for the administration to immediately brief Congress. They asked for the administration’s plan “to prevent a humanitarian and geopolitical disaster that plunges us into another endless war or one that trades one corrupt dictator for another.”

But on Sunday, the leaders said they were still in the dark. Senator Schumer appeared on ABC’s “This Week” to outline the questions he still had about the operation.

“How long do they intend to be there?” he said. “How many troops do we need? How much is it going to cost, what are the boundaries?”

Mr. Jeffries, speaking on NBC’s “Meet The Press,” said he did not trust Mr. Trump to run one country, much less two. “Donald Trump claims that he’s going to run Venezuela,” he said. “He’s done a terrible job running the United States of America.” And he added that Democrats would prioritize taking legislative action to rein in Mr. Trump when Congress returned to Washington this week, “to ensure that no further military steps occur absent explicit congressional approval.”

During a news conference in Palm Beach, Fla., on Saturday to announce the attack on Venezuela, Mr. Trump said he had circumvented Congress because he did not trust its members to keep his plans confidential.

“Congress has a tendency to leak,” Mr. Trump said.

Lobbying & Government.,Maxwell Frost wants Congress briefed immediately on U.S. action in Venezuela - Florida Politics,Jacob Ogles,,,,,https://floridapolitics.com/archives/771535-maxwell-frost-wants-congress-briefed-immediately-on-u-s-action-in-venezuela-and-whatever-may-come-next/,"U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost says the potential for chaos in Venezuela means President Donald Trump’s administration must fully brief Congress on Nicolás Maduro’s arrest.
Indeed, he said it should have happened before military forces entered Venezuela and deposed Maduro.
Frost noted that the same administration revoked temporary protected status for Venezuelans in the U.S. while also taking military action to remove the regime.
Most international observers believe opposition leader Edmundo González rightfully won a 2024 election against Maduro, including Frost.
But I’m wary of the United States making decisions on behalf of Venezuelans,” Frost said.","U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost says the potential for chaos in Venezuela means President Donald Trump’s administration must fully brief Congress on Nicolás Maduro’s arrest.

The Orlando Democrat said that with no leadership in a major South American nation, informing Congress of future actions can’t wait. Indeed, he said it should have happened before military forces entered Venezuela and deposed Maduro.

“No. 1, as per the law, at least the Armed Services committee should be informed about these things before they happen,” he said. “The President says, ‘Well, Congress leaks.’ Well, the law doesn’t say it’s up to discretion like that.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio at a press conference cited concerns about the timeliness of the military operation in bypassing notification.

“We called members of Congress immediately after,” Rubio said. “This was not the kind of mission that you can do congressional notification on. It was a trigger-based mission in which conditions had to be met night after night. We watched and monitored that for a number of days. So it’s just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say, ‘Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days.’”

But Frost said the announced plans to only brief most of Congress over the next week ignores the continuing threat of chaos on the horizon. He pointed to developments over a matter of hours on Saturday.

The U.S. arrested Maduro overnight. In a morning press conference, Trump said the administration had conversations with Delcy Rodríguez, Maduro’s Vice President. Trump said Rodríguez told Rubio she was “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary.” But within hours, Rodríguez told state media the government would demand Maduro’s immediate release and promised that her nation would not “surrender” to the U.S.

Frost also pointed to statements from Trump that the U.S. was prepared for a “second wave if we needed to do so,” indicating potential for further military action.

“I don’t know what is going to happen,” Frost said. “We don’t know what else the President has planned.”

Frost suggested that political concerns for the President, such as his poor approval ratings and the ongoing release of files from the Jeffrey Epstein investigation, prompted the military action more than any concern for the well-being of Venezuelans. Frost noted that the same administration revoked temporary protected status for Venezuelans in the U.S. while also taking military action to remove the regime.

But Frost, like other Florida Democrats, stressed that he holds no sympathy for Maduro. Nearly half of all Venezuelans living in the U.S. live in Florida, a number that rose sharply in 2010, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

“Nicolás Maduro is a brutal dictator, who spent a decade killing, disappearing and jailing his people. On a personal note, my Mom is a refugee from Cuba who was escaping political oppression,” Frost said.

“But a lot of things can be true at once. There are a lot of people in the Venezuelan diaspora celebrating today, and the reason there is a diaspora is that there is a brutal dictatorship in Venezuela.”

He felt distressed when Trump said five times in his press conference Saturday that the U.S. will now run the nation, rather than laying out any plan for selecting new leadership in Venezuela.

Most international observers believe opposition leader Edmundo González rightfully won a 2024 election against Maduro, including Frost. Frost stopped shy of endorsing elevating Gonzalez to power, a course promoted by others like U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, but he didn’t dismiss the approach.

“I will say, of course, I think he (González) won that election and Maduro stole the election, so that makes some sense. But I also think there is something to be said about a new election being done. But I’m wary of the United States making decisions on behalf of Venezuelans,” Frost said.

“If history tells us anything about our country getting involved in Latin America, it’s not a pretty picture.”",https://floridapolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Congress_Frost_60965-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:12:29.495507

The Biden administration and the second Trump administration have recognized Mr. González’s victory.
She has spent the last year courting Mr. Trump’s support and trying to enlist his help in ousting Mr. Maduro.","Publicly, Ms. Rodríguez and the defense minister, Vladimir Padrino López, have said the government that was in place under Mr. Maduro is still in charge. In a fiery speech broadcast Sunday on state television, Mr. Padrino López channeled decades of Venezuelan nationalism and said that the country’s armed forces would “continue to employ all its available capabilities for military defense, the maintenance of internal order and the preservation of peace.”

“Our sovereignty has been violated and breached,” he said, backed by uniformed soldiers. Mr. Padrino López said that U.S. forces had killed a “large part” of Mr. Maduro’s security detail in the raid that apprehended him, part of a death toll of soldiers and civilians that rose to 80 on Sunday.

Mr. Maduro is in a Brooklyn jail with his wife, who were both indicted on federal drug trafficking and weapons charges. They are expected to make their initial appearances in federal court on Monday.

In a series of television appearances on Sunday, the U.S. secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said that the U.S. military would maintain a “quarantine” around Venezuela to prevent the entry and exit of oil tankers under American sanctions.

But though President Trump has said the United States intends to “run” Venezuela and reclaim American oil interests after ousting Mr. Maduro, Pentagon officials said that there were currently no U.S. military personnel in the country.

In an interview with CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” Mr. Rubio said that the large U.S. naval force amassed in the Caribbean Sea off Venezuela will remain “until we see changes, not just to further the national interest of the United States, which is No. 1, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.”

Trump administration officials indicated that the large U.S. military force, which includes 15,000 troops as well as aircraft and warships, was a signal to the Venezuelan authorities that they must act more favorably toward the United States or risk what Mr. Trump called a “second wave” of attacks.

Here’s what else to know:

Oil reserves: Mr. Rubio focused on Sunday, as Mr. Trump did a day earlier, on the opportunities for American companies in Venezuela’s oil sector, and on the need for Venezuelan officials to clamp down on drug trafficking. Mr. Trump made clear his desire to open up Venezuela’s vast state-controlled oil reserves to American oil companies, saying, “We are going to run the country right.” But U.S. intervention could prove complicated and expensive.

U.S. strike: At least 80 Venezuelans, including civilians and soldiers, were killed in the Caracas raid early Saturday, according to a senior Venezuelan official. No American service members were killed. Read more ›

Drug charges: An indictment unsealed by a federal judge in New York City charged Mr. Maduro, his wife, Cilia Flores, and four others with four counts, including narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine and possession of machine guns. Despite the U.S. focus on cocaine trafficking, experts say Venezuela’s role in that trade is modest. Mr. Maduro was being held at Brooklyn’s Metropolitan Detention Center, and he and Ms. Flores were expected to make their first appearance in Manhattan federal court soon. Read more ›

Protests and celebrations: Some people took to the streets of Chicago and Washington on Saturday to protest the U.S. military intervention. Venezuelan migrants in New York cheered Mr. Maduro’s removal from power. Read more ›

Nobel winner: Venezuela’s main opposition leader, María Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, posted a statement asking that her political ally, Edmundo González, be recognized as Venezuela’s president immediately. Ms. Machado had sought in recent months to curry favor with Mr. Trump, but on Saturday he said she lacked the “respect” needed to govern Venezuela.

The images, filmed on cellphones by people in different cities, captured the exact moments in which an air and ground incursion — orchestrated by the Trump administration to remove Venezuela’s authoritarian leader, Nicolás Maduro, and establish a U.S.-led interim administration — played out in real time.

The New York Times was able to verify several videos shared either on social media or directly with reporters. The Times also interviewed residents who documented the attack and provided a firsthand account of a morning that has fundamentally reordered the region’s political landscape.

Helicopters flying over Caracas as explosions rock the Venezuelan capital early Saturday. Parts of this audio were muted by The New York Times because of the number of expletives heard.

The strikes took many people by surprise in Caracas, a city that was already exhausted by crises even as the United States had spent months amassing a massive naval and air presence in the Caribbean. The incursion also startled residents in La Guaira, a strategic port city an hour’s drive from the capital that served as a primary target during the operation.

It had started as a normal Friday night in Venezuela. Residents were hanging out at homes, bars and nightclubs when the operation began in the hours after midnight. But the night’s casual atmosphere soon turned to panic.

“Something is blowing up over there!” a woman cried with expletives while filming the scene outside a restaurant in Catia la Mar, a city in La Guaira state. “They’re invading us!” Venezuelan officials would later say that U.S. strikes targeted naval infrastructure and medical warehouses in the nearby port.

“They’re invading us!” a woman shouts as flare-like lights repeatedly cross the sky in La Guaira, a port city where U.S. strikes targeted naval infrastructure and medical warehouses.

The muffled explosions filling the air first confused Roison Figuera, 29, who said he thought they were part of the final episode of the Netflix show “Stranger Things” he was watching at home.

“And another one goes off,” he said, “and I say, ‘Well, no, this is not the television.’”

He went up to the roof of his house, which has a direct view of the Port of La Guaira. He saw another explosion erupt, so he took out his cellphone.

“At first, I thought a fuel truck or a ship had exploded,” Mr. Figuera, a local journalist and dancer, said. “But then I actually thought — half-joking — I asked myself, ‘Have the Marines arrived?’”

When he heard from colleagues that similar explosions were taking place in Caracas, he realized some kind of attack was taking place.

A local journalist, Roison Figuera, filmed the Port of La Guaira right after it had been struck. “Have the Marines arrived?” he asked himself.

Closer to the port, people driving a car captured the moment in which a strike hit the ground. “Another one is coming, there it comes!” a man said right before driving past a loud bang and a massive fireball. Another explosion is heard as the car rushes down the street.

Some of the destruction was filmed by residents as they made their way through a city under siege. The precision of the strikes was visible in the ruins of the port. Cellphone footage captured fires burning behind blue-fenced facilities with shipping containers.

On the streets outside, people were starting to clear the rubble in an attempt to restore traffic to the main coastal artery of La Guaira, which connects the port with the highway that climbs up to Caracas.

Chaos also ensued in Caracas after U.S. strikes hit Fort Tiuna, a fortified military base that houses, among other things, Venezuela’s Ministry of Defense. Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were captured at the defense compound.

Armando Polachini, who lives in a residential complex next to the fort, had been kept awake by neighbors throwing a loud party. But the music was abruptly eclipsed by the thunderous roar of an explosion. When moments later the power went out — part of a cyberoperation that cut power to large swaths of the capital to allow U.S. military aircraft to approach undetected — a thought grabbed him.

“The first thing that came to mind was these are the Americans,” said Mr. Polachini, 44, the manager of a clothing brand. “I grabbed my phone and the first thing I did was try to record what was happening.”

Chaos ensued on the roads in Caracas as crowds of people tried to flee the scene after a nearby military base was hit repeatedly during the raid.

Below his balcony, crowds rushed from their apartments and into the streets, fleeing either on foot, by car or on motorcycles. Mr. Polachini decided to stay put and calm his family, who began to panic.

“It was a pretty horrible situation,” he said. “I still have it playing over and over in my mind. Over and over. The sound of the missiles — the sound of them falling.”

Hours later, after dawn broke over the coast, Mr. Figuera went to film the aftermath in La Guaira. A massive plume of smoke loomed over the port. Other Venezuelans in the greater Caracas area and nearby northern coast emerged from their homes to find their communities transformed, lining up at the few open supermarkets to try to stock up on supplies: toilet paper, precooked corn flour and canned goods.

“There is an eerie silence here,” Mr. Figuera said. “I’m kind of in shock. I don’t feel anything. I’m just waiting to see what might happen.”

U.S. forces will continue to prevent oil tankers on a U.S. sanctions list from entering and leaving the country until the government opens up the state-controlled oil industry to foreign investment — presumably giving priority to American companies — and makes other changes, he said on “Face the Nation” on CBS News.

“That remains in place, and that’s a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes, not just to further the national interest of the United States, which is No. 1, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela,” he said.

And in a testy exchange later on “Meet the Press” on NBC News, Mr. Rubio complained that people were “fixating” on Mr. Trump’s declaration at a news conference in Florida on Saturday that the U.S. government would run Venezuela. He added that “it’s not running — it’s running policy, the policy with regards to this.”

Mr. Rubio said on CBS that the U.S. naval force that Mr. Trump massed in the Caribbean Sea near Venezuela over recent months — “one of the largest naval deployments in modern history, certainly in the Western Hemisphere” — would remain in place to enforce the quasi blockade, with the aim of “paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue.”

And he added that Mr. Trump could put U.S. troops on the ground in Venezuela beyond the recent operation in which Army Delta Force soldiers seized Mr. Maduro, if it served American interests. The president “does not feel like he is going to publicly rule out options that are available for the United States,” Mr. Rubio said.

A White House official said Mr. Rubio had detailed in his interviews on Sunday what Mr. Trump had meant when he used the word “run,” and that there was no contradiction in their remarks. The officials said top Trump aides “will continue to diplomatically engage” with the current leadership in Venezuela.

Mr. Trump told The Atlantic on Sunday that if the current acting leader of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, a vice president under Mr. Maduro, “doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”

Mr. Rubio led an effort in the Trump administration to oust Mr. Maduro that was supported throughout the fall by Stephen Miller, the president’s homeland security adviser, and John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, The New York Times reported in September.

As Mr. Trump did in his news conference on Saturday, Mr. Rubio focused in his Sunday interviews on oil as the main prize for the United States in its operation against Mr. Maduro, the autocratic leader of the country who is now in detention with his wife, Cilia Flores, in Brooklyn. Mr. Trump said on Saturday that “we’re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground.”

On Sunday, Mr. Rubio told CBS News that the oil industry in Venezuela, which is controlled by the government and under U.S. sanctions, needed to be “reinvested in.”

“It’s obvious they do not have the capability to bring up that industry again,” he said. “They need investment from private companies who are only going to invest under certain guarantees and conditions.”

Mr. Rubio’s and Mr. Trump’s remarks over the weekend suggested that the administration intended to force Ms. Rodríguez to allow American oil companies to invest and operate in the country under favorable conditions.

The statements by the two men amount to an explicit declaration of gunboat diplomacy and an embrace of the kind of 19th-century U.S. imperialist policy in the Western Hemisphere that has been widely criticized across Latin America.

For years, Chevron has been the only U.S. oil company operating in Venezuela, in several joint ventures with the state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., or PDVSA. The Biden and second Trump administrations gave Chevron a license to operate there as an exception to sanctions imposed on Venezuela’s oil industry by Mr. Trump in his first term. Other American companies had a large presence over decades in the Venezuelan industry, but left the country during two periods when the government exerted state control over the ventures.

U.S. forces boarded two oil tankers last month that were transporting oil from Venezuela to Asia. The first one, the Skipper, was on a Treasury Department sanctions list for transporting Iranian oil, and a federal court had granted the Justice Department a warrant to seize the tanker based on that history. The second one, the Centuries, was not on the department’s sanctions list.

For days, the U.S. Coast Guard has been pursuing another tanker on the sanctions list, the Bella 1, which had been going to Venezuela to pick up oil. That tanker changed its flag to that of Russia and renamed itself the Marinera during the trans-Atlantic pursuit, and the Russian Foreign Ministry told the U.S. government formally on Dec. 31 to stop chasing the tanker.

The Trump administration has said all weekend that it hopes to work with Ms. Rodríguez, and Mr. Rubio deflected questions on Sunday about why it was not supporting any leadership bid by Venezuela’s main opposition figures.

He was in contact throughout last year with figures in the opposition movement. And as a senator from Florida, he signed a formal letter of support for María Corina Machado, the Venezuelan opposition leader, to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. She was awarded that prize last year, which frustrated Mr. Trump, who had been openly campaigning to win it himself.

On Saturday, Mr. Trump said in his news conference that Ms. Machado lacked the “respect” within Venezuela to govern, even though international election experts say a candidate she supported, Edmundo González, beat Mr. Maduro in a 2024 election by a wide margin. The Biden administration and the second Trump administration have recognized Mr. González’s victory.

In January 2025, right after starting his new job, Mr. Rubio spoke with both Ms. Machado and Mr. González, whom he called the “rightful president,” and “reaffirmed the United States’ support for the restoration of democracy in Venezuela,” according to a State Department summary of the call.

On Saturday, Ms. Rodríguez sounded a defiant tone, denouncing the U.S. raid against Mr. Maduro and saying he was the country’s rightful president. When asked on Sunday whether the United States could work with her, Mr. Rubio said: “We’re going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what we know of what they’ve done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward. So we’re going to find out.”

Mr. Rubio also said there were no immediate plans to send U.S. troops into Venezuela to seize other officials who have also been indicted by the U.S. Justice Department on drug trafficking charges, as Mr. Maduro was in 2020, during the first Trump administration. He said that had not been a consideration in planning for the operation to take Mr. Maduro.

Mr. Rubio said that the United States planned to ensure that Venezuela stopped trafficking drugs. The Trump administration stated last year that curbing “narco-terrorism” from Venezuela was a main reason for its campaign against the country, which has included carrying out legally questionable military strikes on boats that have killed at least 115 people.

However, Venezuela’s role in the drug trade is limited. Mr. Maduro allowed some Colombian cocaine producers to send their product through Venezuela, mainly to Europe, but the country does not produce fentanyl, which has long been Mr. Trump’s stated focus.

When asked in the NBC interview whether Communist-run Cuba, an ally of Venezuela, was the next target of the Trump administration, Mr. Rubio did not deny the possibility. He said that “the Cuban government is a huge problem” and that “they are in a lot of trouble, yes.” Mr. Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, has said for decades that the leadership of Cuba must be removed, and that toppling the Maduro “regime” in Venezuela would help lead to a transformation in Cuba.

In another interview on Sunday, on “This Week” on ABC News, Mr. Rubio said that congressional authorization of the military operation to seize Mr. Maduro was not necessary because it was “a law enforcement operation” rather than an “invasion.” He also said that notifying members of Congress ahead of the operation would have led to leaks of the military plans and endangered American soldiers.

Tyler Pager and Minho Kim contributed reporting.

This week he was back onstage, brushing off the latest U.S. escalation — a strike on a dock that the United States said was used for drug trafficking — by bouncing to an electronic beat on state television while his recorded voice repeated in English, “No crazy war.”

Mr. Maduro’s regular public dancing and other displays of nonchalance in recent weeks helped persuade some on the Trump team that the Venezuelan president was mocking them and trying to call what he believed to be a bluff, according to two of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk about the confidential discussions.

So the White House decided to follow through on its military threats.

On Saturday, an elite U.S. military team swooped into Caracas, the capital, in a pre-dawn raid and whisked Mr. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

Weeks earlier, U.S. officials had already settled on an acceptable candidate to replace Mr. Maduro, at least for the time being: Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, who had impressed Trump officials with her management of Venezuela’s crucial oil industry.

The people involved in the discussions said intermediaries persuaded the administration that she would protect and champion future American energy investments in the country.

“I’ve been watching her career for a long time, so I have some sense of who she is and what she’s about,” said one senior U.S. official, referring to Ms. Rodríguez.

“I’m not claiming that she’s the permanent solution to the country’s problems, but she’s certainly someone we think we can work at a much more professional level than we were able to do with him,” the official added, referring to Mr. Maduro.

It was an easy choice, the people said. Mr. Trump had never warmed up to the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who had organized a winning presidential campaign in 2024, earning her the Nobel Peace Prize this year. Since Mr. Trump’s re-election, Ms. Machado has gone out of her way to please him, calling him a “champion of freedom,” mimicking his talking points on election fraud in the United States and even dedicating her Peace Prize to him.

It was in vain. On Saturday, Mr. Trump said he would accept Ms. Rodríguez, saying that Ms. Machado lacked the “respect” needed to govern Venezuela.

U.S. officials say that their relationship with Ms. Rodríguez’s interim government will be based on her ability to play by their rules, adding that they reserve the right to take additional military action if she fails to respect America’s interests. Despite Ms. Rodríguez’s public condemnation of the attack, a senior U.S. official said that it was too soon to draw conclusions about what her approach would be and that the administration remained optimistic that they could work with her.

Mr. Trump declared on Saturday that the United States intended to “run” Venezuela for an unspecified period and reclaim U.S. oil interests, an extraordinary assertion of unilateral, expansionist power after more narrow, and also contested, arguments about stopping the flow of drugs.

In Ms. Rodríguez, the Trump administration would be engaging a leader of a government that it had routinely labeled illegitimate, while abandoning Ms. Machado, whose movement won a presidential election last year in a victory widely recognized as stolen by Mr. Maduro.

And it was not immediately clear if Ms. Rodriguez would even play along. In a televised address, she accused the United States of making an illegal invasion and asserted that Mr. Maduro remained Venezuela’s legitimate leader.

To retain leverage, senior U.S. officials said, restrictions on Venezuelan oil exports would remain in place for now.

But others involved in the talks expressed hope that the administration would stop detaining Venezuelan oil tankers and issue more permits for U.S. companies to work in Venezuela in order to revive the economy and give Ms. Rodríguez a shot at political success.

Ms. Rodríguez, 56, arrives at the job of Venezuela’s interim leader with credentials of an economic troubleshooter who orchestrated the country’s shift from corrupt socialism to similarly corrupt laissez-faire capitalism.

She is the daughter of a Marxist guerrilla who won fame for kidnapping an American businessman. She was educated partly in France, where she specialized in labor law.

She held middling government posts in the government of Mr. Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chávez, before being promoted to bigger roles with the help of her older brother Jorge Rodríguez, who eventually became Mr. Maduro’s chief political strategist.

Ms. Rodríguez managed to stabilize the Venezuelan economy after years of crisis and slowly but steadily grow the country’s oil production amid tightening U.S. sanctions, a feat that earned her even the grudging respect of some American officials.

As Ms. Rodríguez consolidated control over economic policy and eliminated rivals, she built bridges with Venezuela’s economic elites, foreign investors and diplomats, to whom she presented herself as a soft-spoken technocrat and a contrast to the burly security officials forming most of the rest of Mr. Maduro’s inner circle.

Those alliances have borne fruit in recent months, earning her powerful champions that helped to cement her rise to power. On Saturday, her assumption of power was greeted with cautious optimism by some of Venezuela’s captains of industry, who said in private that she had the skills to create growth, if she could persuade the United States to relax its chokehold on the country’s economy.

For all her technocratic leanings, Ms. Rodríguez has never denounced the brutal repression and corruption sustaining Mr. Maduro’s rule, once calling her decision to join the government an act of “personal revenge” for her father’s death in prison in 1976, after being interrogated by intelligence agents from pro-U.S. governments.

Ms. Rodríguez’s capacity for negotiating across Venezuela’s ideological chasm could prove useful in easing tensions. Juan Francisco García, a former ruling party lawmaker who has since broken with the government, said he had some apprehensions about her ability to govern but gave her the benefit of the doubt.

“History is full of sectors and figures linked to dictators who have, at some point, served as a bridge to stabilize the country and transition to a democratic scenario,” Mr. García said.

The contradictions enveloping Ms. Rodríguez were on display on Saturday when she addressed the nation.

While Mr. Trump said that Ms. Rodríguez had been sworn in as Venezuela’s new president, it was clear that Mr. Maduro’s supporters — including Ms. Rodríguez herself if her remarks are taken at face value — still see him as Venezuela’s leader.

Spotlighting the potential challenges ahead, even the text on Venezuelan state television labeled her as vice president. People close to the government said those displays of loyalty were a necessary public relations strategy to pacify the ruling party loyalists, including in the armed forces and paramilitary groups, who were reeling from the military humiliation inflicted by the United States on their country and the destruction and death caused by the attack. At least 40 Venezuelans died, both civilians and soldiers, according to a senior Venezuelan official.

U.S. forces managed to descend into the capital largely unopposed, destroy at least three military bases and grab the country’s president from a heavily guarded compound, without any loss of American life.

Still, the Trump administration has chosen to give Mr. Maduro’s vice president a chance and to pass over Ms. Machado, who won the Nobel Prize and had at least some allies in Mr. Trump’s circle.

Ms. Machado, a conservative former member of the National Assembly from an affluent Venezuelan family, boasts decades-long ties to Washington.

She has spent the last year courting Mr. Trump’s support and trying to enlist his help in ousting Mr. Maduro. She has openly supported his military campaign in the Caribbean and mostly refrained from commenting on his policies toward Venezuelan migrants.

On Saturday, after Mr. Trump announced that the U.S. military had captured Mr. Maduro, she released a statement saying that she was ready to lead. “Today we are prepared to assert our mandate and seize power,” she wrote in a message she posted on X.

But roughly two hours later, Mr. Trump said they had not spoken. It would be “very tough” for Ms. Machado to take control of her country, Mr. Trump said, adding in his televised speech that she was a “very nice woman” but “doesn’t have the support” in Venezuela to lead.

A spokeswoman for Ms. Machado declined to comment.

“For Trump, democracy is not a concern — it is about money, power, and protecting the homeland from drugs and criminals,” said Michael Shifter, a senior fellow at the Inter-American Dialogue, a research institute in Washington.

In his speech to the nation, Mr. Trump also made no mention of Edmundo González, the retired diplomat who became Ms. Machado’s political surrogate after she was barred from running. Mr. González, who is in self-imposed exile in Spain, is considered the legitimate winner, by a wide margin, of the 2024 election, even though Venezuelan authorities handed the victory to Mr. Maduro.

Eric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington, and María Victoria Fermín , Mariana Martínez and Isayen Herrera from Caracas, Venezuela.

Americans took to the streets of Chicago and Washington on Saturday to protest the U.S. military intervention in Venezuela, even as Venezuelan migrants in New York gathered to celebrate the removal of Nicolás Maduro from power.

Holding signs that read “No Blood for Oil,” “No U.S. War on Venezuela” and “Hands Off Latin America,” a crowd of several hundred people gathered in Federal Plaza in Chicago as night fell. They called the operation to remove Nicolás Maduro, the ousted Venezuelan leader, an act of imperialism that Americans did not vote for, carried out without required Congressional approval.

“I’m 37 and grew up with the Iraq wars,” said Katrina Denny. “This morning, I was like, ‘Oh my God, we’re doing it again.’”

She said she thought that protests would grow if the Trump administration continued to use military force in Venezuela. “They filled half the plaza tonight on short notice, but this is only the beginning,” she said. “If this continues, I’m sure there will be many more events and larger ones.”

Many protesters expressed suspicion of the White House’s motives. “If Maduro wasn’t legally elected, that’s not for us to say,” said Adela Cruz, 51. “It just seems like a ploy to get oil.”

Jonny Bishop, 28, said he was worried for the men and women in the military. “As someone who teaches high school, my kids are the ones who may have to go to war,” he said, adding that with all of the other problems facing Americans, “going to war is the last thing we need.”

After the rally in Federal Plaza, the Chicago police allowed protesters to march up Dearborn Street to Wacker Drive, near Trump Tower Chicago.

In Washington, people on both sides of the issue gathered for separate afternoon rallies near the White House.

At one of them, dozens of opponents of the intervention chanted anti-Trump slogans. One of the organizers, Morgan Artyukhina, 38, said their message was “that this is a war that is being waged by the Trump administration, not just in contravention of U.S. law and international law, but also, falsely in the name of the American people.”

A few blocks away, a smaller group celebrated the capture of Mr. Maduro by U.S. troops.

Draped in a Venezuelan flag, Leonardo Angulo, 35, danced near a statue of Simón Bolivar, who helped free Venezuela from Spanish imperial rule. Mr. Angulo, who has lived in the United States for eight years, said he and his family came out “to celebrate, and gather with my people, because we share this feeling, this feeling of joy, of happiness, of hope most of all.”

Still, there was an undercurrent of anxiety, which one person in the crowd attributed to concerns that federal agents would appear and detain the Venezuelans present at the rally.

In New York, Venezuelan migrants described a mix of euphoria, relief and guarded hope after years of exile.

Beatriz Hernández danced in Times Square as a group of 100 gathered in Midtown, waving flags and calling family members back home.

Ms. Hernández, 60, said the moment felt transformative for the Venezuelan diaspora forced to emigrate because of poverty and lack of freedom during Maduro’s administration.

“It’s a great joy, the news we received,” said Ms. Hernández, who is originally from Maracaibo, Venezuela. “We haven’t slept since 3 a.m. It’s almost 6 p.m. and I don’t think we’ll be sleeping anytime soon because of the adrenaline.”

Ms. Hernández arrived in New York four years ago after a long journey that she said included crossing the Darién Gap on foot before reaching the U.S. border, where she requested asylum.

“The news is a hope of being able to return safely to our country,” she said. “I think that now I will be able to see my daughters who stayed there, and that in the not-too-distant future I will be able to return to my country and hug my sister.”

Lucia Coronel, 30, who is originally from Maracay, left Venezuela nine years ago and first emigrated to Colombia. She arrived in New York, where she requested asylum, three years ago.

“Now I don’t care about asylum,” Coronel said. “I feel a relief that opens up the possibility of returning to our homes voluntarily and safely. We didn’t emigrate by choice, we emigrated out of necessity.”

Other Venezuelans were more measured.

“We’ve gone through sadness and joy,” said Kimberly Castillo, 32, who is also from Maracay. “Sadness because nobody wants to see their country being bombed by another country. We are sad about the people who were caught in the middle, but are joyous knowing now there is the possibility for better times for my country.”

The Pulitzer Prize-winning team seeks to present the true facts, unaffected by agenda or biases.

President Donald Trump said a U.S. military assault succeeded in capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, both facing U.S. charges related to cocaine trafficking under newly unsealed indictments.

In a Jan. 3 press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump said the U.S. would ""run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.""

Trump also said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodríguez was sworn in as interim president. Trump said Rodríguez had talked to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was ""essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.""

However, Rodríguez criticized the U.S. military action as ""brutal aggression"" on state television and called for Maduro’s immediate release.

Maduro, an authoritarian, has led Venezuela since 2013, succeeding an ideological ally, Hugo Chávez, who had been in office since 1999. Under both men, U.S. relations with Venezuela frayed over foreign policy, oil and human rights.

In July 2024, Maduro declared victory following an election that international observers described as fraudulent. The country’s opposition candidate, Edmundo González Urrutia, received about 70% of the vote.

Tensions between Trump and Maduro escalated in September after the U.S. government began attacking vessels off the coast of Venezuela, killing more than 100 people, in what Trump described as an effort to thwart drug smuggling.

When a reporter asked Trump during the Mar-a-Lago press event whether he’d spoken to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado following Maduro’s arrest, Trump said Machado ""doesn't have the support or the respect within the country.""

Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy in Venezuela, had a 72% approval rating from Venezuelans according to a March poll by ClearPath Strategies.

Trump said without evidence that the United States’ role in governing Venezuela ""won’t cost us anything"" because U.S. oil companies would invest in new infrastructure in the oil-rich country. ""It’s going to make a lot of money,"" Trump said.

Here, we fact-checked Trump’s and Rubio’s statements from the press conference.

Rubio: ""It’s just not the kind of mission that you can pre-notify (Congress about) because it endangers the mission.""

The administration’s lack of warning to Congress bucks laws and precedents.

Rubio said members of Congress were not notified in advance. Trump said the administration was concerned about Congress potentially leaking news of the administration’s decision to capture Maduro.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., praised the operation as a ""decisive action.""

But Congressional Democrats said Congress should have been notified in advance. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said, ""Maduro is terrible. But Trump put American servicemembers at risk with this unauthorized attack.""

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said Trump and his cabinet were not forthcoming about their intentions for regime change, so ""we are left with no understanding of how the administration is preparing to mitigate risks to the U.S. and we have no information regarding a long-term strategy following today’s extraordinary escalation.""

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the right to declare war. The last time that happened was for World War II.

Since then, presidents have generally initiated military action using their constitutionally granted powers as commander in chief without an official declaration of war.

Since Congress passed the 1973 War Powers Resolution, the president has had to report to Congress within 48 hours of introducing the U.S. military into hostilities and terminate the use of the military within 60 days unless Congress approves. If approval is not granted and the president deems it an emergency, an additional 30 days are granted for ending operations.

In recent decades, congressional consent has usually been granted through an authorization for the use of military force. But an authorization has not been passed for operations in Venezuela. Kaine and other lawmakers have pursued legislation — so far fruitlessly — to prohibit the use of federal funds for any use of military force in or against Venezuela without Congressional authorization.

The Trump administration has whittled away at prior notification requirements. Under federal law, eight bipartisan, senior members of Congress must receive prior notice of particularly sensitive covert actions. In June 2025, the administration told Republicans, but not Democrats, about the forthcoming U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. For the Venezuela operation, it appears no lawmakers were notified in advance.

Trump: Each U.S. boat strike off the coast of Venezuela saves 25,000 people.

Pants on Fire!

The Trump administration has struck at least 32 vessels killing about 115 people in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean since September. Trump said previously that the boats were carrying drugs en route to the U.S. and during the press conference he said the drugs on each boat would kill ""on average, 25,000 people.""

However, experts on drugs and Venezuela told PolitiFact the country plays a minor role in trafficking drugs that reach the U.S. And the administration has provided no evidence about the type or quantity of drugs it says were on the boats. This lack of information makes it impossible to know how many lethal doses of the drugs could have been destroyed.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 73,000 U.S. drug overdose deaths from May 2024 to April 2025. That means the drugs on 32 boats would have been responsible for 800,000 deaths, nearly 11 times the number of U.S. overdose deaths in one year.

Trump: ""Maduro sent savage and murderous gangs, including the bloodthirsty prison gang Tren de Aragua, to terrorize American communities nationwide.""

There is no evidence Maduro sent members of Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua to the U.S.

The U.S. Justice Department indictment against Maduro does not mention Trump’s statement.

An April report from the federal National Intelligence Council contradicted Trump’s statements about links between Maduro and Tren de Aragua.

""While Venezuela's permissive environment enables (Tren de Aragua) to operate, the Maduro regime probably does not have a policy of cooperating with TDA and is not directing TDA movement to and operations in the United States,"" the report said.

Trump: Venezuela ""stole"" U.S oil in the past.

This needs context.

In the early 20th century, Venezuela’s long-serving dictator, Juan Vicente Gómez, allowed foreign companies almost exclusive access to the country’s oil resources.

In 1975, after decades of seeking greater control of its oil resources, Venezuela nationalized its oil industry.

""Trump’s claim that Venezuela has stolen oil and land from the U.S. is baseless,"" Francisco Rodríguez, a Venezuelan economist at the University of Denver, told the Washington Post. ""The U.S. was much more interested in having Venezuela be a provider of oil — relatively cheap oil — than to have a production collapse in Venezuela,"" Rodríguez said. As a result, the change was ""relatively uncontroversial"" at the time.

U.S. oil companies, including Exxon and Mobil and Gulf, now Chevron, lost about $5 billion each in assets and were compensated $1 billion each, according to news reports, the Post reported.

But Rodríguez said the companies didn’t push for additional compensation at the time, in part because no forum existed to do so.

In general, experts have told PolitiFact that invading a country to take its oil would be both illegal and unethical. In 2016, Trump mused about how the U.S. should have taken Iraq’s oil when it invaded to oust Saddam Hussein.

Experts pointed to the Annex to the Hague Convention of 1907 on the Laws and Customs of War, which says that ""private property ... must be respected (and) cannot be confiscated."" It also says that ""pillage is formally forbidden.""

""If ‘to the victors go the spoils’ was legal doctrine, then we would have believed that (then-Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein) should have been able to keep Kuwait City after he invaded"" in 1990, terrorism analyst Daveed Gartenstein-Ross told PolitiFact in 2016. ""But we viewed that — quite rightly — as an act of aggression under the U.N. Charter.""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/846ecf6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5765x3027+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2Fe4%2Fd761dce8425ab9acf3086a0e21cc%2Ftrump-us-venezuela-26003648894364.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 18:12:33.795616

In a report in the Washington Post, the warehouse is part of the Trump administration’s effort to seek contractors to “help it overhaul the United States’ immigrant detention system in a plan that includes renovating industrial warehouses to hold more than 80,000 immigrant detainees at a time.”

“Rather than shuttling detainees around the country to wherever detention space is available, as happens now, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement aims to speed up deportations by establishing a deliberate feeder system,” the Post reported the documents as saying. “Newly arrested detainees would be booked into processing sites for a few weeks before being funneled into one of seven large-scale warehouses holding 5,000 to 10,000 people each, where they would be staged for deportation.”",https://www.dailyfreeman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DFN-L-pat-ryan-hed-01.jpg?w=1024&h=575,N,,2026-01-04 12:57:07.149759

11 October Hasan Ali Moh’D Saleh, 67, died after being detained at the Krome detention center in south-west Miami-Dade county.","Thirty-one people died in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody in 2025 – making it the agency’s deadliest year in more than two decades, as the Trump administration moved to detain a record number of people.

Some of those who died in detention had arrived in the US recently, seeking asylum. Others had arrived years ago, some as young children. Some had been apprehended on criminal charges or had served time for convictions; others had been picked up in the administration’s indiscriminate ICE raids.

They died of seizure and heart failure, stroke, respiratory failure, tuberculosis or suicide. Some died at ICE detention centers and field offices, others after they had been transferred to hospitals, but were still under ICE custody. In some cases, their families and lawyers have alleged, they died of neglect, after repeatedly trying and failing to get medical care.

These deaths occurred as the Trump administration ramped up its immigration operations, detaining a record number of people in December. The agency was holding 68,440 people in detention in mid-December; nearly 75% of them had no criminal convictions. December was also the deadliest month in ICE custody – six people died.

As detention facilities across the US grow more crowded, human rights advocates, immigration lawyers and lawmakers have reported unsanitary conditions, inadequate food and poor medical care. The number of deaths this year marks the highest level since 2004.

“This is a result of the deteriorating conditions inside of ICE detention,” said Setareh Ghandehari, advocacy director at Detention Watch Network, a non-profit that has been tracking immigration detention deaths for years.

The Department of Homeland Security, which encompasses ICE, denied that conditions in detention were declining. “It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody,” said Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the agency. She added that the average rate of death remained low, saying that “consistent with data over the last decade, death rates in custody are 0.00007%”, but did not provide the underlying data for that figure.

Advocates, however, warned that as the administration detains more people, ICE facilities will continue to see more deaths.

“I’m definitely worried that in the coming years, we could see more of this as ICE is trying to expand its facilities, detain and deport more people,” said Ghandehari.

The Guardian has been tracking everyone who died in custody this year. These are their stories.

23 January

Genry Ruiz Guillén, 29, of Honduras, died in a hospital in Hialeah, Florida.

Guillén had come to the United States from Honduras in 2023. He worked in construction.

In October 2024, he was apprehended by local law enforcement, and then transferred to the Krome immigrant detention center in South Florida. His mother told Univision that in December, Guillén called her from detention and told her he wasn’t feeling well, and that he was experiencing fainting spells. It was the last time she spoke with him, she said.

According to ICE, Guillén “had difficulty breathing, prompting a medical emergency” before he died.

“I never thought my son would come to this country to die like this, nor did I ever think I would receive that news,” his mother told Univision.

29 January

Serawit Gezahegn Dejene, 45, of Ethiopia, died at a hospital in Phoenix, Arizona.

He had come to the US in August 2024, and was apprehended by the border patrol, which transferred him to the Eloy detention center. He had cleared the initial steps to apply for asylum according to ICE.

In December 2024, he reported to staff at the detention center that he had an elevated heart rate and fatigue, and was seen by healthcare providers who said he had a possible lymphoma diagnosis, according to ICE.

20 February

Maksym Chernyak, a Ukrainian citizen, died of an apparent stroke at a hospital in Miami.

Chernyak, 44, fled Kyiv with his long term-partner during the Russia-Ukraine war and came to the US on humanitarian parole, according to the Miami Herald.

Chernyak was arrested on 26 January over a domestic violence claim. His partner described the incident as a “family misunderstanding” exacerbated by a language barrier, according to the Miami Herald. He was “kind and warm-hearted”, she told the outlet. Chernyak was then transferred to the Krome detention center in Miami.

While in custody, he experienced “vomiting and seizure activity”, according to ICE. Chernyak was then transferred to a hospital on 18 February, where staff “established a stroke alert due to unresponsive state”, according to ICE. A preliminary cause of death was listed as “bleeding from the brain”.

An investigation by the Miami Herald said that medical experts who reviewed his case have raised concerns about whether Chernyak received adequate care due to the length of time that elapsed before Krome staff called 911. ICE denied allegations that Chernyak did not receive proper medical attention.

23 February

Juan Alexis Tineo-Martinez, 44, of the Dominican Republic, died at the Centro Medico hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

He was taken into custody by US Customs and Border Protection air marine operations two days prior to his death, according to ICE.

Agents contacted local 911 after Tineo-Martinez said he was experiencing leg pain, according to the agency, and he was transferred to the hospital for evaluation. The Dominican embassy in Puerto Rico did not respond to the Guardian’s query about Tineo-Martinez’s cause of death.

8 April

Brayan Garzón-Rayo, 27, of Colombia, died at the Phelps county jail in Rolla, Missouri.

Garzón-Rayo’s mother, Lucy Garzón, told St Louis Public Radio that she and her family came to the US in November 2023, fleeing growing threats of violence and harassment from law enforcement in Bogotá.

In March Garzón-Rayo was charged with a misdemeanor for credit card fraud, and then transferred to ICE custody. He spoke to his mother a few days before he died, Lucy Garzón told SLPR, and complained about stomach pains and the poor quality of the jail’s food.

Lucy Garzón told SLPR that officials told her that her son appeared to have died by suicide. ICE has not confirmed an official cause of death.

His mother said that Garzón-Rayo loved riding his motorcycle, watching soccer and sledding after fresh snowfall.

16 April

Nhon Ngoc Nguyen, 55, died at a hospital in El Paso, Texas.

He was apprehended in February in Albuquerque, according to his family’s lawyer, Tin Nguyen, and his partner and friends couldn’t locate him for days. Eventually, they realised he was being held at the El Paso processing center in Texas. Tin Nguyen said that Nhon Ngoc had been showing early signs of dementia and possible side effects from a head injury prior to his detention.

Shortly after his detention, he began experiencing health complications, Tin Nguyen told the Guardian. ICE eventually offered to release him, so long as his family was able to provide him with round-the-clock acute care, the attorney said – but he didn’t have health insurance and his family was unable to pay for such care. In the meantime, Nhon Ngoc’s condition began rapidly worsening. He died of acute pneumonia, according to ICE.

Nhon Ngoc had come to the US in 1983 and became a legal resident as part of the Refugee Act of 1980. In 1991, he was convicted of second-degree murder and served time at San Quentin prison, in California. After his sentence, in 2013 ICE opened a deportation case against him. While it was pending, he moved to Albuquerque and began rebuilding his life.

He had a loving partner and a huge community of friends, Tin Nguyen said: “He was kind.”

25 April

Marie Ange Blaise, a 44-year-old citizen of Haiti, died at the Broward transitional center in Pompano Beach, Florida.

Blaise entered the US on an unknown date and location, according to ICE. She was apprehended by Customs and Border Protection on 12 February while attempting to board a flight to Charlotte, North Carolina, according to authorities.

ICE has not released an official cause of death. According to reporting by WLRN Public Media on the medical examiner’s report about her death, Blaise spoke to her son hours before she died. “She complained of having chest pains and abdominal cramps, and when she asked the detention staff to see a physician, they refused her,” her son told investigators, according to WLRN Public Media. According to the outlet, ICE offered a conflicting account, saying that Blaise did not take blood pressure medication she was offered.

5 May

Abelardo Avellaneda Delgado, 68, died while in transit from a local jail to a federal detention center, the first detainee to die in this manner in at least a decade.

Delgado was originally from El Huariche, Mexico. During his nearly 40 years in the US, he raised a large family and worked on tobacco and vegetable farms, according to previous Guardian reporting.

Delgado, who did not have legal status, was apprehended in Statenville, Georgia, on a parole violation on 9 April. His family told the Guardian they grew alarmed by his deterioration in jail, and worried about the medications he was being given.

Eventually, Delgado was transferred from the jail to Georgia’s Stewart detention center. But he never made it. Instead, he became “unresponsive” in the transport van with highly elevated blood pressure; the driver called 911, but Delgado died on the scene.

ICE has said the cause of death is under investigation and his family said they are still waiting for answers. “It bothers me,” his son, Junior, told the Guardian in June. “He was a great-grandfather.”

7 June

Jesus Molina-Veya, a 45-year-old citizen of Mexico, died at the Stewart detention center in Lumpkin, Georgia.

Molina-Veya entered the country without authorization on numerous occasions, starting in 1999, according to authorities. During his time in the US, Molina-Veya was arrested on charges including child molestation, a hit-and-run and possession of controlled substances, ICE said.

On 7 June, Molina-Veya was found unresponsive in his cell. While an official cause of death has not been released, an ICE spokesperson has called the death “an apparent suicide”. His death was the second reported in Georgia within a month, a state with one of the highest numbers of detainees in the US.

23 June

Johnny Noviello was found unresponsive at the Bureau of Prisons’ federal detention center in Miami.

Noviello moved with family from Quebec to Florida in 1988 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1991. His father, Angelo, told the Guardian that Johnny was diagnosed with epilepsy shortly after he was born, and would often become ill during the winter. So the family settled in Daytona Beach, seeking a warmer climate.

Noviello, 49, spent most of his life in Florida. He worked at a Dollar Tree and loved going to the beach and playing pool in his spare time, his father said. He maintained close ties to Canada, making regular trips to see family in Montreal.

He spent time in prison for selling drugs, including hydrocodone and oxycodone, but was released early on good behavior. He was apprehended by ICE agents on 15 May at the Florida department of corrections probation office. Noviello’s cause of death is under investigation.

Noviello’s father said the family has not received an autopsy report. “We’re in limbo, we don’t know what happened,” he said. “I don’t know why they didn’t send him to Canada right away.”

26 June

Isidro Pérez, 75, of Cuba died at a Florida hospital of undetermined causes.

According to the Miami Herald, Pérez was a mechanic and fisher from Cuba, and arrived in the US in 1966 at the age of 16.

He was convicted of marijuana possession in the 1980s and served time in prison. His stepdaughter told the Herald that, during his time behind bars, Pérez studied to become a mechanic, and that when he got out of prison, he began rescuing animals. “We’re all humans, you know, we make mistakes, but we remake ourselves,” she told the outlet.

On 5 June, five immigration officers apprehended Pérez at a community center. Officers took him to the Krome north service processing center in Miami. Three weeks later, Pérez died in ICE custody.

19 July

Tien Xuan Phan, 55, died at the Methodist hospital north-east in Live Oak, Texas.

Phan was detained earlier in June for failing to leave the US after a removal order, and held at the Karnes county immigration processing center in Karnes City. He was transferred to a hospital for evaluation after experiencing seizures and vomiting, and becoming unresponsive, according to ICE. His cause of death remains under investigation.

5 August

Chaofeng Ge, 32, of China, died four days after entering ICE custody in Pennsylvania.

Ge was born in 1992 in Luoyang, Henan province, China, and worked in construction. He arrived in the US via the southern border in 2023, when he was detained for unlawful entry. According to an attorney for his family, he spent his time while incarcerated trying to learn English, practicing by writing out scripture and short stories.

He was eventually released and settled in Queens, New York, where he worked as a delivery driver, according to his attorney. In 2025, he was arrested for possessing several stolen credit card numbers in his cell phone and for unauthorized access to a device, and was eventually detained by ICE. ICE and the Pennsylvania state police said that he died by suicide while detained.

His family filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security in the southern district of New York, requesting more information about his death. “I am devastated by the loss of my brother and by the knowledge that he was suffering so greatly in that detention center,” said Yaofeng Ge in a public statement. “He did not deserve to be treated that way. I want justice for my brother, answers as to how this could have happened, and accountability for those responsible for his death.”

Ge is survived by four siblings and his parents, who live in China.

31 August

Lorenzo Antonio Batrez Vargas, 32, died after he was detained at the Central Arizona Florence correctional complex.

Known as “Lenchito” by friends and family, Batrez Vargas was a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) recipient who was brought to the US from Mexico as a five-year-old. He was arrested by police in Flagstaff, Arizona, on 2 August, and charged with possession and use of drug paraphernalia. Immigration enforcement agents said they took Batrez Vargas into custody in Phoenix before transferring him to the detention center in Florence, where his family believes he contracted Covid-19, according to media reports.

ICE said that his cause of death was unknown and remained under investigation.

“We want justice. We want this to never happen to anyone else, especially not to undocumented immigrants,” Jaime Vargas, Batrez Vargas’s uncle, told Univision.

8 September

Oscar Rascon Duarte, of Mexico, died at a long-term medical facility while in ICE custody.

Duarte, 58, had first come to the US in 1976, was deported in 2004 and then re-entered via the southern border. He served a 20-year sentence in prison for attempted sexual contact with a minor and child molestation. After he completed his sentence, he was transferred to ICE custody.

At first, he was held at the Florence staging facility, according to ICE, but was later transferred to Promise hospital in Mesa, Arizona, “due to late-stage Alzheimer disease, right kidney cancer, and hepatitis C all of which required a higher level of care”, where he eventually died, ICE said.

18 September

Santos Banegas Reyes, 42, of Honduras, died at the Nassau county correctional center in New York.

He was a construction worker and a father of two daughters, one of whom lives in the US while the other lives in Honduras, according to local news reports.

He was apprehended on 17 September by federal immigration agents just hours before he was found “not breathing” in his cell at the Nassau county correctional center. According to ICE, the preliminary cause of death appeared to be liver failure complicated by alcoholism. His family is contesting his cause of death, and have requested an independent autopsy.

22 September

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39, died after falling ill at the Adelanto detention center in California.

His mother, Lucía Uribe, told the Guardian that Ismael had come to the US from Mexico when he was five, crossing the US southern border along with his sister and cousin to join his mother and father. The family settled in Westminster, California, and later moved to Huntington Beach.

He spent a year studying graphic design, and then began working – first at a factory that produced cleaning supplies and later at car washes. Lucía said that Ismael loved listening to music. He was always willing to help others, and often helped his sister, a single mother, with childcare.

Uribe had been protected from deportation under the Daca program, but he was denied renewal because he had been convicted of driving under the influence.

He was apprehended in August during an immigration raid at the Fountain Valley Auto Wash, where he had worked for about 15 years, and was transferred to Adelanto. There, he fell ill – first with a cough and fever, and then other medical complications, according to his family. He was transferred to a hospital, where he died.

His mother learned of the detention through one of his co-workers, and said she was unaware of any medical condition he had. “I want to see less medical negligence,” she told the Guardian, referring to conditions at ICE detention centers.

ICE said Uribe’s cause of death was “still under investigation”.

24 September

Norlan Guzman-Fuentes, 37, of El Salvador, was killed when a gunman opened fire at the ICE field office where he was being held.

He is survived by his partner, Berenice Prieto, and four children. He had worked mowing lawns and trimming trees, and in his free time he liked fishing around the Dallas-Forth Worth area, his loved ones told CBS.

Guzman-Fuentes was arrested by Dallas police in late August, due to an outstanding warrant for driving under the influence and other charges that were later dropped.

“We had just bought our first home together, and he worked hard every single day to make sure our children had what they needed. His death is a senseless tragedy that has left our family shattered,” Prieto said in a public statement shortly after his death. “I do not know how to explain to our children that their father is gone.”

29 September

Miguel Ángel García Medina, 31, of Mexico, was killed outside an ICE field office in Dallas.

García Medina is survived by his wife, Stephany Gauffeny, two stepdaughters and a son – who was born three days after his death – his mother and grandparents, who live in Mexico, and three siblings.

“Everyone tells me the same thing: he was very funny. He always made us laugh, and that’s why we miss him so much,” Gauffeny told the Guardian. “He was very goofy, you almost always saw him laughing, joking or singing.”

Gauffeny – who clarified to the Guardian that her husband was referred to in an ICE press release as Miguel García-Hernández, his stepfather’s last name – also said: “He was a very present father. Sometimes he wouldn’t go to work if my daughters needed something.”

García Medina was born in San Luis Potosí, a central state in Mexico, and crossed the US border without papers when he was a teenager, settling in Arlington, Texas. He met Gauffeny at a party shortly after and the two were friends for years before they became a couple.

He had lived in the Dallas area for nearly two decades, most recently making a living painting and remodeling homes. In his free time, he liked to work on his truck, Gauffeny said.

He ended up in ICE custody early on 24 September, after a short time in jail for a DUI. While he was shackled inside a government van outside the ICE field office, a gunman opened fire. He died five days later of his gunshot wounds.

He would have turned 32 on 5 January, which is also the day of his 10th wedding anniversary. Gauffeny told the Guardian that he had been in the process of obtaining a green card and planning to open his own painting company. “He made business cards and said he was going to buy the equipment,” she said. “He was so excited and had a lot going for him.”

29 September

Huabing Xie, of China, died at El Centro regional medical center in Calexico, California.

The border patrol had apprehended Xie on 12 September in Indio, California, and transferred him to the Imperial regional detention facility, according to ICE. In 2023, he had been placed under removal proceedings, the agency said.

The agency said that Xie experienced “what appeared to be a seizure and became unresponsive” and medical personnel at the detention center tried to administer life-saving measures, before emergency medical services arrived and took him to the hospital, where he died.

4 October

Leo Cruz-Silva, a 34-year-old man from Mexico, died while detained by ICE at the Ste Genevieve county jail in Missouri.

A few days before he died, he was detained by police in Festus, Missouri, for public intoxication, according to federal immigration officials. The police then handed him over to ICE, which served him with a notice that the agency would reinstate a previous deportation order. Cruz-Silva had likely entered the US before 2010, when he was a child, according to immigration officials, and was expelled twice after re-entering via the southern border.

On 4 October, Cruz-Silva died by apparent suicide, according to ICE.

About 50 people organized a vigil to mourn him. “He was a person, he was a brother, he was a son, he was a person,” Susie Johnson, the founder of Abide in Love, a non-profit that works with ICE detainees in Missouri jails, told St Louis Public Radio. “All loss of life, in my opinion, is tragic, and I hate that it happened in our community,” she said.

11 October

Hasan Ali Moh’D Saleh, 67, died after being detained at the Krome detention center in south-west Miami-Dade county.

Saleh, who was from Jordan, first came to the US in 1994 and became a lawful permanent resident a few months after he arrived in the country.

Saleh managed a convenience store in Fort Lauderdale. In 2017, he was charged – along with a dozen other clerks and store owners – in a scheme to exchange food stamps for cash. He had served time in prison, and after his release in 2020, ICE placed him under an “order of supervision” that required him to regularly check in with immigration officers. In 2025, he was apprehended and placed at Krome.

He was taken to a local hospital due to a high fever, and became unresponsive. A physician listed his preliminary cause of death as cardiac arrest.

23 October

Josué Castro Rivera, a 25-year-old man from Honduras, was killed while trying to flee ICE agents in Virginia.

He had been on his way to a gardening job when ICE agents pulled over his vehicle, his brother, Henry Castro, told reporters. When agents tried to detain Castro Rivera and three other passengers, he fled, running into traffic. He was struck while crossing Interstate 264 in Norfolk.

According to his brother, Castro Rivera had come to the US four years ago, and had been working to help support family in Honduras. “He had a very good heart,” Castro told the Associated Press. “He didn’t deserve everything that happened to him.”

23 October

Gabriel Garcia Aviles, a 54-year-old from Mexico who had been living in the US for 30 years, died about a week after being detained by immigration agents.

Aviles was a father of two and grandfather of three, according to his family. His daughter, Mariel, told LA Taco she used to speak with him every day, and described him as someone who was “always happy and loved bikes”.

Customs and Border Protection agents grabbed him during a “roving patrol” in the southern California city of Costa Mesa on 14 October. Mariel last spoke with him shortly after he was apprehended, she told LA Taco. In the days that followed, his family tried repeatedly to contact him, but said that officers at the Adelanto detention facility refused to connect them.

A week after his detention, Mariel received a call informing her that her father was in critical condition at the Victor Valley global medical center. The last time his family was able to see Aviles, he was unconscious in a hospital room guarded by immigration officers, Mariel told LA Taco.

His family has questioned ICE’s assessment that Aviles died of “natural causes” and complications of alcohol withdrawal. He had been healthy, his daughter said, prior to his detention.

25 October

Kai Yin Wong, 63, of China, died at a hospital in San Antonio, Texas.

Wong had first come to the US in 1970 as a permanent resident. He was convicted of sexual abuse of a child in 2010, and served a 14-year sentence. He was then transferred to ICE custody and ordered deported from the US.

Before his death, he had been detained at the South Texas ICE processing center in Pearsall. In October, he was first transferred to a local hospital after he complained of shortness of breath, and then airlifted to another hospital in San Antonio when he started to experience heart failure and possible pneumonia. He was transferred to another medical center for heart valve repair surgery, according to officials, and died from complications.

3 December

Francisco Gaspar-Andrés, a 48-year-old man from Guatemala, died at an El Paso hospital due to suspected kidney and liver failure, according to ICE.

He is survived by his wife of 25 years, Lucía Pedro Juan, and their four daughters. The couple had run a plant nursery outside Miami for a decade, and Pedro Juan has described him as a hard-working husband who fought to provide for their family.

According to an interview Pedro Juan gave to the El Paso Times, the couple had gone on a grocery run during the Labor Day holiday when they were pulled over by a highway patrol officer who asked to see their identification papers, and then turned them over to ICE; they were eventually separated by immigration officers. “I hugged him, I tickled him on his ribs and I gave him a kiss on his cheek,” she said of their goodbye. “I never saw him again.” Pedro Juan was detained for three months and later deported to Guatemala.

Gaspar-Andrés ended up at Camp East Montana, a detention facility at the Texas military base known as Fort Bliss. The American Civil Liberties Union has called the facility a “human and civil rights catastrophe” following several reports of injuries, illnesses and abuses.

Gaspar-Andrés was repeatedly seen by medical staff for symptoms including bleeding gums, sore throat and body aches, fever, jaundice and hypertension. He was transferred to a hospital on 16 November, where he was diagnosed with hyponatremia. He was later placed on dialysis and palliative care, before he died in December, according to ICE.

His wife told the El Paso Times that Gaspar-Andrés had been relatively healthy prior to his detention, and disputed ICE’s assertion that he had hypertension or other underlying conditions.

5 December

Pete Sumalo Montejo, 72, died at the Valley Baptist medical center in Harlingen.

He had first come to the US from the Philippines in 1962, as a lawful permanent resident. In 1992, he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault of a child and in 2024 he was convicted for possession of a controlled substance, according to ICE.

In February, ICE detained Montejo at the Montgomery processing center, where he began to experience several medical complications including shortness of breath and hypoxia, anemia, and septic shock resulting from pneumonia, according to the agency.

6 December

Shiraz Fatehali Sachwani, 48, of Pakistan, died at a hospital in Fort Worth, Texas.

He first came to the US in 1996 as a nonimmigrant visitor, according to ICE, and overstayed his visa. He was arrested by border patrol in 2017, in North Dakota, and ordered to leave the US after he did not appear at a 2019 immigration court hearing. Then, in June, ICE located him at a jail in Euless, Texas, where he had been booked.

He spent more than five months at the Prairieland detention center in Alvarado, Texas, before he died. ICE has said Sachwani had a history of medical conditions – including chronic respiratory, liver and kidney issues – and died of “natural causes”.

12 December

Jean Wilson Brutus, a 41-year-old man from Haiti, died at the Delaney Hall detention facility in Newark, New Jersey, one day after he was taken into custody.

ICE said Brutus died of “suspected natural causes”. His cousin told NBC New York that the family is still searching for answers about what happened. “We haven’t had some kind of closure surrounding his death,” Evans Belony, his cousin, told the outlet. “He was like a loved one, that we all loved, he was like a brother.”

Brutus came to the US in 2023 as an asylum seeker, his cousin said, who added that Brutus had been “very depressed and very sad” following the death of his mother.

The conditions at Delaney Hall, where Brutus was held, have come under scrutiny from lawmakers and advocates. Andy Kim, a Democratic senator from New Jersey, toured Delaney Hall the day after Brutus’s death and spoke to about 80 detainees, who he said described receiving poor medical care and “disgusting” meals that included raw meat. He called for the facility to be closed.

14 December

Fouad Saeed Abdulkadir, 46, of Eritrea died of “medical distress”, according to the agency.

According to court documents obtained by the Daily Voice, Abdulkadir filed for an emergency federal motion for medical relief three days before he died.

Abdulkadir had been an imam at the Islamic Center of Northeast Ohio, and had gained a green card in 2018. In 2023, he was charged with wire fraud and misuse of public funds and later sentenced to prison. Supporters wrote to a US district judge requesting leniency, arguing that Abdulkadir may not have fully understood the application process for the benefits programs he was convicted of misusing.

“We miss his teachings, his knowledge. We crave him for our own sake, not just for him. He’s an actively good man,” a supporter wrote, according to the Daily Voice.

ICE took custody of him in July 2024, and detained him at the Moshannon Valley processing center in Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, where he died a year and a half later. Community members raising funds for his funeral services said that Abdulkadir “spent his life selflessly caring for others, nurturing our children with the wisdom of the Qur’an, healing family rifts, and offering kindness to everyone he met. His boundless generosity touched countless souls, and the space he leaves behind feels immeasurably quiet and deep.”

15 December

Nenko Stanev Gantchev, 56, was born in Bulgaria and died at the North Lake processing center in Baldwin, Michigan.

Gantchev was “discovered unresponsive on the floor of his cell during routine checks”, and his official cause of death is still under investigation, according to ICE.

He had first arrived in the US in 1995. According to the agency, Gantchev was denied a green card in 2009 and, in 2023, was ordered by an immigration judge to return to Bulgaria. He was apprehended by immigration agents in September as part of the administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz”, which sent hundreds of federal agents to Chicago to crack down on unauthorized immigrants.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/483cd1d5d1031a1f2f884250465bd83403ad66c9/1_0_2499_2000/master/2499.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb315f8b88121a3ad4ea8fc4f1d05f30",N,,2026-01-04 11:57:16.982449

Trump told reporters Saturday the U.S. will “run” Venezuela for the time being.
On Dec. 17, the House narrowly rejected two concurrent resolutions that would have expressed opposition to U.S. military engagements against terror organizations in the Western hemisphere and against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress.","What the United States does next in Venezuela and in the Western Hemisphere more broadly are questions that loom large as the 119th Congress returns to work this week for its second session.

On the heels of the U.S. military’s abduction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro early Saturday morning and the administration’s planned prosecution of Maduro on weapons and drug charges, Democrats and at least a handful of Republicans will push for Congress to make its voice heard on the matter — starting this week.

At least one vote appears likely in the Senate in the days ahead on requiring congressional authorization for additional U.S. military actions in or against Venezuela.

By the end of January, lawmakers may also decide whether to withhold Defense appropriations for such operations.

At least classified briefings on Venezuela, if not public hearings, are also in the works.

“It’s time for Congress to get its ass off the couch and do what the Constitution mandates that we do,” Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a member of the Armed Services and Foreign Relations panels, told reporters on Saturday.

Votes ahead

The Senate is poised to vote next week on a resolution by Kaine that would block U.S. military action within or against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress, he said. It would be the latest of several so far ill-fated attempts to assert congressional prerogatives.

What’s more, Kaine said, whenever the House-Senate compromise version of the two chambers’ 2026 Defense appropriations bills comes up for a vote, the Senate will decide whether to consider an amendment by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., that would prohibit use of funds to prosecute military action in or against Venezuela.

[Related: US capture of Maduro rests on criminal case]

Lawmakers hope to clear the Defense spending measure by Jan. 30, when stopgap funding will expire.

If past is prologue, however, the attempts to rein in the president’s military actions will fall narrowly short in partisan votes.

Lawmakers’ reactions on Saturday to the president’s actions in Venezuela — with Republicans almost universally backing him and virtually all Democrats decrying the action — only confirmed Congress’s ossified divisions.

Cuba and beyond

Trump’s military operation in Venezuela is just the opening chapter of an as yet unwritten story.

Trump told reporters Saturday the U.S. will “run” Venezuela for the time being. The president said a small number of American forces may be needed in that country for that purpose, and he did not rule out additional and potentially lethal U.S. military action there.

“We’ve been in quagmires in the Americas for decades, if not centuries, because of decisions just like this,” Kaine said.

The unresolved questions only start with how the U.S. will oversee governance in Venezuela and whether there will be resistance from Venezuelans.

Many lawmakers are also wondering aloud if the ouster of Maduro is part of a larger plan to remake the Western Hemisphere, and perhaps Greenland, by force if necessary.

The White House’s November National Security Strategy said some U.S. military forces should be repositioned from other regions to the Western Hemisphere to deal with problems such as drug trafficking and migration and to establish or expand access in “strategically important locations.”

The strategy also called for bolstering U.S. maritime forces in the region and for “targeted deployments to secure the border and defeat cartels, including where necessary the use of lethal force to replace the failed law enforcement-only strategy of the last several decades.”

At a news conference Saturday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio described the taking of Maduro as a law enforcement operation supported by the U.S. military.

But Rubio suggested that Cuba’s leaders, in particular, should worry about their own future.

“If I lived in Havana and I was in the government, I’d be concerned at least a little bit,” Rubio said.

[Related: Press Conference: Donald Trump Discusses the Capture of Nicolás Maduro in Venezuela – Jan. 3, 2026]

Trump, for his part, told reporters his administration “wants to surround ourselves with good neighbors.” He said Cuba is “not doing very well right now” and is a “failing nation.”

Trump said Cuba is “very similar” to Venezuela “in the sense that we want to help the people in Cuba.”

[Related: Trump: US will ‘run’ Venezuela after military mission to nab Maduro]

Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, is worried about what might come next across the region.

“Based on the administration’s National Security Strategy, I am deeply concerned that this may be an indication of more to come as the administration seeks to dominate the Western Hemisphere,” Smith said in a statement.

‘What comes next’

But Smith and others are concerned, first off, about the administration’s plans in Venezuela.

“It appears the Trump Administration gave no consideration or plan for what comes next in terms of a functioning government in Venezuela,” Smith said, echoing a widespread Democratic view. “This vacuum threatens to destabilize South America, will likely have no impact on the drug cartels, and could make the situation worse.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the Armed Services Committee, asked in a statement: “What does it mean that the U.S. will ‘run’ Venezuela, and what will Trump do next around the world?”

No public hearings have yet been held on the four-month-old campaign of strikes against alleged drug running boats in the Caribbean and Pacific, or on the deployment of a vast U.S. naval armada in those waters or on U.S. military plans regarding Venezuela.

But even top Republicans who have been critical of the Trump administration’s foreign policy efforts largely fell in line Saturday, while expressing a desire to learn more about the operation and its aftermath.

Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he would soon convene a briefing about the administration’s plans.

“This arrest was the culmination of a monthslong effort by the Trump administration to degrade the narco-terrorist organizations that Maduro oversaw,” Wicker said in a statement Saturday. “The Venezuelan people must now act swiftly to put their country back on a path to peace and prosperity, which will redound to the benefit of all their neighbors.”

Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee Chair Mitch McConnell similarly commended Trump’s move to sack Maduro. The president “has broad constitutional authority and long historical precedent for the limited use of military force,” McConnell wrote on the social platform X.

But McConnell, R-Ky., made clear he didn’t think it was America’s job to “run” Venezuela for long.

“A free, democratic, and stable Venezuela, led by Venezuelans, is in America’s national security interests,” he wrote. “I expect the Administration to brief Congress soon on how it intends to secure this outcome.”

Some Democrats said Saturday that administration officials, in briefings to lawmakers less than a month ago, lied about their goal to change the leadership of Venezuela — either by not acknowledging it or even, in some cases, allegedly denying it.

“The administration has assured me three separate times that it was not pursuing regime change or taking military action in Venezuela,” said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. “Clearly, they are not being straight with Americans.”

Members were not notified in advance of the operation, Trump confirmed to reporters on Saturday.

Partisan divisions

In addition to Kaine’s war powers resolution, Sen. Ruben Gallego, D-Ariz., has drafted a joint resolution that would direct the removal of U.S. armed forces from any counterdrug strikes that have not been authorized by Congress.

Both chambers have already repeatedly defeated — in largely party-line votes — multiple resolutions opposing Trump’s Caribbean operations.

On Dec. 17, the House narrowly rejected two concurrent resolutions that would have expressed opposition to U.S. military engagements against terror organizations in the Western hemisphere and against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress.

The chamber defeated a concurrent resolution offered by top House Foreign Affairs Democrat Gregory W. Meeks of New York, that would have directed the president to remove the use of armed forces against any presidentially designated terror organization in the hemisphere.

Two Republicans, Don Bacon of Nebraska and Thomas Massie of Kentucky, broke with their party to vote for the resolution, which went down on a 210-216 vote.

On Saturday, though, Bacon was supportive of ousting Maduro.

Another House Republican, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, expressed her opposition to Saturday’s operation.

Two Texas Democrats, Henry Cuellar and Vicente Gonzalez, bucked their party to vote against Meeks’s resolution.

The House similarly voted down, 211-213, a second concurrent resolution offered by Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., that would have directed the president to remove the use of armed forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela unless authorized by Congress.

Similarly, the Senate, on the strength of GOP votes, blocked two previous attempts to constrain Trump.

On Oct. 8, the Senate did not agree, 48-51, to a motion to discharge from committee a binding joint resolution by Kaine and Sen. Adam B. Schiff, D-Calif., that would bar military strikes against alleged drug boats.

Then the Senate voted 49-51 on Nov. 6 against discharging from committee another joint resolution from Kaine and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., that would have blocked U.S. military action within or against Venezuela.

On both Senate votes, Paul and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski were the only two GOP senators to cross the aisle and support advancing the Democratic resolutions. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., opposed bringing the Schiff resolution to the floor, though he backed doing so with Kaine’s.",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/01/venezuela_BC_003_010326.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 13:11:45.296039

A state budget deficit, caused in part by the expansion of Medi-Cal and other Democratic priorities, will also challenge lawmakers hoping to backfill cuts by the Trump administration.
“It’s a difficult time for California,” said Limón, who lives in unincorporated Santa Barbara County and is married with a young daughter.
“We need federal immigration reform,” Limón said.
“And that includes a comprehensive look at the state of immigration, the benefit of immigration, the benefit of our immigrant community.","Since President Trump’s immigration raids began sweeping through California’s cities and farm fields, state Senate President Monique Limón has carried a copy of her passport.

“Just in case,” she said.

Limón is one of the most powerful politicians in the state behind Gov. Gavin Newsom, but the detainment of American citizens, including U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla — who was handcuffed by federal agents in Los Angeles in June — showed that no Latino in California is safe.

In July, a farmworker in the country illegally fell to his death during an immigration raid in Camarillo, part of her district, and fear of other sweeps prompted the recent cancellation of a holiday parade in her hometown of Santa Barbara.

Locals have been detained while walking to the grocery store, she said.

“There’s this fear of racial profiling that is happening that I think is very real,” said Limón, 46.

The granddaughter of a Mexican farmworker and the first Latina elected Senate president, Limón ascended to the post in November after a tumultuous year that saw the Democratic-led state under constant attack from Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress.

The coming months will test Limón as the Trump administration ramps up deportations, looks to expand offshore drilling off the Santa Barbara coastline and slashes federal funding for Medicaid and other programs.

Limón, a progressive Democrat, must also work alongside Newsom, who is likely to use his final year as governor to strengthen his reputation as a presidential contender and may clash with Limón and other legislators over budget decisions.

A state budget deficit, caused in part by the expansion of Medi-Cal and other Democratic priorities, will also challenge lawmakers hoping to backfill cuts by the Trump administration.

“It’s a difficult time for California,” said Limón, who lives in unincorporated Santa Barbara County and is married with a young daughter. “Not just our state, but I think the country as a whole.’

On Friday, Limón joined immigration advocates outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Santa Maria to demand answers about the detainment of nearly 150 people in Limón’s central coastal district in late December.

“We can’t let what’s happening be something that we normalize,” Limón said.

Raids last year targeted farms in Limón’s district, an area that includes all of Santa Barbara County and parts of San Luis Obispo and Ventura counties.

For Limón, the fight for immigrant rights is deeply personal.

Limón’s grandfather picked strawberries in Oxnard after coming to the U.S. through the state’s bracero program. The senator draws a link between California’s economy and its undocumented workforce, blaming labor shortages and unharvested crops on the raids.

“We need federal immigration reform,” Limón said. “And that includes a comprehensive look at the state of immigration, the benefit of immigration, the benefit of our immigrant community.

“That is not just in all the taxes they pay, but certainly their contributions to so many sectors of our economy as well.”

A 2019 study by the federal government estimated half of all of the state’s farmworkers are undocumented and the vast majority of workers are from Mexico.

Limón remembered Jaime Alanis Garcia, the farmworker who died in Camarillo in July, in a speech on the Senate floor. She described Garcia calling his family in his final moments and telling them how scared he was.

“After 30 years of working in this country as a farmworker, doing the job that our government, our country, our constituents, has called an essential worker job, that his life would end that day, that way, because of where he was working,” said Limón.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement that more than 10,000 alleged undocumented immigrants have been arrested in Los Angeles since Trump took office last year, but the agency didn’t provide statewide numbers.

DHS “has arrested and deported hundreds of thousands of criminal illegal aliens across the country, including gang members, rapists, kidnappers, and drug traffickers.

“DHS is just getting started under President Donald Trump and Secretary [Kristi] Noem,” the statement said. “The best is yet to come.”

Limón said “it’s not lost” on her that the granddaughter of immigrants is helping lead the state at a time when Trump wants to remove Mexicans from California.

Growing up in Santa Barbara, she marched with her parents against Proposition 187, the 1994 ballot measure which denied many taxpayer-funded services to undocumented immigrants.

The coastal city was also the site of a massive oil spill in 1969 that killed thousands of birds, fish and sea mammals, and helped launch the state’s environmental movement.

Limón’s own interest in environmentalism was sparked, she said, by the wildfires that erupted in the nearby Santa Ynez Mountains and forced school classes to stay indoors, she said.

The first person in her family to go to college, Limón attended UC Berkeley and received a master’s degree in education from Columbia University.

Petite in stature, she describes herself as an “accidental politician” whose interest in higher education led her to run for her local school board, which led to a campaign for state Assembly, and later, state Senate.

Colleagues, including some Republicans, describe her as reasonable and a policy wonk who loves spreadsheets.

Sen. Henry Stern (D-Los Angeles), who has worked with Limón to target oil drilling, said she is a “lower-key kind person” who doesn’t seek out the spotlight.

“She doesn’t have that pushiness that many politicians tend to have, which is ‘Who is in the front, who gets to be on TV?’” he said.

Former Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez, who now heads the California Labor Federation, recalled Limón’s uphill effort to pass a bill to stop predatory lending. The legislation died the previous session, and support waned.

Gonzalez asked her how she was going to get the votes.

“She said, ‘I am asking you to trust me and let me work this,’” Gonzalez said. The bill passed with bipartisan support and caps interest rates on consumer loans.

Her other high-profile bills include requiring employers to disclose pay ranges in job ads and allowing child-care workers to unionize.

She has frustrated pro-housing groups by declining to vote on some bills, including one to allow more density near transit stops, and by her push to force an environmental review for a controversial development in her Santa Barbara hometown.

In November, she criticized the Trump administration over its announcement to open up the coast to offshore drilling, arguing “new offshore drilling leases lock us into decades of pollution.”

Some of her relatives are politically conservative and she gets an array of questions at family gatherings: “Why didn’t California do this? I heard on the news that this is happening. What does this mean?”

Her extended family is so large that a recent Thanksgiving of nearly 40 family members was considered small.

Her aunt, Mónica Gil, an executive at NBCUniversal Telemundo, introduced Limón at a gala in December to honor her in downtown Los Angeles. During her speech, Limón reminded the crowd that it took 175 years for a woman with her background to be elected Senate president.

“We are starting to see the glass ceiling crack,” said Limón. “We’re not there yet, but that glass ceiling that’s cracking is opening doors.”

Former state Sen. Kevin de León was the first Latino elected Senate president, and the author of the state’s sanctuary law, which limits state and local government cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

Complicating the state’s budget process is an anticipated shortfall in the coming year.

Sen. Roger Niello (R-Fair Oaks), vice chair of the budget and fiscal review committee, expressed alarm that California’s expenditures continue to outpace revenues, even though the state isn’t in a recession.

He predicted Limón will be a “good pro tem for Republicans to try to collaborate with” because she “will listen to people.”

The state budget divided some Democrats last year when Newsom proposed ending new Medi-Cal enrollments for some undocumented groups and requiring others to pay monthly premiums. The majority of the Legislature, including Limón, backed the changes.

Sen. María Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), a member of the Latino Caucus, opposed the move and chastised her colleagues for the “betrayal.” “Remember today’s date and what the Senate is doing,” said Durazo during a speech from the Senate floor.

Limón said her starting point with the new budget is to try and “keep the existing programs in place that help Californians without having to do reductions or cuts.”

In early December, dozens of immigrants rights’ advocates met with Limón’s staff to present their priorities for the budget.

The Trump administration last year secured tens of billions of dollars in government funding to hire more immigration officers and build detention centers — infrastructure intended to speed up deportations.

Some advocates want at least $150 million for immigrant legal services in California’s budget, money that would follow an initial outlay last year.

“There is going to be need for permanent funding [for legal services] throughout the Trump administration,” said Masih Fouladi, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center, who attended the meeting.

Durazo also wants more money for attorneys.

“It actually stops people from getting deported,” said Durazo. “We learned from what worked.”

While the arrests have brought attention to California’s field workers and day laborers, Limón said students and others also need a pathway to citizenship.

“That is only going to come from the federal government,” she said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/87ae9d9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4301+0+582/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd2%2F20%2Ff861175a49298099db548e9ce1fd%2F1532205-me-1204-sen-pro-tem-monique-limon-gem-007.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 11:12:15.143253

In one fell swoop, the capture appeared to render the 1973 War Powers Resolution obsolete, if not an outright work of fiction.
Similarly, the deployment of a vast military force off Venezuela, including the largest US aircraft carrier, was carried out without seeking authorization.
Stung by this haughty disregard, congressional Democrats hit out ferociously on Saturday, with insistent demands to be briefed on future actions.
“That is a situation unfortunately that I think the framers of the constitution did not really anticipate,” he said.","Nothing speaks more eloquently of the disempowering of the US Congress under Donald Trump’s second presidency than the brazenly audacious arrest of Venezuela’s leader, Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia.

Far from recognizing it, Trump did not even acknowledge Congress’s right to know – keeping senior members in the dark until the operation to seize the strongman was under way.

Only after the operation to detain Maduro had begun did the administration bother to tell members of the congressional “gang of eight”: the top Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives, plus the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees of the two chambers.

That marks a conspicuous break with convention, even as previously observed by Trump himself. When Qassem Suleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard’s Quds force was killed in a targeted strike during Trump’s first presidency in January 2020, the gang was punctiliously consulted, people involved in that operation have said.

In one fell swoop, the capture appeared to render the 1973 War Powers Resolution obsolete, if not an outright work of fiction.

The 1973 act – passed in the wake of the Vietnam war amid widespread anxieties about an incipient “imperial presidency” – requires a president to notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying troops into hostilities and withdraw them after 60 days, unless Congress authorizes the action or declares war.

It was a reaction to Lyndon Johnson’s perceived abuse of the notorious Tonkin Gulf Resolution of 1964, an ostensibly narrow measure that Johnson ultimately exploited to pursue unlimited war in Vietnam.

Yet long before the operation to seize Maduro, Trump had in effect communicated that he considered such congressional limits null and void by offering up a raft of alternative legal justifications – including executive orders declaring the Venezuelan leader and his henchmen “narco-terrorists” and thus potentially subject to similar precepts that governed the post-2001 “war on terror”.

Its effectiveness in constraining presidents from acts of war has long been shown to be limited, as the prolonged wars in Iraq and Afghanistan attest – although George W Bush received congressional authorization in both cases.

The 1989 invasion of Panama – carried out under the administration of George HW Bush to unseat the central American country’s dictatorial ruler, Manuel Noriega – was conducted without a former declaration of war or specific congressional approval. Bush, however, had taken care to garner bipartisan support on Capitol Hill beforehand.

Nor did Barack Obama seek specific prior congressional approval before the operation to kill Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, but instead acted under the authority of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), passed by Congress after the 11 September 2001 al-Qaida terror attacks on New York and Washington.

Under Trump 2.0, no approval was sought for the mass military build-up off Venezuela’s shores or the estimated 35 lethal strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats that have killed at least 115 people since last September. Similarly, the deployment of a vast military force off Venezuela, including the largest US aircraft carrier, was carried out without seeking authorization.

The disdain implicit in the explanations from Trump and Marco Rubio as to why information on the Maduro raid was withheld even from senior congressional figures – that they cannot be trusted because they might leak – is unmistakable.

“It’s just simply not the kind of mission you can call people and say: ‘Hey, we may do this at some point in the next 15 days,’” Rubio told reporters.

Stung by this haughty disregard, congressional Democrats hit out ferociously on Saturday, with insistent demands to be briefed on future actions.

“President Trump has made no secret of his intentions to effectively abolish the Congress, and that pattern continues today with his flagrant disregard for the Article 1 war powers of Congress, which is essential to our constitutional system of checks and balances,” said Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker.

Mark Warner, the Democrat’s ranking member on the Senate’s intelligence select committee and a member of the gang of eight, said: “Our constitution places the gravest decisions about the use of military force in the hands of Congress for a reason. Using military force to enact regime change demands the closest scrutiny, precisely because the consequences do not end with the initial strike.”

And, Tim Kaine, a Democratic senator for Virginia who last month tabled a war powers resolution seeking to rein in the administration’s actions in Venezuela, said: “It is long past time for Congress to reassert its critical constitutional role in matters of war, peace, diplomacy and trade.”

He added: “Where will this go next? Will the president deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?”

Yet it is hard not to detect an air of impotent futility in the Democrats’ chorus of indignation.

With the exception of a few known Republican rebel figures such as Thomas Massie, a representative from Kentucky, Republican criticism was muted, whatever private misgivings some might have about Trump’s extravagant assumption of presidential powers at their expense.

Matt Duss, a former foreign policy adviser to Bernie Sanders, the leftwing Vermont senator, cited Mike Lee, a Republican senator from Utah, as an example of how far the party’s members in Congress have ceded ground to the president.

Having initially voiced reservations about the lack of authorization from Congress, Lee sharply changed tack – apparently after speaking to Rubio - saying that Maduro’s arrest was within “the president’s inherent authority under Article II of the Constitution to protect US personnel from an actual or imminent attack”.

Duss contrasted Lee’s supine stance with his previous actions, when he jointed Sanders to support a war powers resolution aimed at restricting US support for Saudi Arabia’s military intervention in Yemen during Trump’s first term.

“Senator Lee spoke very eloquently about the constitutional principles at stake, and that was just when the United States was only supporting the Saudi emirati war in Yemen,” said Duss. “So for him to come out now and say the president has inherent authority to invade a country and kidnap a foreign leader without any authorization from Congress, is just wild.

“It’s been clear for a while that he, along with many other Republicans, have decided that their political careers depend on staying in the good graces of Donald Trump and there’s really no past principle that they won’t abandon.”

Duss said the instruments available to Congress under the War Powers Resolution were no longer fit for purpose. He suggested that the legislation needed to be rewritten, in the manner of the national security powers reform bill, which Sanders introduced – ironically, along with Lee – during Trump’s first presidency.

The legislation was never enacted and even if reintroduced and passed would likely be vetoed by Trump – even if the Democrats were to recapture one or both chambers of Congress in November’s midterm elections.

Short of a foreign policy disaster in Venezuela that could produce a groundswell of Republican opinion that might then yield a Senate supermajority to override a presidential veto, such legislation’s only hope, Duss conceded, is the future election of a sympathetic Democratic president.

“That is a situation unfortunately that I think the framers of the constitution did not really anticipate,” he said. “Given that so many of the kind of separation of powers and the checks and balances presume that you’re going to have leaders who care about the law and who care about these processes.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0875114693379a7bee8c3b7b8c1ae529d57fd01/1965_611_1894_1516/master/1894.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=43a12bd45a470179a5d491445a342f9a",N,,2026-01-04 11:12:18.874610

The rally comes after two of the four family members were released.

For the past three years, the Bakhtani family lived in the Capital Region using their education to give back to others.

“My sons are not criminals. They are hardworking men who labor more than 40 hours a week to provide for their families.”

In a message from the mother of the Bakhtani family – read by Afghan American Community Center President, Yousaf Sherzad – she describes the pain she felt when her husband and three sons were detained by ICE at the beginning of December.

“As a mother, my heart is breaking. I have endured war, exile, hunger and loss, but this pain is beyond my strength.”

The Bakhtani family were taken to an ICE detention center in Buffalo, one son forced to leave behind a 2-month-old daughter. After weeks, the father was released with only one of his sons. He tells CBS6 that his son has already gained U.S. citizenship – and everyone else is going through the proper channels to do the same.

“I have asylum pending and I have my social security work permit, which is not expired, in my wallet. Also, I have a state ID.”

The case has sparked outrage from several elected officials – including a representative from Albany’s new mayor, Dr. Dorcey Applyrs.

Chief of staff Nesta Littlejohn said, “This administration is not going to back down from the scare tactics coming from Washington, DC. This administration is going to uphold Albany’s sanctuary city status.”

Senator Pat Fahy continuing to push the MELT and Safe Air Acts – both proposed legislation that would put regulations on federal enforcement agents.

“Yes, of course, we need national immigration reform, but creating a reign of terror in our streets is not the way to do it.”

The Bakhtani family says they are working with pro-bono attorneys to arrange the release of the remaining two sons. They expect to pay a high bond and are seeking help from the community.",https://cbs6albany.com/resources/media2/16x9/832/1320/23x0/90/6c092335-b7db-4bc6-81fe-f02de3ecb225-Screenshot20260103195844.png,N,,2026-01-04 14:57:13.185917
