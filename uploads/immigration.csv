This partnership will allow some Clermont County deputies to arrest and transport people on ICE warrants with ICE oversight.

""Our focus remains on transparency, efficiency and accountability, enforcing the law and delivering value to taxpayers while keeping our community safe,"" the sheriff's office said in a social media post.

The sheriff's office said U.S. Rep. Dave Taylor visited the Clermont County Jail Friday to learn more about the county's ""ongoing collaboration"" with ICE and the U.S. Marshals Service as they prepare to house federal inmates.

Clermont County officials said they have transferred 26 inmates to ICE and are currently housing four inmates who will be transferred to federal custody after local charges are complete.

Deputies in Butler County in June were the first in the state to receive credentials allowing them to make immigration arrests during routine police activities. Since then, Butler County has announced multiple ""targeted"" operations in partnership with ICE.

Additionally, the Butler County Jail houses federal inmates and, in October, had nearly 500 federal inmates from both ICE and U.S. Marshals.

He’s seen ICE agents hit protesters with batons, shoot pepper balls and rubber bullets, and deploy flash-bangs into the crowd.
And I was checking in with people at a supply table, finding out who the medics are, because [the ICE agents had] been releasing chemical munitions on us before.
ICE has been escalating their response to protesters every time we’ve gone.
The pushback that you will get from the authorities is that these protests are turning violent, that the protesters are not just protesters.","The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview located outside of Chicago has become a focal point for protesters who want to resist the agency. A viral photo of an ICE agent at the site pepper spraying a pastor in the face has come to exemplify the aggressive and violent tactics federal officers are using to corral the demonstrations.

The Rev. Quincy Worthington was there the night his friend, the Rev. David Black, was shot in the back of the head with a pepper bullet and pepper-sprayed in the face, and has returned every weekend since. He’s seen ICE agents hit protesters with batons, shoot pepper balls and rubber bullets, and deploy flash-bangs into the crowd. Worthington says his faith is what keeps him going back after some of the scariest nights of his life.

Below is a conversation between Worthington and Today, Explained host Noel King. Their conversation has been edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to Today, Explained wherever you get podcasts, including Apple Podcasts, Pandora, and Spotify.

Where did this start for you?

At the beginning of September, I went to a Faith Over Fear rally and press conference in Daley Plaza [in downtown Chicago] that was about Operation Midway Blitz ramping up and about a faithful response to that. David was there and he spoke, and through conversation of asking him what was going on and what he was doing, he told me about Broadview and the things that were going on there. And he said that it would be really great to have more clergy presence there, because we provide a sense of calm and can help deescalate things sometimes if it needs to be deescalated. I told him I would be happy to join him at those and went that Friday.

That night when the picture was taken, he and I had actually just arrived there together. And I was checking in with people at a supply table, finding out who the medics are, because [the ICE agents had] been releasing chemical munitions on us before. One of the things I’ve been trying to help do is get protesters safely away from the chemical munitions and to get the medical treatment if they need it; helping flush out eyes. While I was connecting there, David went up front as he usually does to pray, to plead to the humanity of the officers. He had finished doing that and was turning around to walk away, and the agent on the roof shot him in the top of the head with a pepper ball.

Were you surprised that this happened?

(Sigh) I think by that time, no. I mean, I guess you’re surprised every time it happens. I wasn’t shocked. ICE has been escalating their response to protesters every time we’ve gone. So I think I was a little taken back in the moment that it was just a random pot shot that they took at him, but it wasn’t entirely surprising that that’s how they responded.

When did things start to escalate between the protesters outside of Broadview and law enforcement? And what did it look like when it did?

“I find it terrifying. It seems like every time I go, that time is the scariest moment of my life.”

When I started going in September, what we would notice is an escalation both throughout the day and then every week that we would go. It first started early in the day, when vehicles would come in and out, that they were trying to keep the road clear and protesters away. At least I assume that’s what they were trying to do. Then it seemed like they would randomly come out and just attack us.

And so the pattern would be: You would see one to three agents appear on the roof. You would see a drone go up in the air, and that’s when you knew something was coming. And then as the gate would open, the men from the roof would shoot down pepper balls onto the protesters and sometimes rubber bullets. The gates would open. Anywhere from 20 to 50 agents, depending on how large the crowd would be, would then rush into the crowd, essentially throwing tear gas at us, shooting us with pepper balls. I saw canisters of pepper spray that they would just douse the crowd in. They would shove people to the ground; they would sometimes grab somebody and detain them.

Do you find this frightening?

I find it terrifying. It seems like every time I go, that time is the scariest moment of my life.

What you’ve just described went down in September. It’s late October. Is this still happening at Broadview?

Right now, there’s a temporary restraining order preventing ICE from using chemical munitions. So we haven’t seen that exactly at Broadview. We’ve seen it at other places in the city where ICE is conducting operations. But since October, Illinois State Police has come in. They have threatened to use chemical munitions, but have never released them that I’ve seen. Instead, they carry batons and use physical force.

The pushback that you will get from the authorities is that these protests are turning violent, that the protesters are not just protesters. They’re in some cases, and I quote, “violent rioters.” What have you seen?

I have not seen anything to lead me to believe that these are violent rioters. I’ve never seen protesters acting any way but peacefully. They might yell things that I think are inappropriate, that I certainly wouldn’t yell at somebody, but that’s totally within their First Amendment rights. So I challenge that narrative. I have not seen anything that would look anything remotely like a riot.

After what you’ve seen over the past couple of weeks — agents of the federal government, in your telling, attacking peaceful protesters — has this changed your feelings about law enforcement?

I think this has changed my feelings about just about everything. I think it’s made me seriously question my understanding of law enforcement and why they’re there, the way the US government operates. And I think on a personal level, it’s caused me to struggle with and think deeper about my own faith and about what it means to be a person of faith — and what it means to be a citizen of this country.

As a minister and a professionally trained theologian, we often tend to think of these things in abstract ideas. There’s this idea of essentially picking up your cross and following Christ, or, are you willing to die for your faith? And those were kind of abstract ideas for me. I think in a very real sense, I’ve been forced to confront the very real possibility that by living out my Christian convictions, that I’m putting myself in serious jeopardy.

For me, the call to follow Christ has to reign supreme in my life. And what I witness in the life and teachings of Jesus is a man who stands up to unfair oppression. He speaks boldly and prophetically about standing up for the least of these. About trying to give voice to those who feel voiceless and standing with people who can’t stand by themselves, and giving hope to the hopeless. More important than that, I think the linchpin, the reasoning behind that is that Jesus firmly believed that every person is a precious child of God, and that we’re all created in the image of God. And that’s something that’s sacred and needs to be protected. And so when I see things that are blatant human rights violations and the denial of basic human rights to our brothers and sisters...

The Trump administration alleges he is a violent MS-13 gang member involved in smuggling other undocumented migrants.

His lawyers have filed a suit contesting his deportation, and a federal judge in August blocked an attempt to send Abrego Garcia, who is married to a US citizen and denies all wrongdoing, to Uganda.

In Friday's filing, government attorneys say they have identified the west African country of Liberia as a site for ""removal,"" as it was not on a list of countries that Abrego Garcia's attorneys had rejected out of hand.

""Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States's closest partners on the African continent,"" attorneys said in the filing in a US federal court in Maryland.

The government noted that Liberia is an English-speaking country and is ""committed to the humane treatment of refugees.""

It said it could complete the deportation ""as soon as October 31.""

Abrego Garcia's lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said ICE is seeking to deport his client ""to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland.""

""Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional,"" Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement on his law firm's website.

Abrego Garcia had been living in the United States under protected legal status since 2019, when a judge ruled he should not be deported because he could be harmed in his home country.

He then became one of more than 200 people sent to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison in March as part of Trump's crackdown on undocumented migrants.

But Justice Department lawyers admitted that the Salvadoran had been wrongly deported due to an ""administrative error.""

Abrego Garcia was returned to US soil months later, only to be detained again in Tennessee on human smuggling charges, a separate case from the Maryland proceedings.

Right-wing supporters praise the Republican president's toughness, but legal scholars and human rights advocates have blasted what they say is a haphazard rush to deport people without even a court hearing, in violation of basic US law.

Residents say law enforcement arrived sometime around 6 a.m.

Video posted to social media and shared with KATU show officers telling residents they were serving a search warrant in the area, and that they were conducting an investigation.

""They [officers] said supposedly because there was a whole bunch of guns and drugs, and that's why they were coming to the apartment,"" Carrington Square resident Priscilla Mazorra said.

In a post on social media, state Rep. Ricki Ruiz, D-Gresham, confirmed Rockwood Preparatory School closed because of the operation.

“Witnesses reported over 10 vehicles arriving and targeting two individuals,” Ruiz said.

According to Mazzora, officers used some sort of explosive device to blow at least two doors off the hinges, then raided at least one of those apartments.

Mazzora told KATU she saw four people detained by federal officers, including three from one household, but that number has not been confirmed.

One Gresham man who did not want to be named, called the extent of the operation unwarranted.

""If they're doing an investigative type of warrant like they stated, they don't need 30 to 40 officers. It's a waste of resources,"" he said. ""It's a waste of taxpayer dollars to be having that many amount of agents for a couple of apartments that they were going through and the vehicles that they were going through.""

Ruiz warned Gresham residents that they should expect to see more ICE operations in the coming weeks.

“These are not normal times,” Ruiz said. “When a school in the heart of Rockwood has to cancel classes without notice and a community is left in crisis, it’s clear that these tactics are meant to create fear in one of our most diverse and vulnerable neighborhoods.”

""It's really sad you know,"" Mazorra said. ""It's very concerning 'cause now families have to really, like, watch their back, and having to live like that in fear is just not something that any wants to experience.""

Morning Reads

Trump backs away from sending federal troops to San Francisco after pleas from tech leaders (Alexandra Marquez and David Ingram, NBC News) — President Donald Trump on Thursday said that “he is calling off plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco after speaking to the city’s mayor and following backlash from the tech industry,” according to NBC News. His decision keeps San Francisco clear, at least for now, of ongoing legal battles over Trump’s authority to federalize and deploy the National Guard to cities that oppose the deployment. “The Trump administration and California’s government are already engaged in a legal battle over the president’s deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles earlier this year to quell protests against immigration enforcement raids in the city and surrounding areas. … Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Portland, Chicago and Washington this year,” and the question of whether the Chicago deployment can proceed is in front of the Supreme Court.

Cities, nonprofits challenge Trump grant freeze at Fourth Circuit (Steve Garrison, Courthouse News Service) — Two months after the Supreme Court held in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association that disputes over the Trump administration’s effort to freeze certain federal grants likely belong in the Court of Federal Claims, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit is weighing whether it was improper for a U.S. district judge in South Carolina to order the administration to fund “more than 30 environmental or agricultural grants awarded to various nonprofits and cities,” according to Courthouse News Service. The government contends, citing the NIH decision, that the case on the environmental and agricultural grants needs to move to the Court of Federal Claims, while the grantees “argued Thursday that the constitutional claims raised in the suit could not be properly decided by the 16-judge court that specializes in handling government contract disputes.”

‘That would be neat’: American businesses eye $1 trillion in tariff refunds—and a long fight ahead—depending on the Supreme Court (Sasha Rogelberg, Fortune)(Paywall) — If the Supreme Court upholds lower court rulings striking down tariffs, the federal government may need to refund up to $1 trillion in tariff revenue to American companies, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. However, finance experts told Fortune that some small businesses may forego the money in order to avoid what could turn out to be a complicated refund process. “The general feeling is, if you have the resources, and you have the capability, the juice is worth the squeeze,” said David Warrick, executive vice president of supply-chain risk management firm Overhaul. “If you are a smaller business or a smaller importer, you’ve already spent time baking in the cost of tariffs and the associated risks to your supply chain, then you’ve got to weigh up that cost-benefit.”

Harvard sees drop in Black, Hispanic student admissions, rise in Asian Americans (Lexi Lonas Cochran, The Hill) — Harvard College’s latest admissions data shows that Black students comprise 11.5% of the school’s class of 2029, down from 14% in the class of 2028, according to The Hill. “For Black students, the slide has been consistent since the 2023 Supreme Court decision that outlawed affirmative action in higher education. Before the decision, Black students made up 18 percent of Harvard’s student population.” Hispanic student admissions are also down (from 16% to 11%), but the share of Asian American students is up by four percentage points. Harvard did not provide admissions data for white students.

Fighting Trump and defending Tesla, lawyer Paul Clement is everywhere now (Mike Scarcella, Sara Merken, and David Thomas, Reuters) — Former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement has argued more than 100 cases before the Supreme Court, and he’s showing no signs of slowing down, according to Reuters. He’s set to argue two cases in front of the court in December, and he’s working on several other high-profile disputes. “He’s on the team representing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook in a major fight at the Supreme Court over Trump’s effort to oust her, and defending U.S. judges in Maryland in an unusual lawsuit brought against them by the U.S. Justice Department over immigration. … For [Elon] Musk, Clement is part of a team defending Tesla in federal court in wrongful death litigation, and representing X Corp in a battle with watchdog Media Matters.”

Several cases on the interim docket are fully briefed and awaiting the court’s response, including the Trump administration’s request to be allowed to federalize and deploy the National Guard in Illinois. For more information on the current state of the interim docket, check out Kelsey’s story in the On Site section below.

Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is scheduled to speak at Springfield Symphony Hall in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Monday night, about her path to the Supreme Court.

A Closer Look: Capital Punishment

The Supreme Court on Thursday denied two requests for a stay of execution from Anthony Boyd, clearing the way for him to be put to death in Alabama hours later. Boyd became the 40th person executed in the United States this year, which has seen a surge of executions after a period of decline, as SCOTUSblog reported last month.

So far this year, the Supreme Court has considered more than 30 emergency stay applications for persons on death row, and it has not granted a single one. For those who are familiar with the court’s typical approach to capital litigation, this trend likely isn’t surprising. Such emergency applications are rarely viewed favorably by the justices.

Most of this year’s denials have come and gone without a noted dissent. Boyd’s case is one exception. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissent from the denial, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson.

Another exception is the case of Crawford v. Mississippi, which the court addressed last week. Charles Ray Crawford contended that his attorneys “conceded [his] guilt before the jury” after he expressly told them not to, and noted that the Supreme Court later held in a separate case that such an action by attorneys violates the Sixth Amendment. Crawford’s stay request was denied, but, as with Boyd, Sotomayor dissented, joined by Kagan and Jackson.

Death row inmates have fared better when their case makes it to the merits docket, at least in recent years. During the 2024-25 term, the justices ruled in favor of the inmate in three cases – Andrew v. White, Glossip v. Oklahoma, and Gutierrez v. Saenz – by either asking a lower court to reconsider their claims or ordering a new trial. In the term ahead, the court will again weigh in on the administration of the death penalty in Hamm v. Smith, a case about how courts, when presented with multiple IQ scores, should determine whether a capital defendant is so intellectually disabled that he may not be executed.

SCOTUS Quote

“From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death.”

— Justice Harry Blackmun in Callins v. Collins

Court Turns Down Man’s Request to Die By Firing Squad

The Supreme Court on Thursday afternoon turned down a request from an Alabama inmate to block his execution. In an unsigned order, the justices denied Anthony Boyd’s plea to put his execution on hold and to decide whether executing him by nitrogen hypoxia would violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the court’s decision to allow the execution to go forward. In a nine-page opinion joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, Sotomayor wrote that “Boyd asks for the barest form of mercy: to die by firing squad, which would kill him in seconds, rather than by a torturous suffocation lasting up to four minutes. The Constitution would grant him that grace. My colleagues do not,” as Amy noted in her analysis.

With Adams no longer mayor, Trump will lose the benefit of that arrangement.
It is not too early to create a detailed strategic plan to thwart Trump’s bullying once Mamdani becomes mayor.
The New York City Law Department handles the filing of such lawsuits.
Mamdani is all but certain to face the full spectrum of intimidation from Trump and his allies.","This month is the 63rd anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis. In October 1962, Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev tried to intimidate the young first-term U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, by moving nuclear warheads and missiles into Cuba. Though the threat of nuclear war loomed, Kennedy rose to the challenge: Khrushchev blinked, and Russia removed the nuclear warheads from Cuba.

We are now witnessing another generational standoff between America’s bully-in-chief, President Donald Trump, and Zohran Mamdani, the likely next mayor of New York City, whom Trump has referred to as “Mamdani the commie.” In 1962, Khrushchev was 23 years older than Kennedy. The difference in age between Trump and Mamdani — 44 years — is about double.

Trump’s vindictiveness will not stop with mere threats.

If Mamdani becomes mayor, Trump has vowed to withhold billions of dollars in federal funds from New York, take over New York “when we have to,” and arrest Mamdani if he defies federal immigration enforcement. This week, the president admitted Mamdani is likely to win, “but here’s the good news: He’s got to go through the White House.” The other object of Trump’s bullying is New York City voters, who effectively are being told that voting for Mamdani risks reprisals against their city.

Trump’s vindictiveness will not stop with mere threats. To understand what is in store for New York, we need look no further than the illegal actions Trump has already perpetrated against colleges, universities, law firms and other cities and states. Trump may, for instance, direct federal agencies to conduct bogus investigations of New York City agencies for their use of federal funds. He may federalize the New York National Guard to patrol the City’s streets under the pretext of fighting crime. He may demand his Justice Department indict Mamdani on flimsy pretexts, such as not cooperating with his immigration policies.

So far, Trump has spared New York from the wrath he has inflicted on other major Democratic Party-controlled cities, including Washington, D.C.; Chicago; and Los Angeles. But that’s because current Mayor Eric Adams agreed to cooperate with the administration’s immigration policies, and in return the Justice Department moved to dismiss Adams’ federal charges for bribery and fraud. With Adams no longer mayor, Trump will lose the benefit of that arrangement.

Mamdani has no illusions about Trump’s vindictiveness. So far, Mamdani has politically pushed back against Trump’s bullying with the united front of New York’s two top state officials — Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James (herself a target of the president). He has likely recognized that every target of Trump’s bullying that has stood up to the president has gained rather than lost political clout. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, for example, regained public support after directly confronting federal agents when Trump sent the National Guard into LA.

But more is now needed. It is not too early to create a detailed strategic plan to thwart Trump’s bullying once Mamdani becomes mayor.

Fighting this legal battle will take enormous legal firepower.

A major battleground in this fight will be the federal court in the Southern District of New York. Mamdani’s team should review what legal actions other cities and states have brought against the Trump administration in federal court and begin compiling the types of legal pleadings that are likely to be successful. A committee of advisers should oversee the drafting of ready-to-file court papers to use, as necessary, the day Mamdani becomes Mayor.

Fortunately for that committee, Trump has shown a penchant for not following the U.S. Constitution and statutory law. This has been his underlying weakness in his ongoing retribution campaigns against his perceived enemies. New York City must be prepared to seize on those missteps and follow the examples of Harvard University, Jenner & Block and other institutions that have successfully used Trump’s blatant violations of the law against him in court.

Fighting this legal battle will take enormous legal firepower. The New York City Law Department handles the filing of such lawsuits. However, the Law Department currently has numerous vacancies for lawyers. As soon as Mamdani becomes mayor, he must fill those positions.

Mamdani is all but certain to face the full spectrum of intimidation from Trump and his allies. A well-thought-out strategic plan, similar to the one Kennedy orchestrated in response to Khrushchev, is the best path to defeating the bully.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251023-donald-trump-zohran-mamdani-zz-c8a8d4.jpg",N,,2025-10-25 04:56:32.976456

“I'm just out today supporting not only the administration, Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, just overall law and order,” Gee said.","MINNEAPOLIS — Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Minneapolis Friday afternoon, Oct. 24, touting efforts of federal law enforcement operations in Minnesota since President Donald Trump took office.

The former South Dakota governor also blasted Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and other leaders.

“Under the leadership of (Minneapolis) Mayor (Jacob) Frey, under the leadership of Gov. Walz, more violent crimes are being perpetuated in these communities because of their refusal to defend American citizens,” Noem said.

Noem said federal efforts in Minnesota have resulted in the removal of 4,300 individuals ""off of our streets."" Of those, 3,316 had criminal histories and 98 were part of foreign terrorist organizations, according to Noem.

Noem's appearance on Friday was met with a crowd of more than 300 protesters outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building. The DHS head spoke to the media from behind a table of items she said were seized by ICE, including rifles, cocaine and methamphetamine.

Protesters ahead of the news conference suspected that Noem’s visit would announce the deployment of new federal agents in Minnesota. When asked during the news conference, Noem said that it is “up to the president,” and she wouldn’t say if Minnesota specifically would be seeing an increase in federal officers, but that DHS is expecting an increase of roughly 10,000 new ICE officers across the country.

Noem said that she is looking at local partnerships with sheriffs as well as state agreements and cooperatives, “such as Gov. Walz has not been.”

“If (Walz) would sign agreements with us to have our backs out on operations, that he would help with the safety and security of our federal officers when they're out there protecting people and making sure that we're focused on getting the worst of the worst off our streets as soon as possible, that would be absolutely wonderful,” Noem said. “That would be fundamental, because I don't know how he sleeps at night.”

A spokesperson with Walz's office told Forum News Service on Friday evening that Noem's visit appeared to be ""more about pulling a political stunt than about solving a problem.""

""The governor wishes the Trump administration would stay focused on the real issues facing Americans: skyrocketing health care costs, a crisis for farmers, and the ongoing federal government shutdown,"" the spokesperson said.

The Prairie Correctional facility in Appleton has been eyed as a potential ICE detention facility, The Washington Post reported in August, citing internal ICE documents. Noem said that she couldn't speak to specific contracts but confirmed Friday that DHS is looking at Minnesota.

Noem also touted “Operation Twin Shield” conducted by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in coordination with ICE and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from Sept. 19 to 28.

USCIS said the operation was “the first of its kind” and was aimed at fraud detection and deterrence activities in which immigration officers discovered suspected fraud in 275 cases across Minneapolis and St. Paul.

Noem's visit came three weeks after the Justice Department sued Minnesota over its ""sanctuary policies."" Walz has rejected that Minnesota is a sanctuary state, while Twin Cities mayors stand behind their separation ordinances.

It also comes as federal law enforcement cracks down in Chicago, the most recent of U.S. cities to see a surge in federal law enforcement presence. Two million undocumented immigrants have been removed or have self-deported since Jan. 20 of this year, the Department of Homeland Security reported in September.

Outside of the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, a large crowd gathered Friday afternoon.

Amber Mathwig, a veteran with About Face: Veterans Against the War, said she heard about Noem’s visit Friday on social media and that she's worried there will be an announcement that Minnesota “is the next target.”

“My concern out of this is not only that there's going to be a increase in incredibly violent, you know, detainment, kidnappings by ICE, but that a national guard from another state is going to be, you know, asked to go occupy our city, and what can happen from there,” Mathwig said.

Becky Gee, a former South Dakota resident, also heard about Noem’s visit on social media. Standing outside next to a small crowd of Trump flags, she came to show support for her former governor.

“I'm just out today supporting not only the administration, Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, just overall law and order,” Gee said. “We have to have immigrants, but we have to have immigrants coming the legal route.”

Minnesota was home to approximately 130,000 undocumented immigrants in 2023, according to a 2025 analysis from Pew Research Center — considerably smaller than estimates for states such as California, Texas and Florida, which stand in the millions.

Minnesota has more undocumented immigrants than all of its bordering states but other Midwest states such as Illinois and Michigan top Minnesota, at 550,000 and 200,000 respectively, according to the Pew estimates.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/0978ff2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x4000+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe7%2Fa7%2F3fc7afb8402fbb76aedf8af17ab2%2Fdsc-1371-1.JPG,N,,2025-10-25 02:16:52.587575

Speaking at a late afternoon news conference, she blamed Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for an increase of violent crime. She also highlighted federal funding that has been recently approved to hire more U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

“We have thousands more in the next week or two that will be deployed into field offices as well, and this office will be the beneficiary as well,” she said.

Noem’s appearance drew hundreds of protesters who held a news conference of their own and a rally outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which houses the Fort Snelling Immigration Court.

It comes on the heels of Operation Twin Shield, a “targeted surge” in enforcement by immigration officials and the FBI in the Twin Cities metro area in September that officials said uncovered 275 cases of suspected immigration fraud.

At the news conference Friday, Noem spoke behind a table piled high with confiscated assault weapons. She was joined by Samuel Westbay, St. Paul special agent in charge from Homeland Security Investigations and HSI Special Agent Tonya Price, among others.

Since January, Noem said federal agents have arrested more than 4,300 people in Minnesota for immigration violations. She highlighted four cases at the news conference of men arrested for crimes including human trafficking, homicide and sexual assault.

Major cities in Minnesota do not comply with ICE’s request to hold detainees, Noem said, allowing “dangerous criminals” to be released.

Last month, the Trump administration filed a lawsuit against the state of Minnesota, city of Minneapolis, city of St. Paul and other state officials over policies that limit cooperation between local law enforcement and federal immigration officers. The case is still pending.

Both cities are involved in lawsuits to block Trump’s order earlier this year to cut federal funding grants that support city services. Some of the threatened services include housing support, transportation and emergency management.

Frey and St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter released statements in response to Noem’s visit on Friday, reassuring residents that local law enforcement are prohibited from working with federal immigration and immigrants have legal rights.

On Friday Noem said one Minnesota county, that she did not name, has recently signed an 287(g) agreement that allows ICE to delegate authority and train local officers to perform immigration enforcement functions. She is looking to collaborate with smaller towns to partner on federal immigration operations, she said.

Local immigration attorneys said Noem’s data on arrests clashes with the information they have on their immigrant clients who have been detained by ICE in recent months. They also said an increase of federal immigration officers will likely result in more enforcement across Minnesota.

“The message that the administration wants to convey is very different than what the reality is of the average undocumented person,” said Evangeline Dhawan-Maloney, a local immigration attorney.

Watching the press conference via live video feed, some attorneys said it felt similar to a political campaign in the way it perpetuated negative rhetoric towards immigrants.

“We need these immigrants and many of them coming from the border are not the worst of the worst that she is describing,” said Gloria Contreras Edin, a St. Paul immigration attorney.

“I do not agree with the criticism of the Consultative Commission on Human Rights regarding the infrastructure of the Maison de retour,” Minister of the Interior Léon Gloden said at a press conference on Friday morning.

The facility opened in October 2024 and is located in temporary structures in Hall 6 at Luxexpo in Kirchberg.

Both Gloden and Director General of Immigration Jean-Paul Reiter said on Friday that they want the facility to move to a permanent premises but cannot yet say when that will be.

Despite the temporary facilities, Gloden rejected most of the CCDH’s criticism. “One hall will remain, but renovation work will continue,” Gloden said, noting that sanitary facilities are to be renovated.

Voluntary return is an honest policy

“Voluntary return is part of an honest immigration policy,” said Gloden. The voluntary return procedure has already been introduced step by step, and the ministry of the interior will now promote it more strongly.

The principle of voluntary return has not changed, but the procedure for doing so has been adapted. Voluntary return applies to people whose asylum application has been rejected or who are staying in Luxembourg illegally, as well as asylum seekers deemed to be the responsibility of another EU country under the so-called Dublin rules.

The new voluntary return procedure provides for every asylum seeker to be informed about the possibility of voluntary return to their country of origin or a third country before a decision is made on their application. The asylum application and the voluntary return procedure are now carried out by two different immigration officials. Previously, one official handled both procedures. “It is extremely important that there is trust between the asylum seeker and the officials during both procedures,” Gloden said.

If an asylum seeker decides to return voluntarily, they are accommodated in the Maison de retour.

Reintegration programme

Another change to voluntary return is that people who opt for this procedure or whose asylum application has been rejected will be accompanied to their country of return by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the European Reintegration Programme (EURP).

If the asylum application is rejected, the person must leave the structures of the Office national de l'accueil (ONA) within 30 days. If they decide to return voluntarily, they will receive between €3,000 and €6,000, depending on criteria.

“Voluntary return is a form of cooperation,” said Gloden. “We want to offer these people prospects in their countries,” he added. This could be achieved through training and career counselling, among other things. Neither Gloden nor Reiter said what these look like in concrete terms, however.

In 2024, there were 274 voluntary returnees to 54 countries.

President Trump says he’s canceled plans to send federal forces into San Francisco.","The United Nations is urging Israel to open the Rafah border crossing to allow urgently needed aid into the Gaza Strip. This comes as 41 aid organizations, including Oxfam and the Norwegian Refugee Council, have published an open letter accusing Israel of “arbitrarily” rejecting aid deliveries into Gaza. The letter says, “Aid denied by Israeli authorities includes tents and tarpaulins, blankets, mattresses, food and nutrition supplies, hygiene kits, sanitation materials, assistive devices, and children’s clothing, all of which should be unrestricted during the ceasefire.” The World Food Programme warned it was falling short of its target of sending 2,000 tons of food into Gaza. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization described Gaza’s starvation crisis as “catastrophic.”

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “There is increase in amount after the ceasefire, but what is entering Gaza is significantly below the required target. Significantly below the required target. And that I also can explain the second — can be an answer to the second question: Is there a dent in hunger level? So, if the Gaza that — if the aid that’s entering Gaza is significantly low, it cannot dent the hunger level. And the situation still remains catastrophic, because what’s entering is not enough.”

In Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with senior Israeli army officials and held a news conference in Kiryat Gat, the site of a new international command center with troops from the U.S., U.K., Jordan and the UAE. Rubio said that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, cannot have a role in the Gaza Strip; Rubio called it a “subsidiary of Hamas.” Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire came into effect on October 10, Israel has killed nearly 100 Palestinians and wounded 230 in Gaza.

President Trump responded Thursday to the Israeli Knesset’s vote advancing legislation that would annex the occupied West Bank.

President Donald Trump: “The West Bank is — don’t worry about the West Bank. Israel’s not going to do anything with the West Bank, OK? Don’t worry about it. Is that your question? They’re not going to do anything with the West Bank. Don’t worry about it. Israel’s doing very well. They’re not going to do anything with it.”

This follows a Time magazine interview in which Trump firmly opposed Israeli annexation, saying, “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called annexation in the West Bank a “threat to the peace process.”

Meanwhile, Al Jazeera is reporting that a child has died after being wounded by Israeli forces during a raid in Nablus. UNRWA reports more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in settler and Israeli army attacks in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023. We’ll have more on this story later in the broadcast.

Members of the Israeli opposition are slamming far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich for his “harmful” comments about Saudi Arabia. Smotrich resorted to stereotypes when he said he wouldn’t agree to a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia if it required Israel to recognize a Palestinian state.

Bezalel Smotrich: “If Saudi Arabia says to us 'normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,' friend, no, thank you. Continue riding camels on the sand in the desert. And Saudi Arabia, we will continue to develop, really, with economy and society and state and all the great and wonderful things that we know how to do.”

Smotrich has since apologized for his comments. This comes as President Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next month. It will be the Saudi crown prince’s first visit to the U.S. since the 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

President Trump says he’s suspended trade talks with Canada over an advertisement produced by the government of Ontario that criticizes tariffs. The ad features excerpts of a 1987 address by then-President Ronald Reagan warning of the dire consequences of high tariffs, like the 35% tariff Trump has imposed on most Canadian goods not covered under a trade agreement.

President Ronald Reagan: “High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse. Businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.”

In a social media post, Trump lashed out at the one-minute ad, calling it ”FAKE,” writing, “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.”

A group of civil and human rights organizations is calling on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to end the jailing of pregnant people and to immediately investigate reports of severe medical neglect in ICE jails in Louisiana and Georgia. A joint letter signed by the National Immigration Project, the American Civil Liberties Union and others describes the shackling of pregnant people during transport; solitary confinement; the denial of prenatal vitamins; inadequate food; and delayed or substandard medical care. They say one woman experienced a dangerous infection after a miscarriage due to ICE’s medical neglect.

Meanwhile, CNN is reporting that the Department of Homeland Security is funneling $10 billion through the Navy in order to construct a sprawling network of migrant detention centers in Louisiana, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Pennsylvania and Utah. A source tells CNN that facilities could hold as many as 10,000 people each.

The federal government shutdown has entered its 24th day. It’s now the second longest in U.S. history, rivaled only by the 2018-2019 shutdown during Trump’s first term. On Thursday, the Senate rejected competing partisan bills to compensate some federal workers who’ve gone without pay since early October.

This comes as at least 36 states are warning they’re preparing to suspend November payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities warns that would leave about one out of every eight people in the U.S. without food assistance, including some 16 million children, 8 million older adults and 4 million people with disabilities.

The Trump administration finalized plans Thursday to open more than a million-and-a-half acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. The Interior Department also announced the first oil and gas lease sale with the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska since 2019, and it approved a more than 200-mile industrial road through Alaska’s Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Environmentalists condemned the announcements. In a statement, the Alaska Wilderness League wrote, “Opening the entire coastal plain of the Arctic refuge to drilling would destroy one of the most ecologically significant landscapes on earth — the birthing grounds of the porcupine caribou herd, vital habitat for polar bears and migratory birds, and sacred land for the Gwich’in people who have stewarded its resources for millennia.”

President Trump on Thursday pardoned the convicted founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering while he was CEO of Binance. According to The Wall Street Journal, Binance struck a business deal with World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto startup, which has generated $4.5 billion since Trump returned to office. Binance also reportedly hired lobbyist Charles McDowell, who is a close friend of Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. Republican Senator Thom Tillis blasted the pardon, saying it sends “a bad signal.” When asked about Zhao’s pardon, President Trump said, “I don’t know, he was recommended by a lot of people.”

The Trump administration has released a list of wealthy donors and corporations funding President Trump’s $300 million construction of a 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House. Among the donors are Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Palantir, Lockheed Martin and more. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is contributing $22 million, after settling a lawsuit Trump filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after he incited his followers to attack the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

On Thursday, the Secret Service shut off public access to the Ellipse, a public park adjacent to the White House and one of the only spots to view the demolition. Photos show the entire East Wing has been knocked down.

President Trump says he’s canceled plans to send federal forces into San Francisco. On Thursday, Trump wrote on social media that he’d been talked out his plans for what he called a “surge” after he spoke with his “friends” — the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, and the CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff. Trump’s sudden reversal came as protesters rallied outside a U.S. Coast Guard base on the San Francisco Bay, where more than 100 federal agents were reportedly preparing to ramp up immigration raids. Police used flash-bang grenades to drive protesters away from an entrance as Customs and Border Patrol vehicles drove through. Separately, city officials joined protests at San Francisco City Hall. This is Laura Valdez, director of Mission Action, which works on behalf of low-income and immigrant communities.

Laura Valdez: “Please remember that this might be the start of mass enforcement in our communities, and we need to prepare adequately. And even if it is not the start, we still need to be prepared. And this community is here to back you up.”

Meanwhile, former House speaker and longtime San Francisco Congressmember Nancy Pelosi is warning federal agents they could face arrest by local police if they break California law while carrying out immigration sweeps. In a statement, Pelosi wrote, “While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not. Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.” In response, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on X, “Stand down or face prosecution. No one threatens our agents. No one will stop us from Making America Safe Again.”",https://www.democracynow.org/images/headlines/47/79547/full_hd/H4-Boat.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 10:56:36.867202

The landscape of immigration enforcement in the United States has shifted dramatically in recent months. In Colorado, Nicholas Pierce—a lawyer specializing in asylum and deportation defense—finds himself in a relentless race against changing federal policies. Each new directive, from the so-called “Freaky Friday” initiative that offered unaccompanied minors cash to self-deport, to the rollback of protections for groups like Venezuelan refugees, brings fresh uncertainty. Local human services agencies and families alike are left scrambling for answers, often with little guidance from official sources.

Pierce describes a system that has become both swifter and more unforgiving. “It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” he reflects, comparing the current crackdown to previous administrations. With hundreds of cases, he’s witnessed firsthand the profound disruption: legal statuses stripped, families forced into hiding, and children left without the right to hearings. The psychological toll is palpable, as some Coloradans are now advised to seek asylum in countries like Argentina or Chile—an option previously unthinkable.

Public opinion in Colorado is deeply divided, as evidenced by a CPR News and Colorado News Collaborative survey. While some residents support strict border controls, a majority express discomfort with the tactics being used—particularly when due process is circumvented and enforcement appears indiscriminate. One Grand Junction resident put it bluntly: “Ambushing families is despicable.” Another, from Durango, argued, “Deport criminals, not workers.” The refrain is clear: the desire for security must not come at the expense of basic human rights.

State leaders have responded with resistance. Attorney General Phil Weiser has fought federal actions in court, while lawmakers have passed bills to shield undocumented immigrants from attention. Despite these efforts, federal agents continue to execute raids, sometimes in ways that spark outrage—such as smashing car windows or detaining families with children at gunpoint. Even as state laws limit cooperation, interagency coordination persists, fueling tension among policymakers and advocates.

Economic Shockwaves: Chicago’s Restaurants and Workers in Peril

In Chicago, the consequences of the federal crackdown ripple through the city’s restaurant industry—a sector heavily reliant on immigrant labor. With increased ICE activity under operations like Midway Blitz and At Large, owners have taken drastic measures to protect staff: closing doors, shifting to takeout only, and locking entrances during business hours. The fear is pervasive, and its impact is immediate. “You can’t plan for this,” admits one restaurateur, who requested anonymity for safety.

Sales have plummeted for businesses like Taquizas Valdez and Cadinho Bakery, with foot traffic drying up as both workers and diners stay home. “You can definitely feel the streets are lonelier,” says Ivan Valdez. Online harassment compounds the anxiety, with some businesses receiving threats for displaying signs opposing ICE. The economic fallout is compounded by the human stories: street vendors have been detained, losing their livelihoods; families are separated, and owners worry about the well-being of their teams.

Yet, amid the fear, there is resilience. Community groups organize whistle events and restaurant crawls to alert neighborhoods about ICE activity and support local businesses. Owners like Omar Cadena and Eric Carlson describe a strengthened sense of solidarity, with neighbors and elected officials offering advice and resources. Fundraisers for immigrant rights groups are becoming more common, and the message is clear: immigrants are the backbone of Chicago’s vibrant food scene and economy. “They’re paying taxes, pumping money into the economy,” Cadena notes, highlighting the paradox of policies that target those who contribute most.

California’s Vigilance: Political Pushback and Community Mobilization

On the West Coast, the Bay Area remains on edge even after President Trump canceled a planned surge of federal enforcement in San Francisco. The announcement came after significant pressure from city leaders, business figures, and public outcry. But the sense of relief is tempered by caution. “San Francisco remains prepared for any scenario,” Mayor Daniel Lurie declared, echoing the region’s longstanding commitment to sanctuary policies.

The mood is tense. Federal agents’ presence on Coast Guard Island in Alameda sparked protests, with law enforcement deploying flash-bang grenades and pepper powder to disperse crowds. Local officials, including Oakland’s Barbara Lee, vow to support residents through legal means. California’s Governor Gavin Newsom continues to monitor developments, emphasizing the state’s unique role as a haven for immigrants and warning against federal overreach.

This tension plays out against a backdrop of broader political battles: Newsom has vetoed legislation citing hostile federal policies, and state leaders are fighting to preserve funding for critical services. The Bay Area’s story is one of vigilance—balancing preparedness with advocacy, and community mobilization with calls for reasoned governance.

National Pulse: Divided Opinions, Shifting Priorities

Polls reveal a country wrestling with its identity and priorities. In Colorado, concerns about illegal immigration vary by region: 90% on the Eastern Plains see it as a major problem, compared to just 46% in Denver. Meanwhile, 20% of Coloradans say the mistreatment of immigrants is an “extremely serious” concern, with higher sensitivity in urban areas. Nationally, a Gallup poll finds that only 30% of Americans now support reducing immigration—a notable decline from the previous year, with most opposition clustered along party lines.

Debate centers not only on numbers but on fairness. A New York Times/Sienna survey reports that 53% of voters believe deportation processes have not been fair, with many questioning the government’s aggressive tactics. The friction is evident: while some see strict enforcement as a necessity to protect resources and order, others warn of the social and economic costs—particularly the erosion of due process and compassion.

These divisions shape the actions of leaders and communities alike. In Colorado, legal battles and policy reforms continue. In Chicago, restaurant owners rally to support their staff and neighbors. In California, officials remain vigilant, ready to resist federal intervention. Across the country, stories of hardship and resilience abound, painting a complex portrait of a nation at a crossroads.

America’s immigration crackdown has exposed deep fractures—between security and compassion, local autonomy and federal power, economic necessity and political ideology. The voices from Colorado, Chicago, and California reveal a country searching for balance: striving to uphold laws while honoring the human stories behind every policy. Ultimately, the test will be whether communities and leaders can forge solutions that respect both the rule of law and the dignity of those who seek a better life within America’s borders.",https://azat.tv/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/America-Immigration.jpg,N,,2025-10-25 08:57:28.930197

Over Labor Day weekend, the government attempted to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children who were in ORR custody; kids were loaded onto planes before a judge halted the plan.
In early October, the government said it was offering $2,500 to unaccompanied minors 14 years and older who agree to leave the country.
Under Trump, the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border and entering ORR custody has plummeted.
In September, about 2,000 kids were in ORR custody on average, down from more than 6,000 last October.","The Department of Homeland Security has sent unaccompanied immigrant teenagers $5,000 fines for illegally entering the United States, according to youth advocates and fine notices reviewed by New York Focus and The Intercept.

Roughly 10 teenagers in New York, ages 14 to 17, received the fine in mid-October, said Meena Shah, managing director of the Legal Services Center at The Door, a New York City-based nonprofit that serves young people. At least one teenager in Michigan has received the fine too, according to the teen’s lawyer. New York Focus and The Intercept reviewed copies of the fine notices delivered in both New York and Michigan.

The fine is one of several new financial penalties for immigrants created by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July. The federal government is issuing the fines under a section of the law titled “Inadmissible alien apprehension fee,” which is set at $5,000 and can be applied to people apprehended between official ports of entry. Homeland Security’s application of the fine hasn’t been previously reported.

Shah and Ana Raquel Devereaux, the attorney representing the teenager in Michigan, both said the kids are living in shelters overseen by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, which takes custody of unaccompanied immigrant children while they wait to be released to an adult sponsor.

Devereaux, who works for the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, pointed out that kids in government custody have no ability to work.

“It’s really about creating fear,” Devereaux said. “There’s no way that a child in this situation would be able to pay this, and the penalties are so severe.”

Minors in Texas and Pennsylvania have received the fines too, according to a staff member at a national nonprofit who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the nonprofit’s leadership fears being targeted by the Trump administration.

The fine is one of several ways the Trump administration has sought in recent weeks to pressure minors who entered the U.S. alone to return to their home countries. Over Labor Day weekend, the government attempted to deport dozens of unaccompanied Guatemalan children who were in ORR custody; kids were loaded onto planes before a judge halted the plan. In early October, the government said it was offering $2,500 to unaccompanied minors 14 years and older who agree to leave the country.

The notices reviewed by New York Focus and The Intercept state that “Payment in full is due now” and list an array of potential consequences for failure to pay, including collection litigation and negative impacts on their immigration cases. Fines that aren’t paid in full will accrue interest, the notices say.

“They’re trying to pressure and coerce these young people into taking voluntary departure,” Shah said. “These are the stressors you’re putting very young kids under.”

Border Patrol teased the apprehension fee in a September 24 Facebook post, which included a megaphone emoji and said anyone 14 years or older could be fined. Money collected from the fines will be credited to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to the text of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Other fees created by the new law include $100 to apply for asylum, plus $100 every year the application is pending; $550 for asylum-seekers to apply for a work permit; and $5,000 for anyone ordered removed in absentia and then arrested by ICE. Lack of clarity over exactly how and when to pay the $100 fees recently sparked panic among asylum-seekers in New York and a flood of misinformation and potential scams, New York Focus recently reported.

In response to questions about the $5,000 fee being applied to minors, the Department of Homeland Security referred New York Focus and The Intercept to a press release about a different fee of $1,000 for immigrants paroled into the U.S. The agency did not respond to follow-up questions.

Supporters of the fine argue that it will incentivize people to cross at legal entry points rather than traverse dangerous desert terrain and take up Customs and Border Protection resources. Andrew Arthur, a fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates for restrictions on immigration, said he understood the argument that a teenager won’t be able to pay a $5,000 fine, but said their parents or relatives would then be on the hook.

“This isn’t, you know, ‘We want to punish 14-year-old kids,’” Arthur said. “This is, ‘We want to discourage parents from paying smugglers to bring their kids to the United States.’”

It’s unclear how many immigrants have received the $5,000 fine. Several attorneys who work with unaccompanied minors in New York and other states told New York Focus they’d heard about the fines secondhand but hadn’t seen any cases personally. All of the cases New York Focus and The Intercept were able to verify involved teenagers in ORR custody, but advocates said they had heard of minors outside of federal custody receiving the fines.

Under Trump, the number of unaccompanied children crossing the border and entering ORR custody has plummeted. In September, about 2,000 kids were in ORR custody on average, down from more than 6,000 last October.

Theo Liebmann, a law professor at Hofstra University who runs a legal clinic for immigrant youth, said unaccompanied kids in ORR custody are particularly vulnerable because they often don’t have lawyers, having recently arrived in the U.S.

Liebmann, who doesn’t have any clients who have received the fine, said it appeared to be an effort to “go after the kids who are especially defenseless and won’t be able to understand how to look at this threat, how real this threat is, and what they can do in response.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241884413-e1761341003294.jpg?fit=3000%2C1500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-24 22:56:36.226530

The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Friday issued a so-called administrative stay on an Oct. 20 ruling by a sharply divided three-judge panel. The stay means an Oct. 4 decision by a lower court judge to block deployment is back in effect for at least the next several days.

In the meantime, a full complement of appellate judges will consider holding a so-called en banc rehearing to review whether the 2-1 decision was correct on the law. Oregon requested the rehearing, as did the dissenting judge who said it was a dangerous decision.

“This administrative order expresses no views on the merits of this matter and is not a reconsideration of the earlier stay order,” Senior Circuit Judge Sidney R. Thomas said in the order.

The Portland dispute comes as Trump continues to tout his plans to bring state National Guard troops under federal control and send them into Democratic-led cities where he claims violent protesters are impeding the activities of US immigration agents. Similar suits are challenging Trump’s deployments to Los Angeles, Washington, DC, and Chicago.

Oregon argues a rehearing is warranted because the 2-1 ruling was wrong on the law. Friday’s order suggests the appeals court will complete its vote on whether to hold the review by Oct. 28, a day before the start of three-day trial in Portland on the merits of Oregon’s suit challenging the deployment.

The Portland is being being overseen by US District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee whose initial order against the deployment concluded the president was exaggerating the severity of the protests.

The flights began after Venezuela agreed in March to resume repatriation flights, and have continued amid heightened U.S.-Venezuelan tensions in recent weeks.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported approximately 140 individuals back to Venezuela in its latest removal flight on October 15. Last Wednesday's flight included at least seven individuals with criminal histories, including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang and sexual predators, according to DHS.

Among those deported include Jefferson Bracho Haddad, an alleged Tren de Aragua gang member that a DHS spokesperson tells CBS News had six criminal arrests, including for larceny and drug possession. The agency spokesperson added that the flight also returned Angelo Dennis-Jesus Ainaga-Jaspe, convicted of multiple weapons offenses, plus Diego Alejandro Mavarez Arocha, convicted of sexual assault.

DHS has repeatedly spotlighted removals of individuals with criminal histories as part of an ongoing effort by the Trump administration to deport undocumented migrants the government determines pose threats to public safety.

""These individuals, including confirmed Tren de Aragua gang members, sexual predators, and violent offenders, should have never been in our country in the first place,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement provided to CBS News, adding that an estimated 2 million undocumented immigrants have left the U.S. since January.

McLaughlin did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported. The vast majority would have needed to leave without making contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.

According to senior DHS officials, the deportations to Venezuela have occurred alongside the intensified U.S. campaign against drug trafficking and transnational crime in South America. The Trump administration has carried out at least 10 known strikes on suspected narcotics vessels over the past two months, including two this week off Colombia's Pacific coast. The most recent strike, conducted overnight, targeted a vessel allegedly operated by Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang in the Caribbean Sea.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said it was ""a lethal kinetic strike"" in international waters, marking the first night strike of the campaign. ""Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike … all six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed,"" Hegseth said.

Trump administration officials say the combination of targeted strikes and deportation flights reflect a multi-pronged strategy to disrupt the Tren de Aragua gang and other organized criminal networks, which have been linked to drug trafficking and violent crime throughout the Americas.

The U.S.-Venezuela repatriation deal, which allows the flights to Caracas, has faced scrutiny from human rights organizations, though Trump administration officials point to the diplomatic deal as an important tool in reducing the influence of transnational criminal gangs within the United States.

Senators left Thursday after failing to advance legislation that aimed to pay essential workers, such as military troops or immigration enforcement agents, despite the funding lapse. Workers expect to miss their first full paychecks within the next few days, depending on where they work.

The vote was different from the previous 11 votes that failed to advance a House-passed bill to fund the government through Nov. 21. The last vote on that temporary remedy was Wednesday as advocates warned about running out of food benefits, delayed flights and other lost services during the shutdown.

The shutdown, entering its 24th day, has dragged on for long enough that lawmakers are looking for options for a longer, temporary funding bill to complete negotiations on full-year funding for government agencies.

Trump told reporters he didn’t know if the shutdown would be resolved by the time he returns from a trip to Asia on Oct. 30. His trip will take him to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea.

""My officers are frustrated right now,"" he said in a statement Friday. ""I have officers who are taking out loans to pay their rent and feed their families. I have officers who are borrowing money from family members to make their car payment, pay for daycare, or pay their student loans.""

House officially out for another week

The House of Representatives is officially scheduled to be out for another week, even as the shutdown is barreling toward record length.

Though he's acknowledged some frustration about the strategy within the GOP caucus, Speaker Mike Johnson has kept the chamber away from voting as part of an effort to pressure Senate Democrats. Without the House in session, it's impossible to pass any bipartisan funding deals.

The House recess, which began Sept. 19, is slated to continue through Sunday, Nov. 2. Lawmakers will receive a 48-hour notice if the speaker changes his mind and decides to bring them back to vote. - Zachary Schermele

Expiring health care subsidies remains the focus of shutdown for Democrats

Health care policy remains the dividing line for Democrats on Day 24 of the federal government shutdown.

Senate Democrats have 12 times blocked a Republican-backed continuing resolution to fund the government at existing spending levels. Democrats argue legislation to reopen the government should also extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies and reverse Republicans’ Medicaid cuts passed over the summer.

Republicans have refused to entertained negotiations on health care policy, arguing the health care subsidies should be debated by Congress after the shutdown is over.

Democrats have circled Nov. 1 as a key date in their push. That’s when open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, begins and millions of Americans will start shopping for their 2026 health coverage plans.

If the subsidies are not extended by November, healthcare.gov consumers could experience sticker shock when they start searching for health care plans. Premiums are expected to double for millions of Americans if the subsidies are not renewed, according to the research organization KFF.

Inflation ticked up in September

Inflation ticked up again in September, revealing the persistence of rising prices as the job market shows signs of cooling and consumers head into the holiday season.

Consumer prices increased 3% from a year earlier, slightly up from 2.9% in August, according to the Labor Department’s Consumer Price Index, a measure of goods and services costs across the country.

The economic impact of the ongoing government shutdown has not yet been fully felt, according to Bankrate Financial Analyst Stephen Kates. At the Bureau of Labor Statistics, October data collection has been suspended during the lapse in funding.

“Federal layoffs or the absence of backpay would drag down spending and worsen labor conditions, especially in the local areas most affected,” Kates said in an Oct. 21 note. “The longer the shutdown continues, the larger our blind spot will be on current economic conditions.”

What is the Social Security COLA adjustment for 2026?

While the Labor department's jobs report was delayed due to the ongoing shutdown, today's Consumer Price Index received special attention as it was needed to calculate cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, for Social Security.

The Social Security Administration announced a 2.8% adjustment in 2026, larger than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries have received in 2025.

Airline pilot unions urge passage of Republican bill to end shutdown

Pilots for major airlines are jumping into the fight over the federal government shutdown as three pilot unions called on Congress to end the stalemate by passing the Republican-backed continuing resolution.

The Coalition of Airline Pilots Associations, the NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots, and the Allied Pilots Association issued separate statements on Thursday urging Congress to pass a ""clean"" continuing resolution to reopen the government.

Their statements came after a fourth union, Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, endorsed the Republican-backed continuing resolution the previous day.

About 13,000 air traffic controllers ‒ considered ""essential"" workers ‒ are working without pay during the shutdown. Transportation Security Administration employees are also forced to work without pay.

""We have seen the stress and tension this year on the National Airspace System due to short-staffed air traffic controllers,"" the Coalition of Airline Pilot Associations said in a statement. ""This shutdown only compounds the pressures they face as they now report to work without a paycheck.""

The Air Line Pilots Association, the largest pilot union with about 80,000 members, in an Oct. 15 statement called on lawmakers to find a solution to reopen the government, but it did not specify which bill Congress should pass.

The White House warned that Americans should expect airport delays and disruptions if the shutdown spills into the Thanksgiving holiday, when travel historically spikes.

""We fear there will be there will be significant flight delays, disruptions and cancellations across the country this holiday season,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a Thursday briefing with reporters. ""If Democrats continue to shut down the government, they will also be shutting down American air travel."" Read more.

Unsuccessful Senate bill aimed to pay essential workers

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, proposed legislation that would have paid ""essential"" workers such as air-traffic controllers, members of the military and immigrant enforcement agents, who remain on the job despite a lack of paychecks.

""We're not paying them,"" Johnson said. ""That's absurd.""

The 54-45 vote fell short of the 60 necessary to advance the bill. Three Democrats joined Republicans in supporting the measure: Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff of Georgia and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania.

Trump uncertain if shutdown will be resolved during Asia trip

Trump told reporters he didn’t know if the shutdown would be resolved by the time he returns from a trip to Asia on Oct. 30.

""I don't know,"" he told reporters at the White House.

Trump leaves Friday for a trip to Malaysia, Japan and South Korea. But he said Democrats “have gone totally crazy” and their unpredictability leaves resolution of the dispute uncertain.

“I don’t think they know what they’re doing right now,” Trump said.

Time runs short to resolve full-year funding bills even if shutdown ends

The House approved legislation to keep the government funded through Nov. 21 because lawmakers thought seven weeks would provide enough time to approve full-year spending bills.

But with half that period gone already, without even the temporary funding approved, lawmakers are starting to look for options to both reopen the government and fund it for an entire year.

Another bill might be required just to reopen the government until December or next year. But the House has been out while waiting for the Senate to reopen the government. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, has opposed bringing back the House until the Senate acts.

Rep. Jason Smith, R-Missouri, who heads the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, told Bloomberg TV on Wednesday that some Republicans are talking about extending funding past the next election, until Dec. 1, 2026.

“Every day that passes, we’ve got less time to fund the government,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, told reporters Monday.

A shortage of air-traffic controllers could lead to cancelled flights: DOT

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that a shortage of air-traffic controllers could lead to more delayed and cancelled flights with the holidays approaching.

Duffy told reporters Oct. 23 that controllers will miss their first full paycheck Oct. 28. As they grow concerned about how to pay their mortgage or car loan, or to put food on the table, Duffy worried they would look for second jobs.

“I don’t want my air-traffic controllers taking a second job,” Duffy said of the high-stress job requiring concentration.

Duffy said a lack of controllers would lead to reduced flights.

“Safety is paramount for us,” Duffy said. “You will see us delay traffic. You will see us cancel flights.”

Former budget official: SNAP food benefits could be extended

Sharon Parrott, president of the nonpartisan research institute Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the Trump administration could continue providing food assistance to low-income families through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program despite the shutdown.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has warned full benefits won’t be available Nov. 1 if the shutdown continues. But Parrott, a former Office of Management and Budget official, said the administration could shift billions of dollars in contingency funding to continue benefits for the 42 million people who participate in the program.

“It would be unconscionable for the Administration to go out of its way to threaten millions of children, seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, parents, and workers with hunger, rather than taking all legal steps available to provide food assistance to people who need it,"" Parrott said.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/21/USAT/86819058007-20251020-t-184510-z-423036774-rc-2-sfhaawg-07-rtrmadp-3-usashutdown-1.JPG?crop=5499,3093,x0,y550&width=3200&height=1800&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-24 21:00:59.882595

Reports of federal immigration agents making arrests and tear-gassing neighbors on the North Side led some elected officials to leave the hearing at the Cook County Building to check out the latest development in operations Midway Blitz and At Large in person.

Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Illinois, said that at least four people living in her district were “disappeared” as Friday’s hearing unfolded. While the arrests continued away from Friday’s “shadow hearing,” Ramirez told Block Club that the visit offered a valuable perspective for her colleagues who haven’t yet seen federal agents descend on their communities as they have in Chicago.

“Nothing beats watching, seeing, walking through these streets — whether it’s in Little Village or Albany Park or Humboldt Park — to actually feel and see and take that back to the work that we have to do,” Ramirez said.

Among those who left to deal with raids that were happening at the same time were Cook County Board Commissioner Jessica Vásquez, Ald. Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez (33rd) and State Rep. Lilian Jiménez, Ramirez said during the hearing.

Friday’s gathering was the fourth in a series of “shadow hearings” — or unofficial public hearings — by a group of members of Congress touring the country to discuss the tactics deployed by immigration agents and the trauma left behind. Previous hearings were held in Washington, D.C., and this was the first one held in Chicago, said Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Washington.

“My people are being hunted down, in Chicago, by ICE and CBP and other agencies,” said Juliet De Jesus Alejandre, the Logan Square Neighborhood Association’s executive director, during the hearing.

For more than a month, Chicagoans have tried to keep up with ICE sightings across the city, sharing information with each other, including through rapid response groups. Across the city neighbors — including City Council members — are using bright orange whistles to warn others when federal immigration officials are nearby.

“Everyday community members, also known as rapid responders, are now the last line of defense against unbridled, violent kidnappings of both our beloved immigrant families and neighbors and, also, U.S.-born Black and Brown Chicagoans,” De Jesus Alejandre said.

Rep. Jesús “Chuy” García, D-Illinois, directed his ire at Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino — the public face of the ongoing operations in Chicago — saying that Bovino and other federal agents have been operating without warrants and are violating residents’ Constitutional rights.

“We saw a little man [Bovino] lead an attack on a hard-working, studious, industrious community as he sprayed tear gas on people in our community. We reject these practices,” García said.

Over the past month, federal agents in and around Chicago have shot at least two people, killing one; repeatedly tear-gassed protesters and first responders; shot rubber bullets at protesters; detained U.S. citizens, including children; handcuffed a Chicago alderperson in a hospital; smoke-bombed and tear-gassed people in Logan Square, Albany Park and East Side; fired a chemical weapon at a TV reporter and detained a journalist.

Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Michigan, also presented recruitment ads from the Department of Homeland Security that she said were examples of how members of the Trump administration, like Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, are pushing an “extremist” anti-immigrant ideology via federal agents’ actions.

“I want my colleges to remember this, because when we get the gavel back, we’ve got to know they’re already there. We’ve got to address white supremacy within our agencies that are attacking our immigrant neighbors,” Tlaib said.

Arrests without due process or access to legal counsel shows that people are being “disappeared and kidnapped” by the Trump administration, Tlaib said.

“I can’t believe I can’t find my residents. Literally for days,” Tlaib said.

Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Illinois, suggested that immigration officials were violating the law at ICE’s Broadview processing facility, citing feedback from constituents who’ve had loved ones detained there. He read an email from one person who wrote, “My dad was sent to Mexico, but he told me he signed his voluntary leave because the conditions were so inhumane inside the Broadview facility.”

The conditions included up to 60 people kept inside one cell, which has forced them to sleep standing up, Krishnamoorthi said.

Mayor Brandon Johnson was among a group of local and state officials who also participated in Friday’s hearing. He implored state leaders to declare a state of emergency to allow virtual learning for students whose families are affected by federal agents’ actions.

It was part fact-finding mission and part a show of solidarity among democrats who have from the beginning decried the way ICE and Border Patrol agents have carried out their immigration enforcement mission.

For weeks now, communities across the Chicagoland area have been responding to ICE agents targeting their neighborhoods, like Little Village, with large crowds trying to disrupt those efforts.

Protesters have frequently surrounded ICE vehicles and used cell phones to document what's happening, sometimes prompting agents to deploy tear gas to disperse crowds. That has happened despite a judge issuing a temporary restraining order limiting the use of chemical agents.

""They will say, our presence is impeding right, our yelling is documenting, right, and our documentation, they don't want to be documented, because everything that they're doing is illegal, it's unconstitutional is violent and it's dangerous,"" said Juliet de Jesus Alejandre, Executive Director of Palenque LSNA.

House democrats from across the country, including most from the Chicago region, held an unofficial immigration hearing to get testimony from impacted community members, including one 19-year-old woman named Genesis, whose mother has been detained.

""I get home from one of mom's shifts and I still need to find a way to put food on the table for my little sister and me,"" Genesis said. ""I have to seek more affordable meals because I don't have enough money to pay the bills that are already piling up.""

""They've conducted raids near churches and clinics and places that should be sacred,"" Rep. Jesús ""Chuy"" García said. ""That's why we're conducting oversight and demanding accountability, and an end to the lawless federal invasion of Chicago.""

The Trump administration has said agents are going after violent criminals who are in illegally, but communities members said frequently not turned out to be the case. 08 1:02

""With two operations on the ground, the effects are chilling. ICE and CBP are operating without a hint of accountability or transparency for their actions,"" said Ani Huamani with the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council.

Mayor Brandon Johnson later joined the members of Congress in a show of unity, thanking the congressional delegation for raising awareness of what's happening in Chicago.

""I'm grateful that you all are here to shed light today on Trump's unlawful and increasingly aggressive actions taken against our city and cities across America. What we heard today in the hearing was alarming stories of protesters being attacked, children being traumatized and communities living in fear,"" Johnson said. ""Our standing here today, standing here proudly, unapologetically sends a very clear message to Donald Trump. Chicago will not be silent, we will not bend, we will not cower and we will certainly not break.""

Among those testifying was a pastor, David Black with First Presbyterian Church Chicago, who was hit in the head with pepper balls while praying outside the ICE detention facility in Broadview.

""Temporary restraining order issued by Judge Sarah Ellis should be improving the conditions of those exercising their First Amendment right in Chicago Bovino and his henchmen are showing mocking contempt for the rule of law,"" Pastor Black said.

""May my colleagues take this conviction back, as we remind those in leadership in Congress that it is our moral responsibility to defend our communities,"" Rep. Delia Ramirez said. ""The greatest threat to public safety in Chicago is ICE AND CBP. I think it's important we lift up just how out of control and unaccountable DHS is.""

The committee members have already been in Chicago two days, talking to community groups gathering information and feedback. Before they return to Washington, they plan to meet with business groups and educators as well.

""We will take these field hearings across the country, and we will use every part of our power and our platform to fight back and ensure that we return this country to a country of democracy and justice for all,"" Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security provided more information Friday about recent violent run-ins with federal agents over the past few days.

DHS issued the following statement:

""While conducting immigration enforcement operations in Cicero and Glendale Heights, agitators stalked law enforcement, rammed vehicles, fled scenes, injured agents, and caused multiple accidents across town-putting law enforcement and the public in danger. Despite the violence, CBP arrested 3 illegal aliens who were breaking our nation's immigration laws. Six citizens were arrested for impeding and threatening to kill agents.

""Our officers are facing a surge in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, and gang members.

Criminal lawyers had to advise only of “direct” consequences.","Criminal defense lawyers don’t have to take into account what a guilty plea could cost their clients in a civil lawsuit, a federal appeals court has ruled.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit this month rejected a lawsuit by Nita and Kirtish Patel, who tried to extend protections to immigrants in danger of deportation to civil litigation. Criminal defense lawyers are required to advise non-citizens of the effects of guilty pleas on their immigration status, but the Third Circuit would go no further.

The Patels forged medical documents to bill the United States for services and face millions of dollars of liability under the False Claims Act – a law that allows whistleblowers and state and federal government to sue when governments are over-billed.

“(I)f we were to hold that the Sixth Amendment requires defense counsel to advise a client about potential civil liability under the False Claims Act, we would be recognizing a new rule of constitutional law,” the Third Circuit wrote.

The Patels offered mobile diagnostic test services at Biosound Medical Services and Heart Solution, and Kirtish falsely told Medicare that a licensed neurologist would perform neurological diagnostic testing.

Kirtish wrote diagnostic reports, and Nita forged the signature of a physician. They earned at least $4.3 million, with about $1.7 million of it coming from Medicare.

But in 2014, a whistleblower who had worked for the Patels filed a False Claims Act lawsuit in New Jersey federal court. This alerted prosecutors who soon arrested them.

They each pleaded guilty to a count of healthcare fraud with the agreement there would be no more criminal charges. Nita got 78 months in prison and Kirtish got 100 months, along with restitution of $4.8 million.

The federal government has the option to intervene in FCA cases filed by whistleblowers, and it did. It used the guilty pleas as evidence of the Patels’ liability.

Awards in FCA cases are tripled as a punishment. A judge ordered $5 million in damages, plus another $2,750,000 in civil penalties.

Nita and Kirtish moved to vacate their criminal sentences because their lawyers had never informed them of their potential civil liability when pleading guilty. They pointed to a 2010 decision – Padilla v. Kentucky – which held criminal lawyers had to caution immigrants on what a guilty plea could do to their status.

Criminal lawyers had to advise only of “direct” consequences. The Supreme Court in Padilla didn’t classify deportation as a “collateral” consequence because removal from the country is a “particularly severe penalty… intimately related to the criminal process.”

Other circuits have held the Padilla ruling is directed only at deportation.

“We read Padilla the same way,” the Third Circuit said. “It did not disturb the lower courts’ rules about whether the Sixth Amendment requires attorneys to inform their clients of a conviction’s collateral consequences.

“Instead, it announced that those courts’ rules are inapplicable to one specific consequences: deportation.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/6b/c6b4eaeb-ba17-46f1-a276-006e390eaf73/68fa9b8fa5fea.image.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 23:56:39.632413

Management and Training Cooperation previously owned the prison from the mid-90s until 2013. Fast forward to this year, MTC owns the facility once again after purchasing it from the state for $15 million.

In May, a spokesperson with MTC told KGUN 9 that the facility would be used for detention purposes. In October, an MTC spokesperson told KGUN 9 they are still exploring opportunities with several public agencies and don’t have additional information to share.

As its exact future use remains a question, hundreds of people attended Thursday’s community forum. Everyone in attendance appeared to be opposed to a potential ICE detention center in the town.

Veteran Stevie Rendino said she can’t believe what is going on in the country.

“I fought for freedom or so they told me, and now here I am having to protest a secret police,” she said.

She and Marana resident, Bennett Burke, shared similar feelings when they found out about the possible use of the facility near Sanders and Silverbell.

“Absolute disgust,” Rendino said.

“Outrage, I’m outraged at all of this,” Burke said.

While hundreds were in opposition at Thursday’s event, KGUN 9 recently spoke to Republican State Senator John Kavanagh, who is in support of it being used as an ICE detention facility.

“While they’re being processed, we don’t want to overcrowd them in office jail cells or local jails – let’s have a nice facility and they can get their due process, or they can wait for their flight out there,” he said.

Early this year, Sen. Kavanagh proposed Senate Bill 1294, which would have allowed the state to lease the facility to ICE for $1 a year. The bill failed in the House.

In a letter addressed to Pelosi, Newsom, state Attorney General Rob Bonta and San Francisco D.A. Brooke Jenkins, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche accused the officials of encouraging efforts to detain federal agents, specifically those working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), if they violate state law during operations.

| REGISTER NOW: Protecting major events from drone threats

Blanche’s letter came in response to recent remarks by Pelosi, who suggested that local law enforcement in California could arrest ICE agents if they break state laws. In a joint statement with Rep. Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.), Pelosi cited California’s legal protections and said that while the president may have immunity from prosecution, “those who operate under his orders do not.”

“California law prevents federal agents from taking certain actions,” the statement read. “Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the president cannot pardon them.”

In response, Blanche called such statements “illegal and futile,” warning that any attempts to arrest federal law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties would be met with legal consequences.

“Stand down or face prosecution,” Blanche wrote on X. “No one threatens our agents. No one will stop us from Making America Safe Again.”

He also directed the officials to preserve all written and electronic communications related to any such plans.

None of the plaintiffs responded to a FedScoop request for comment on the new court filing, nor did Democracy Forward, which represents the groups, by the time of publication.
The IRS’s data-sharing agreement with ICE has sparked outrage from immigrant rights and privacy groups, as well as separate litigation.
When news of the pact broke in March, the IRS’s then-acting commissioner resigned from the agency in protest.","The Treasury Department found out this week that a Department of Homeland Security component recently requested data from the IRS — but the ask wasn’t from the subagency currently tied up in litigation over solicitations of that kind.

In a federal court filing Thursday, attorneys for the defendants in Center for Taxpayer Rights v. Internal Revenue Service said Treasury on Tuesday “learned of a request” to the IRS made by Customs and Border Protection.

According to the Justice Department lawyers, CBP on or around Sept. 11 reached out to the IRS “for certain corporate return information pursuant to” the section of federal tax code on “ascertaining the correctness of audits under the Tariff Act of 1930.” Treasury notified the attorneys of this request Wednesday, per the filing.

The lawsuit in question was initially about DOGE’s access to IRS IT systems. The plaintiffs — the Center for Taxpayer Rights, Main Street Alliance, the National Federation of Federal Employees and the Communications Workers of America — sought to cut off that access, citing privacy concerns.

But an amended complaint filed in May took a broader look at the “sensitive taxpayer data DOGE seeks to share,” including moves made by DHS “to support unspecified criminal investigations in connection with immigration enforcement.”

On Sept. 5, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ordered the defense attorneys to notify the court within 24 hours of any additional requests DHS or Immigration and Customs Enforcement makes to the IRS, or new plans to share tax data with those agencies.

Since the September data request came from CBP and not ICE, the defense wrote in its filing that it does not think it “falls within the ambit of the Court’s order” but decided to share the information with the court anyway, “out of an abundance of caution.”

The defense also noted that CBP did not request any individual tax return information. The agency also has “no authority” to “redisclose” information to ICE that it obtained via the tariff-related section of the Internal Revenue Code, the attorneys said.

None of the plaintiffs responded to a FedScoop request for comment on the new court filing, nor did Democracy Forward, which represents the groups, by the time of publication.

The IRS’s data-sharing agreement with ICE has sparked outrage from immigrant rights and privacy groups, as well as separate litigation. When news of the pact broke in March, the IRS’s then-acting commissioner resigned from the agency in protest.",https://fedscoop.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/GettyImages-2215825907.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 19:17:22.168563

According to that article, the Departments of Defense and Justice were assisting ICE in an investigation into an alleged ""concealed logistics network"" that used nonprofits and people without legal status in the U.S. for ""dark money, globalist data tracking operations, and in some cases, organ harvesting.""

ICE had reportedly discovered that network during its raids, leading the local government — Los Angeles County — to attempt to block further federal access through a state of emergency declaration, according to Gazetteller.com.

Los Angeles County Supervisors Lindsey P. Horvath and Janice Hahn, who co-introduced the state of emergency declaration, dismissed the article via email as ""absurd.""

In October 2025, a claim (archived) circulated online that Los Angeles County declared a state of emergency after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids exposed ""tunnels, safe houses, and foreign-backed trafficking hubs"" in the area.

Los Angeles County includes dozens of cities in southern California, the most populous of which is Los Angeles. County supervisors voted to declare a state of emergency on October 14, 2025, after ICE ramped up enforcement actions in June (archived).

Popular X and Facebook (archived) posts sharing the claim began with an all-caps headline, reading, ""L.A. DECLARES STATE OF EMERGENCY AFTER TRUMP'S ICE RAIDS EXPOSE TUNNELS, SAFEHOUSES, AND FOREIGN-BACKED TRAFFICKING HUBS HIDDEN INSIDE SANCTUARY PROGRAMS""

The claim also circulated on Instagram (archived) and Threads (archived). Snopes readers wrote in asking if the claim was true.

Los Angeles County's state of emergency declaration did not mention ICE discoveries or the reported investigation. According to the declaration, the state of emergency was necessary because ICE raids had ""created a climate of fear"" that kept people affected by enforcement actions at home, leading to ""long-term harm to workers, families, and businesses.""

The claim appeared to come from an article (archived) on Gazetteller.com that featured the same all-caps headline seen in online claims. Gazetteller.com is an independent news website that takes article submissions from readers. That article appeared to be the sole source of the claim, as searches on Google, Yahoo, Bing and DuckDuckGo did not produce similar reports from other news outlets (archived, archived, archived, archived).

Gazetteller.com's article claimed that ICE raids had ""exposed tunnels, safe houses, and foreign-backed trafficking hubs"" inside ""sanctuary programs.""

The article's central claim was that the real reason why Los Angeles County declared a state of emergency was to attempt to keep federal agents out after the discovery of the alleged ""concealed logistics network."" Snopes could not independently verify this claim. Therefore, we leave this story unrated.

Los Angeles County Supervisors Lindsey P. Horvath and Janice Hahn, who co-introduced the state of emergency declaration, told Snopes via email: ""This is absurd.

LA County declaration a response to 'climate of fear'

Though Gazetteller.com claimed it was ICE's alleged discoveries that prompted the state of emergency declaration, Los Angeles County's declaration said it was the effects of the raids on the local population that drove the county to act.

Los Angeles County wrote in its state of emergency declaration:

Enforcement actions and tactics have created a climate of fear, leading to widespread disruption in daily life and adverse impacts to our regional economy due to decreased attendance at workplaces, the temporary or permanent closure of businesses and restaurants, and increased strain on our local institutions such as schools, hospitals, and places of worship

Horvath, who co-proposed the declaration, said it would allow the county to ""protect and stabilize"" communities affected by ICE actions.

In practice, the declaration allowed officials to seek financial assistance and mutual aid outside the county to support people affected by ICE's enforcement action. That could mean assisting them financially or with free legal aid. The declaration allowed the county to expedite hiring, contracting and procurement to achieve this.

The declaration did not mention any of the alleged ICE discoveries that Gazetteller.com reported. The website's article referenced ""internal reports"" that said Los Angeles County was using the declaration to block federal oversight. Snopes could not independently find or verify these reports.

DHS and ICE websites mum about alleged discoveries

At the time of this writing, neither the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) nor ICE had publicly confirmed any details from Gazetteller.com's article.

ICE ramped up activity in the city of Los Angeles starting June 6, according to Mayor Karen Bass. ICE said on June 7 that agents arrested 118 people without legal status in the U.S. in Los Angeles that week. That number was up to 5,000 arrests by late August.

Searches on the DHS and ICE websites and social media for news about tunnels in Los Angeles produced no results. DHS, ICE and other government departments do not publish information about all their work online and might withhold discoveries connected to ongoing investigations.

In sum, Snopes could not independently verify the central claim in Gazeteller.com's article. We await replies from several departments and agencies to queries about the details in the article, which two Los Angeles County supervisors dismissed as ""absurd.""

Los Angeles County's state of emergency declaration remained in place at the time of this writing and could only be lifted by the Board of Supervisors. ICE and DHS enforcement actions also continued in Los Angeles and across the country despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown.

We’re taking a closer look at what’s going on inside the facility, as detainees and advocates say it’s reaching the point of overcrowding.
This year, under this [Trump] administration, we’ve seen it grow pretty quickly, grow to what we believe to be at or near capacity, he said.
VanDerhoef says the increased volume of detainees has impacted access to quality legal counsel and created other issues for detainees.
Nationally, the Trump administration touted the bond policy against immigrants who entered the country illegally.","The number of detainees at Tacoma’s Northwest ICE Processing Center has risen since the Trump administration took over.

We’re taking a closer look at what’s going on inside the facility, as detainees and advocates say it’s reaching the point of overcrowding.

For the past 12 years, private Seattle immigration attorney Larkin VanDerhoef has worked with clients at the detention center under numerous administrations (Presidents Barack Obama, Donald Trump 1.0, Joe Biden, and now Trump 2.0).

Since January, VanDerhoef says, the population has gone up while the facility at times has been understaffed.

“In the time that I have been working with people down there, we’ve seen the population ebb and flow depending on administrations and priorities. And probably the lowest was during COVID in 2020, 2021. This year, under this [Trump] administration, we’ve seen it grow pretty quickly, grow to what we believe to be at or near capacity, he said.

We reached out to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement about the reports of overcrowding at the Tacoma detention center.

In a statement, an ICE spokesperson told Cascade PBS, “There is no overcrowding at NWIPC ... ICE has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding.”

However, according to data analysis by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights, the facility has been nearly at capacity for most of this year, and even went above capacity, briefly, over the summer. The facility has a maximum capacity of 1,575.

VanDerhoef says the increased volume of detainees has impacted access to quality legal counsel and created other issues for detainees.

“We understand the contract that the GEO Group, who runs the facility, has with the Department of Homeland Security, as they are to provide by the contract 10 spaces or rooms for legal visits. They’ve never provided that, in the time that I have been working with people down there,” he said. “In fact, it was seven rooms, [and] more recently, two of them have been taken away. They’re using ... two entirely, now, for court hearings being done by video by judges across the country. So we’ve seen a dramatic increase in the population, and in fact a decrease in actual physical access to be able to visit our clients.”

ICE did not respond to our follow-up questions about allegations that attorneys have been having a hard time adequately preparing their cases with clients; the reduction in contact visit rooms; and the high volume of daily hearings. GEO Group did respond, but its spokesperson, Christopher V. Ferreira, referred us to an initial email statement:

“The support services GEO provides include around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation.”

VanDerhoef also says under the Trump administration, a vital legal lifeline was cut — the Legal Orientation Program, run by the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project.

“With the ending of the Legal Orientation Program, it at least provided individuals with the legal assessment to know what their options are; and with issues of limiting access, it’s pretty clear that the goal is to have more cases conclude in the immigration court without lawyers because it certainly is easier and quicker to deport somebody who doesn’t know their legal rights,” Larkin explained.

In late September, a federal judge ruled that a Tacoma immigration court’s practice of denying bond to detained noncitizens was unlawful. Nationally, the Trump administration touted the bond policy against immigrants who entered the country illegally.

The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed the class action lawsuit last spring against the Tacoma immigration courts.

VanDerhoef says that despite the ruling, the courts have not complied in automatically granting bond, or at least presenting the opportunity to request it.

“What we’re seeing, this is pretty unprecedented. But in recent weeks, we’re seeing the immigration judges not following that order, and we’re still waiting to see. They may be waiting for further guidance, but it’s pretty clear they are bound by that order. And they’re still not granting bonds for people that this federal judge has decided should be eligible for them,” Larkin said.",https://www.cascadepbs.org/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/The_Newsfeed_10.24.png,N,,2025-10-24 18:56:48.462106

It is unclear if the Supreme Court will still be closed to the public come Nov. 5.
The basis of the consolidated case The Supreme Court said in September it would hear the case, after a series of lower court rulings that invalidated the tariffs but allowed them to remain in place for the nation’s top court to have the final word.
The federal government has argued that if the Supreme Court ultimately sided with lower courts and blocked Trump’s tariffs, it may deliver a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.","WASHINGTON — Less than two weeks away from oral arguments before the Supreme Court about the legality of sweeping tariffs that President Donald Trump placed on most countries, the nation’s top court is setting more of the ground rules for the proceedings, as the president is accusing a U.S. ally of trying to “illegally influence” the outcome.

Trump contended that Ontario, the most populous province in Canada, was seeking to tip the scales of the case in favor of the small business and state plaintiffs seeking to upend the levies by placing TV ads using excerpts from a 1987 speech by former President Ronald Reagan.

Trump posted on his Truth Social site Friday morning that Canada was “trying to illegally influence the United States Supreme Court in one of the most important rulings in the history of our Country.”

In the radio address, Reagan said of tariffs that “such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.’’ Ontario premier Doug Ford said later Friday that the ad would be taken down.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to allow an extended 80-minute period of oral arguments on Nov. 5 – with 40 minutes for the U.S. solicitor general and 20 minutes each for lawyers representing the American companies and states that are suing.

In its decision, the court also denied additional oral arguments by separate plaintiffs who argue that tariffs have unlawfully burdened commerce and travel essential of indigenous communities living along the border between the U.S. and Canada.

Trump suggested earlier this month that he plans to attend the Supreme Court proceedings, which could be the first time a sitting president does so. The Supreme Court Historical Society said Friday that there is no record to their knowledge that it has ever happened before.

It is unclear if the Supreme Court will still be closed to the public come Nov. 5. The highest court announced last week it has shut its doors to the public ""until further notice"" due to the ongoing government shutdown.

The basis of the consolidated case

The Supreme Court said in September it would hear the case, after a series of lower court rulings that invalidated the tariffs but allowed them to remain in place for the nation’s top court to have the final word. Opening arguments next month were originally scheduled for the typical one hour.

Trump announced in April that he was imposing what he called “Liberation Day” tariffs, including a 10% import duty across the board and additional levies that vary by country. Seperately, the president placed duties on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the threat of illegal immigration and drugs from the countries constituted a ""national emergency"" under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act.

The Trump administration contends the president has the ability to impose tariffs under the IEEPA by declaring that the U.S. is facing a national emergency.

The past few days have seen a flurry of amicus briefs, including one filed Friday by economics, politics and law of international trade professors that contends the president must instead abide by a different law on trade: Section 122.

That law –– a part of the Trade Act of 1974 — allows the president to place “temporary import surcharges” to address “fundamental international payments problems” but restricts the placement to 150 days and 15% — on top of duties already in place.

Solicitor General Dean John Sauer referenced Section 122 in a filing to the nation’s top court but contended that it should be viewed as “complementary” to the statute Trump has used as the basis for his tariffs.

“Section 122 and IEEPA each provides an independent source of authority,” Saur wrote in his brief. “The President’s choice to exercise his authority under one does not compel him to comply with the terms of the other.”

Who are the parties involved?

Separate cases involving small businesses and states — V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump and Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump — have been working their way through the courts in recent months, and will be considered in tandem by the nation’s highest court.

V.O.S. Selections — a New York-based wine business — is joined in its litigation by Genova Pipe, a plastic pipe manufacturer; MicroKits, which makes electronic toys and musical devices; FishUSA, a fishing equipment company; and Terry Precision Cycling, a women’s cycling brand.

The states of Oregon, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Vermont have also signed onto their lawsuit.

In the other case originating in Washington, D.C., two Chicago area educational companies — Learning Resources and hand2mind — argued that their businesses made it through the COVID-19 pandemic but that the tariffs “are now posing the greatest challenge of their existence.”

The CEO of Learning Resource estimated in April that the company’s tariff bill would rise from $2.3 million in 2024 to $100.2 million this year.

Revenue of Trump’s tariffs to date

Tariffs have already raised about $200 billion for the country’s coffers so far this year, the Congressional Budget Office reported.

The federal government has argued that if the Supreme Court ultimately sided with lower courts and blocked Trump’s tariffs, it may deliver a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.

“If the United States were forced to pay back the trillions of dollars committed to us, America could go from strength to failure the moment such an incorrect decision took effect,” Sauer said in a letter to a federal appeals court earlier this year.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/supreme_court_AP_25135471977857_NAT_1020,N,,2025-10-24 19:17:27.931503

In a statement, the US Treasury accused Petro of failing to rein in Colombia’s cocaine industry and of shielding criminal groups from accountability.

The Treasury cited Petro’s “Total Peace” plan, an initiative designed to bring an end to Colombia’s six-decade-long internal conflict through negotiations with armed rebels and criminal organisations.

“Since President Gustavo Petro came to power, cocaine production in Colombia has exploded to the highest rate in decades, flooding the United States and poisoning Americans,” Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a statement.

“President Petro has allowed drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.”

Petro, a prolific social media user, quickly shot back that the Treasury’s decision was the culmination of longstanding Republican threats, including from US Senator Bernie Moreno, a critic of his presidency.

“Bernie Moreno’s threat has indeed been fulfilled,” Petro wrote on the social media platform X. “My wife, my children, and I have been placed on the OFAC [Office of Foreign Assets Control] list.”

He argued that his country had been “fighting drug trafficking effectively for decades” and suggested he would contest the sanctions in the US court system.

“Not one step back and never on my knees,” Petro wrote, pledging not to back down from the fight.

Friday’s designation puts Petro in a relatively small group of top international leaders to be sanctioned by the US.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has faced individual sanctions for human rights abuses in his country, and Russian President Vladimir Putin was also hit with sanctions following his country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The sanctions against Petro, however, come as the left-wing leader and former rebel reaches the twilight of his presidency. Term-limited, he is slated to step down in 2026.

Petro is considered the first left-wing president in modern Colombian history.

It also marks the latest action the Trump administration has taken against one of its most prominent critics in Latin America.

A history of confrontation

The feud between Petro and Trump began shortly after the US president returned to the White House for a second term on January 20.

Trump moved swiftly to fulfil a campaign promise: the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants from the US.

Images of shackled immigrants being herded onto US military aeroplanes soon filled the international media. Petro was among those who expressed outrage on social media.

In the wee hours of January 26, he threatened not to accept two deportation flights that were in midair from the US. “The US cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals,” he wrote on social media.

Trump responded by threatening the country with 30 percent tariffs, and Petro backed down.

But the two have continued to butt heads over issues ranging from immigration to human rights to how Colombia should tamp down on its illicit cocaine production.

The South American country remains the world’s largest source of coca, a leaf that can be processed into cocaine. Last year, the United Nations reported that Colombia had marked its 10th consecutive year of increasing cocaine production, with a 53 percent increase over 2022, when Petro took office.

Trump, however, has increasingly leaned into the fight against drug trafficking as he flexes his might abroad, particularly in Latin America.

He has, for example, wielded the threat of elevated tariffs on US imports to pressure other countries, including neighbours like Canada and Mexico, to combat drug smuggling.

Clashes over military strikes

Since September 2, Trump has followed his threats with military action, carrying out a series of missile strikes on nautical vessels in the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean.

The targets, Trump has said, were drug traffickers. But Petro has argued that the strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.

He has used his social media platform to highlight cases like that of fisherman Alejandro Carranza, who reportedly died in one of the strikes. At least 34 people have been killed in the bombings, some of them Colombian.

“These are not war casualties,” Petro wrote in one social media post on Friday, shortly before the sanctions were announced. “They are murders.”

Petro took that message to the stage at the United Nations in New York in September, blasting the Trump administration for its actions.

“The violent war on drugs was a failure, and I replaced it with an effective anti-trafficking policy,” Petro told the international body.

“Was it really necessary to shoot missiles on unarmed poor young people in the Caribbean? The anti-drug policy is meant to stop cocaine that is coming to the United States. The anti-drug policy is to dominate the peoples of the south as a whole.”

Petro was seen afterwards on the streets of New York City protesting with pro-Palestinian demonstrators in opposition to Israel’s war on Gaza.

Within hours, the Trump administration, which has compared such protests to “terrorism”, yanked Petro’s visa “due to his reckless and incendiary actions”.

That same month, the administration also decertified Colombia as a partner in the US’s continuing “war on drugs”.

Ending Colombia’s aid

Relations between Trump and Petro have only grown more tense since.

Just this week, Trump announced on his platform Truth Social that he would be ending all aid to Colombia, the largest recipient of US funds in South America.

He also warned the US could take a more active role in the region if Petro does not do more to stem the cocaine trade.

“Petro, a low rated and very unpopular leader, with a fresh mouth toward America, better close up these killing fields immediately, or the United States will close them up for him, and it won’t be done nicely,” Trump wrote.

It was a threat Trump would repeat days later, on October 22, in a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte.

“He’d better watch it, or we’ll take very serious action against him and his country,” Trump said of Petro. “What he has led his country into is a death trap.”

Petro, in response, threatened to sue Trump for slander. The US leader has called Petro a “drug dealer”, “thug”, and “bad guy”, among other things.

The spat between the two presidents has left their countries’ diplomatic relations frayed, with Colombia recently recalling its ambassador from Washington, DC.

But traditionally, Colombia had been one of the US’s top allies in the region and a key partner in its efforts to stem the drug trade.

Friday’s sanctions freeze all property Petro, his family and Interior Minister Benedetti may have in the US and bar US-based entities from doing business with them.

Benedetti, for his part, framed the sanctions as a form of retribution for standing up for Petro.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-10-23T175415Z_1797378855_RC2THHA5XRRL_RTRMADP_3_COLOMBIA-POLITICS-1761334187.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-24 18:01:54.805599

The Trump administration notified a federal judge in Maryland on Friday that it intended to deport Abrego Garcia to the West African country, which it said had agreed to accept him.

The Trump administration notified a federal judge in Maryland on Friday that it intended to deport Abrego Garcia to the West African country, which it said had agreed to accept him.

“Federal Defendants have received diplomatic assurances regarding the treatment of third country individuals removed to Liberia from the United States and are making the final necessary arrangements for Petitioner’s removal,” Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate wrote in the court filing. “Defendants expect to provide the requisite formal notice of the new designation of Liberia to Petitioner later today.”

Abrego Garcia has no ties to Liberia, according to one of his attorneys.

He was mistakenly deported to his native El Salvador in March, capturing national attention. The Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June to face human-smuggling charges — to which he pleaded not guilty — and has sought to deport him to multiple countries without success.

He reunited with his family for a weekend in Maryland before ICE took him into custody on Aug. 25, and he has been detained ever since while fighting his deportation.

During an Oct. 10 hearing in federal court challenging the lawfulness of his ICE detention, Abrego Garcia’s legal team said he was ready to leave the country for Costa Rica. He previously rejected a plea deal to go to the country under the condition that he plead guilty to the human-smuggling charges.

Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, said the government’s choice to send his client to Liberia instead of Costa Rica was designed to inflict maximum hardship. The attorney also expressed concern about the possibility of Liberian officials deporting Abrego Garcia to El Salvador.

“Having struck out with Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia — a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” Sandoval-Moshenberg said.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who is presiding over the suit challenging his detention, repeatedly clashed with attorneys representing the federal government — first, over their initial refusal to bring Abrego Garcia back from El Salvador and, most recently, over their failure to produce information about ICE’s plan to deport him.

The announcement of the second deportation comes two weeks after a hearing during which an ICE removals operations official testified that the three African countries to which the Trump administration had threatened to send Abrego Garcia — Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana — had declined to receive him.

Liberia’s foreign minister, Sara Beysolow Nyanti, met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Oct. 16, according to a press release from the country’s ministry of foreign affairs. At the meeting, the countries agreed to strengthen Liberia’s ability to manage migration issues.

United States and has been relied on by courts across the country.
Again in 1946, the Court in Knauer v. United States affirmed its commitment to ensuring that naturalized citizens are able to fully exercise their First Amendment rights.
Two years later, in Chaunt v. United States, the Supreme Court imposed a fourth requirement: materiality.
If a naturalized citizen drove 60 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone, Roberts pointed out, but later answered “no” to that question, his citizenship could be revoked.
Such a result could lead to nearly any naturalized citizen being stripped of the right to citizenship for a failure to disclose even the most minor offense.","Denaturalization Laws and Supreme Court Rulings

The Constitution grants Congress the power to establish a “uniform rule of naturalization” — to set the terms and conditions under which a foreign-born national may become a citizen. The authority to revoke citizenship, however, is limited. In 1967’s Afroyim v. Rusk, the Supreme Court affirmed the principle announced 70 years earlier in United States v. Wong Kim Ark that the Constitution does not give Congress the authority to forcibly deprive a naturalized American of citizenship: The 14th Amendment protects “every citizen of this Nation against a congressional forcible destruction of his citizenship, whatever his creed, color, or race.”

The only situation in which citizenship can be revoked without the citizen’s consent is if it is unlawfully procured. This rule was cited by the Court in the 1981 case Fedorenko v. United States and has been relied on by courts across the country.

The law provides two paths for the government to revoke unlawfully procured citizenship: civil and criminal proceedings.

The civil statutes authorizing revocation have a long and complex history, but the current law, 8 USC 1451(a), provides that a naturalized person’s citizenship can be taken away if it was “illegally procured” or “procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.”

To show that these conditions are met, the government must establish that the person did not meet the three requirements for citizenship when they applied. The first two are objective: five years of lawful permanent residence in the United States with physical presence for at least half that time and continuous residence since the application was filed.

The third requirement is “good moral character,” which is not defined in immigration law. The statute does, however, provide a list of behaviors or activities that preclude a finding of good moral character — including certain criminal offenses, participation in persecution or Nazi genocide, and false testimony for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit. The law also says that even if someone is not within the listed categories, an adjudicator is not precluded from finding a lack of good moral character “for other reasons.”

This gives adjudicators considerable leeway when considering whether people qualify for citizenship in the first instance. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services recently announced policies that further expand that discretion. The government can also seek to revoke citizenship by claiming the citizen misrepresented or withheld information about some activity that showed a lack of good moral character.

While the civil revocation provision in section 1451(a) looks at a person’s actions prior to naturalization, another provision of the civil code, section 1451(c), allows the government to pursue denaturalization for actions taken up to five years after naturalization on the theory that behavior within that period shows a lack of allegiance to the United States at the time of naturalization. Under section 1451(c), joining or being affiliated with certain organizations or advocating certain views in the period following naturalization is prima facie evidence that citizenship was obtained by “concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.” The types of affiliations that can trigger this rule are broad, extending to organizations that advocate destruction of property.

This may appear to leave room for the government to target naturalized citizens based on First Amendment–protected activity, such as joining a protest arranged by an organization that could be regarded as advocating for the destruction of property. The Trump administration has arrested, detained, and deported pro-Palestinian protesters who have attended demonstrations where property was damaged. Denaturalizations could become an extension of that effort.

Alternatively, the government may commence a criminal prosecution under 18 USC 1425, which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that an individual “knowingly procur[ed] or attempt[ed] to procure, contrary to law, the naturalization or evidence of naturalization or of citizenship.” Such cases must be brought within 10 years of the offense. Conviction requires the government to establish that the citizen lied about facts that either would have led the immigration official to deny naturalization or would have led to discovery of other facts warranting a denial.

However, the courts have imposed significant constraints on these citizenship-stripping laws, particularly in cases where the government seems to be targeting citizens’ association or speech.

Limits on Stripping U.S. Citizenship

In 1824, the Supreme Court held that a naturalized citizen is “a member of the society, possessing all the rights of a native citizen, and standing, in the view of the Constitution, on the footing of a native.” Since the 1940s, it has issued a series of decisions recognizing the importance of citizenship rights. Among other things, the Court has rejected congressional attempts to treat naturalized Americans differently than the native born and rebuffed attempts to denaturalize Americans based on their country of origin, beliefs, or statements, no matter how unpopular or even odious. Unless a citizen consents to give up their citizenship, the government must prove that they illegally acquired that citizenship in the first place and meet an elevated burden of proof.

Fundamental Protections

The Supreme Court jurisprudence constraining the government’s attempts to strip citizenship from Americans developed around the time of World War II and in its aftermath. The legal disputes often involved the most unsympathetic people — alleged Nazis and communists — and arose at a time when the United States was at war with Germany and in the throes of the Second Red Scare and McCarthyism. Rather than cave to the political climate, the Court articulated several key principles and rules limiting the government’s authority to denaturalize citizens that remain in effect today.

In the 1943 case Schneiderman v. United States, the Court emphasized that citizenship is a “precious right” and it would “be difficult to exaggerate its value and importance.” Taking it away is “more serious than a taking of one’s property, or the imposition of a fine or other penalty.” This recognition permeates its subsequent decisions and forms the basis for the stringent standards it set.

The Schneiderman Court also showed its skepticism of denaturalization attempts that have a nexus to First Amendment–protected speech and activities. The justices rejected the Roosevelt administration’s attempt to revoke the citizenship of a Nazi sympathizer, holding that his country of origin, beliefs, or statements — even if hated by a majority of the country — were irrelevant to the determination of whether to take away his citizenship. Rather, rights to “liberty in thought and action [belong] to all those upon whom the right of American citizenship has been conferred by statute, as well as to the native born.” Concurring, Justice Wiley Rutledge said that a citizen living under a threat of denaturalization could never be truly free. “If he belonged to ‘off-color’ organizations, or held too radical or, perhaps, too reactionary views . . . he could not open his mouth without his words being held against him. . . Such a citizen would not be admitted to liberty. His best course would be silence or hypocrisy. This is not citizenship,” he wrote.

Again in 1946, the Court in Knauer v. United States affirmed its commitment to ensuring that naturalized citizens are able to fully exercise their First Amendment rights. Although the Court concluded that Knauer had fraudulently procured his citizenship, it warned that naturalized citizens must have “the right to speak freely, to criticize officials and administrators, and to promote changes in our laws;” to do otherwise would “make denaturalizations the ready instrument for political persecutions.”

The Court has also consistently turned back congressional attempts to impose conditions on naturalized citizens. In Schneider v. Rusk, the justices struck down a law that allowed the government to revoke the citizenship of naturalized Americans who lived in their native country. No such rule applied to native-born Americans. This discrepancy, the Court held, relied on “the impermissible assumption that naturalized citizens as a class are less reliable, and bear less allegiance to this country than do the native born.” The Afroyim Court invalidated a law that would have stripped a naturalized citizen of his citizenship for moving to Israel and voting in its elections. Congress does not have “any general power, express or implied, to take away an American citizen’s citizenship without his assent,” it ruled.

Heightened Scrutiny

In addition to establishing fundamental rules recognizing citizenship as a right of the highest order, insisting on equal rights for naturalized and native-born citizens, and protecting naturalized citizens’ First Amendment rights, the Court established stringent rules for reviewing citizenship stripping cases.

Clear, unequivocal, and convincing proof

The Court has repeatedly held that, given the vital interest at stake, citizenship cannot be taken away in a civil proceeding unless the government provides clear, unequivocal, and convincing evidence that revocation is warranted. This standard is “substantially identical with that required in criminal cases — proof beyond a reasonable doubt.”

In-depth scrutiny of record

In applying the clear, unequivocal, and convincing standard, the Court reviews the record with heightened scrutiny. In the 1944 case Baumgartner v. United States, for example, the Court did not defer to the lower court’s finding that a German-born citizen had not truly and fully renounced his allegiance to Germany and did not intend to support the Constitution and laws of the United States. Instead, it conducted a detailed review of the timing and content of Baumgartner’s statements and diary entries about the virtues of Hitler and the German government and concluded that the evidence was insufficient to “penalize a naturalized citizen for the expression of silly or even sinister-sounding views which native-born citizens utter with impunity.”

Similarly in Schneiderman, the Court conducted a thorough canvass of Schneiderman’s Communist writings to conclude that his membership in the Communist Party did not mean that he supported overthrowing the American government by force and thus was not attached to the Constitution.

Proof of willfulness and materiality

As the United States entered the Cold War and Sen. Joe McCarthy (R-WI) led the House Un-American Activities Committee to root out suspected Communists, the Supreme Court again stepped in to limit citizenship-stripping efforts. In Nowak v. United States in 1958, the Court required the government to show that a citizen’s alleged opposition to the principles of the Constitution was willful; mere support for the Communist Party, which held those views was not enough.

Two years later, in Chaunt v. United States, the Supreme Court imposed a fourth requirement: materiality. The government had filed a civil case arguing that Chaunt’s citizenship should be revoked because he falsely denied membership in the Communist Party, lacked the requisite attachment to the Constitution, and had concealed and misrepresented his record of arrests. The Court held that the government had to show that any information Chaunt concealed would have warranted denial of citizenship or might have been useful in an investigation leading to the discovery of other facts justifying denial of citizenship. The “tenuous” connection between Chant’s prior arrests and his connection to the Communist party did not meet that standard.

By the time the Court issued Afroyim in 1967 holding that unlawful procurement was the only circumstance in which a naturalized American could be deprived of citizenship then, the Court had established strict legal requirements for citizenship stripping.

In 1988, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority in Kungys v. United States and summarized the four-part test for civil denaturalization when citizenship was unlawfully procured: the naturalized citizen must have misrepresented or concealed some fact, the misrepresented or concealed fact must have been willful, the fact must have been material, and the naturalized citizen must have procured citizenship as a result of the misrepresentation or concealment.

The only issues in dispute in the case were materiality and procurement. The majority opinion defined the materiality test as whether the misrepresentation or concealment had a natural tendency to produce the conclusion — by evidence that is clear, unequivocal, and convincing — that the applicant was qualified for citizenship. As for the requirement of procurement as a result of misrepresentation or concealment, the majority held that a material misrepresentation created a presumption that the naturalized citizen had been unqualified, but that she could rebut that presumption with a showing by a preponderance of the evidence that she actually had met the statutory requirement for naturalization.

Criminal Denaturalization

The Court has held firm to these principles in criminal denaturalization cases as well. In 2017, in Maslenjak v. United States, the Court considered criminal denaturalization pursuant to 18 USC 1425 which — similarly to the civil denaturalization provision — provides that an American’s citizenship can be revoked if the individual knowingly procured, contrary to law, the naturalization of any person.

A unanimous Court rejected the government’s argument that any false statement in the naturalization process was sufficient to establish that the citizen “knowingly procured” their citizenship unlawfully. Rather, the unlawful act — in this case, making a false statement — must have a causal connection to the acquisition of citizenship, meaning be material.

During oral argument, Chief Justice John Roberts showed the absurdity of ruling otherwise. The naturalization application asks whether the applicant ever committed a crime or offense for which he was not arrested. If a naturalized citizen drove 60 miles per hour in a 55 mph zone, Roberts pointed out, but later answered “no” to that question, his citizenship could be revoked. Such a result could lead to nearly any naturalized citizen being stripped of the right to citizenship for a failure to disclose even the most minor offense.

In sum, even during periods of heightened suspicion of foreign nationals, the Court has imposed strict limits on government efforts to strip citizenship, including a high burden of proof, de novo examination of the record, and materiality and willfulness requirements.",https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/1050x525/public/2025-10/denaturalizationarticle.jpg?itok=c8Fu1iCN,N,,2025-10-24 17:18:04.804228

The students were arrested Thursday after they were “beat up” and “assaulted” by officers at the scene, according to protesters and Chicago officials. One student was released at the scene, and another student was released hours later, they said.

“This is not even about immigration,” alderman Sigcho-Lopez said during a press conference outside Benito Juarez High School Thursday. “This is about crushing dissent.”

The streets of the Little Village neighborhood filled up with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents for a second day in a row Thursday, with protesters seeking to block officers from targeting residents and businesses without a warrant.

“These kids were en route to school. They saw the horrific scenes when you see masked individuals coming for your neighbors,” Sigcho-Lopez said. “They were unfortunately detained. One had blood on his face.”

Liz Winfield, a teacher at Benito Juarez and a member of the Chicago Teachers Union, said she noticed one of her students was missing while taking attendance.

“I marked a junior student absent, not because that student was sick or his bus was late. It was because ICE snatched him up on his way to school,” she said.

“I am so angry and frustrated that these students have to add this worry to their school day,” she added. “They should be worrying about college acceptance or if they’re going to get a date for the school dance. It is outrageous and unacceptable.”

Federal agents detained at least seven people in Little Village, and suburban Cicero, on Wednesday. Two staff members of alderman Michael Rodriguez were arrested and released the next morning, according to his office.

Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino, who is leading the push in Chicago, was captured on video Thursday appearing to toss tear gas canisters at the crowds in Little Village, which lawyers argue violates a court order against indiscriminate use of riot weapons during protests.

Lawyers for a group of protesters, reporters and faith leaders who attended demonstrations warned a federal judge that Bovino “was simply ignoring your order.”

They called on Judge Sara Ellis “to conduct an inquiry into this incident and order relief that the court deems proper,” given the “flagrancy of the apparent violation.”

In a statement to The Independent, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused “rioters” in a crowd of 75 to 100 people of shooting fireworks at agents during an enforcement operation Thursday.

A Border Patrol van carrying detainees was “attacked” by a mob that “grew more hostile and violent, advancing toward agents and began throwing rocks and other objects at agents, including one that struck Chief Greg Bovino in the head,” according to McLaughlin.

She said agents repeated “multiple warnings” to leave before firing tear gas at demonstrators.

“The use of chemical munitions was conducted in full accordance with CBP policy and was necessary to ensure the safety of both law enforcement and the public,” McLaughlin said.

Sigcho-Lopez called the officers’ actions “illegal.”

“They detained them over what? There’s no charges,” he said. “We want to understand why they were detained to begin with.”

Thursday’s volatile scenes and arrests took place as members of Chicago’s school board called on the city’s public school system to hold virtual classes to avoid the same scenario. Chicago Public Schools said it cannot order those changes without a state of emergency declaration from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker.

Federal agents — which have historically been prohibited from enforcement actions in sensitive areas like schools — are intensifying raids and arrests in the Chicago area, which has emerged as a flashpoint for protest against the president’s mass deportation agenda.

A lawsuit accuses federal agents there of “indiscriminately” tossing flash grenades and tear gas and firing guns loaded with chemical irritants and rubber bullets against demonstrators.

Protesters and reporters have faced “serious injuries” and “some are being randomly singled out for arrest” and detained inside an ICE facility, where they “are detained incommunicado for hours,” according to the complaint.

Trump has deployed hundreds of National Guard members to the state, which a federal judge has temporarily blocked, as a multi-state legal challenge against the administration’s federalized troops plays out.

“I’m mad as hell,” Illinois state Sen. Celina Villanueva said Thursday. “What I saw today is a continuation of fascism that Donald Trump and his cronies are trying to instill throughout our entire country.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/24/14/15/Federal-Enforcement-Chicago-9cdy7b4m.jpeg?trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-24 17:17:46.905295

The Texas Supreme Court recently finalized amendments to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 201, implementing the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (“UIDDA”).[1] The amendments took effect August 31, 2025, marking a shift in how parties conduct interstate discovery involving Texas witnesses.

By adopting the UIDDA, Texas has joined the overwhelming majority of states in streamlining interstate discovery. Massachusetts, Missouri, and New Hampshire remain the only states that have yet to adopt some version of the UIDDA, leaving them as outliers in an otherwise uniform national system.

What Changed

For decades, attorneys seeking evidence in Texas for an out-of-state proceeding were first required to obtain a “mandate, writ, or commission” from the court where the lawsuit was pending. This process was cumbersome because it involved unnecessary delays and expenses.

Now, under Rule 201.3, a party simply submits an out-of-state subpoena to a court clerk in the Texas county where discovery is sought. The clerk must then promptly issue an equivalent Texas subpoena incorporating the same terms—with no judicial stamp of approval required.

The new rule applies to subpoenas requiring witnesses to:

Attend and give testimony at depositions (oral examination or written questions); or

Produce documents or tangible things.

Importantly, this request does not constitute an appearance in Texas courts, which means out-of-state attorneys can obtain subpoenas without needing to be licensed in Texas, seek pro hac vice admission, or hire local counsel to issue and serve the subpoena.

Once issued, the Texas subpoena must be served according to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 176 and 205. From there, Texas law controls. Any discovery disputes, whether concerning protective orders or enforcement, get resolved in Texas courts.

One Key Limitation: Property Inspections

Texas’s version of the UIDDA, however, includes a notable exception that prevents clerks from issuing subpoenas for premises inspections. Litigants will still need a court order for subpoenas seeking inspection of property. Rule 201.3 covers testimony and documents, while carving out and preserving Texas’s traditional requirement for judicial oversight of property inspections.

Why This Matters

The new rule simplifies interstate discovery by eliminating jurisdictional hurdles, reducing costs, and accelerating the discovery process. By directing clerks to act “promptly” and without the need for judicial intervention, the UIDDA framework removes delays that previously plagued litigation across state lines. This change benefits both out-of-state parties seeking discovery in Texas and Texas litigants conducting discovery in other UIDDA states that require reciprocity.

Companies with employees, documents, or operations in Texas can expect to see an increase in out-of-state discovery requests, as the process is now more efficient for parties in litigation elsewhere to obtain testimony and documents from Texas witnesses. Businesses should review their document retention policies and ensure employees understand their potential obligations when served with out-of-state subpoenas.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.7163_543.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 22:17:40.431476

The Salvadoran national's case has become a magnet for opposition to President Donald Trump’s immigration policies since he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador, in violation of a settlement agreement. He was returned to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court said the administration had to work to bring him back. Since he cannot be re-deported to El Salvador, ICE has been seeking to deport him to a series of African countries.

Meanwhile, a federal judge in Maryland has previously barred his immediate deportation. Abrego Garcia's lawsuit there claims the Trump administration is illegally using the deportation process to punish him for the embarrassment of his earlier mistaken deportation.

A Friday court filing from the Department of Homeland Security notes that “Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent.” Its national language is English; its constitution “provides robust protections for human rights;” and Liberia is “committed to the humane treatment of refugees,” the filing reads. It concludes that Abrego Garcia could be deported as soon as Oct. 31.

“After failed attempts with Uganda, Eswatini, and Ghana, ICE now seeks to deport our client, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, to Liberia, a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” a statement from attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg reads. “Costa Rica stands ready to accept him as a refugee, a viable and lawful option. Yet the government has chosen a course calculated to inflict maximum hardship. These actions are punitive, cruel, and unconstitutional.”

Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally as a teenager.

The letter cites several federal statutes that criminalize assaulting, impeding or conspiring against federal officers, and notes the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution dictates state officials cannot prosecute federal agents for actions taken in the course of their duties.

Blanche directed California leaders to ""preserve all written and electronic communications and records related to any attempts or efforts to impede or obstruct federal law enforcement officials,"" forewarning that the Department of Justice will investigate and prosecute any official who violates federal statutes.

President Trump announced a day earlier that he had called off the deployment in San Francisco after being persuaded by local tech leaders. But elected officials elsewhere in the Bay Area, who lacked similar assurances, had wondered whether federal agents would still conduct raids in their cities this weekend.

On Friday, the two federal officials said that the operation had been canceled throughout the Bay Area and that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents were not expected to conduct the enforcement action that had been planned. Department of Homeland Security officials also called off plans to bring staff members from Los Angeles to the Bay Area to help with the operation, one of the federal officials said.

Mayor Barbara Lee of Oakland confirmed later on Friday that federal agents had canceled their operation in Oakland and the rest of the Bay Area. She said that she was told that by Yesenia Sanchez, the Alameda County sheriff, who was in communication with federal officials.

Other Bay Area leaders expressed cautious relief.

“While I am glad that President Trump called off the surge in federal immigration enforcement in our region, we must remain vigilant,” Jesse Arreguín, a Democratic state senator who represents East Bay communities, said in a statement. “Our immigrant neighbors, which are the backbone of our economy, are living in fear.”

Earlier this week, C.B.P. agents began heading to the Bay Area for an enforcement push that was expected to start this weekend.

The agents began staging at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda, a military installation near Oakland, drawing more than 200 hundred protesters who opposed the immigration raids. At least two Border Patrol vehicles were seen entering the base on Thursday morning.

Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he had been convinced by tech executives with Bay Area ties that Mayor Daniel Lurie of San Francisco had made progress this year on reducing crime in his city.

But leaders and activists in Oakland, which borders Alameda, said at the time that they hadn’t been given any indication of whether the Trump administration would cancel enforcement plans there. In August, Mr. Trump named Oakland as one of several cities that he was eyeing for federal enforcement and National Guard troops because he said it had high crime rates.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/24/multimedia/24NAT-BAY-AREA-RAID-thlq/24NAT-BAY-AREA-RAID-thlq-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 16:57:04.538546

Although the statute doesn’t explicitly grant authority to impose tariffs, President Trump announced a set of sweeping tariffs in April 2025, triggering a global stock market crash. Trump argued that IEEPA implicitly authorized his actions—a claim no prior president had ever made in the statute’s nearly fifty-year history.

Learning Resources, Inc., an educational toy manufacturer, successfully challenged Trump’s tariffs in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Although the Trump administration appealed to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, Learning Resources asked the Supreme Court to hear the case before the appellate court could rule. Separately, a group of small businesses led by V.O.S. Selections and a coalition of twelve states successfully challenged the tariffs in the United States Court of International Trade. On appeal, the Federal Circuit upheld that decision, holding that IEEPA does not authorize the sweeping tariffs that Trump imposed. The Supreme Court consolidated the two cases and agreed to expedited review.

In October 2025, the Constitutional Accountability Center filed an amicus brief supporting the challengers to the tariffs. Our brief responds to a historical argument made in support of the tariffs. According to this argument, IEEPA incorporates a traditional presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime that traces back to the nineteenth century and was first codified in the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA). As our brief shows, this narrative is unsound.

When the TWEA was enacted, there was no consensus about the existence of an inherent presidential authority to impose tariffs during wartime. During the nineteenth century, every imposition of presidential duties or fees in wartime generated significant constitutional controversy. Rather than demonstrating any consensus, these historical episodes reveal fierce contestation over the President’s inherent wartime authority to impose tariffs. When the Supreme Court addressed challenges to these tariffs, the Court ultimately relied on Congress’s express approval of them—leaving the separation-of-powers dispute unresolved.

We further show that, regardless of the original TWEA’s meaning, Congress later severed the Act from its war powers foundation, and IEEPA further separated peacetime emergency powers from implied wartime powers in 1977. Even assuming that law-of-war principles recognized a wartime tariff authority in 1917, and that those principles were codified in the original TWEA, that doesn’t mean that the TWEA continued to confer this authority even after it was subsequently amended. On the contrary, amendments to the TWEA in 1933 dissolved any link with wartime powers and implied tariff authority.

Moreover, when passing IEEPA in 1977, Congress recognized that decades of amendments to the Act had created a dangerously broad grant of authority. Congress’s solution was to split the statute in two: the TWEA would apply only during declared wars, while the newly enacted IEEPA would cover peacetime national emergencies with more limited grants of power to the President. Far from expanding presidential authority, Congress deliberately constrained it. Because IEEPA applies to peacetime emergencies—not wars—any claimed wartime tariff authority has no place in the statute.

The decisions of the lower courts should be affirmed—President Trump doesn’t have authority under IEEPA to single-handedly set global tariffs.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-10-24 15:16:57.601331

Federal agents have conducted raids in several Chicago neighborhoods, including Little Village, South Shore, and Brighton Park.

Large-scale immigration raids have continued in Chicago, even as the legality of deploying the National Guard awaits a decision from the Supreme Court.

On Oct. 22, federal immigration officers descended on Little Village, a South Side neighborhood at the heart of Chicago’s Mexican community. Alderperson Mike Rodriguez told USA TODAY at least eight people were arrested, four of whom were U.S. citizens.

It was the latest in President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz, his Chicago-area immigration enforcement crackdown. Trump launched the blitz on Sept. 8, saying it was needed to catch ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. Many local critics say instead innocent people are being left terrorized. As of Oct. 8, the Department of Homeland Security said it had arrested more than 1,500 people. But USA TODAY has been unable to confirm that number or track down exactly where all of the incidents are occurring. At an Oct. 20 federal court hearing, a top Homeland Security official said around 75 people had been arrested in connection with protesting immigration enforcement.

A look at some of the high-profile events, like clashes with local elected officials, a raid on a South Side apartment building and ongoing protests at an ICE facility in the suburbs, show the immigration efforts have come to neighborhoods all over the city. Here is what to know:

Little Village, heart of Chicago’s Mexican community, raided

Federal immigration enforcement agents raided the city’s longtime historic Mexican neighborhood on Oct. 22 and Oct. 23, removing several people, causing car accidents and brandishing weapons, according to residents, local leaders and advocates.

Agents in the morning descended on the commercial corridor of Little Village, a South Side neighborhood and heart of Chicago’s Mexican community. Photos and video from the scene show masked U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents sprinting after people and local business owners locking their doors ahead of agents.

""A reign of terror was brought upon our neighborhood,"" Ald. Mike Rodriguez told USA TODAY. ""They took at least eight people, of those eight, four were U.S. citizens, and two were members of my staff.""

Among the agents on the scene was Customs and Border Protection Commander at-Large Chief Gregory Bovino. The longtime Homeland Security official spearheaded the immigration enforcement crackdown in Los Angeles and is seen as directing the agents' aggressive tactics in Chicago.

Federal agents rappel from helicopters in South Shore apartment raid

Federal agents rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters. Dozens of others, their faces hidden behind masks, arrived in moving trucks. In total, 300 officers stormed a South Side apartment building that Department of Homeland Security officials say harbored criminals.

Hundreds of agents swarmed apartments in the multi-story building, detaining several American citizens, including children, for hours and netting 37 total arrests. The outcome of those arrests remains unclear.

The Chicago Sun-Times and NewsNation were among the first to report on the raid in the city’s South Shore neighborhood. The historically Black area gained a sizable Venezuelan population after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott bused tens of thousands of migrants from the border to the Democratic-led city in 2023. Many moved to the neighborhood after first being placed in city-run shelters in the area.

Videos of the raid shared online by the Department of Homeland Security show Border Patrol agents with guns drawn approaching the building in the middle of the night. Agents led shirtless men outside. The raid saw dozens arrested and the building left in shambles, according to photos shared with USA TODAY. Two ""confirmed Tren de Aragua members"" were captured, according to a Department of Homeland Security statement.

Customs and Border Protection Commander at-Large Chief Bovino was also on hand for the raid.

Broadview facility in the suburbs center of many protest clashes

The ICE facility in Broadview lies on an industrial strip surrounded by residential streets. The small village of some 8,000 people outside of Chicago is home to the region’s main immigration enforcement facility, and it has become a hotbed of clashes between federal agents and anti-immigration enforcement protesters.

DHS officials said they had arrested more than 30 people in connection with the protests as of the beginning of October, including three who had loaded guns. Agency officials did not immediately respond to requests for further information on the people arrested.

Charges against many of the protesters have been downgraded or dropped, including against two of the protesters who were found to be carrying guns. Charges against Ray Collins and Jocelyne Robledo were dropped after a grand jury declined to bring an indictment, a rarity in the federal court system.

Homeland Security officials did not provide the name of the third person they said had been arrested with a gun.

Federal agents have used chemical agents, including pepper spray and tear gas, in plain sight to disperse Chicago protesters blocking immigration enforcement vehicles. On Sept. 26, agents also fired chemical agents at protesters and journalists standing in a road leading up to the immigration enforcement facility located at 1930 Beach Street in Broadview.

Agents' use of chemical weapons on protesters, clergy and journalists resulted in a lawsuit where a federal judge on Oct. 9 ordered federal agents to limit their use of the munitions. U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis called agents' use of the munitions ""unprovoked"" and likely ""constituted excessive force"".

Department of Justice lawyer Eric Hamilton said in an Oct. 9 hearing that agents had used $100,000 worth of chemical weapons outside the suburban facility.

Man killed by federal immigration officers in Northwest Suburbs

Federal immigration agents fatally shot Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez in the city’s Northwest suburbs who they say was resisting arrest and dragged an agent with his car, officials said on Sep. 12. Reuters reported the incident happened in Franklin Park.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials said he ignored commands from federal agents and drove his car into an officer attempting to arrest him. The agent suffered multiple injuries and is in stable condition, according to an agency statement. In body-worn camera footage from the scene, the agent describes his injuries as ""nothing major.""

DHS said in a statement that the situation arose from an ""enforcement operation targeting a criminal illegal alien"" and that agents had ""conducted a vehicle stop to arrest"" the man.

Former federal judge and prosecutor Ruben Castillo said that the shooting would be among the first incidents a new commission from the office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker would investigate. ""There are serious questions about that shooting and that killing,"" said Castillo, who is leading the commission.

Border Patrol agent shoots woman on South Side

A Border Patrol agent in Chicago shot a woman after she and at least one other person allegedly rammed cars into vehicles carrying federal authorities, as protests over immigration enforcement intensify and the Trump administration vows to deploy federal troops to the Democratic stronghold.

Chicago residents Marimar Martinez and Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz were arrested on charges of assaulting, impeding and interfering with the work of federal agents with a deadly weapon, according to a criminal complaint filed in the Northern District of Illinois.

Martinez’s attorneys say federal agents attacked their client: “We don't think this is a complicated case,” said attorney Christopher Parente in an Oct. 15 hearing. “It's a car accident where one of the drivers gets out and shoots the other driver.”

The incident occurred in Brighton Park.

Chicago news producer handcuffed, arrested, not charged

Federal Border Patrol agents on Friday, Oct. 10, detained a Chicago news producer during an immigration enforcement operation in the neighborhood known as Lincoln Square.

Video of the incident shows masked agents holding Debbie Brockman, of WGN-TV, face down in the middle of the street as they handcuff her. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Border Patrol, has accused her of throwing an object at a Border Patrol car. WGN reported that she hasn’t been charged with a crime.

A man recording the incident asked for her name. Brockman, whose LinkedIn lists her as a producer, identified herself and said she works for WGN, a Chicago-based news station. “Let them know,” she said.

Agents then placed her in the back of an unmarked gray Chrysler minivan with tinted windows as onlookers yelled at them.

Illinois state representative stopped by Border Patrol agents

Illinois Representative Hoan Huynh was pulled over by federal immigration officials on Oct. 21 in the northwest neighborhood of Albany Park, video shows. The narrator says he was following immigration officials and being followed by agents.

""I never thought I would have a gun pulled on me by ICE agents, but that’s exactly what happened to me yesterday,"" the state representative said in a post on Facebook.

Huynh said that he had been canvassing his district to inform people of their rights should they encounter immigration agents.

""I am a refugee who came to the United States with my family after fleeing an authoritarian regime in Vietnam,"" Huynh said. ""I know what it means to live in fear of the government, and I will not stand by while families here in Chicago face that same fear from ICE.""

Woman pulled out of car in West Loop school pickup line in viral video

A viral video posted Oct. 8 shows several federal immigration officers pulling a woman out of small blue SUV. Fox 32 reported it happened in the West Loop at a school pickup line in sight of other parents and children, though she was not there to pick up their children. The outlet also reported another woman was arrested, though she can’t be seen in the video. The woman being arrested said she had been followed there.

Raids in East Side and Albany Park neighborhoods have become focal point in lawsuit over agents’ use of chemical weapons

On Oct. 14, federal agents pursued a suspect in their vehicles through a neighborhood on the far Southeast Side of Chicago that resulted in a car accident. Neighborhood residents gathered to protest immigration enforcement and agents deployed chemical to disperse the crowd, Homeland Security officials said in a hearing on Oct. 20.

Ellis, the federal judge presiding over the case regarding immigration agents' use of chemical weapons, called top Homeland Security officials Kyle Harvick, deputy incident commander for Customs and Border Protection, and Shawn Byers, a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deputy field director, into court to testify regarding agents' use of chemical weapons in the incident.

Harvick defended his agents' conduct in the East Side neighborhood: ""We needed to contain that scene,"" he testified, ""and then more and more people started to come and then some of those people started to throw objects.""

A Chicago Sun-Times photo taken at the scene showing an agent pointing a weapon into the face of an unarmed teen has become the face of the kind of intimidation many Chicagoans say they are experiencing at the hands of federal agents.

Ellis has said repeatedly that she has serious concerns about whether federal officials are following her orders that they have to warn protesters ahead of using chemical weapons on them.

The judge also questioned their use of chemical weapons in a similar incident in the Albany Park neighborhood.

At an Oct. 17 news conference, Tom Carol, the pastor of a church in front of the scene of the incident in the North Side neighborhood, called the use of chemical weapons on the residential street ""outrageous.""

""ICE agents decided to come to this neighborhood and cause trouble for our community, they tried to snatch one of our neighbors on this very block right as church was letting out,"" the longtime Christ Lutheran Church pastor said. ""It was outrageous in our community to see tear gas used to disperse a non-violent crowd, we’ll continue to stand up for our neighbors.""

The Friday court filing said the West African nation has agreed to take him and argued that the country fit Abrego Garcia’s criteria.

“Although Petitioner has identified more than twenty countries that he purports to fear would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, Liberia is not on that list,” the Department of Justice (DOJ) wrote.

The Trump administration has explored a series of countries as possible deportation destinations after wrongly sending Abrego Garcia to his native El Salvador. An immigration judge in 2019 blocked him from being sent there due to gang threats against his family.

After several months being held in Salvadoran prisons, the Trump administration secured Abrego Garcia’s return, only to hit him with human smuggling charges in connection with a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee in which he was spotted with numerous men without luggage in the van.

Abrego Garcia has denied wrongdoing and has also sought to dismiss the case, arguing he is being selectively and vindictively prosecuted by the Trump administration given the interest in his story.

A Tennessee-based federal judge backed an initial request for discovery, passing a key hurdle to allow the claim to move forward.

As the case proceeds, the Justice Department has argued immigration authorities still have the right to carry out his deportation, a matter that has also been tied up in federal court in Maryland.

In various filings, the Justice Department has proposed deporting him to Uganda, Ghana and Eswatini, while Abrego Garcia has floated Costa Rica as an option.

Attorneys for Abrego Garcia have previously accused the DOJ of having “spun the globe” to pick locations to “troll” their client.

“Having struck out with Uganda, Eswatini and Ghana, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] now seeks to deport our client Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia – a country with which he has no connection, thousands of miles from his family and home in Maryland,” attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said in a statement.

“Costa Rica has agreed to accept him as a refugee, and remains a viable and lawful option. Instead, the government has chosen yet another path that feels designed to inflict maximum hardship. Their actions are punitive, cruel and unconstitutional.”

In the Friday filing, the DOJ argued Liberia should be an amenable choice for Abrego Garcia.

“Liberia is a thriving democracy and one of the United States’s closest partners on the African continent,” they wrote.

“Its national language is English, the same as the country in which Petitioner has resided for the last several years; and it modeled its constitution, which has been in place since 1986 and which provides robust protections for human rights, in large part on the U.S. Constitution. Liberia also is committed to the humane treatment of refugees.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/abregogarcia_092825ap.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-24 16:57:08.773939

“I think he’s just trying to mess with us, with our Bay Area,” said Jose Ramirez, 59.
“The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” she said.
By Thursday evening as the sun set over the San Francisco Bay, hundreds of protesters walked from Fruitvale, along Oakland’s industrial corridors towards the entrance of the Coast Guard base.
“But I’m so proud to be in the Bay Area where people do get activated.” Sam Levin contributed reporting","It was a whirlwind, disorienting 24 hours in the San Francisco Bay Area for local leaders and organizers, who were expecting a major immigration enforcement operation in the region on Thursday.

But by mid-morning, Donald Trump announced he was calling off a federal “surge” – and telling residents to “stay tuned” for what would come next.

In the uneasy lull, many residents carried on, preparing for the worst.

Volunteers organized patrols in areas where day immigrant workers tended to congregate, and launched initiatives to help the children of undocumented workers get to and from school. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in San Francisco and across the bay in Oakland.

“I think he’s just trying to mess with us, with our Bay Area,” said Jose Ramirez, 59. He was one of a few hundred people gathered in Fruitvale – a predominantly Latino community in east Oakland, across the bay from San Francisco. “But we’re still out here to support.”

Oakland’s mayor, Barbara Lee, said at a press conference that she was aware of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents being stationed at the local US Coast Guard base. “The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” she said. “But let me be clear, [in] our city, as I said, we are fully prepared.”

By Thursday night, it remained unclear whether agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and CBP were still planning to ramp up enforcement in cities such as Oakland that border San Francisco.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to the Guardian’s queries, and instead linked to Trump’s Truth Social post explaining that he had called off federal agents following a call with tech leaders including the Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff. “Friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” Trump wrote.

Local officials and advocates condemned Silicon Valley billionaires, including Benioff, who had previously suggested that Trump should send the national guard troops to the city.

“I condemn every tech billionaire who supported this,” said Jackie Fielder, the San Francisco city supervisor representing parts of the city’s Mission neighborhood, home to a large Chicano and the Latino community. Standing at the steps of city hall – and directly facing the massive Salesforce tower looming over the city’s skyline – Fielder said: “We are here because Benioff of Salesforce put forth this idea.”

Meanwhile, in Fielder’s district, volunteers from various community groups were geared up to respond to ramped up raids.

For weeks already, the local non-profit Homies Organizing the Mission to Empower Youth (Homey) had been deploying street patrols, to observe and report ICE activity in the area. Patrollers have yet to intervene in any arrests, said José Luis Pavón, an organizer with the group. “But the patrols are also to build community, to make sure that people know their rights, to also reassure a lot of the people who are scared, to involve small business owners, to involve neighbors, to really strengthen the community,” he said.

Following months of threats from the Trump administration to ramp up law enforcement and immigration raids in the city, the neighborhood is now prepared to respond, Pavón said. “I feel like people are starting to lose their fear. People are getting a lot more practical.”

Bay Resistance, a social justice non-profit, said it would continue to send volunteers to Home Depot stores and other areas where day laborers tend to congregate and work, to monitor for immigration agents and help inform workers about their legal rights. The Latino Task Force said it would drive students of undocumented parents to schools across the city.

“We’re ready,” said Lisa Knox, co-executive director of California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, a non-profit that supports people in immigration detention. “We always say ‘power, not panic.’ We’re focused on getting the message out to the community that they are not alone, people have rights if they encounter ICE or federal agents, and there are rapid response networks that can provide support if they are arrested. Yes, this is frightening, but communities can organize to defend themselves.”

Groups were coordinating across the region to ensure they could mobilize wherever ICE shows up, and advocates had learned lessons from efforts in Los Angeles and Chicago, Knox said. The president’s announcement that he was calling off the troops did not alter preparations, she added: “We’re not taking Trump at his word. He’s equivocated before. We’re sticking with our plans.”

In Fruitvale, which has one of the highest concentrations of immigrants and non--citizens in Oakland, street vendors said they had seen much less foot traffic than usual. The farmers market, held in the plaza outside the transit station, was quieter than usual.

“We cannot let this happen – where people are afraid to get out of the house, where people are afraid to be seen,” said Rosemary, an 18-year-old community college student who joined the protest. She and her loved ones – almost all of whom are immigrants – created a group chat to check in with one another each hour, she said, to make sure they’re safe.

Jaime, an English language development teacher who works with elementary and middle school students in the neighborhood, said she joined up to show solidarity with her students and their families – most of whom are immigrants. Earlier that day, teachers hosted a brown bag lunch for students who were worried about a major federal deployment in the region. A group of about 20 students strategized how to create fundraisers for the families most affected by immigration raids, and reviewed information about immigrants’ legal rights to share with friends and families.

“Unfortunately … a lot of what is happening won’t feel new to our students,” said Nick, a fellow teacher. “It’s not the first time that their families have felt threatened by the presence of ICE or other immigration officials. It’s not the first time they’ve heard of members of our school community being threatened with deportation or being deported.” The Guardian is not using the teachers’ last names at their request, to protect their students.

By Thursday evening as the sun set over the San Francisco Bay, hundreds of protesters walked from Fruitvale, along Oakland’s industrial corridors towards the entrance of the Coast Guard base.

Gabriela DelaRiva, a retired nurse who lived in Alameda – the city where the base is located – began to tear up. Her grandmother, she said, had come to the US from Zacatecas, Mexico, as a child, and worked at canneries in California’s agricultural Central valley. And DelaRiva grew up to be an activist – she had marched for labor rights, and against various US military interventions and wars.

“To see progress, and then to see these things going backwards, it’s very distressing, very painful,” she said. “But I’m so proud to be in the Bay Area where people do get activated.”

What we know:

The enforcement activities are part of Operation Midway Blitz, which launched across the city in early September and remains underway.

Now, officials with the Department of Homeland Security are sharing what unfolded Wednesday, Oct. 22, during the arrests of at least nine people. They say federal agents were targeted in what they are calling ""one of its most violent days"" since beginning the operation.

Near 24th Street and Ogden Avenue, immigration officials say a Latin Kings gang member followed agents in his car and tried to ram them head-on, but instead, struck a bystander's car.

The same day, according to the DHS, officials were at a laundromat when a woman claimed she was putting out a hit on Chief Border Patrol Agent Gregory Bovino.

In other instances, they say people boxed in federal vehicles, fled on foot, and refused to obey commands.

DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin released the following statement:

""While conducting immigration enforcement operations in Cicero and Glendale Heights, agitators stalked law enforcement, rammed vehicles, fled scenes, injured agents, and caused multiple accidents across town—putting law enforcement and the public in danger. Despite the violence, CBP arrested 3 illegal aliens who were breaking our nation’s immigration laws. Six citizens were arrested for impeding and threatening to kill agents.

""Our officers are facing a surge in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, and gang members. Secretary Noem’s message to the rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. CBP and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

We play an important role — a crucial role — in the surrender of our own rights,” Carter quoted.
And we don’t exactly have the most shining health outcomes,” she said, noting this is a “really destabilizing time” to teach public health and health policy.","By SHANNON O. WELLS

Since the January inauguration of President Donald J. Trump, Pitt School of Law Professor William M. Carter Jr. said he’s “watched with horror” as the Trump administration has “purposely disregarded the rule of law,” and acted not only unconstitutionally, but also what he calls “anti-constitutional.”

“They are waging an attack on our underlying constitutional structure. These things are not just a byproduct of otherwise neutral policies. It is the rule of law itself that I believe is under attack,” said Carter, who specializes in constitutional law and civil rights, at a recent Barco Law Building forum. “One particular aspect of that that I’ve watched with equal horror is the assault on constitutional freedom of expression and the assault on issues of constitutional equal protection and equality.”

Carter’s sense of horror, however, is not accompanied by surprise.

“I think anyone who claims surprise at this point is disingenuous in that regard,” he clarified. “The Trump campaign was very clear as to how it intended to go. Having chosen that government, I don’t think we can pretend to be surprised when they do what they said they were going to do.

What Carter has been “surprised, saddened and appalled” by is “how so many of our leading institutions, universities, law firms, nonprofit organizations such as hospital systems and medical centers and others have utterly and quickly capitulated to the administration’s impacts on their rights.”

Carter shared such insights during a panel discussion held Oct. 14 in the Barco Law Building’s Alcoa Room. Around 50 people attended the event, which was called “President Trump’s Executive Policies’ Impact on Freedom of Expression, Health, and Immigration.”

Joining Carter on the panel were Miranda Yaver, assistant professor in Pitt’s Department of Health Policy; Shoba Sivaprasad Whadia, Penn State professor and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Dickinson Law School.

Tamara Dubowitz, chair and professor of epidemiology in Pitt’s School of Public Health, served as forum discussant, and Sheila Vélez Martínez, professor of asylum refugee and immigration law at Pitt’s School of Law, was panel moderator.

The panelists based their discussion on the more than 300 executive orders, memoranda and proclamations issued within the first nine months of Trump’s second term. Bypassing the legislative process to such an extent, they argued, creates a strong potential to degrade freedom of speech, immigrant rights and access to health care, among other constitutionally and legally protected rights and privileges.

Martinez started the event with a video clip of right-wing media host Tucker Carlson interviewing Russ Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Vought talked about the president’s need to move “executively as fast and as aggressively as possible with a radical constitutional perspective, to be able to dismantle that bureaucracy in their power centers.”

Martinez said the video “gives you an idea, and … sets the tone of what we have been seeing and why we’re focusing on executive action. Because, as of Oct. 13, (Trump) has signed 209 executive orders, 54 memoranda and 99 proclamations in the second presidential term.”

The group of experts assembled were there, she explained, to provide illumination as to what executive orders are, their legality and what have the orders meant in the areas of immigration, health, and freedom of expression.

Emphasizing the need to stand one’s ground, William Carter paraphrased from Timothy Snyder’s 2017 book, “On Tyranny”: “A cardinal rule when dealing with an authoritarian regime is ‘Do not surrender in advance.’ Most of the power of authoritarianism is freely given. The government’s reach is long, and its powers are vast, but it cannot, through sheer force, oppress an entire citizenry. We play an important role — a crucial role — in the surrender of our own rights,” Carter quoted.

“My perspective,” he continued, “is that we should not engage in anticipatory surrender. Rather, we should stand on our rights by asserting them in the public debate, as well as through the legal system, challenging the illegality of the administration’s actions in force, as to the First Amendment in particular.”

Despite the quantity of rapidly issued executive orders, constitutional and legal checks and balances remain intact, Carter noted. Lawmaking power still lies with Congress, which has the power to “promulgate bills,” which, if signed by a president become law.

“Thus Trump’s various executive orders, proclamations, dear colleague letters — I don’t know what they’re doing, paper airplanes — they are communicating, are only valid to the following extent: First, they have to be within the scope of powers that are granted to the president by the Constitution or federal law,” he said. “The president has no power beyond that granted to him by the Constitution itself or by federal statute.”

Substance vs. symbolism

An 18-year veteran of Penn State, Shoba Sivaprasad Whadia, runs an immigration rights clinic at the university and, as she said, “writes and thinks often” about choice — or “discretion” — in law.

“In the immigration space, those choices can be macro, the choices we might make as an agency; the instrument, like an executive order; the choice to issue an executive order that can impact a broad swath of people or institutions; as well as choices that are mindful,” she said. “Those are the individual decisions that officers or agents might make, like whether to arrest someone or whether to use roving patrols to ‘stop’ an individual on their way to work, or whether to take somebody into custody.

“All of these choices, even, are discretionary choices that have long been a centerpiece of the immigration system,” she noted.

As an immigration attorney who worked with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and practiced during the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Whadia said while what’s going on now is, in many ways “unprecedented, history also is repeating itself.”

“We can start from the 19th century and bring us to the national origins era, to 9/11, to the first Trump administration, to where we are now,” she said. “History is a good reason for why none of us should be surprised.”

A number of recent executive orders focused on immigration, like the recent White House order to pursue prosecutions against those who burn flags as a form of protest, Whadia acknowledged, “were symbolic.”

“So the real operationalization happened through policy or paper, not regulation, not a congressional act, and not even the executive order itself,” she said.

Several federal agencies already carry out immigration-related laws and directives. “Congress has delegated those responsibilities to agencies like the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of State.”

At the same time, the Immigration and Nationality Act, passed by Congress in 1952, remains intact.

“It is the primary framework for immigration law today,” Whadia explained. “It has been compared second in complication to the U.S. tax code. So if anyone is trying to explain immigration law or policy to you in a soundbite, this is where making sure you have clear, accessible and accurate information is paramount.”

A recent White House proclamation called for a $100,000 fee for H1-B visas that allow American companies to hire non-immigrant international workers to work in the U.S.

“If you’re in rural Pennsylvania, we’re facing a huge physician shortage, much of which is being filled and fulfilled by H1-B physicians,” Whadia said. “If we drain Central Pennsylvania hospitals from H1-B positions, the people who lose are American patients.”

Upending global health safeguards

Miranda Yaver comes to the executive order topic from both the political science and public health perspectives.

“I feel really fortunate to be able to wear these two hats, (but wonder) if I’ve been cursed by a witch or something. In the first Trump administration, I was teaching law and public policy and constitutional law … and sort of thinking, now quaintly, ‘How can I possibly teach constitutional law amidst institutional arson?’” she said, drawing laughter from the crowd.

Deciding to pivot to health policy and public health when the COVID pandemic hit, she soon found herself once again teaching in targeted realms during another Trump administration.

“In my former life, I was also a stand-up comedian, so along with a team of researchers at the University of Michigan — all of us masochists in various ways — we are analyzing the Trump administration’s actions,” she said, including the number of executive orders and the role of the “not so beautiful bill,” she said of the Trump-named “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” of tax and spending policies recently passed by Congress.

What she considers considerably harmful results include pulling the U.S out from the World Health Organization (WHO), terminating staff in the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), reducing access to health care, defunding vaccine research and threatening to defund the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

“We can have the best insurance in the world, but if we don’t have doctors, we’re not going to get the care. And we don’t exactly have the most shining health outcomes,” she said, noting this is a “really destabilizing time” to teach public health and health policy.

Withdrawing from the WHO is going to be “deeply, deeply harmful to global public health on issues ranging from the health effects of childhood poverty to infectious disease prevention and surveillance.

“And for context, just because we need some more dismal news out of a lot of public health people,” she quipped, “I would say that the next pandemic is a question of if, not when, so underfunding infectious disease surveillance not a great thing.”

Aggressive offense

Following the panel presentation, Jacob Simon, a Pitt School of Law alumnus, asked about ways of “combatting” executive orders, such as seeking injunctive relief in, say, the case of a medical patient’s doctor being deported, or more in the form of “grassroots” efforts to pressure institutions to resist.

Responding, Carter called it a “both/and, not an either/or” scenario.

“Political scientists who study the development of the law (at conferences) essentially say, ‘We lawyers are all wrong about how the law works. Most often, the law follows public opinion. It does not lead it,’” he said. “Most often, especially at the Supreme Court level, they are following rather than leading. There are exceptions. But the data tend to prove that. So public opinion is kind of the foundational work.”

Carter also advocated for going “on offense more often and as aggressively as possible” regarding your legal rights, rather than waiting for something to happen and then suing in response.

“For example … right now, today, I would contend that every university professor has standing to sue based on the chilling effects that the Trump administration’s attack on freedom of speech has had,” Carter explained. “Everyone who works in the university has standing, and I would argue, so do students.

“Maybe I’m wrong … The only way to find out is to bring those cases,” he added. “And I would suggest bringing them aggressively and proactively.”

Last month, the DHS released a statement clarifying that “ICE does not raid or target schools”.","A group of Democratic senators have demanded that the Department of Education stop immigration enforcement activities from taking place close to schools, following several violent crackdowns near school grounds in Chicago.

Although the raids are conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which is under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the senators are making an appeal directly to the education secretary, Linda McMahon.

They said aggressive actions were affecting the safety of students.

“Federal agents continue to use unwarranted, excessive levels of force around Chicago, demonstrating an alarming lack of care or regard for the health and wellbeing of children, particularly by conducting unfocused, inflammatory operations within close proximity of school grounds,” the senators wrote, according to NBC News.

“We demand you pressure your colleague, secretary of homeland security Kristi Noem, to reinstate restrictions on federal immigration enforcement operations in and around places of education.”

The letter was signed by Tammy Duckworth, a senator from Illinois; Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen of Nevada; Kirsten Gillibrand of New York; Cory Booker and Andy Kim of New Jersey; Ed Markey of Massachusetts; and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland.

At the start of the year, Donald Trump rescinded a policy that prevented ICE from carrying out enforcement in sensitive areas, including schools, hospitals and churches.

“Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America’s schools and churches to avoid arrest,” the DHS said in a statement at the time, adding that removing the policy “returns [enforcement] to a case-by-case basis”.

While violent ICE arrests have taken place across the country in recent months, Chicago has become a focal point in Trump’s targeted immigration crackdown. School officials on Thursday said that officers arrested and briefly detained a 16-year-old student from a nearby school who was a US citizen, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

“We have received reports of federal law enforcement activity in a nearby neighborhood, and I am very sorry to share that a member of our school was impacted,” said Juan Carlos Ocon, the principal of Benito Juarez community academy, in an email to families, noting that enforcement did not take place on school ground. “I know this situation has created many fears and concerns in our community, and I want to emphasize that we are taking this situation extremely seriously.”

Earlier in the month, parents expressed concern about ICE deploying teargas as part of enforcement activity close to a school. Students at one school were rushed inside during recess after teargas was deployed nearby.

In their letter to McMahon, the senators said ICE should follow “common sense” policing guidelines when carrying out enforcement.

“If society can agree that alcohol, tobacco and drugs should be kept at least 1,000 feet away from our school, surely we can agree that tear gas – a chemical weapon which causes burning, pain, skin inflammation and respiratory distress – and other violent DHS tools and tactics also belong on that list,” the letter said.

The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Education did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Last month, the DHS released a statement clarifying that “ICE does not raid or target schools”.

“The media is sadly attempting to create a climate of fear and smear law enforcement,” Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary, said in a statement at the time. “ICE is not conducting enforcement operations at, or ‘raiding’ schools. ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children.

SAN FRANCISCO – Thousands of residents, workers, and faith leaders filled downtown San Francisco Thursday, rallying under the banner “Free the Bay” despite President Donald Trump’s announcement earlier in the day that he was canceling plans for a federal deployment in the city.

The demonstrations began hours after a noon press conference on the steps of City Hall, where a coalition of faith, labor, and community organizations released a joint statement signed by 150 groups demanding Trump keep federal troops out of the entire Bay Area. Organizers said the protests would go on regardless of the president’s reversal, citing deep distrust of his administration’s track record on immigration and civil rights.

Supervisor Shamann Walton said, “We have to be careful because we do not trust this administration. Hard to say you’re not coming, after you say you’re coming, then say you’re not coming, doesn’t mean we want to make sure our community is prepared to address the concerns and the issues that come when we have federal troops raiding our streets. We are going to remain vigilant.”

San Francisco District 11 Supervisor Cheyenne Chen, a Chinese American immigrant, drew parallels between current events and past acts of discrimination. “We have a long history of fighting for our rights and our freedom from organizing legal challenges to defend the Chinese Exclusion Act to Wong Kim’s fight for the birthright of citizenship,” Chen said. “Today our community is under attack as history is repeating itself, and we must stand in solidarity with our immigrant brothers and sisters.”

Chen added, “Federal agents, you do not belong in front of our schools, our businesses, our churches, and our hospitals. Community organizations, we are standing strong together with resources. We have each other’s back.”

Sophia Eva, serving as emcee, said that while Mayor Daniel Lurie had spoken with Trump earlier in the day and the president had said he would not deploy federal agents, the community’s needs remained urgent. “While Trump may be temporarily saying he’s not deploying federal agents to our city, in reality our communities really need assistance and they need this assistance to feel safe,” she said. “We also need housing. We need healthcare. We need jobs, and we need more federal resources and to restore federal cuts to essential programs such as Medi-Cal, SNAP, and schools—that should be the priority.”

Kim Tavaglione, Executive Director of the San Francisco Labor Council, said that labor leaders were committed to protecting all Bay Area workers, regardless of whether federal troops arrived. “They supposedly are calling off the troops from San Francisco, but, as everyone knows, our workers live in the nine Bay Area counties and beyond,” she said. “Labor is vowing to protect every worker in every county in the Bay Area. An injury to one is an injury to all.”

She added that if the administration “really wants to help the Bay Area, it’s time for them to double down, give us money for our schools, our public transportation, our public sector, our city workers, our county workers. We’re in desperate need of infrastructure. Instead of building a goddamn palace in Washington, D.C., help us build our roads, help us build our infrastructure.”

Alejo, Executive Director of Workers United, said the threats of federal action were “a show to make sure that we’re getting their message to stay silent, stay afraid.” He continued, “As a community, we reject those ideas. We reject that message because we know that the answer to our own safety is when we organize with each other because only we have each other’s back. To those who ICE is targeting, you’re not alone. You have rights. Reach out to your rapid response network, organize at home, organize in your workplace.”

By late afternoon, an estimated 5,000 people gathered at Embarcadero Plaza, carrying banners and chanting in defiance of what they described as the militarization of immigrant communities. Francisco Herrera, Co-Director of Nuevo Sol, said, “Bay Area leaders remain united against ICE and against any federal deployment anywhere in the Bay—whether it comes from the National Guard or the Department of Homeland Security. We won’t desist when our region—our neighborhoods, our schools, our parks, our houses of worship—are under threat of being turned into a militarized training ground.”

District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder told the crowd, “When they send troops into our neighborhoods, they’re not protecting us; they’re punishing us for standing up for justice. Our schools are underfunded, our hospitals are understaffed, and yet Trump wants to spend millions on ICE raids? That’s not leadership, that’s sabotage.”

Fielder later joined District 1 Supervisor Connie Chan and Supervisors Walton, Chen, and Mahmood in announcing legislation to appropriate city funds from San Francisco’s general reserves toward immigrant legal services and the San Francisco Rapid Response Network, which have been underfunded amid renewed federal threats.

Fielder said she has been pushing for these funds since taking office and voted against Mayor Lurie’s budget because it lacked additional resources for immigrant legal defense. The Rapid Response Network verifies immigration enforcement activity in San Francisco and connects immigrants arrested by ICE with legal assistance and support services.

“In a moment when Trump is pledging mass deportations, our San Francisco Rapid Response Line and immigration defense attorneys are operating under extremely limited capacity compared to the massive and unprecedented deportation machine they are now facing,” Fielder said.

She emphasized the critical role of immigration attorneys in protecting due process and keeping families together, saying, “Many of the lawyers are immigrants’ last hope, and they are incredibly overwhelmed, overworked, and burning out rapidly. It’s not sustainable. It is time that the city put its money where its values are.”

As the rally continued into the evening, participants filled the streets with chants, music, and banners proclaiming solidarity with immigrant families. Kim Tavaglione told the crowd, “Every raid, every arrest, every threat is a violation of our humanity. But we know our rights, and we’re teaching our neighbors how to protect them. This is not just about the Bay Area; it’s a national emergency. We will not let them turn our communities into battlegrounds.”

Lara Kiswani, Executive Director of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, said, “We declare our collective humanity and the way we do it is the way we’re showing up today, linking arm and arm. Immigrants are not alone in being the first line of defense. The first line of defense is all of us, shoulder to shoulder, street by street.”

Reverend Deborah Lee, Co-Executive Director of the Interfaith Movement for Human Integrity, urged attendees to stay active and vocal. “This is no time for silence. It’s no time for complacency. It’s a time for us to speak. It’s a time for us to be active,” she said. “Our faith traditions tell us that the government should be for the good of the people and public finances should not be used to invade and repress communities and put them into fear and hiding.”

As the rally concluded, chants of “Free the Bay!” echoed through downtown San Francisco. Leaders promised continued mobilizations and vigilance as Trump’s immigration crackdown looms over the region.

“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said.
It’ll be great again.” Trump had suggested that the role of the National Guard in San Francisco would be to address crime rates.
“I want to make sure that San Franciscans understand that the National Guard would not have any legal authority to make arrests or investigate crime,” San Francisco Dist.
Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, said Wednesday that the City by the Bay is experiencing its lowest homicide rate in 60 years.","President Trump said Thursday he had called off a planned deployment of immigration agents in San Francisco after prominent tech executives and Mayor Daniel Lurie asked him to do so.

“The Federal Government was preparing to ‘surge’ San Francisco, California, on Saturday, but friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge in that the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. Among the people Trump said he spoke to were Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.

Lurie released a statement saying he had talked to Trump on Wednesday night and told him that the presence of militarized immigration enforcement would hinder ongoing efforts to decrease crime and fentantyl use and boost economic activity.

“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie said.

On Truth Social, Trump said he believed the surge would be a “faster, stronger and safer” way to remove criminals from the city but that Lurie asked “very nicely” if he could be given a chance to “turn it around.”

News of the planned deployment of federal agents prompted fierce backlash from some California officials Wednesday.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom released a statement on X confirming and criticizing the agents’ upcoming arrival. He called deployment a “page right out of the dictator’s handbook” intended to create the conditions of unrest necessary to then send in the National Guard.

“He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol, he sends out ICE, he creates anxiety and fear in the community so that he can lay claim to solving that by sending in the [National] Guard,” Newsom said. “This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.”

About 100 federal agents, including members of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, were en route to the U.S. Coast Guard’s Alameda base, according to reporting from the San Francisco Chronicle. On Thursday morning, before Trump announced the cancellation of the surge, protesters gathered outside the base, where they attempted to prevent federal agents from entering, the Chronicle reported.

On Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that agents would be performing immigration enforcement in San Francisco.

“DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists — in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco,” the spokesperson said.

Lurie, who has thus far avoided directly criticizing Trump during the mayor’s first 10 months in office, issued a statement Wednesday outlining his strong opposition to a deployment of immigration agents or the National Guard in San Francisco.

“Uncoordinated federal action undermines our work,” he said. “Having the military posted in front of our schools, restaurants and office buildings will hinder our progress and let chaos get in the way of our recovery.”

Newsom told reporters at a Wednesday event that the state would file a lawsuit within a “nanosecond of any efforts to send the military to one of America’s great cities, San Francisco.”

He urged Californians to remain peaceful in the face of the arrival of federal agents.

“President Trump and [White House Deputy Chief of Staff] Stephen Miller’s authoritarian playbook is coming for another of our cities, and violence and vandalism are exactly what they’re looking for to invoke chaos,” said Newsom on X.

Trump had suggested for weeks that San Francisco was next on his list for National Guard deployment, after the administration sent troops to Los Angeles and Chicago and was battling in court to send them to Portland, Ore.

On Sunday, Trump told Fox News, “We’re going to San Francisco and we’ll make it great. It’ll be great again.”

Trump had suggested that the role of the National Guard in San Francisco would be to address crime rates. However, the National Guard is generally not allowed to perform domestic law enforcement duties when federalized by the president.

“I want to make sure that San Franciscans understand that the National Guard would not have any legal authority to make arrests or investigate crime,” San Francisco Dist. Atty. Brooke Jenkins told NBC Bay Area on Tuesday. She said the Guard is not legally equipped to “to curb the fentanyl crisis or retail theft or the issues that are most pressing here.”

Lurie acknowledged Wednesday that the city had more work to do to combat fentanyl use but said that the National Guard “cannot arrest drug dealers or shut down open-air drug markets.” He also touted progress the city had made in reducing violent crime to 70-year lows and the number of tent encampments to record lows.

Last month, Trump said that cities with Democratic political leadership such as San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles “are very unsafe places and we are going to straighten them out.”

Trump said he told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that “we should use some of these dangerous cities as training for our military, our National Guard.”

In a Monday statement, the White House defended the deployment of troops in U.S. cities, pointing to drops in crime after troops were deployed in Memphis and Washington, D.C.

“The President’s actions in DC have been tremendously successful, with even Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser highlighting the significant reduction in crime as a result of the operation,” Abigail Jackson, White House spokesperson, said in the statement. “San Francisco Democrats should look at the tremendous results in DC and Memphis and listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Bowser and welcome the President in to clean up their city.”

The president has direct command of the National Guard in Washington, D.C., as it is a federal territory. However, the president is generally not allowed to federalize troops to support local law enforcement without a governor’s consent.

In the case of Los Angeles and Chicago, the Guard was mobilized to defend federal property and personnel during immigration protests. In Memphis, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee has approved the deployment of the Guard to assist law enforcement with a crackdown on crime. Memphis has the highest violent-crime rate of any city in America, according to FBI data.

Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, said Wednesday that the City by the Bay is experiencing its lowest homicide rate in 60 years.

“It’s one of the safest large cities in this country that’s experiencing an economic rebirth and growth,” Newsom said.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a6341c1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8111x4258+0+574/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6e%2F82%2F7289a1ec43d79a4449a9a736c1a5%2Fgettyimages-2239294536.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:17:32.665418

""There is absolutely no reason for Americans’ SNAP benefits to be suspended considering the funding for November is authorized and readily available.
For far too many veterans, seniors, and children, SNAP benefits are the difference between having food or not.
""We urge USDA to use these funds for November SNAP benefits and issue clear guidance to states on how to navigate benefit issuance.
Choosing not to ensure SNAP benefits reach those in need this November would be a gross dereliction of your responsibilities to the American people.","Today, Congresswoman Veronica Escobar (TX-16) joined 213 of her Democratic colleagues in calling on the Trump Administration to immediately release the nearly $5 billion in SNAP contingency funding that would allow November benefits to go out without interruption.

SNAP benefits were made available to eligible individuals in October, but due to the Agriculture Secretary’s unwillingness to use her statutory transfer authority along with the roughly $5 billion SNAP contingency fund to deliver benefits in November, 42 million American seniors, veterans and families with children risk not being able to keep food on their table.

""Over 152,000 people in El Paso, including children, seniors, veterans, and working parents, rely on SNAP to put food on the table. Despite $5 billion available in SNAP’s reserve or 'contingency fund,' the Trump Administration has directed states to withhold November benefits that millions of low-income families need,” said Congresswoman Escobar. ""There is absolutely no reason for Americans’ SNAP benefits to be suspended considering the funding for November is authorized and readily available. I join my colleagues in calling for the administration to urgently release SNAP contingency funding and to finally come to the table to negotiate ending the shutdown for the good of the American people.""

The text of the letter can be found in its entirety below:

“Dear Madam Secretary,

""Right now, millions of Americans are struggling to afford food due to the Administration’s ill-conceived trade war. Just this year, we’ve seen household staples like eggs, coffee, and ground beef hit record high prices. Now more than ever, millions of families across the country depend upon the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to make ends meet. For far too many veterans, seniors, and children, SNAP benefits are the difference between having food or not. Now, due to the government shutdown, they are facing crippling levels of uncertainty about whether they will be able to afford food next month.

""A potential lapse in benefits would be felt by Americans of all ages and affect every corner and congressional district in the country. As the largest food assistance program in the United States, SNAP serves 42 million people. That includes 16 million children, 8 million seniors, 4 million people with disabilities, and 1.2 million veterans.

""That is why we were deeply concerned to see your comments suggesting that SNAP will run out of funding in two weeks and that no SNAP benefits will be issued in November. USDA’s shutdown plan acknowledges that “Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds...” USDA still has significant funding available in SNAP’s contingency reserve – which Congress provides precisely for this reason – that can be used to fund the bulk of November benefits.

""We urge USDA to use these funds for November SNAP benefits and issue clear guidance to states on how to navigate benefit issuance. Additionally, while the contingency reserve will not cover November benefits in full, we urge USDA to use its statutory transfer authority or any other legal authority at its disposal to supplement these dollars and fully fund November benefits.

""There are clear steps the administration can and must take immediately to ensure that millions of families across the country can put food on their table in November. Choosing not to ensure SNAP benefits reach those in need this November would be a gross dereliction of your responsibilities to the American people. We appreciate your consideration of these requests.”

Rashida Tlaib more than a week to find a Michigan mother who had been detained by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents.

Speaking at a “shadow hearing” in Chicago Friday on the impacts of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, the Democratic lawmaker said 12 days passed before she could find where the mother of three children was detained.

“They had her sleeping in a cot, like on the floor. And I didn’t know where she was!” she said. “I just couldn’t find her – and I’m a former immigration lawyer!”

Tlaib said she and her fellow Democrats have had similar experiences and it has led them to question the administration’s tactics and actions.

“Enough! When we say disappeared and kidnapped, we’re meaning disappeared and kidnapped,” she said. “We can’t find them.”

An attorney for the Trump administration told a federal judge in Portland, Oregon, Friday that they don’t intend to use all of the National Guard troops who have been called up for a potential deployment to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“As of yesterday, our determination remained that 200 (troops) is the right number and the appropriate number,” Department of Justice attorney Jacob Moshe Roth said in a court hearing over whether Judge Karin Immergut must drop her restraining order preventing President Trump from deploying National Guard troops in Oregon.

After first having their effort to federalize 200 Oregon National Guard troops in Portland blocked by Immergut, the administration then moved in 200 guardsmen from California and up to 400 from Texas to prepare for a deployment. The judge expressed concern that a total of 800 guardsmen was a substantial escalation.

Roth said they never intended to use more than 200 troops on the ground.

“They were not supposed to be supplemental; they were supposed to be instead of (the Oregon troops who were initially blocked),” he said.

The DOJ attorney reiterated what the administration said in a Thursday filing, that the administration might be satisfied for now if the judge allows only the 200 Oregon guardsmen to be deployed while continuing to sideline the troops from California and Oregon.

An independent journalist alleges the Department of Homeland Security used video footage he recorded in Illinois without permission and mislabeled it as an example of clashes in Portland, Oregon.

Ford Fischer said a clip of his footage was used in a 3-minute video posted on X on Sunday in which Micah Bock, a DHS deputy assistant secretary, talks about federal law enforcement officers saying they are “defending our cities under siege.”

“Footage of mine is used to say ‘In Portland, Oregon, Antifa terrorists have surged against our federal facilities,’” Fischer said in a post on X. “While labelled as Portland, this footage was shot by me in Broadview, Illinois.”

Fischer, who has been documenting anti-ICE protests in multiple cities, said he did not give DHS permission to use or license his video. When asked about Fischer’s allegations, a DHS spokesperson did not directly address them in a statement to CNN.

“Violence and rioting against law enforcement is unacceptable regardless of where it occurs,” the spokesperson said. In both Portland Oregon and Chicago Illinois violent Antifa terrorists have assaulted and brutally attacked our officers and agents. We will not stop until every single one of these anarchists are brought to justice.”

Fischer told CNN he was surprised to find his footage in the publication, noting that in recent months he observed federal agents using high-end camera gear to make their own, highly stylized videos.

“When I replayed it (…) I realized that indeed, a version of my Broadview, Illinois footage with the watermark cropped out was labelled ‘Portland, Oregon,’” Fischer told CNN.

CNN has geolocated the video clip and confirmed it was taken outside the ICE facility in Broadview on September 19, 2025.

A federal judge will hear arguments Friday in a lawsuit filed by Washington, DC, officials over the Trump administration’s decision to send National Guard troops to the district this August.

In the suit filed last month, DC Attorney General Brian Schwalb accuses the president and his administration of violating the Constitution and federal law by sending thousands of troops to the district without consent from local leaders.

“Deploying the National Guard to engage in law enforcement is not only unnecessary and unwanted, but it is also dangerous and harmful to the District and its residents,” Schwalb said in a statement last month. “It’s DC today but could be any other city tomorrow.”

More than 2,000 National Guard members were assigned to the DC mission and ordered to carry weapons as part of President Donald Trump’s anti-crime agenda in the nation’s capital, which also included a surge of federal officers from other agencies. Many of the National Guard troops were deployed from Republican-led states.

The White House has maintained the president has the authority to deploy the Guard to protect federal property and assist law enforcement.

Friday’s hearing comes as judges across the country are weighing similar lawsuits over the administration’s deployment of the Guard in Oregon and Illinois.

A federal judge will hear arguments today on whether she should drop the restraining order that currently prevents a National Guard deployment in Portland, Oregon – or keep it in place. But the Trump administration is suggesting she has more than two choices.

Judge Karin Immergut blocked President Trump’s deployment of about 600 National Guard troops from Oregon, California and Texas to help protect a Portland ICE facility that has been the site of protests since mid-summer.

The Department of Justice said a recent ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals should force Immergut to end her temporary restraining order that prevents any federalized Guard deployment within the state of Oregon. The state argued the appeals court decision did not directly address that order, and the judge should wait until the Ninth Circuit decides whether to rehear the case with more judges.

In a court filing earlier this week, the Trump administration suggested another alternative, saying even if Immergut decides against overturning her full order, she could instead allow deployment only of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, keeping the ones from Texas and California on the sidelines.

“Even if this Court distinguishes the federalized Guardsmen from Oregon from those coming from California and Texas, there is no question that the (order blocking deployments) must be dissolved or stayed insofar as it prohibits deployment of federalized Oregon Guardsmen,” the court filing said.

Immergut – a Trump appointee – has not said when she will make a decision on the government’s request. Her restraining order is scheduled to expire on November 2.

The Trump administration is giving its first details on how many federal law enforcement agents have been deployed for security at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland, and Oregon officials claim the information shows the administration’s previous statements were exaggerated.

In a response to the state’s ongoing lawsuit trying to stop the deployment of the National Guard in Portland, the Department of Homeland Security said Thursday the processing facility that has been the target of protests for months has had extra security staffing from three different DHS agencies since June. The highest confirmed number is around 150 officers in late September.

Shortly after that filing, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield sent a letter to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals arguing the new document shows “a material factual error” made in court about the need for federal officers in Portland.

The Department of Justice originally said 115 members of the Federal Protective Service had to be deployed to keep the peace at the ICE building, a callout they argued was unsustainable without support from the National Guard. But Rayfield notes the new document shows fewer FPS agents being deployed, with a maximum of 31 ever on active duty at a time in Portland.

Rayfield says the appeals court should reverse its own decision earlier this week that could open the door to National Guard deployments in Portland soon.

“This Court must act swiftly to prevent defendants from attempting to benefit from their own material mistake to deploy military forces to peaceful civilian streets, contravening the rule of law and our nation’s history and traditions,” Rayfield wrote.

The Trump administration has not yet responded to Rayfield’s letter.

As legal cases move forward over National Guard deployments to Democratic-led cities from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche is warning California and Illinois officials not to interfere with federal immigration enforcement activities, saying it violates federal law.

Here are the latest developments:

California

President Donald Trump called off plans to “surge” federal law enforcement and immigration resources to San Francisco, citing conversations with “friends” in the area and the city’s mayor.

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie’s patience on a call with Trump is part of the reason plans were dropped, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said.

Lurie on the call emphasized the progress his city has made in recent years in addressing crime and fueling economic growth. “Having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery,” the mayor said.

At a protest against the anticipated deployment to the Bay Area, people blocked Customs and Border Protection vehicles outside a Coast Guard base. Two protesters were arrested, and law enforcement officers fired shots at a U-Haul truck backing toward them.

A panel of three judges with the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals continues to weigh whether to limit Trump’s ability to continue deploying National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area.

Illinois

In Chicago, Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino is accused of throwing at least one tear gas canister at protesters, possibly in violation of a federal judge’s temporary restraining order restricting federal agents from using aggressive crowd control tactics at anti-ICE protests in the city.

Gov. JB Pritzker announced the creation of the Illinois Accountability Commission to establish a public record of federal enforcement abuses.

Federal agents have been deployed in Chicago since early September during what the administration has titled “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The mother of a 20-year-old Illinois woman who became “the face” of the operation after she was killed in a drunken driving hit-and-run collision with a man in the country illegally said her daughter wouldn’t have wanted to be associated with the immigration enforcement push.

Oregon

A federal judge will hold a hearing today to consider whether to dissolve or suspend the temporary restraining order she issued this month barring the White House from deploying the National Guard into Portland.

US District Judge Karin Immergut will preside over the virtual hearing, scheduled for 10 a.m. local time.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/114666-chicagoansconfrontice-horizontal-1-00-00-15-03-still001.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-24 14:04:31.075570

Activists are planning to rally outside the federal Whipple Building near Fort Snelling Friday afternoon, according to social media posts. The Whipple Building is the site of Minnesota’s Immigration Court and an ICE office.

They are planning their own press conference at noon, and aim to protest at the site during Noem’s remarks, scheduled to begin at 4:30 p.m.

Minnesota has yet to see mass deployment of ICE agents, but increased immigration enforcement presence has been documented. In early October, ICE arrested a crew of roofers from El Salvador and Honduras working in St. Paul’s North End, drawing community protests.

On Sept. 30, immigration officials announced they had conducted 900 site visits and in-person interviews in the Twin Cities in an effort to clamp down on alleged immigration fraud carried out through marriage and student visas. The effort, dubbed Operation Twin Shield, claimed to have uncovered 275 cases of suspected fraud.

A June federal law enforcement raid on a Mexican restaurant in south Minneapolis drew hundreds of protestors and sparked chaotic scenes on Lake Street. The raid included dozens of federal agents, including ICE personnel, in paramilitary garb, but was not tied to deportation efforts.

Her visit comes three weeks after the U.S. Department of Justice sued the Twin Cities and state, alleging that they interfere with federal immigration enforcement because of their “sanctuary city” policies.

Local officials, including Gov. Tim Walz and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul, pushed back against that lawsuit and said they aren’t violating any laws.

Attorney General Keith Ellison also issued a statement saying, “My team and I regularly partner with law enforcement to prosecute dangerous individuals who pose a threat to their communities, and Minnesota is not stopping the federal government from doing the same. This baseless lawsuit is just more political retaliation against Minnesota and we will respond in court. In the meantime, Minnesota will continue to use our law enforcement resources to actually improve public safety.”

ICE says it has averaged more than 400 arrests per day nationwide since President Donald Trump signed executive orders in January directing the agency to prioritize immigration enforcement and deportations.

“Coast Guard personnel issued multiple verbal commands to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse,” the Coast Guard statement reads.
“When the vehicle’s actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire.” No Coast Guard personnel were injured during the incident, according to the the agency.

The incident followed a days-long demonstration near the base, which is expected to be used by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB).

The Coast Guard posted a statement to social media early Friday with details about the incident, which occurred around 10 p.m. PDT Thursday. The agency said security personnel “standing watch” in the area observed a vehicle behaving “erratically” before it attempted to “back into” the base.

Video of the incident, which aired on CBS News, shows a truck reversing toward a line of personnel stationed near the base. Once officers began firing shots toward the truck, it drove away.

“Coast Guard personnel issued multiple verbal commands to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to comply and proceeded to put the vehicle in reverse,” the Coast Guard statement reads. “When the vehicle’s actions posed a direct threat to the safety of Coast Guard and security personnel, law enforcement officers discharged several rounds of live fire.”

No Coast Guard personnel were injured during the incident, according to the the agency.

CBS also reported that people witnessed the truck strike two bystanders, but it is unclear whether that led to any injuries.

The statement also said the FBI would take lead on investigating the incident and that the Coast Guard would coordinate with law enforcement agencies.

The Alameda base drew more than 100 protesters earlier Thursday in anticipation of the site’s use by CBP agents during a planned immigration enforcement crackdown in San Francisco. The base is roughly 15 miles away from the city.

CBP officers began arriving to the area early Thursday morning, while some demonstrators attempted to block vehicles from entering the gates. Officials used smoke grenades and flash-bang devices to disperse protesters.

Government officials have expressed fear in recent weeks for the safety of law enforcement officers in the current political climate — primarily amid the rise in tensions over President Trump’s robust deportation agenda.

DHS says gang member tried to ram agents with car, defends apparent tear gas use on protesters

Meanwhile, ABC7 is getting more information from the DHS about recent violent run-ins with federal agents over the past few days.

DHS says Wednesday was one of their most violent days on the job.

At 26th and Ogden in Cicero, DHS claims, a Latin Kings gang member tried to ram agents with his vehicle.

Six people were arrested that day for impeding operations, and three undocumented immigrants were placed into custody.

And there were more tense moments Thursday at the Little Village Discount Mall during an anti-ICE rally.

Attorneys accused federal agents of violating a court order, which does not allow them to use riot control weapons unless facing an imminent threat and requires them to issue warnings first before deploying tear gas.

A federal complaint is now taking aim at the man who led the charge. An image of Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino appears to show him throw tear gas ""without justification,"" according to the complaint.

""Federal agents started acting aggressive, pushing protesters away... Again, it was all peaceful protesters,"" said protester Kristian Armendariz.

However, DHS says the group of about 75-100 people began firing commercial artillery shell fireworks at agents and throwing rocks, adding that Bovino was hit in the head.

According to DHS, agents repeated multiple warnings to the crowd to back up, informing them that chemical agents would be deployed. The department stood by their agents' actions, saying, ""Agents properly used their training. The use of chemical munitions was conducted in full accordance with CBP policy and was necessary to ensure the safety of both law enforcement and the public.""

Bovino was set to appear in court on Nov. 5, but now, a federal judge has ordered more than double the time to question Bovino after these incidents.

Because Abrego Garcia has deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept him and a country where Abrego Garcia believes he will not face harm or persecution.
The Trump administration so far has floated sending Abrego Garcia to one of three nations in Africa — Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.
In March, Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, where he detailed his experience of psychological and physical torture.","WASHINGTON — The Trump administration Friday identified the West African nation of Liberia as the location for the removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, noting his deportation could come as soon as Oct. 31.

In a Friday court filing in the District of Maryland, the Department of Justice argued that Liberia is a close partner with the United States and that the federal government has received assurances from Liberia that Abrego Garcia will not be harmed if he is deported there. They added that Abrego Garcia, who has a wife and family in Maryland, has not expressed fear of being removed to Liberia.

“Although Petitioner has identified more than twenty countries that he purports to fear would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, Liberia is not on that list,” according to the filing.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his Maryland case could not be immediately reached for comment.

The new filing comes shortly after attorneys for Abrego Garcia in a separate case in Tennessee this week requested to subpoena Trump DOJ official Todd Blanche in connection with Abrego Garcia’s claim that his criminal case by the Trump administration is vindictive. That hearing is set to start Nov. 4.

Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to those charges, which accuse him of the human trafficking of immigrants in an incident stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee.

Detention challenged

Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation cast a spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal.

Abrego Garcia has stated he is willing to be deported to Costa Rica, which has agreed to accept the longtime Maryland man as a refugee.

Because Abrego Garcia has deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept him and a country where Abrego Garcia believes he will not face harm or persecution.

The Trump administration so far has floated sending Abrego Garcia to one of three nations in Africa — Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.

Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis found little evidence the Trump administration has made any effort to remove Abrego Garcia either to the southern African nation of Eswatini or Costa Rica.

At that hearing, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys told Xinis they have not received an answer from the federal government as to why officials won’t remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica.

Detained in Pennsylvania

Xinis is currently mulling whether or not to order the release of Abrego Garcia, who is detained at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Pennsylvania.

Any indefinite stay would likely be unconstitutional, per a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them.

County officials this week advanced plans to create “ICE-free zones” throughout the region.
San Jose officials are considering a similar proposal to prevent ICE from using city-owned properties.
“The Border Patrol and ICE have no business patrolling the streets and communities of East San Jose,” Ortiz said.
“Don’t give this administration a single reason to turn their sights to the South Bay,” he said.","South Bay civic leaders said they remain ready to support the region’s immigrant community after news broke Thursday morning that President Donald Trump is backing off plans to surge federal law enforcement personnel in the Bay Area.

“They’ve made the right decision. Our region is on the rise,” Mayor Matt Mahan said during the news conference at the Amigos de Guadalupe Center for Justice and Empowerment in East San Jose.

The event had initially been called in response to Wednesday news reports that the Trump administration planned to deploy more than 100 federal law enforcement personnel to a Coast Guard base in Alameda. The planned deployment, which was said to include immigration enforcement officers, was seen as an attempt to make good on Trump’s promise to crack down on crime in San Francisco.

But by Thursday morning, the deployment had apparently been called off.

“I hope desperately for the good of all of our residents, including our most vulnerable neighbors, that this decision holds,” Mahan said.

Despite the sighs of relief, however, speakers at the East San Jose event — a group that also included elected officials for San Jose and Santa Clara County, as well as a number of nonprofit leaders — voiced skepticism that the apparent enforcement reprieve would stick.

“The administration has shown us that they change their minds from one hour to the next,” Rebeca Armendariz, a member of the Rapid Response Network, a coalition of community-run organizations that protect immigrants and their families from deportation raids in Santa Clara County, told San José Spotlight. “We want our community to continue to prepare themselves.”

To do so, Armendariz urged residents to report on the activity of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to her network.

Other speakers offered messages of solidarity to the South Bay’s immigrant community, encouraging them to be mindful of their rights during interactions with federal immigration officials.

“To our immigrant brothers and sisters, you are not alone,” Maritza Maldonado, executive director of Amigos de Guadalupe, said. “We see you. We love you. We will fight alongside you.”

ICE has conducted large-scale operations in cities such as Los Angeles and San Francisco since President Donald Trump took office earlier this year. Santa Clara County has not seen this level of crackdown so far. But fears of immigration raids have kept San Jose students from attending class and slowed foot traffic at Latino-owned businesses. Some undocumented residents have chosen to self-deport.

With the threat of stepped up immigration raids looming, South Bay governments have been stiffening protections for undocumented residents in recent months.

County officials this week advanced plans to create “ICE-free zones” throughout the region. In such zones, local officials would raise physical barriers and lock gates to prevent federal immigration agents from unlawfully using county properties for surveillance and arrests. San Jose officials are considering a similar proposal to prevent ICE from using city-owned properties.

The county and city have also announced efforts to step up legal aid, family shelter, food, child care, health services and communication for undocumented residents.

District 5 Councilmember Peter Ortiz, who represents East San Jose and has been a chief backer of these efforts, was among those who spoke during the event.

“The Border Patrol and ICE have no business patrolling the streets and communities of East San Jose,” Ortiz said. “We will not accept fear as a form of government. We will not accept intimidation disguised as security.” During his remarks, Mahan also reaffirmed the city’s commitment to its sanctuary city laws, which prohibit most forms of cooperation between San Jose police officers and immigration officials.

In addition, he also urged people who are considering protesting the administration’s actions to do so peacefully.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has promoted the program, which the federal government has called a “force multiplier” for immigration enforcement.
He described the 287(g) task force model as a way to serve warrants “expeditiously — and not wait for ICE” to come in person.
Big money in immigration enforcement Bolstering the immigration crackdown is a growing flow of money, incentivizing and rewarding local police departments to do federal work.
Civil rights concerns But as money and manpower flow into immigration enforcement, critics warn of high potential human costs.","As the federal government intensifies its immigration crackdown, the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office has emerged as one of the Suncoast’s most active partners with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

In recent months, Sheriff Kurt Hoffman’s deputies have patrolled the Everglades immigration jail known as “Alligator Alcatraz” and shuttled immigrants between detention facilities in Florida, earning more than $280,000 in state funding for the work. Meanwhile, the number of ICE detainers — which keep people up to 48 hours past their release date for possible detention and deportation — have quadrupled this past year inside the already crowded county jail.

Sarasota County’s ICE activity stands in sharp contrast to neighboring agencies. The Manatee County Sheriff’s Office has not sent deputies to Alligator Alcatraz or transported immigrants for ICE, according to a spokesperson. And while North Port sought state reimbursements, its request was only a third the size of Sarasota’s.

The county’s growing role comes as Florida positions itself as a testing ground for aggressive, state-backed immigration enforcement — with cash incentives for local agencies and expanded powers under a federal program called 287(g).

The initiative, named for a section of federal immigration law, authorizes local police and sheriff’s deputies to perform duties typically reserved for ICE agents, including holding people inside jails in coordination with the federal agency.

Florida has ramped up its use of the 287(g) task force model, which goes further, allowing officers to make immigration arrests in the field.

U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has promoted the program, which the federal government has called a “force multiplier” for immigration enforcement. During a press conference in Bradenton on Monday, Noem told reporters it was “fantastic to see” how Florida has jumped on board.

But immigrant rights groups have warned that it diverts local staff time from normal policing and risks racial profiling and eroding community trust – problems that surfaced in the years before the government abandoned this same enforcement model more than a decade ago.

“The task force model really changes the culture of law enforcement agencies and the officers who are deputized and pushed to do this kind of work,” said Roberto Lopez, a senior staffer with the group Texas Civil Rights Project, who has closely followed Florida’s immigration policies. “That kind of approach is harmful to policing writ large.”

Hoffman told Suncoast Searchlight during a Sept. 9 interview that the program allows his deputies to act quickly on immigration warrants. He described the 287(g) task force model as a way to serve warrants “expeditiously — and not wait for ICE” to come in person.

The office has since cut off communication with news outlets on the topic of immigration after adopting a policy routing all 287(g)-related media requests through ICE — a move transparency experts say reflects ICE’s broader retreat from public accountability.

“Law enforcement has the power to detain you, to throw you in a cell, to take your kids, to take your money, even take your life,” said David Cuillier, director of the University of Florida’s Joseph L.

As U.S. immigration enforcement shifts from the border to the interior of the country, few states have supported President Donald Trump’s efforts as enthusiastically as Florida.

Each of its 67 sheriff’s departments and more than 150 police departments have signed 287(g) task force agreements with ICE — a controversial practice that no other state has adopted so broadly.

In Sarasota County, Hoffman said that 20 of his deputies would be “cross-sworn as task force members” and able to coordinate with ICE to search for undocumented immigrants in the field — citing traffic stops as a typical gateway to immigration arrests.

“If you get stopped for driving on a suspended license or speeding or something, and we find out that you’re foreign born, [under] the task force model, the deputy out there can then contact ICE,” Hoffman said. “Then that deputy, under the task force model, will charge them, bring them into the jail, and in the jail could process the warrant.”

The sheriff’s office also is a regional transportation hub: Deputies transport people accused of immigration violations from the Hardee, Manatee and Sarasota County jails to ICE custody in the Tampa area. And in August, the office sent a contingent of deputies to patrol Alligator Alcatraz, the immigration detention center in the Everglades.

Since training deputies on the task force model this fall, Hoffman’s agency has reported 16 “encounters” with people suspected of lacking proper authorization to be in the country, according to a statewide database hosted by Gov. Ron DeSantis’s State Board of Immigration Enforcement. None of those resulted in immigration-related arrests.

Most of the office’s immigration enforcement still occurs inside the county jail, where officers may hold people flagged by ICE for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release. ICE issued 173 detainers to the jail between Jan. 20 and late July — four times as many as during the same period last year.

Big money in immigration enforcement

Bolstering the immigration crackdown is a growing flow of money, incentivizing and rewarding local police departments to do federal work.

Florida’s State Board of Immigration Enforcement has set aside a $250 million grant to reimburse agencies for their work with ICE, and released more than $14 million so far. ICE, too, is set to pour millions into Florida law enforcement, announcing Sept. 26 it had awarded Florida more than $38 million for that work.

Those agreements have begun to pay off.

Law enforcement agencies in 47 cities and counties received a first batch of reimbursements last month for time spent on ICE training, detention beds, vans and employee bonuses between February and June.

Some sought reimbursements for technologies and gear as wide-ranging as bullet proof vests, body cameras, finger print scanners, printers, monitors, laptops, virtual private networks (VPNs), handcuffs, leg irons, weapon lock boxes and automated license plate readers.

On the Suncoast, the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office requested the lion’s share of reimbursements; neither DeSoto nor Manatee County sheriff’s offices requested funds. Only one other local law enforcement agency — in the City of North Port — requested and received reimbursement, bringing in a total of $95,000.

In its application to the state, Hoffman’s agency requested: $62,400 to “sublet” beds for people held on ICE detainers; more than $10,000 for gas mileage and meals while transporting immigrants for ICE; more than $130,000 in employee bonuses; and almost $74,000 to purchase a transport vehicle.

The reimbursements were approved just after the sheriff secured an 11% budget expansion — the second-largest of any Sarasota County department — adding more than $20 million in new funding and helping drive a $2.5 billion county budget that has grown more than 70% in three years. The office now operates on roughly $220 million a year, most of it for personnel costs, technology upgrades and jail operations.

Hoffman also is managing an overcrowded jail and facing cost projections in the hundreds of millions to expand the facility. Against that backdrop, the state and federal reimbursements for immigration enforcement — just $283,390 — represent a slim fraction of the agency’s overall budget.

But for individual employees, the financial incentives are significant: Officers can receive $1,000 in one-off bonus payments for ICE training, plus additional pay for special assignments.

The Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office, for example, sought more than $7,500 in state reimbursements per officer for deputies to work security at Alligator Alcatraz in August. According to budget documents obtained through a public records request, the office requested an initial total of $52,454.50 for a 10-day “mission” from the state’s Division of Emergency Management, which built the detention center.

Civil rights concerns

But as money and manpower flow into immigration enforcement, critics warn of high potential human costs.

An internal Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office policy on the 287(g) program prohibits discrimination, as well as “profiling, stereotyping and biased enforcement practices.” But civil rights advocates say the task force model nonetheless opens the door to abuses — eroding trust between deputies and immigrant communities.

Amid concerns about a lack of oversight for local law enforcement, the federal government previously dropped the 287(g) task force model in 2012. Maricopa County, Arizona, offered a worst-case scenario: There, the Department of Justice found deputies had systematically discriminated against Latino residents of the county. The county settled a lawsuit over the program and has spent more than $300 million on the court case and reforms required under the settlement, ProPublica has reported.

Florida’s widespread adoption of the program and its large-scale sweeps like O

peration Tidal Wave — a 6-day push in April by federal and state agencies to arrest undocumented immigrants — has struck a nerve with advocates across the country.

“I’ve been watching and looking at Florida, especially with Operation Tidal Wave, and seeing how [it] bodes for Texas’s future,” said Lopez, of Texas Civil Rights Project. “We aren’t seeing, yet, that kind of task force model compliance that you’re seeing in Florida.”

Under Trump’s second administration, ICE has brought back the model in full force, signing up hundreds of agencies across the country. Now, the federal agency has eroded its training requirements, too.

Under previous iterations of the program, officers were required to participate in weeks of in-person training; they are now required to complete 40 hours online.

Even law enforcement officials have expressed concern about the program.

Sarasota County Commissioner Tom Knight told Suncoast Searchlight that he harbored doubts about the model while serving as sheriff from 2009 until 2021. He allowed for some immigration arrests in the county jail but worried that taking immigration enforcement into the streets would instill fear in community members and jeopardize his relationships with constituents.

“My message was that my job as sheriff is not to be a border patrol agent or an ICE agent out in the field,” said Knight. “It was always an issue for me with the community: what does the hospitality industry think? What do the farmers think? I would talk to a lot of them – even if the people they were hiring were legal, they still had family members who were not here legally… It’s a touchy situation.”",https://suncoastsearchlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sarasota-Sheriff-Deputy-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 18:01:59.381736

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said today that the U.S. struck a boat allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean Sea, marking at least the third time this week that the U.S. has attacked a vessel it says was involved in drug trafficking.

“The vessel was known by our intelligence to be involved in illicit narcotics smuggling, was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route, and carrying narcotics,” Hegseth wrote in a post on X. “Six male narco-terrorists were aboard the vessel during the strike, which was conducted in international waters—and was the first strike at night. All six terrorists were killed and no U.S. forces were harmed in this strike.”

Hegseth said that this vessel belonged to the Tren de Aragua gang, which the Trump administration has named a designated terrorist organization, and was hit in the Caribbean.

Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., and at least a half a dozen other senators are calling on the U.S. Education Department to pressure immigration authorities to refrain from carrying out enforcement within 1,000 feet of any school property, citing recent classroom disruptions in the Chicago area.

Today, they sent the letter, first provided to NBC News, to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, demanding that she step in and ask the Department of Homeland Security to curb its operations around schools.

“Federal agents continue to use unwarranted, excessive levels of force around Chicago, demonstrating an alarming lack of care or regard for the health and wellbeing of children, particularly by conducting unfocused, inflammatory operations within close proximity of school grounds,” the senators wrote in the letter. “We demand you pressure your colleague, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, to reinstate restrictions on Federal immigration enforcement operations in and around places of education.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said today that the U.S. and numerous other countries are committed to the demilitarization of Gaza, stressing that Israel had met its commitment to withdraw its forces from areas of the Palestinian territory.

Speaking from the Civilian Military Coordination Center in Israel, Rubio said ""miles of tunnels"" set up by Hamas posed a challenge to the demilitarization efforts.

""We’re dealing with miles and miles of kilometers of tunnel networks,"" he said. ""We’re dealing with two decades of terrorist infrastructure. All that has to be confronted, and we’ll do that together with Israel.""

He emphasized the multinational commitment to disarmament.

Responding to the Knesset's vote to advance a bill to annex the occupied West Bank, Rubio said, ""It was used to embarrass Netanyahu."" He added that he doesn't think annexation will actually happen and said it would jeopardize the ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel.

""It’s a threat to the peace process, and everybody knows it,"" he said. ""But I’m not getting to the middle of Israeli politics. We’re focused on peace and security.""

Statement

Verdict

The Ontario ad is an edited, heavily condensed version of a Ronald Reagan speech, but the sentiment is unchanged and is an accurate reflection of the former president's views on protectionism.

Analysis

Trump said late last night that he was canceling trade talks with Canada after the province of Ontario ran an ad attacking his trade war and the negative effects it anticipates from higher trade tariffs.

The ad used an edited speech by Ronald Reagan in 1987 in which he said, among other things: ""High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries, and the triggering of fierce trade wars.""

Trump dismissed the ad as “FAKE,” implying it misrepresented or distorted the former president’s words.

The Ontario ad changes the order of Reagan’s words, quotes only part of some sentences and removes some of the very specific original context on how he had — very reluctantly and contrary to his economic philosophy — just imposed tariffs on Japan in a dispute over semiconductors.

But the sentiment expressed in the ad is unchanged: Reagan's speech was anti-protectionist and he did say, referring to his own tariffs, that “over the long run such trade barriers hurt every American worker and consumer.”

Trump has doubled down on his criticism this morning, posting on Truth Social that Canada ""fraudulently took a big buy ad saying that Ronald Reagan did not like Tariffs, when actually he LOVED TARIFFS FOR OUR COUNTRY, AND ITS NATIONAL SECURITY.""

The Reagan Foundation said it was considering its legal options regarding the ad, which it said misrepresents the remarks and used the speech without permission. But that legality issue aside, it’s not clear in what way Reagan’s words were misrepresented.

Ambassador Steve Fagin, a seasoned career U.S. diplomat, is expected to be tapped as the State Department's liaison to the Civilian Military Coordination Center monitoring the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas and coordinating the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza, two sources familiar with the matter told NBC News.

Fagin is currently serving as U.S. ambassador to Yemen and has almost two decades of field experience in the foreign service.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to visit the coordination center in southern Israel later this week.

“We’ll be assigning some career, experienced State Department personnel to sort of be there to help coordinate all these efforts,” Rubio told reporters shortly before his departure for Israel on Wednesday. “It’s important particularly over the next couple of weeks, that we keep the cease fire together.”

Fagin will face an uphill battle increasing humanitarian assistance to meet the needs of a starving population in Gaza.

After two years of war, a United Nations hunger monitor warned in August that Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip were confronting manmade faminelike conditions.

The flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza increased 46% in the first week of the fragile U.S. brokered ceasefire, according to the U.N.

Fagin is also likely to face some skepticism from aid groups after the U.S. backed the controversial Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which required Palestinians to travel to four aid distribution hubs rather than bringing the aid directly to civilians.

“Humanitarian assistance must enter the Gaza Strip at scale to meet the enormous needs of the population wherever they are,” Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general, said yesterday.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime political foe of Trump who previously sued him for making misleading statements to banks, is scheduled to be arraigned today in federal court on bank fraud charges.

A grand jury in Virginia indicted James, a Democrat, this month, weeks after Trump posted a message on Truth Social pressing Attorney General Pam Bondi to take action against her and two other political adversaries.

James is charged with one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The indictment alleges she falsely claimed that a home in Norfolk, Virginia, was her second residence, allowing her to obtain favorable loan terms, and that she rented the property to a family of three.

For the 12th time, Senate Democrats blocked the Republican Party’s government funding legislation this week without a single senator switching his or her vote.

Just three Democratic caucus members voted for the bill: John Fetterman, D-Pa.; Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev.; and Angus King, I-Maine. That means Republicans are still five votes short of the 60-vote threshold to ensure passage of the bill, just as they have been since before the government shut down 23 days ago.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told NBC News he’s taken aback by some of the Democratic posturing and rhetoric.

“I’m surprised at how open they’ve been about it,” Thune said in an interview Thursday. “That statement yesterday by that House member that they know the American people are going to suffer but this is their leverage? This isn’t about leverage. This isn’t a political game. It’s about people’s lives.”

President Donald Trump’s scorched-earth immigration policy has led to a historic drop in attempted crossings on foot. At the same time, repression and detentions of immigrants within the country have surged.

For Mr. Trump, closing the border seems to be a promise fulfilled. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) reported in mid-September that the number of people caught trying to cross illegally had dropped 96% in 2025 compared with 2024, to 6,319 cases—an average of 204 per day. According to the DHS, 2 million people have already left the U.S. during the first 250 days of the Trump administration, of whom 400,000 were deported; the rest departed voluntarily.

The United Nations confirmed similar figures, noting a 97% drop in border-crossing attempts between January and August, compared with 260,000 in the same period of 2024, based on monitoring of key migration routes. Interviews conducted by the UN Human Rights Office with 182 migrants who decided to return home found that 49% said crossing had become “impossible,” while 46% cited fear of Trump’s crackdown.

With the border quieter, turmoil has moved north, into the country’s interior. The government’s aggressive approach has produced striking images: students detained on the streets by masked agents, immigrants and even U.S. citizens violently confronted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, and families left desperate as loved ones are taken before immigration courts.

The case of Kilmar Armando Ábrego García—deported illegally to El Salvador despite a court order forbidding it—has become emblematic. Rights groups have taken the government to court, denouncing human rights violations and unsanitary detention conditions. Recently, the Supreme Court authorized police to detain individuals with “Hispanic appearance” before checking their immigration status—a ruling that has deepened the sense of insecurity, even among American citizens.

“I came to this country seeking safety and justice. Instead, I was arrested after a hearing and taken to a place designed to break you. The lights never go out, the cold is unbearable. They denied even the most basic human right,” said one immigrant involved in a lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), speaking anonymously and referring to being denied bathroom access.

Valor visited both sides of the border between San Diego (California) and Yuma (Arizona), including the famous dune fields that have served as backdrops for films such as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope (1977). The area reflects a land divided even in name: known as Algodones on the Mexican side and officially as the Imperial Sand Dunes in the U.S. The same applies to El Centinela, a mountain straddling the border—Americans call the 780-meter peak Mount Signal.

Traveling through the region, one quickly notices the shared physiognomy and the strong influence of Mexican cuisine. English and Spanish flow interchangeably, mirroring the fluid cultural identity of a border whose complexity goes far beyond static walls.

Sales executive Kirstin Backes, 36, was training for a dune rally when the reporter visited. Born in California, she works with high-performance cars and feels a deep connection to the dunes, which her family has visited since her childhood. “The dunes show how arbitrary the border can be,” she said, pointing to areas where the sand nearly swallows the wall. “The wall was built by humans, but nature seems to mock it.”

Ms. Backes fears coming across dying migrants in the dunes and says the presence of heavily armed guards makes her uneasy. While reluctant to publicly criticize the government, she believes Trump’s policies are hurting both the economy and society.

“I hope people out there understand that most Americans don’t support these policies—or at least not the way they’re being enforced,” she said. “Trump is using immigrants as political weapons to feed fear.”

Along the 250-kilometer stretch between the Pacific Ocean and Yuma, the border remains sealed and tightly guarded, with Border Patrol trucks stationed roughly every 25 kilometers. Approaching within 91 meters of the nine-meter-high steel wall is prohibited, as is flying drones nearby. Funds from the “Big Beautiful Bill”—so far Mr. Trump’s only legislative victory—will finance further expansion of walls, roads, sensors, and surveillance.

The border agents, cordial but visibly bored, took the opportunity to chat with the reporter. In September, the desert heat was still punishing, with temperatures reaching a perceived 45 degrees Celsius. Federal Route 8 cuts across the region, but crossing on foot is nearly impossible. The nearest city, Yuma, lies 31 kilometers away.

Except for areas managed by the National Park Service—accessible only between November and March—the region is desolate. In the desert, a few emergency phones for migrants, installed by the California government, punctuate the emptiness. Near one stands a small memorial to Rebecca Castellanos, who died in 2022.

Agents, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed that crossings have decreased. In Arizona, some attempts still occur in less-patrolled areas. Their main concern now, they said, are vehicles trying to cut through the desert to pick up migrants who manage to evade natural barriers. The entire region is monitored by solar-powered cameras from Anduril, a U.S. defense technology company specializing in artificial intelligence.

In Yuma—a city known for its large population of American retirees who cross into Mexico to buy cheaper medicine and health services—the heat makes life even harsher. A $309 million contract was signed to reinforce 43 kilometers of the nine-meter-high wall. Apart from a few heroin addicts frozen in distorted poses beneath canopies, the city consists mainly of cars shuttling between air-conditioned malls and drive-thru restaurants.

East of Yuma, natural barriers grow stronger: the Colorado River, the Sonoran Desert, and farther east, the Rio Grande. Between Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas, the border is more porous—in stretches where rivers do not define the boundary, pedestrian barriers are still under construction, unlike the nearly completed section in California.

Crossing from Calexico (U.S.) to Mexicali (Mexico), Valor saw little visible police or military presence beyond a single checkpoint with sniffer dogs on the road to Tijuana. A dirt road just a few kilometers before it offered an easy detour. The border crossing itself was surprisingly fast, with no passport checks—only cameras photographing vehicles and passengers.

The world’s busiest border city, Tijuana—now home to 1.8 million residents—emerged during the colonial era and grew after the border’s demarcation in 1848. Once a hub for brothels and casinos, it evolved in the 20th century into North America’s largest medical device manufacturing center. It is also widely seen as the point where Latin America ends.

At the western edge, the playa offers the most striking face of the border: the wall extends 50 meters into the sea. The spot has become a tourist attraction, with murals condemning U.S. immigration policies and honoring those who died or disappeared during crossings. Even a fragment of the Berlin Wall stands nearby, beside vendors selling ice cream and micheladas—a traditional Mexican drink of beer mixed with chili and lime.

Nearby, car washer Álvaro Lopez, 52, recalls the days before the wall existed. “It used to be just a fence. We interacted a lot—we’d go play on the other side. But in the 1990s, they started putting up the wall,” said Mr. Lopez, who has worked there for 40 years and has a daughter living in the U.S.

Writer and professor Pepe Rojo, 57, crosses the border weekly to teach at the University of California, San Diego. Having lived on the border for 19 years, his artistic performances—which blend science fiction, mock newspapers from the future, and robots played by local activists—critique the harsh realities of maquiladora factories and the endless waits faced by migrants in daily border lines. “Things started getting worse after 9/11,” he said.

At the playa, families picnic, avoid the polluted water, and listen to mariachis playing for spare change. Many gaze through the narrow slits of the wall toward San Diego. For Mr. Rojo, this routine captures how border residents cope with their reality. “It’s something they face every day—a very concrete part of their lives. There’s no hatred, just resignation,” he said.

“Rather than supporting and working with federal law enforcement professionals, California politicians, including U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi and San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, have instead called for state and local law enforcement officials to ‘arrest’ federal agents and officers for enforcing federal laws enacted by the U.S. Congress, including federal immigration laws,” Blanche wrote in his missive.

“The Department of Justice views any arrests of federal agents and officers in the performance of their official duties as both illegal and futile,” he added. “Numerous federal laws prohibit interfering with and impeding immigration or other law-enforcement operations.”

Blanche said the DOJ would “investigate and prosecute any state or local official” who flouts federal statutes or directs or conspires with others to violate them.

The deputy AG further ordered the California officials to “preserve all written and electronic communications and records related to any attempts or efforts to impede or obstruct federal law enforcement officials.”

“We urge you and other California officials to publicly abandon this apparent criminal conspiracy, to stop threatening law enforcement, and to prioritize the safety of your citizens,” Blanche continued. “In the meantime, federal agents and officers will continue to enforce federal law and will not be deterred by the threat of arrest by California authorities who have abdicated their duty to protect their constituents.”

Amid reports of ICE raids planned for the Bay Area, Pelosi and Rep. Kevin Mullin (D-Calif.) issued a joint statement claiming that California law “prevents federal agents from taking certain actions.”

“While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not,” the lawmakers wrote. “ Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.”

This submission focuses on the health impacts of air pollution caused by fossil fuels, drawing on HRW’s recent research and advocacy on environmental issues. In particular, it draws out findings and lessons from our work on fossil fuel production (e.g. refining) and use (e.g. coal-fired power plants) across a variety of locations in countries: the United States, Türkiye, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The findings summarized in this brief illustrate a consistent human rights impact: fossil fuel production, combustion and processing are a major source of deadly air pollution that seriously harms health—causing respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases and premature deaths, particularly among children, older people and people with pre‑existing health conditions.

Our research further shows that regulatory agencies frequently fail to monitor or enforce air quality standards, to the detriment of public health and in some cases, in violation of the right to health information. The people living in and around oil, gas, and coal extraction sites, refineries, power plants, and pipelines often have extremely limited means to protect their health from the devastating impacts of toxic air pollution.

After briefly summarizing our research findings, HRW respectfully offers recommendations for tackling these challenges and strengthening air quality protections in line with human rights obligations.

Weak or unenforced regulations

HRW research has identified that governments often fail to adopt and implement comprehensive pollutant limits consistent with the World Health Organization’s (WHO) 2021 Air Quality Guidelines. This includes standards for fine particulate matter (PM2.5), responsible for the most deaths worldwide from any air pollutant, according to the Health Effects Institute (HEI) and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW documented that enforcement of air quality standards is poor. HRW found that although air quality standards were generally in line with EU standards (although less robust than WHO guidelines), local officials tasked with various aspects of air quality management said they weren’t enforced. Likewise, between 2018 and 2022 the state breached Energy Community Treaty standards on emissions (for PM2.5, NOx, and SO2) from prescribed coal-fired power plants. In 2020 the plants were emitting almost 10 times as much SO2 as permitted by the treaty. The country had one of the world’s highest mortality rates from air pollution, according to WHO data.

A 2023 HRW investigation into the toxic air pollution caused by expanding fossil fuel operations in the UAE found that PM2.5 concentrations have been consistently above WHO-recommended levels. HRW also analyzed the annual PM10 concentrations from 2018 to 2022 throughout the country, finding that the average of all the stations in 2022 was more than eight times the yearly WHO recommendation. Based on WHO estimates of the death rate attributable to outdoor air pollution, 1,872 people died from air pollution-related illnesses in the UAE in 2019. While the government recognizes the problem of air pollution, its current air-quality standards are much weaker than what the WHO recommends. For instance, the UAE lacks regulatory limits on PM 2.5 (daily and annual), PM10 (annual), NO2 (annual).

In Türkiye (2024), HRW found that air quality standards are less strict than those recommended by WHO and do not include a limit for PM2.5, leaving a major regulatory gap. By early 2024 Türkiye had become Europe’s largest coal-fired electricity producer , accounting for 73 percent of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and certain coal projects that are planned (and seeking approvals and financing) but not yet built. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, more than 35,000 people died from air pollution-related illnesses in 2019 in Türkiye.

Flawed environmental impact assessments

Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are a critical tool to determine a proposed activity or project’s possible impact on air quality and the health of fenceline communities. Inadequate EIAs allow polluting activities to be approved despite known risks to human health.

Successive Turkish governments have built and expanded two of the country’s biggest coal power plants, plants A and B, in Afşin-Elbistan. HRW found that air pollution levels near plant A – and the later-built plant B two kilometers away – are dangerously high and that residents are experiencing health conditions that academic studies have attributed to air pollution from the plants. Despite this, Turkish authorities were presented with an EIA that gave the go-ahead for the expansion of plant A, which is projected to lead to an estimated 1,900 premature deaths over its 30-year economic lifespan. HRW found the EIA failed to meet national and international standards.

Specifically, HRW found that the EIA: (i) lacked an adequate assessment of baseline air quality which fails to integrate the existing air pollution problem of the region, (ii) ignored the impact of air pollution on human health; (iii) failed to adequately evaluate the worst-case scenario as technological deficiencies of the Afşin Elbistan A Plant were not taken into account; (iv) lacked a cumulative impact assessment based on the planned projects and relevant existing industrial installations; and (v) failed to respect consultation and participation rights. In 2025, authorities approved the Afşin-Elbistan plant’s expansion.

Disproportionate health impacts on marginalized populations

HRW research on the health impacts of the fossil fuel industry has identified that, in many cases, polluting facilities are located within or near marginalized communities, compounding existing inequalities and exposing residents to greater health risks. A defining feature of the fossil fuel industry is its tendency to produce sacrifice zones - places where residents suffer devastating physical and mental health consequences that violate their human rights as a result of living in pollution hotspots and heavily contaminated areas.

In the UAE (2023), HRW found that migrant workers—comprising 88% of the population—face severe health impacts from toxic air pollution. Migrant workers, including low-wage workers engaged in outdoor work, described a myriad of health problems that they believe could be related to the toxic air they are breathing: respiratory ailments, skin problems, eye problems, dizziness, cardiovascular diseases, and allergies. In the UAE, people with certain health conditions such as asthma, pregnant women and other people, children, older people, people with disabilities, migrant workers especially those working outdoors, people living in poverty and other socially and economically marginalized populations are more likely to be exposed to or adversely impacted by harmful air pollution.

In the US state of Louisiana (2024), HRW found that residents of the predominantly Black and low-income region known as “Cancer Alley” suffer elevated rates of cancer, reproductive, and respiratory illnesses linked to emissions from fossil fuel and petrochemical operations. Many of the residents of Cancer Alley Human Rights Watch interviewed experienced maternal, reproductive, and newborn health harms. Virtually all could name immediate family members, friends or neighbors who had experienced such harms, including low-birth weight, preterm birth, miscarriage, stillbirths, high risk pregnancy and birth, and infertility. Yet expansion is underway with at least 19 new fossil fuel and petrochemical plants planned at Cancer Alley, including within many of the same predominantly Black and poor communities.

Poor air quality monitoring

Air monitoring is essential for assessing air quality and preventing harmful pollution. When monitoring is lacking or is incomplete, people’s health is put at considerable risk. HRW has identified significant gaps in pollutant monitoring at or nearby fossil fuel and petrochemical facilities.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW showed that air pollution monitoring stations are often not working or unavailable. Local government officials, particularly outside of Sarajevo, reported having insufficient budgets and a shortage of adequately trained personnel to maintain monitoring stations and report data. The country’s 17 air pollution monitoring stations sometimes are out of service, particularly in Republika Srpska, and many do not adequately monitor PM2.5.

In the UAE (2023), HRW found major inconsistencies and data gaps in official air quality monitoring networks. Although some data from monitoring stations across the country is shared, key pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are sometimes missing from public datasets. The available data is also dispersed across multiple platforms and applications that display inconsistent totals for the number of monitoring stations. Moreover, while existing air quality websites provide measurements from ground level monitoring stations, some do not measure all relevant pollutants, and the standards displayed are less stringent than WHO recommendations.

In Louisiana, USA (2024), HRW found that petrochemical companies underestimated benzene emissions from their operations by up to 28 times. Since 2018, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has required oil refineries to install fenceline monitors to measure benzene levels at their perimeters, where emissions can reach nearby communities. However, out of thousands of petrochemical plants nationwide, only 13 have been required to install similar monitors under federal action. Of these, only four have provided enough data for analysis, revealing two plants, including one located in Cancer Alley, with benzene concentrations exceeding EPA regulatory limits.

In Türkiye (2024), HRW found that the number of monitoring stations remains insufficient. While the Turkish government’s air quality monitoring website provides measurements from ground level monitoring stations across the country, the historic data is at times incomplete and pollution hotspots like Afşin-Elbistan are not closely monitored. According to 2016-2019 data analysis, conditions in at least 21 of 81 provinces could not be adequately assessed because data was available for fewer than 75 percent of days. These shortcomings prevent the Turkish government from reliably monitoring the impact of coal-fired power plants on air quality.

Limited availability of air quality information

Access to information about environmental and health risks and impacts associated with a proposed activity or project is a key component of the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. HRW has documented numerous cases in which governments have failed to identify or disclose the air pollution risks posed by the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, thereby threatening the human rights of nearby communities.

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (2022), HRW reported that while major polluters are legally required to submit air quality data to the government, this information is not made public. Warnings to avoid outdoor activities or to limit vehicular transport on days with poor air quality were largely limited to the capital, Sarajevo. In the absence of adequate government monitoring and communication, a series of citizen-run sensors fill the gap - young people said they regularly use apps or websites that report on air quality, some of them operated by civil society. Others receive air quality updates from television and radio, while others, particularly older people, say they assess air quality based on the smell or the appearance of the air, neither of which is appropriate to determine the extent of air pollution or assess health risks.

In the UAE (2023), HRW documented a dearth of public information about the impacts of air pollution, its sources, and how at-risk populations can protect themselves. The UAE government acknowledged that “[t]here is currently no system to warn the public about inevitable high-level pollution episodes (for example, dust storms) and to provide guidance on how to reduce personal exposure to pollution,” yet it has done little to address these gaps. Migrant workers told HRW that they had no information about the risks of air pollution, its sources, who is most impacted, and how they can protect themselves. Existing air quality websites did not provide practical advice on protection measures and lacked detailed information for at-risk groups. They only exist in Arabic and English and are not accessible to migrant workers who may not speak either of these languages; information is not available in accessible formats.

In Louisiana (2024), HRW found that residents’ complaints to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) went unanswered. When residents have questions or concerns about industrial operations, they are instructed to contact the LDEQ. However, instead of serving as a trusted source of information, the agency has become a source of profound frustration for many. The lack of information and action has led many residents to stop contacting the agency altogether.

In Türkiye (2024), HRW noted that emissions from large combustion plants, including coal plants, are not publicly available. Even when courts have ordered the government to provide emissions data of coal plants publicly, the authorities have not revealed the data. Residents in Çoğulhan, Berçenek, and Altunelma, said they have not received any information about the extent of environmental problems in the region, possible health effects, or how to participate in decisions around the coal plant that would enable them to address or prevent health risks and seek remediation for health harms. The Environment Ministry provides some health advice via a website, such as suggesting that members of sensitive groups limit outdoor activities when air pollution levels are high, but it does not provide detailed practical advice for at-risk groups.

Recommendations

As a guiding principle, States should implement moratoria on new or expanded fossil fuel operations and begin phase-out of existing operations. In addition, we recommend the following:

Regulation and enforcement

Order an immediate pause of all fossil fuel and petrochemical operations that pose an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health and the environment until they operate in accordance with relevant legal protections.

Develop and enforce stringent regulations to limit air pollution related to fossil fuel and petrochemical operations, including through legally binding pollutant limits on particulate matter (PM 2.5 ​ and PM 10), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2​), and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions in line with the WHO’s 2021 Air Quality Guidelines. Regulations should also seek a phase-out of venting and flaring of methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas and air pollutant.

Mandate science-based buffer zones separating fossil fuel and petrochemical operations from residential, educational, and recreational areas. As a guiding principle, communities should not be relocated to allow for industry expansion or continued operation. On the contrary, states should prioritize decommissioning and or relocating life-threatening facilities away from where people live, work, learn and play.

Environmental impact assessments

Deny permits for fossil fuel and petrochemical operations that would result in a disproportionate burden of harm in already overburdened communities.

Require EIAs to include air quality and health impact assessments for all fossil fuel and petrochemical projects, including short and long-term health risks from exposure to PM 2.5, PM10, NOX, SO2, CH4 and other pollutants.

Require comprehensive baseline and cumulative air quality assessments, considering existing and planned industrial installations.

Ensure affected individuals and communities can meaningfully participate in the EIA process.

In Trump v. Illinois, the Supreme Court will soon decide whether to issue a stay of a district court’s injunction of the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago. The government’s brief argues there is “no reason to believe that courts can, or should, second guess the President’s conclusion” that military force is needed to suppress an emergency. “[T]his case,” the brief argues, falls in the heartland of unreviewable presidential “discretion.” Even if judicial review is permissible, the government says, a court must be “highly deferential” to the President’s decision.

The Government’s position cannot withstand even rudimentary analysis. This is because the president’s authority is dramatically weaker when deploying troops domestically than it is when fighting enemies overseas.

Power Over the Military is not Exclusive to the President

The government’s interpretation suggests that a president may deploy military forces anywhere in the United States for any reason, and that courts would have no authority to determine its legality. This assertion runs counter to U.S. history, the structure of powers related to the military in the U.S. Constitution, and the theory of checks and balances.

The Framers and the generation that fought the American Revolution were well aware of the dangers of domestic use of the military. Among the grievances enumerated in the Declaration of Independence, abuse of the military was persistent theme: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our Legislature,” and “He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.” The Third Amendment to the Constitution reflects these concerns in its prohibition on quartering soldiers in civilian homes during times of peace without legislation.

For this and other reasons, the Framers wisely disaggregated the military power horizontally across the three branches of the federal government, as well as vertically between the states and the federal government. They gave Congress the unique power to declare war and appropriate funds for military exploits, along with a series of other war-related powers. They gave the executive branch the authority to command troops in battle. They gave the judiciary the ability to arbitrate disputes among the branches and to protect individual rights. They left to the various states the power to call forth a militia to protect the people within their particular jurisdictions.

In addition to the structural constitutional dissipation of control over the military, statutes like the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act forbid the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Congress similarly banned the use of troops at polls around the same time. Even the Insurrection Act, which champions of presidential power cite as an ace-up-the-president’s sleeve, says that the president’s power to use the militia or armed forces is, among other purposes, to protect against the deprivation “of a right, privilege, immunity or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law” when the state is unable to protect such rights of the people (emphasis added).

In other words, the power of the president to use the military in times of emergency is arguably tethered to the need to protect the constitutional rights of the people. This is consistent with the president’s articulated duty under Article II of the Constitution to “take care that the laws are faithfully executed.”

No Cause for Deference

The claim of extreme judicial deference to the president rests on a false equivalence of foreign and domestic use of the military. There is plenty of case law that supports broad deference for presidential determinations regarding foreign troop deployments. Of course, federal judges have been reluctant in our more recent history to second guess the decision to use the military to defend the United States against foreign enemies, or to micromanage tactical decisions during the course of a war. But when the president seeks to deploy the U.S. armed forces into American streets, the constitutional rights of Americans are potentially under threat, and courts are therefore duty-bound to exercise the utmost vigilance.

It is no accident that President Donald Trump is sending military forces into places in which there are some displays of opposition to his policies, based on an unsubstantiated and politically-motivated claim that these pose a threat to the country. It is no coincidence that in the midst of these deployments, he summoned every U.S. General from around the world to Washington to inform them that they need to focus on “the enemy within,” and urged them to use American cities as training grounds for the use of military force.

History tells us that deploying the military against one’s own people is the sine qua non of an authoritarian state, and represents the corruption of the military to solidify power. Be it Jews or other religious minorities, immigrants, infidels, suspected criminals, or alleged traitors, the “strong” leader convinces the population that these “others” are the true threat to national security and that therefore a military response is needed. Extreme deference to the president’s domestic use of the military abdicates the fundamental duty of courts to closely examine threats to fundamental constitutional rights of free speech and assembly that are the bedrock of a democracy.

The United States military swears an oath of allegiance to the Constitution. The oath of office of military officers, unlike that of enlisted servicemembers, contains no explicit commitment to follow presidential orders. Following military orders is obligatory, but only insofar as such orders are lawful. The same was true in Nazi Germany until August 2, 1934, when, following the death of President Paul von Hindenburg, the oath to follow the Weimar Constitution was replaced with an oath of allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Following that date, the German military was under the control of the Führer, sealing the death of German democracy until well after the end of the Second World War. More recently, two weeks ago in Madagascar, the civilian government was toppled by a military coup, the latest in a series of African countries to lose civilian control of the government—including military takeovers in Mali, Niger, Chad, Sudan, and Burkina Faso, not to mention those in other regions, including Myanmar.

If the Supreme Court decides to grant certiorari in the Illinois case or in a similar case involving use of the National Guard, such as the Oregon or California cases, the question of deference to presidential authority as Commander-in-Chief will be front and center. The government will once again argue that there is no basis for federal courts to second-guess presidential decisions regarding the deployment of U.S. troops, and that under Article II such second-guessing would be a violation of the separation of powers. Yet this appeal to presidential deference would ignore the basic distribution of military powers in both constitutional and statutory form that has existed for the entirety of U.S. history.

No case holds that the courts are powerless to prevent an illegal deployment of troops within the United States. How could it? Such a holding would render separation of powers meaningless and destroy the judiciary’s role as a bulwark against tyranny. The Court must remember its statement from 1972 in Laird v. Tatum:

“[T]here is nothing in our Nation’s history or in this Court’s decided cases… that can properly be seen as giving any indication that actual or threatened injury by reason of unlawful activities of the military would go unnoticed or unremedied.”

Military rule and military coups have been fanciful, far-off threats in the United States, but President Trump has now made this threat real in his war against “the enemy within.” The Supreme Court must not shirk its obligation to ensure that presidents cannot conscript the military in an effort to undermine democracy.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2239825286.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 13:16:57.569850

In a recent case addressing sovereign immunity for Native American tribes, Washington Supreme Court Justice Sal Mungia issued an unusual concurrence: He agreed with the state high court’s legal ruling that, under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the Stillaguamish tribe is immune from a lawsuit over land ownership. “But I dissent,” he wrote in Flying T Ranch v. Stillaguamish, “from the racism embedded in the federal case law that applies to this dispute.”

Mungia’s concurrence lays out the racist stereotypes rooted in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court rulings cited by the Washington high court. In these 19th-century cases, justices described Native Americans as “low in the grade of organized society” and with a “savage nature.” These cases, Mungia argued, were based on racist premises.

Mungia’s concurrence was striking not only for pointing out the prejudices baked into long-standing precedents, but also for how it engaged with his role as a state court judge in our federal system. Mungia acknowledged that the Washington Supreme Court is bound to follow U.S. Supreme Court precedents. However, “we are not bound to stay silent as to the underlying racism and prejudices that are woven into the very fabric of those opinions,” he argued. He called on his colleagues to “clearly, loudly, and unequivocally state that was ‘wrong.’”

While the cases Mungia condemns are more than a century old, state judges have also sharply critiqued some contemporary U.S. Supreme Court decisions as resting on their own illegitimate bases. Last month, for example, Justice Todd Eddins of the Hawaii Supreme Court pointed to recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings, including on its shadow docket, as reflecting a “throw-judges-under-the-bus disdain for district courts, the fact-finders of the federal judiciary.” Looking at the high court’s Establishment Clause jurisprudence, Eddins argued in his Hilo Bay Marina v. Hawaii concurrence that the justices had “repackaged and whitewashed facts to achieve a desired outcome” and imposed policy preferences by “unprincipled fiat.”

When it comes to critiquing the U.S. Supreme Court, state supreme court justices enjoy a unique institutional posture: Like all judges, they can speak to the reality of having to apply problematic precedents, but they also sit outside the federal judicial hierarchy that often leads lower court judges to bite their tongues. Notably, while federal judges have increasingly spoken up to criticize the Court’s use of the shadow docket in litigation involving the Trump administration — which is highly unusual in itself — they’ve largely done so anonymously.

State supreme court justices are also in a special position because they sit atop state judiciaries as the ultimate word in interpreting state laws. This means that within their own sphere, they can model an alternative to the Court in how they interpret, apply, and grapple with their states’ constitutions, laws, and precedents. Eddins, for example, observed that when it comes to interpreting his state’s constitution, he treats recent Supreme Court jurisprudence as “white noise.” And as Mungia notes, the Washington Supreme Court has previously repudiated some of its own prior decisions that “disregarded the rights of Native Americans and their treaty rights.”

Historically, controversial Supreme Court decisions weren’t the end of the conversation about the meaning of the U.S. Constitution and other federal laws. Cases like Lochner v. New York, which invalidated labor protections as inconsistent with the right to freedom of contract, were just the beginning of dialogue — and sometimes conflict, between the Supreme Court and Congress, the states, and other institutional actors. Today’s state court opinions may signal a new generation of contestation.

This comes as 41 aid organizations, including Oxfam and the Norwegian Refugee Council, have published an open letter accusing Israel of “arbitrarily” rejecting aid deliveries into Gaza. The letter says, “Aid denied by Israeli authorities includes tents and tarpaulins, blankets, mattresses, food and nutrition supplies, hygiene kits, sanitation materials, assistive devices, and children’s clothing, all of which should be unrestricted during the ceasefire.” The World Food Programme warned it was falling short of its target of sending 2,000 tons of food into Gaza. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization described Gaza’s starvation crisis as “catastrophic.”

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: “There is increase in amount after the ceasefire, but what is entering Gaza is significantly below the required target. Significantly below the required target. And that I also can explain the second — can be an answer to the second question: Is there a dent in hunger level? So, if the Gaza that — if the aid that’s entering Gaza is significantly low, it cannot dent the hunger level. And the situation still remains catastrophic, because what’s entering is not enough.”

In Israel, Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with senior Israeli army officials and held a news conference in Kiryat Gat, the site of a new international command center with troops from the U.S., U.K., Jordan and the UAE. Rubio said that the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, known as UNRWA, cannot have a role in the Gaza Strip; Rubio called it a “subsidiary of Hamas.” Since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire came into effect on October 10, Israel has killed nearly 100 Palestinians and wounded 230 in Gaza.

President Trump responded Thursday to the Israeli Knesset’s vote advancing legislation that would annex the occupied West Bank.

President Donald Trump: “The West Bank is — don’t worry about the West Bank. Israel’s not going to do anything with the West Bank, OK? Don’t worry about it. Is that your question? They’re not going to do anything with the West Bank. Don’t worry about it. Israel’s doing very well. They’re not going to do anything with it.”

This follows a Time magazine interview in which Trump firmly opposed Israeli annexation, saying, “It won’t happen because I gave my word to the Arab countries. Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened.” Separately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called annexation in the West Bank a “threat to the peace process.”

Meanwhile, Al Jazeera is reporting that a child has died after being wounded by Israeli forces during a raid in Nablus. UNRWA reports more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in settler and Israeli army attacks in the occupied West Bank since October 7, 2023. We’ll have more on this story later in the broadcast.

Members of the Israeli opposition are slamming far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich for his “harmful” comments about Saudi Arabia. Smotrich resorted to stereotypes when he said he wouldn’t agree to a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia if it required Israel to recognize a Palestinian state.

Bezalel Smotrich: “If Saudi Arabia says to us 'normalization in exchange for a Palestinian state,' friend, no, thank you. Continue riding camels on the sand in the desert. And Saudi Arabia, we will continue to develop, really, with economy and society and state and all the great and wonderful things that we know how to do.”

Smotrich has since apologized for his comments. This comes as President Trump is set to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next month. It will be the Saudi crown prince’s first visit to the U.S. since the 2018 murder of columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

President Trump asserted Thursday that he had the authority to continue to launch airstrikes against alleged drug boats in international waters without a congressional declaration of war. Since September, the Pentagon says it’s struck nine alleged drug boats, killing 37 people.

President Donald Trump: “Well, I don’t think we’re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war. I think we’re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK? We’re going to kill them. You know? They’re going to be, like, dead. OK.”

Trump also denied reports by The Wall Street Journal that the U.S. is sending B-1 bombers near Venezuela. Meanwhile, Venezuela’s Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López announced he’s deploying armed forces along the country’s coastline.

Vladimir Padrino López: “No attempt to destabilize the Venezuelan nation will pass through here. They may send however many CIA-affiliated units in covert operations from any flank of the nation, and any attempt will fail, as they have failed so far.”

President Trump says he’s suspended trade talks with Canada over an advertisement produced by the government of Ontario that criticizes tariffs. The ad features excerpts of a 1987 address by then-President Ronald Reagan warning of the dire consequences of high tariffs, like the 35% tariff Trump has imposed on most Canadian goods not covered under a trade agreement.

President Ronald Reagan: “High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars. Then the worst happens. Markets shrink and collapse. Businesses and industries shut down, and millions of people lose their jobs.”

In a social media post, Trump lashed out at the one-minute ad, calling it ”FAKE,” writing, “Based on their egregious behavior, ALL TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADA ARE HEREBY TERMINATED.”

The federal government shutdown has entered its 24th day. It’s now the second longest in U.S. history, rivaled only by the 2018-2019 shutdown during Trump’s first term. On Thursday, the Senate rejected competing partisan bills to compensate some federal workers who’ve gone without pay since early October.

This comes as at least 36 states are warning they’re preparing to suspend November payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities warns that would leave about one out of every eight people in the U.S. without food assistance, including some 16 million children, 8 million older adults and 4 million people with disabilities.

The Trump administration finalized plans Thursday to open more than a million-and-a-half acres of Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. The Interior Department also announced the first oil and gas lease sale with the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska since 2019, and it approved a more than 200-mile industrial road through Alaska’s Izembek National Wildlife Refuge.

Environmentalists condemned the announcements. In a statement, the Alaska Wilderness League wrote, “Opening the entire coastal plain of the Arctic refuge to drilling would destroy one of the most ecologically significant landscapes on earth — the birthing grounds of the porcupine caribou herd, vital habitat for polar bears and migratory birds, and sacred land for the Gwich’in people who have stewarded its resources for millennia.”

President Trump on Thursday pardoned the convicted founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Changpeng Zhao pleaded guilty in 2023 to enabling money laundering while he was CEO of Binance. According to The Wall Street Journal, Binance struck a business deal with World Liberty Financial, the Trump family’s crypto startup, which has generated $4.5 billion since Trump returned to office. Binance also reportedly hired lobbyist Charles McDowell, who is a close friend of Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. Republican Senator Thom Tillis blasted the pardon, saying it sends “a bad signal.” When asked about Zhao’s pardon, President Trump said, “I don’t know, he was recommended by a lot of people.”

The Trump administration has released a list of wealthy donors and corporations funding President Trump’s $300 million construction of a 90,000-square-foot ballroom at the White House. Among the donors are Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Palantir, Lockheed Martin and more. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is contributing $22 million, after settling a lawsuit Trump filed against YouTube for banning him from the platform after he incited his followers to attack the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

On Thursday, the Secret Service shut off public access to the Ellipse, a public park adjacent to the White House and one of the only spots to view the demolition. Photos show the entire East Wing has been knocked down.

President Trump says he’s canceled plans to send federal forces into San Francisco. On Thursday, Trump wrote on social media that he’d been talked out his plans for what he called a “surge” after he spoke with his “friends” — the CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, and the CEO of Salesforce, Marc Benioff. Trump’s sudden reversal came as protesters rallied outside a U.S. Coast Guard base on the San Francisco Bay, where more than 100 federal agents were reportedly preparing to ramp up immigration raids. Police used flash-bang grenades to drive protesters away from an entrance as Customs and Border Patrol vehicles drove through. Separately, city officials joined protests at San Francisco City Hall. This is Laura Valdez, director of Mission Action, which works on behalf of low-income and immigrant communities.

Laura Valdez: “Please remember that this might be the start of mass enforcement in our communities, and we need to prepare adequately. And even if it is not the start, we still need to be prepared. And this community is here to back you up.”

Meanwhile, former House speaker and longtime San Francisco Congressmember Nancy Pelosi is warning federal agents they could face arrest by local police if they break California law while carrying out immigration sweeps. In a statement, Pelosi wrote, “While the President may enjoy absolute immunity courtesy of his rogue Supreme Court, those who operate under his orders do not. Our state and local authorities may arrest federal agents if they break California law — and if they are convicted, the President cannot pardon them.” In response, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche wrote on X, “Stand down or face prosecution.

The wait is over. The Texas Supreme Court recently finalized amendments to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 201, implementing the Uniform Interstate Depositions and Discovery Act (“UIDDA”).[1] The amendments took effect August 31, 2025, marking a shift in how parties conduct interstate discovery involving Texas witnesses.

By adopting the UIDDA, Texas has joined the overwhelming majority of states in streamlining interstate discovery. Massachusetts, Missouri, and New Hampshire remain the only states that have yet to adopt some version of the UIDDA, leaving them as outliers in an otherwise uniform national system.

What Changed

For decades, attorneys seeking evidence in Texas for an out-of-state proceeding were first required to obtain a “mandate, writ, or commission” from the court where the lawsuit was pending. This process was cumbersome because it involved unnecessary delays and expenses.

Now, under Rule 201.3, a party simply submits an out-of-state subpoena to a court clerk in the Texas county where discovery is sought. The clerk must then promptly issue an equivalent Texas subpoena incorporating the same terms—with no judicial stamp of approval required.

The new rule applies to subpoenas requiring witnesses to:

Attend and give testimony at depositions (oral examination or written questions); or

Produce documents or tangible things.

Importantly, this request does not constitute an appearance in Texas courts, which means out-of-state attorneys can obtain subpoenas without needing to be licensed in Texas, seek pro hac vice admission, or hire local counsel to issue and serve the subpoena.

Once issued, the Texas subpoena must be served according to Texas Rules of Civil Procedure 176 and 205. From there, Texas law controls. Any discovery disputes, whether concerning protective orders or enforcement, get resolved in Texas courts.

One Key Limitation: Property Inspections

Texas’s version of the UIDDA, however, includes a notable exception that prevents clerks from issuing subpoenas for premises inspections. Litigants will still need a court order for subpoenas seeking inspection of property. Rule 201.3 covers testimony and documents, while carving out and preserving Texas’s traditional requirement for judicial oversight of property inspections.

Why This Matters

The new rule simplifies interstate discovery by eliminating jurisdictional hurdles, reducing costs, and accelerating the discovery process. By directing clerks to act “promptly” and without the need for judicial intervention, the UIDDA framework removes delays that previously plagued litigation across state lines. This change benefits both out-of-state parties seeking discovery in Texas and Texas litigants conducting discovery in other UIDDA states that require reciprocity.

Companies with employees, documents, or operations in Texas can expect to see an increase in out-of-state discovery requests, as the process is now more efficient for parties in litigation elsewhere to obtain testimony and documents from Texas witnesses. Businesses should review their document retention policies and ensure employees understand their potential obligations when served with out-of-state subpoenas.

[1] On June 11, 2023, the Texas Legislature passed H.B. 3929, directing the Texas Supreme Court to consider adopting the UIDDA before September 1, 2025. Tex. HB 3929, 88th Leg., R.S. (2023).

Angelou recalls someone exclaiming, “‘This ain’t no United Nations.","The 80th anniversary session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York began in September 2025 under the theme, “Better together: 80 years and more for peace, development and human rights.” This theme likely does not resonate in South America and the Caribbean as the United States extrajudicially kills civilians from the region on fishing boats in international waters, in violation of the use of force rules of the U.N. Charter. The U.N. has urged restraint while the United States claims the laws of war apply and summarily executes people without trial for unsubstantiated allegations of drug trafficking. “Better together” likely also comes across as empty rhetoric in Sudan, which currently faces the largest humanitarian crisis since recordkeeping began, where the U.N. has been engaged in longstanding conflict resolution efforts.

Additionally, the anniversary theme most certainly falls flat in Haiti, given the U.N.’s shameful history there. In 2010, peacekeepers charged with protecting Haitians were responsible for a deadly cholera epidemic which resulted in 800,000 cases and killed an estimated 10,000 Haitians. Despite Haiti having no history of cholera outbreaks, the U.N. took years to admit its role and did not provide effective remedy. Peacekeepers in Haiti also committed widespread rape, sexual abuse, and sexual exploitation of women and children without redress. One survivor surmised, “As far as the U.N. goes, they came here to protect us, but all they’ve brought is destruction.”

In too many instances, the U.N. has largely functioned to preserve unjust global power dynamics. At the time of its founding in 1945, racial apartheid remained a brutal reality and approximately 750 million people were subject to colonial domination and rule. The U.N. continues to institutionalize this hierarchy; as South African President Cyril Ramaphosa recently commented: “Five permanent members effectively make decisions on behalf of more than 85% of the world’s population living in countries of the Global South.”

Recalling the 1960 coup in the Republic of the Congo (now Democratic Republic of Congo), and a subsequent protest at the U.N. offers a window to see the U.N.’s malignant neglect more clearly.

Coup in the Congo

Amidst the wave of decolonization in Africa following World War II, the Belgian government planned to formally grant independence to Congo, while neo-colonially governing key areas. Belgium desired to maintain control of Congo’s vast mineral riches. Today, for example, Congo holds half the world’s reserve of cobalt, used in batteries for cell phones, cars, computers, and other electronics. During the handover ceremony in June 1960, newly elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba forcefully asserted independence, declaring, “We who suffered in our bodies and hearts from colonialist oppression, we say to you out loud: from now on, all that is over.” But following almost a century of colonization, the road ahead was not easy.

On July 5, 1960, Congolese rank-and-file soldiers mutinied in response to Belgian military officials proclaiming, “Before independence = after independence.” The soldiers were disgruntled by lack of leadership changes and wanted higher wages. Sensing an opportunity, Belgium immediately reasserted power. With Belgian support, the mineral-rich province of Katanga seceded, with Moïse Tshombe as nominal leader. Both feared the central government’s encroachment on lucrative mining profits, which provided 60 percent of the country’s income.

To respond to the secession, Lumumba traveled to the United States to request assistance from it and the U.N. While in New York, Lumumba met with the activist and writer Rosa Guy, founding member of the Harlem Writers Guild. The United States rebuffed Lumumba, and while the U.N. assembled a large peacekeeping force, Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld refused to allow U.N. forces to intervene in Katanga. Making matters worse, when he later visited the country, Hammarskjöld declined to meet with Lumumba, heading instead to see Tshombe and seemingly granting him legitimacy. Guy lobbied informally to member States of the U.N. that they should continue to recognize Lumumba as Congo’s legitimately elected prime minister.

Simultaneously, Lumumba faced prospects of a secession from the mineral-heavy province of South Kassai. Consequently, he approved army chief Joseph Desiré Mobutu’s plan to lead an attack on the province. Congolese troops subsequently rampaged, resulting in massive killings and alienating many from Lumumba’s government.

With few options left, Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for military aid. The Soviets agreed, incensing the United States, given their Cold War rivalry. In August 1960, the U.S. government authorized a clandestine scheme to “replace the Lumumba Government by constitutional means.” The U.S. ambassador advised President Joseph Kasavubu to buy votes in parliament prior to a no-confidence vote against Lumumba. Though Kasavubu did not follow the advice and lost the vote, on Sept. 5, 1960, he nevertheless announced Lumumba’s dismissal on the radio.

Over cables, Hammarskjöld indicated that the U.N. had no issues with Lumumba’s illegal removal from power. U.N. officials in Congo even attempted to stop Lumumba from challenging his purported dismissal, though he eventually did so on the radio.

By Sept. 14, 1960, the CIA’s principal agent and Lumumba’s erstwhile confidante Mobutu, spearheaded a military coup. Conor Cruise O’Brien, a U.N. official in charge of operations in Congo, remarked that the U.N. displayed a concern for legalism “when it was a question of rescuing Lumumba which was quite absent from their very uninhibited phase of activity when it was a question of bringing about Lumumba’s political destruction.”

On Jan. 17, 1961, the day of Lumumba’s assassination, Mobutu delivered Lumumba to Tshombe, Belgian officials, and mercenaries who beat him bloody. Stuart Reid, a history and foreign policy writer, gruesomely details how Katanga’s Belgian police commissioner and the police commissioner’s brother used sulfuric acid, turning Lumumba “into a mass of mucus.” When the acid finished, only Lumumba’s bones and teeth remained. Reid recounts how the Belgians twisted teeth out of Lumumba’s skull with pliers. They then set the remaining parts of Lumumba aflame. The CIA has since acknowledged its involvement in Lumumba’s demise and claims that the U.N. and Belgium played “equally important roles.”

A Demonstration at the U.N.

Lumumba’s execution was met with grief and despair within Congo and beyond. Across the Atlantic, as part of the Black freedom movement, activists and writers Maya Angelou and Rosa Guy, along with jazz great Abbey Lincoln had previously created the Cultural Association for Women of African Heritage (CAWAH), an organization of artists dedicated to supporting the movement. Following Lumumba’s murder, Congolese diplomats informed Guy, who shared the devastating news with Angelou. Angelou wrote of her profound experience in her autobiography, “The Heart of a Woman”: “I knew no words which would match the emptiness of the moment. . . the loss of one hero was a setback of such proportion it could dishearten us and weaken the struggle.”

Guy’s connections with Congolese diplomats tipped them off that Adlai Stevenson, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., was about to announce Lumumba’s murder at the U.N. Following a CAWAH meeting in Harlem, Guy and Angelou stumbled upon Malcom X delivering a speech, which inspired them greatly. Angelou wrote that Guy told her they had “‘to let the Congolese and all the other Africans know that we are with them.’” They convinced some members of CAWAH and the Harlem Writers Guild to join the demonstration. One of Guy’s relatives discouraged her from organizing the protest, declaring, “The United Nations is all the poor countries of this world have…Don’t do anything that might endanger its existence.”

Nevertheless, they persisted. At a bookstore and frequent gathering place in Harlem, Angelou, Guy, and Lincoln informed those in attendance of Lumumba’s execution and the audience responded with disbelief and wailing. Lincoln implicated the Belgians and the Americans. She shared news about their planned demonstration, which included women clipping black mourning veils to their hair, and men wearing black armbands. Lincoln declared, “‘We’re going to stand up and remain standing until they put us out.’” Many in the crowd shouted agreement, “‘See you at the U.N.!’”

They scheduled the demonstration for Feb. 15, 1961. Members of several Black nationalist groups participated. However, Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam were not involved due to the Nation’s policy of non-engagement, which prevented members from participating in politics and protests. Malcolm X was increasingly frustrated with the Nation being seen as talking tough, but never doing anything.

Angelou writes of her disbelief at the large crowd in front of the Manhattan headquarters of the U.N., with placards proclaiming “‘Freedom Now.’” Many activists were unable to enter the U.N., but sympathetic States provided access to about 75 Black demonstrators.

Inside, the U.N. Security Council was meeting to discuss Lumumba’s murder, and Hammarskjöld was busy protecting his tenure from the Soviet Union’s calls for his resignation. In a searing 1,500-word statement, the Soviets labeled him an accomplice to murder and an imperialist. U.S. Ambassador Stevenson flew to Hammarskjöld’s defense, “Shall the United Nations survive? Shall the attempt to bring about peace by the concerted power of international understanding be discarded?”

During Stevenson’s speech, Angelou writes, a piercing “scream shattered his words.” Other voices joined the bloody shriek:

“Murderers.”

“Lumumba. Lumumba.”

“Killers.”

Angelou did not anticipate a riot at the U.N. She expected “to stand, veiled and mournful.” Yet, she heard her own voice joining the chorus shouting, “Assassins.”

Suddenly, the U.N. was in chaos. Angelou recounts diplomats vanishing as guards quickly escorted activists outside. Demonstrators outside were energized. Angelou recalls someone exclaiming, “‘This ain’t no United Nations. This is just united white folks. Let’s go back in.’” With police preventing re-entry, protestors headed for the Belgian Consulate instead, singing, “‘And before I’ll be a slave, I’ll be buried in my grave.’”

In the aftermath, since Guy and Angelou were originally stirred to action by Malcolm X’s oration, they sought out his belated guidance about what they should do. As one of the most radical leaders in the country, they figured he had to support their action. Instead, Malcolm X told them they were wrong, that “‘going to the United Nations’” would “‘not win freedom for anyone.’” He subsequently issued a statement asserting his and the Nation of Islam’s non-involvement, but pointedly observed that the demonstration at the U.N. was symbolic of Black rage in the United States.

Other commentary quickly followed. The New York Times described the activists as “invading” the Security Council chamber and absurdly declared it “the most violent demonstration inside United Nations headquarters in the world organization’s history.” Ralph Bunche, who became the first Black Nobel Peace laureate in 1950, and was serving as undersecretary of the U.N. at the time of the protest, apologized before the General Assembly, telling delegates that the activists were “misled,” and unrepresentative of the “thinking and conduct” of Black Americans. Some in the Black elite were aligned with Bunche’s distancing remarks. Others, like James Hicks, editor of the New York Amsterdam News, challenged Bunche’s apology for Black grief. This sentiment was echoed in several letters to the editor from Black Americans. Hicks described Lumumba’s assassination as the “international lynching of a black man on the altar of white supremacy” that “was staged before the world under the auspices of the United Nations.”

Conclusion

Notably, the country inspiring the 1960s riot never recovered from the complicity of international actors. Mobutu brutally ruled Congo for 32 years. He enriched himself, acquiring sums estimated at $4 to $5 billion, while the 100 million inhabitants of Congo lived in extreme poverty. Protracted extractivist warfare followed Mobutu’s demise, resulting in the deadliest conflict in the 21st century. Since the 1990s, more than six million people have died, seven million people are internally displaced, while 25 million face starvation in Congo. Hundreds of thousands of women and girls have also been subject to rampant sexual violence. Warring parties as well as U.N. peacekeeping forces are implicated in these wanton abuses. In 2022, more than 60 years after Belgium brutally murdered Lumumba, it finally returned for burial a gold tooth that one of his assailants took as a macabre souvenir.

In Sept. 2025, U.N. General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock, a former German foreign minister, mused, “Our world is in pain…But imagine how much more pain there would be without the United Nations.” The story of the Congo is the story of the U.N. The Congo could not possibly experience more pain than it has amid a constant U.N. presence for the past 65 years, including three different peacekeeping missions, with the last being the most expensive in history. In 2022, profound frustration with the U.N.’s failure to protect civilians led some Congolese to protest calling for the organization’s departure. Perceptions persist that the U.N. does not defend the Congolese and is aligned with foreign actors, reminiscent of earlier concerns expressed in the aftermath of Congo’s independence. If the U.N. is the “life insurance for every country,” as Baerbock asserted, then it’s past time for a radical change in policy.

The historian Brenda Gayle Plummer described the 1960s U.N. protest as a “massive …international outcry against imperialism,” the likes of which had not occurred in the United States since protests against the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in the 1930s. Although relegated to the annals of history, the 1960s demonstration at the U.N. is a powerful reminder of the importance of connecting international freedom struggles with those at home in the United States. Following Malcolm X’s break from the Nation of Islam in 1964, he revised his position on political activism. In a speech in New York on Feb. 16, 1965, he observed that “‘human rights’ is part of the charter of the United Nations.” For Malcolm X, framing issues as human rights violations meant, “you can take your troubles to the World Court. You can take them before the world. And anybody anywhere on this earth can become your ally.” Internationalization could “make the world see that our problem was no longer a Negro problem or an American problem but a human problem. A problem for humanity. And a problem which should be attacked by all elements of humanity.”

We saw echoes of the legacy of the 1960s demonstration last month, as thousands protested outside U.N. headquarters in opposition to Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. When Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the General Assembly inside, hundreds of diplomats in the chamber walked out before his speech.

Mr. Trump has sent federal agents and troops to other cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C., saying the deployments will curb crime and illegal immigration.","Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on Thursday threatened to prosecute California officials who support arresting federal immigration agents, sharpening the standoff between the Trump administration and local leaders.

Mr. Blanche conveyed the warning in a letter a day after several officials in San Francisco, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former speaker, and Brooke Jenkins, the city’s district attorney, said that they might seek to arrest federal agents who break California law during immigration raids.

The suggestion, Ms. Jenkins said, came from seeing agents confronting people in Los Angeles and Chicago. While she did not envision police officers handcuffing federal agents on city streets, she said she would use video footage to identify agents using excessive force and ask a judge for arrest warrants.

Their idea would be to prosecute immigration agents who overstep their authority, for example by using excessive force, state officials said. But the ability of states to arrest federal officers is without much legal precedent.

He also said that the Constitution’s supremacy clause prevents federal officers from being held on a state criminal charge if the alleged crime occurred while the officer was performing federal duties.

“The Department of Justice will investigate and prosecute any state or local official who violates these federal statutes,” he wrote, “or directs or conspires with others to violate them.”

He concluded that “federal agents and officers will continue to enforce federal law and will not be deterred by the threat of arrest by California authorities.”

The Trump administration had said on Wednesday that it was sending U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents to Alameda, Calif., to prepare for an operation in the San Francisco Bay Area. President Trump on Thursday called off the crackdown in the city, though it was unclear what that meant for the rest of the Bay Area.

Mr. Trump has sent federal agents and troops to other cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Memphis, Portland, Ore., and Washington, D.C., saying the deployments will curb crime and illegal immigration. Critics have said that he is using them to punish Democratic-led cities and spread fear in immigrant communities.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/24/multimedia/24xp-feds-mhgb/24xp-feds-mhgb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:11.508725

Recipients must not “leak or otherwise publicize the existence of” any federal immigration enforcement operations.
By September, US District Court Judge William Smith ruled that the conditions FEMA imposed on funding were “arbitrary and capricious.” He further stated that DHS failed to provide genuine, fact-based justifications for implementing broad immigration conditions across all grants.
The Trump administration’s persistent effort to add immigration strings to FEMA funding feels like a “poison pill” move, especially since Trump has openly discussed shifting responsibility for disaster aid to the states.
One simple step would be to streamline the Stafford Act to remove vagueness that allows presidents to decline disaster aid on a whim.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to attach conditions to federal disaster assistance grants that require recipients to comply with federal immigration law, hampering the ability of states and localities to prepare for disasters.

In January, Trump issued Executive Order 14159 calling for DHS to “undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem issued a memorandum in February, directing sub-agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to scrutinize all federal financial assistance awards. The purpose was to identify funds allocated to sanctuary jurisdictions and to report on compliance within 30 days. By March, FEMA had added language to its grants requiring state and local recipients to confirm they’d help enforce federal immigration law or risk losing all federal funds administered by DHS.

The language contains six specific criteria.

1. Grant recipients must share information with DHS on the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of individuals.

2. Recipients cannot encourage or induce noncitizens to enter the country illegally.

3. Recipients must “honor requests for cooperation, such as participation in joint operations, sharing of information, or requests for short-term detention” of immigrants.

4. Recipients must provide federal immigration agents “access to detainees” in correctional facilities.

5. Recipients must not “leak or otherwise publicize the existence of” any federal immigration enforcement operations.

6. Both grant recipients and subgrant recipients, including aid organizations, are required to follow the criteria.

Finally, recipients are required to certify that none of the programs operated using federal funding can benefit illegal immigrants.

In May, 20 states and the District of Columbia, which have collectively received more than $23 billion in disaster aid since 2017, filed a lawsuit alleging DHS had no authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. The plaintiffs also claimed the action violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which dictates federal agencies’ regulatory processes. By September, US District Court Judge William Smith ruled that the conditions FEMA imposed on funding were “arbitrary and capricious.” He further stated that DHS failed to provide genuine, fact-based justifications for implementing broad immigration conditions across all grants. Judge Smith also pointed out that DHS didn’t follow internal advice, overlooked how states would be affected, ignored public safety, and failed to consider alternative approaches, such as pausing targeted grants.

Despite Smith’s injunction, states are arguing that the language has not been removed from the grants. DHS is claiming that the language remains as a trigger clause in the event of the injunction being “stayed, vacated, or extinguished.” Meanwhile, the general hurdles the Trump administration has placed on aid are having real-life consequences for communities across the US facing disaster. These actions, which include the elimination of programs designed to fund mitigation projects, are leaving states and localities less prepared for when disaster inevitably strikes.

The Trump administration’s persistent effort to add immigration strings to FEMA funding feels like a “poison pill” move, especially since Trump has openly discussed shifting responsibility for disaster aid to the states. It’s as if they’re actively discouraging states from accepting the funds. The problem with this approach is that it disregards the separation of powers; funds allocated by democratically elected representatives should be distributed to their constituents without additional, arbitrary, and politically motivated conditions. DHS’s efforts undermine national disaster preparedness and response efforts, leaving vulnerable populations at greater risk. For now, only the judiciary branch is standing up for the American people. It’s about time Congress started doing that as well. One simple step would be to streamline the Stafford Act to remove vagueness that allows presidents to decline disaster aid on a whim. Congress also must assert its authority over government spending by censuring the president, challenging the executive branch’s overreach.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7961-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 13:01:55.179738

Gauffeny said the authorities notified her that García-Hernández had been in an accident, but little information was given about the shooting.
She found out through media reports that García-Hernández was sitting in the van outside the facility when gunfire erupted.
“You know, I haven’t gotten any calls from the authorities besides the one I got the day of the shooting,” said Gauffeny.
“He was a father, a husband and a friend, and he was in the process of fixing his [immigration] status,” Gauffeny said.","The widow of one of the people killed when a gunman opened fire on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility in Texas last month has spoken out to question whether the political violence rising under the Trump administration played a role in her husband’s death.

Stephany Gauffeny lost her husband, Miguel García-Hernández, when he became the second of two men to die in the attack outside a detention center in Dallas, after succumbing to his gunshot wounds.

“There’s so much hate going on with immigrants and ICE now, so it has crossed my mind if this would have happened under a different administration. It has certainly played a part in his death,” said the 32-year-old mother in an interview with the Guardian, her first since her husband’s death.

She added: “Sometimes it feels better to be asleep than to be awake, because when I sleep I forget about everything and when I wake up this reality hits me.”

Three days after García-Hernández’s death, Gauffeny gave birth to their third child, a son, Miles Alexander, the name chosen by the father he will never meet. A week after the birth the family buried García-Hernández, 31, in Arlington, where they had recently bought a house, on the outskirts of Dallas.

The authorities described the shooting as a lone, “targeted attack” on ICE and said the gunman, Joshua Jahn – who shot himself dead after spraying the exterior of the facility with bullets – wrote “ANTI-ICE” on one bullet casing.

But in the violent chaos, no law enforcement officers were injured and instead a government van was hit that was holding shackled immigrants on their way to detention. Three detainees from Latin America were shot, including García-Hernández.

The other two victims were 37-year-old Norlan Guzman-Fuentes of El Salvador, who died on the day of the shooting, and 33-year-old José Andres Bordones-Molina of Venezuela, who was later released from the hospital.

Gauffeny said the authorities notified her that García-Hernández had been in an accident, but little information was given about the shooting. García-Hernández, who was undocumented, had been hospitalized in critical condition.

She found out through media reports that García-Hernández was sitting in the van outside the facility when gunfire erupted.

“You know, I haven’t gotten any calls from the authorities besides the one I got the day of the shooting,” said Gauffeny. As she sat for the interview at her lawyer’s office in Dallas last week, she watched over her newborn sleeping in his stroller by her side.

“How many people were in the van? How many times did he actually get shot? Was he conscious at all? They never gave me any details,” she said.

García-Hernández was born in San Luis Potosí, a state in central Mexico. He came to the United States as an undocumented 14-year-old in 2008, and built a life in Texas. But on 8 August this year, García-Hernández had been arrested for driving under the influence and taken to the Tarrant county corrections center in Fort Worth. On that same date, ICE placed a detainer against his release, which allowed immigration officials to pick him up once he served a short time in jail.

“He was a father, a husband and a friend, and he was in the process of fixing his [immigration] status,” Gauffeny said. She is currently weighing filing a lawsuit against the authorities.

Because García-Hernández was married to a US citizen and he was the primary source of income for his household, he was able to apply for a waiver that, if granted, would have effectively erased the transgression of his illegal entry into the US and allowed him to get a green card.

“He wanted to have his own painting company; he made business cards and said he was going to buy the equipment. He was so excited and had a lot going for him,” Gauffeny said.

On the day of the shooting, Donald Trump, in the context of the anti-ICE message on one bullet casing, posted on Truth Social: “This is despicable! The Brave Men and Women of ICE are just trying to do their jobs, and remove the ‘WORST of the WORST’ Criminals out of our Country, but they are facing an unprecedented increase in threats, violence, and attacks by Deranged Radical Leftists.”

ICE issued a statement six days after the shooting about García-Hernández’s death, saying: “Our thoughts are with his family and this tragedy underscores the terrible cost of dangerous rhetoric and violence against the men and women of ICE who are simply carrying out their sworn law enforcement mission.”

Gauffeny said that while the family experienced an outpouring of support from many, including via a fundraiser, she has also been targeted with hate messages from strangers.

“I received comments on social media from people saying that they are not sorry,” she said, adding: “Does the fact that he entered illegally mean that he deserves to be killed the way he was killed?”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0989fe25ceaeb0cd09a7bb868d47cfbe4b4d1f11/8_0_2501_2000/master/2501.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf4c26c8ab8ea597c575edfe6ab2e3f2",N,,2025-10-24 09:02:34.716725

An outright win is next to impossible. The Netherlands has always had a coalition government formed by a minimum of two parties due to its proportional representation electoral system, under which seats in parliament are awarded to parties in proportion to the number of votes they win.

The PVV, headed by Geert Wilders, also won the most votes in the last election in November 2023. It then partnered with three other far-right parties – the Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB), New Social Contract (NSC), and the People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) – to form a coalition government.

But in June, PVV made a dramatic exit from the coalition government over a disagreement on immigration policy. PVV had wanted to introduce a stricter asylum policy that included closing borders to new asylum seekers and deporting dual nationals convicted of crimes, but the other parties demanded further discussions.

In a dramatic move, Wilders took to X to announce that the failure by other parties to agree to PVV’s plans meant it would leave the coalition.

Coalition partners slammed this decision and accused Wilders of being driven by self-interest. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz said at the time that Wilders “chooses his own ego and his own interests. I am astonished. He throws away the chance for a right-wing policy”.

Following the pull-out, Prime Minister Dick Schoof – an independent – announced that he would resign and a snap election would be held this month.

Then, in August, the NSC’s Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp also resigned after he failed to secure support for new sanctions against Israel over its war in Gaza and the humanitarian situation in Gaza City. In solidarity with Veldkamp, other NSC party members left the coalition, leaving only two parties remaining.

Now, with an election imminent, opinion polls suggest the PVV will secure the most seats in the 150-seat parliament. While a winner needs 76 seats to form a government, no single party ever makes it to that figure, which has led to a history of coalitions.

According to a poll by the Dutch news outlet, EenVandaag, on October 14, the PVV is projected to secure 31 seats. The centre-left Green-Labour alliance (GroenLinks-PvdA) is polling at 25 seats, and the centre-right Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) is polling at 23.

PVV’s former coalition partner, the centre-right VVD, could take 14 seats and the BBB, four. So far, the NSC is not projected to secure any seats at all.

Immigration fears

At the end of September, EenVandaag polled 27,191 people and found that the main sticking point between voters – and, hence, between the leaders, PVV and GroenLinks-PvdA – is immigration. Half of all voters said it was the key issue on which they would be voting this year. Housing was the second-most important issue at 46 percent, and “Dutch identity” came third at 37 percent.

While the PVV is firmly anti-immigration and wants to impose a much stricter border policy and asylum laws, GroenLinks-PvdA would prefer to allow a net migration figure of 40,000 and 60,000 migrants per year.

Tempers are running high over this issue. Last month at The Hague, a right-wing activist known as “Els Rechts” organised an anti-migration protest that attracted 1,500 attendees. According to reports, protesters threw stones and bottles at the police, set a police car alight and smashed windows of the left-wing Democrats 66 (D66) party offices.

While left-wingers argue that the immigration issue has been wildly hyped up by the far right, they are losing control of the narrative.

Esme Smithson Swain, a member of MiGreat, a Dutch non-governmental campaign group that calls for freedom of movement and equal treatment for migrants in the Netherlands, told Al Jazeera that the far right in the Netherlands and in the United Kingdom, more widely, had “constructed a narrative that there is a migration crisis”.

“They’ve managed to construct this idea of a crisis, and that distracts our attention away from populism, away from arms trades, away from social services and the welfare state being sold off.”

Whatever its merits, the right-wing message that immigration is at the root of many social ills seems to be taking hold. The far-left, pro-immigration BIJ1 party, which rejects this message, is not projected to win any seats at all in this election.

Immigration “is a key term especially for right-wing political parties to win the election”, Noura Oul Fakir, a candidate for the BIJ1 party, told Al Jazeera. “We don’t focus on it because we look at everything that’s been going on from a systemic point of view, that every form of oppression is interlinked … This fight for equality and justice, it’s about more than just immigration, but it’s also interlinked with other issues that we see nowadays.”

People ‘more emboldened to express racist views’

By January 1, 2024, the Netherlands was hosting 2.9 million migrants (16.2 percent of the population), compared to the average across European Union member states of 9.9 percent (44.7 million people in total).

Similarly, Germany hosts 16.9 million migrants (20.2 percent of the population); France, 9.3 million (13.6 percent of the population); Spain, 8.8 million (18.2 percent of the population); and Italy, 6.7 million (11.3 percent of the population), according to figures from the EU.

Mark van Ostaijen, an associate professor in public administration and sociology at Erasmus University Rotterdam, explained that immigration has become a mainstream talking point in “housing, care, educational and cultural policy domains”.

For instance, the Netherlands is currently short of 434,000 homes, including for 353,000 asylum seekers and 81,000 Dutch first-time buyers, according to figures commissioned by the Ministry of Housing and Spatial Planning (VRO).

Immigration has, therefore, been blamed for what is seen as a housing crisis.

According to Statistics Netherlands (CBS), 316,000 migrants arrived in the country in 2024, 19,000 fewer than in 2023. But CBS also found that population growth is still mainly down to net migration, with the largest number of migrants coming from Ukraine and Syria.

“I think this is indeed something that will continue the electoral legitimacy of far-right parties, or right-wing parties, even more, given the fact that the Netherlands was already quite leaning towards the conservative angle,” van Ostaijen told Al Jazeera.

“This will be a topic that will haunt our politics and our democratic decision-making and discourse for quite a while,” he said.

Anecdotal evidence bears this out. Fakir has noticed a change in the experiences of immigrant residents she and her colleagues have spoken to in the country following the growth of the PVV.

“In their personal life [they have seen] a noticeable shift where people feel more free or emboldened to express racist views, both online and in real life. Others are telling them those classic things of ‘go back to your own country, or you’re not Dutch’,” she said.

For Nassreddin Taibi, a recent graduate who works as a political analyst and plans to vote for GroenLinks-PvdA, the anti-immigration protests at the Hague “further cemented polarisation among Dutch voters” and have caused centrist parties to fall into line with the right-wing narrative.

“These protests have influenced the discourse in the sense that centrist parties now say that cutting immigration is necessary to win back trust of voters in politics,” he said.

Nearly half of voters still undecided

While the far-right PVV is projected to win the most seats in this election, it will still face an uphill journey to form a government, as other parties such as the centre-right People’s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) have ruled out joining a coalition government.

Furthermore, the PVV’s leader, Wilders, has not escaped controversy with his Islamophobic comments and anti-migration stance despite the rise in anti-immigration sentiment across the country as a whole.

Notable incidents over the years include Wilders’ likening of Islam to Nazism in 2007 and his reference to the Muslim holy book, the Quran, as “fascist” in a letter to a Dutch news outlet. His letter and comments led to Wilders being prosecuted for inciting hatred and discrimination, which he denied. In 2011, he was acquitted by a judge who ruled that his comments had fallen within the scope of free speech.

More recently, in August this year, Wilders posted an image on X that depicted a smiling, blonde and blue-eyed woman, representing the PVV; and a wrinkled, angry-looking elderly woman wearing a headscarf, representing the PvdA. It was accompanied by the words: “The choice is yours on 29/10.”

Fake news and misinformation have also driven the rise in far-right narratives, analysts say.

The Facebook page ‘Wij doen GEEN aangifte tegen Geert Wilders’ (We are NOT filing charges against Geert Wilders), which claims to be a PVV supporters’ page boasting 129,000 followers, said it does not intend to be “discriminatory, hateful, or incite violence”, but has nevertheless posted AI-generated images of this nature.

In one such image, which received 1,700 likes, a white family is seemingly being harassed by men of colour.

In another, a white woman is seen in a supermarket paying for groceries while surrounded by Muslim women wearing hijabs and niqabs, with the caption: “No mass immigration, no Islamisation, no backwardness of the Dutch.” The post received 885 likes.

While the outgoing home affairs minister, Judith Uitermark, has said the government is examining new ways to combat fake news, she added that the Netherlands is somewhat protected from the rise of extremism by its proportional representation system, under which no one party ever wins a majority.

Still, the Dutch Data Protection Authority has warned voters not to use AI chatbots to help them decide who to vote for.

And a large number are still deciding. EenVandaag found that some 48 percent of voters are still undecided about which candidate they will choose. If the GroenLinks-PvdA can disengage from right-wing talking points and, instead, focus on its own policies more, it may perform better than expected, analysts say.

This will be no easy task, however.

“We find ourselves doing this also as a civil society organisation, as campaigners, trying to fight off the narrative and fight off the kind of populist ideals of the far right faster than we can push for our own agenda as well. And I think a lot of the time that leaves left-wing parties in the Netherlands seeming a bit hollow,” Swain said.

Still, she says that she is holding out hope for this election, despite what feels like a “vast and growing far-right bulk of the population”.

Leaders say it's not about interfering but rather about alerting and informing the community.

Flyers will be passed around to businesses around the state, community leaders saying Thursday the hotline is not just a number, it’s a lifeline to protecting immigrant families.

Passionate statements from local leaders on Thursday in Portland as they announced the launch of a hotline meant to protect immigrants and their families who may be fearful of seeing ICE on Maine streets.

""Our families, our friends, our neighbors are afraid to go to school, to work, to worship, to the hospital, to the store,"" Rev. Dr. Jodi Cohen Hayashida, a minister in Auburn, said.

Members of the Maine Immigrants’ Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice say the ICE Watch Hotline will help people from having to rely on internet posts or word of mouth.

""So we know that this tactic is effective in deterring law enforcement activity,"" Presente! Maine Executive Director Crystal Cron said.

Cron is one of the hotline organizers. She says once the number is called, you will be connected to a volunteer operator, where you can either get supportive advice or report that agents are in your area.

They'll also take a step further: sending people to the location to interact with the agents and answer questions from anyone involved.

Betsy Smith is a spokesperson for the National Police Association, which supports American law enforcement. She believes this hotline only hurts the community.

""A hotline to protect criminals is absolutely obscene,"" Smith said. ""It prevents law enforcement from arresting criminal illegal aliens... It's dangerous, it's unconstitutional, and it's un-American.""

That hotline went live Thursday.

The number is 207-544-9989.

Volunteers will be there to take calls in the morning and evening.

Leaders say they're still building out a list of operators.

“The Maine ICE Watch Hotline is a lifeline for families, a bridge for neighbors and a promise that no one in our community will face fear alone,” said Portland At-Large City Councilor Pious Ali, speaking at a press event at City Hall Thursday.

The goal of the project, which is organized by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice, is to provide accurate, real-time information about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol activity and connect Maine families to resources and support services.

“This isn’t about panic — it’s about protection,” Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine said. “It’s about staying informed, connected and ready to act together. When ICE shows up, we show up too — not with fear but with solidarity. This hotline is a step towards the community we all deserve, one rooted in trust, care and collective defense.”

The hotline has already trained over 150 volunteers, both as operators to receive calls as well as verifiers to confirm or refute reported sightings of immigrant enforcement activity, Cron said. While there are already volunteers across the state, Cron said they are seeking more in rural areas.

Federal actions targeting Democratic-led cities and states have been on the rise. The press conference was held two days after 50 federal agents descended on New York City’s Canal Street, reportedly arresting nine men.

Last month, a Portland resident was detained by ICE agents after dropping off their child at the Gerald E. Talbot Community School. Nationally, schools, like workplaces, have become frequent targets and there is research tying the raids to increased student absences.

Wes Pelletier said at the press event that, as councilor for Portland District 2, he represents some of the city’s more diverse neighborhoods and has “seen firsthand how fear has taken hold of our communities. Truancy is on the rise… our parks and playgrounds and our streets are more quiet.”

Pelletier, who is among the volunteers that have taken the verifier training, said over the past few months there’s been quiet organizing but there’s been a growing need for a “unified network to share information that doesn’t cause undo panic, is integrated in the communities it serves, and that balances safety with accessibility.”

After the hotline receives a call of a potential sighting, the report is passed to a regional verifier response group. If they confirm that immigration agents are present, an alert will go out through texts and social media. Verifiers are also trained to observe enforcement actions and gather more information. Afterwards, the hotline will help track the detainee through the immigration system while connecting impacted people with legal representation, financial and other support.

Similar grassroots efforts have been launched elsewhere to protect immigrant communities and push back against federal enforcement actions.

Ahead of the Trump administration’s deployment of immigration authorities last month to Chicago, community groups similarly launched a hotline to help keep tabs on agent activity. Since then, volunteers have organized a vast rapid response network that includes blowing whistles to alert neighbors if ICE or Border Patrol agents are spotted nearby and documenting encounters with federal agents on their phones.

Cron said they’ve connected with and learned from groups in other states, including Siembra NC, in North Carolina, and LUCE Immigrant Justice Network in Massachusetts.

The role of local law enforcement

While the speakers focused on federal immigration activity, enforcement in Maine has routinely been initiated by local law enforcement.

Since March, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, has tracked 22 minor traffic stops and similar incidents where more than 50 Maine residents and workers were handed over to immigration officials by state and local law enforcement based on suspected immigration status alone. This is not a complete picture of such incidents, but rather the organization’s best estimate based on verifiable reports.

“What is known shows a concerning and broad pattern of Maine law enforcement agencies across the state stepping outside of their roles and voluntarily diverting Maine’s resources to assist the federal administration with indiscriminate immigration enforcement, threatening the rights and safety of some of Maine’s most vulnerable residents,” ILAP shared in a statement.

While ICE arrests in Maine double, governor delays deciding on limits for local police cooperation

The state Legislature has considered prohibiting or restricting state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities, though both remain in limbo heading into the next session in January. One of those bills passed the Legislature and rests with Gov. Janet Mills.

“When our governor refuses to sign a bill that will prevent local and state law enforcement from being used to enforce harsh federal immigration laws, it sends the wrong message,” said Ali. “It tells the federal agencies that they can come into our neighborhoods and act without restraint.”

Cron said the hotline guidance is the same regardless of whether it is a federal or local officer and people should call in if they see any suspicious law enforcement activity.

An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities.

As of Tuesday night, no police departments in Maine have formal agreements with federal immigration authorities, after Wells Police Department terminated its agreement under the 287(g) program.

This means departments in Maine have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials.

Another layer is where immigration detainees are housed. The public has for months been calling for the board to end Cumberland County Jail’s contract with the U.S. Marshal Service to house federal detainees, which includes immigration detainees, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics.

Earlier this week, the board postponed its decision, with some members raising concern that ending the contract would only take people farther away from their families and legal counsel.

Legal experts say that already occurs, as it’s common practice for federal authorities to transfer immigration detainees from facility to facility.

As Maine Morning Star reported in April, the majority of immigration detainees in Cumberland County Jail are not residents of nor were they arrested in Maine. Most were transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.

The hotline is currently available from 6-9 a.m. and 5-9 p.m. Monday through Friday. The coalition is encouraging interested parties to volunteer or share information about the hotline on social media or by displaying one of their posters.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4699-scaled-e1761245956885-2048x1327.jpeg,N,,2025-10-24 10:00:46.735526

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.","Over the last several months, Nicholas Pierce’s work as an asylum, refugee and deportation defense lawyer on the Front Range has meant playing catch-up. The immigration policies and orders that seem to come on a near-daily basis from the federal government have been hard to keep up with.

In a recent interview, Pierce tried to make sense of the latest effort by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which activists said was called ""Freaky Friday,"" offering unaccompanied immigrant children cash to self deport, and potentially depriving them of the right to hearings. A local human services agency had reached out to him earlier in the day asking how it would impact the young immigrants in their care.

He couldn’t answer. Instead he had to turn to others, including a contact at ICE, to figure it out.

“It is, in a lot of ways, much worse than what I had anticipated, much faster than I had anticipated,” Pierce said about the impact the president’s immigration crackdown has had on Colorado. “I was an immigration lawyer during the first Trump administration, and there was just a lot more checks and balances in the system.”

With about 400 cases on his plate through his Denver-based firm Amistad Law, Pierce said he’s seen firsthand how families and communities are being torn apart. He said many have had their legal statuses stripped away, through things like ending Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans – many of whom sought refuge in Colorado. Others, he said, have chosen to go into hiding for fear of being detained when appearing for their asylum interviews.

Pierce, who is a former U.S. Army Reserve service member and whose work receives state funding through the Colorado Refugee Support Program, is one of hundreds of Coloradans polled by CPR News and other outlets in the Colorado News Collaborative who have expressed either complete opposition to or frustration with some of the ways Trump has carried out his campaign promise to close the southern border and reduce the number of undocumented immigrants living in the country.

A small number we heard from say they support the president’s actions, calling them necessary to free up government resources for things like housing and Medicaid for citizens or protect the country from socialism.

Since the beginning of the year, the Trump administration has increased immigration raids across U.S. cities, including in Colorado, escalated tactics like sending the National Guard to back up ICE in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and reversed Biden-era policies, including allowing arrests at schools and churches.

What Coloradans are saying about immigration

In the survey circulated by Colorado newsrooms, including CPR News, a majority of the nearly 400 respondents said that, even if they supported some of the president’s stated goals, they opposed some of the immigration enforcement tactics currently being used by federal agents.

Specifically, Coloradans take issue with federal agents violating due process and not focusing on deporting the “worst of the worst” criminals.

“I have no problem with deporting those convicted of felonies, but ambushing families is despicable,” said a woman in Grand Junction.

“I am in favor of the overall goal, but I do take issue with some of the practices,” said a man from Broomfield. “Treat people as human beings, even if they are criminals.”

A man in Durango summarized it like a report card. He gave efforts to close the border an A+, deporting criminals a C-, visa restrictions a D-, the use of Immigration and Customs Enforcement an F and described the use of the National guard as illegal. He said Trump also failed in the area of “Politicalization.”

“Deport criminals not workers,” said a woman in Durango. ICE tactics like “unmarked cars, civilian clothes, refusal to identify themselves should be eliminated.”

“It's a waste of time to deport people contributing to the economy,” said a man in Colorado Springs. “I'm more concerned with the affordability of housing and health care.”

“The response has been too extreme and brutal,” said a woman in Colorado Springs. “It targets too many law-abiding, legal, U.S. residents,: denying due process to detainees.”

Evergreen resident Norman Sherbert said he believed the president was carrying out what he promised to do when elected and correct the previous administration’s actions.

“I’m not here to tell the government how to do their job,” Sherbert elaborated via email. “All I know is that 11 or 12 million illegal immigrants coming into our country, seeing pictures of the masses of people standing at our borders, and hearing of children without guardianship being used to gain entrance into the U.S. is not good policy. And, in the long run over the next generations, will have a deteriorating effect on our society and way of life.”

Sherbert sees the administration’s extreme measures as a necessary way to right the situation with the limited time and resources it has.

At a flea market in Colorado Springs on a recent weekend, JoAnn Antaya said she believed Trump wanted to help people during his first administration but doesn’t agree with the tactics being used today.

A German-born American who remembered how difficult it was to adjust to a new culture as a child, Antaya believes society has lost its compassion.

“We do not care about our fellow man,” Antaya, 63, said. “So it's easy to put a wall between here and Mexico because you know what? They have nothing to do with you. Heaven forbid if you should hand them a crust of bread. No, I'm not happy with my country.

“It's like they're not compromising. They're not coming to a happy medium. They're just combative. And that's all it is: Argument, argument, argument.”

What the polls say about immigration concerns

Opinion polling suggests how Coloradans feel about immigration has a lot to do with where they live.

A poll from the Colorado Health Foundation released earlier this year looked at top issues facing Coloradans. It surveyed over 2,300 people across the state.

It found that “illegal immigration” was a major concern for about half of the residents surveyed, though the extent of the concern depended on where respondents lived, lower in urban areas (39 percent), versus suburban (58 percent) and rural (65 percent).

Ninety percent of respondents on the Eastern Plains believe illegal immigration is a problem in Colorado compared to 46 percent in Denver metro.

On the flip side, 20 percent of all respondents said the mistreatment of immigrants was an ""extremely serious” concern compared to 42 percent of respondents saying it was “not too serious.”

Broken down by region, that concern fluctuated, with 44 percent of urban respondents saying mistreatment is extremely or very serious compared to 30 percent of suburban respondents and 23 percent of rural respondents.

“The regional, the urbanity and the partisanship seemed to really be driving how folks react to those problems and react differently to the two different framings that we tested,” said Lucia Del Puppo, senior vice president with the research firm that conducted the Pulse Poll.

CHF spokesperson Katie Peshek says Pulse Poll findings are shared with policymakers to help them understand the real issues residents are facing and prioritize those concerns.

“With a third of poll respondents pointing to government and politics as the state’s leading challenge, it’s clear that on issues like immigration, the cost of living and housing, Coloradans are ready for real action and solutions,” Peshek said.

Meanwhile, a national Gallup poll released this summer found that only 30 percent of Americans say immigration should be reduced, a position that has shrunk by fifteen points since last year.

But the support for staunching immigration largely falls along party lines, with the poll finding “Republicans are the only group still showing at least plurality support for reducing immigration.”

In a recent national poll of registered voters by the New York Times/Sienna, “51 percent said they thought the government was deporting mostly people who ‘should be deported,’ while 42 percent said the government was deporting the wrong people.”

That poll, too, found respondents wrestling with the administration’s aggressive tactics.

“More than half of voters, 53 percent, think the process of deporting people has not been fair; 44 percent said it was mostly fair,” according to The New York Times.

How Colorado leaders are responding to federal actions

Some Coloradans praised the work of elected officials to stand in the way of federal immigration enforcement.

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has used his office’s powers to fight against federal immigration actions, from defending in-state tuition for noncitizen students to suing a sheriff’s deputy for involving ICE in a traffic stop that resulted in the detainment of a college student.

In the spring, state lawmakers passed a bill designed to protect undocumented immigrants from coming to the attention of federal authorities. And over the summer, Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress toured the state’s only immigration facility in Aurora, only to leave with more questions than answers.

Colorado governments are in danger of losing federal funds and the state is being sued by the federal government for so-called sanctuary policies, but Democratic leaders have so far resisted the administration’s pressure campaign, arguing immigration enforcement is not the state’s problem.

That doesn’t mean inter-agency coordination isn’t happening. Despite state laws strictly limiting when officials can cooperate with ICE requests, state agencies were found to have provided federal immigration officials with Coloradans’ personal information in response to subpoenas several times this year. Those actions by the Polis administration have riled fellow Democrats and immigration advocates.

Looking ahead

Even though state laws prohibit local law enforcement from helping federal agents, targeted immigration raids continue to take place across the state, including outside of metro regions. In the last couple of weeks, local news outlets have reported on an incident in Alamosa where ICE detained a family with a baby inside a vehicle at gunpoint, smashing a car window, and a situation in Routt County where a county commissioner was blocked by ICE vehicles.

For Pierce, it’s not just new policies that have made it difficult for him – or other lawyers – to do this job. He’s seen announcements of immigration court judges resigning or being fired, resulting in longer processing times for cases. Clients are also being transferred to detention facilities out of state, making it hard to connect with their legal counsel and putting them at risk of being deported within days.

“So when it comes to hurting people, the system's gotten a lot faster. When it's come to helping people, the system's gotten a lot slower,” he said.

The majority of Pierce’s cases involve Afghan men who fought alongside the U.S. military during the Iraq War and are now waiting to get legal residency. Most of them filed petitions in 2022 or 2023 but still don’t have a court date set. With the reimposition of the so-called Muslim ban by the Trump administration this summer, it has been difficult for them to be reunited with their families. Pierce says these policies betray a promise made by the U.S. government for fighting alongside its troops.

The situation is leaving the men with two options: risk likely death to join their families back home or wait in the U.S, in the hope that their families will eventually be allowed to join them.

It’s gotten so bad that Pierce has found himself for the first time ever advising people to seek asylum in Argentina or Chile. He’s even started to offer powers-of-attorney services so that family or friends with U.S. citizenship can take control of bank accounts and other assets if their loved ones are rapidly deported.

Only U.S. citizens, green card holders who have gone through a five-year waiting period, and some Haitian and Cuban nationals with special status will be eligible for SNAP. This means refugees, people who have been granted asylum and human trafficking survivors will all lose their benefits, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.

The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service gave states 120 days to implement these changes, meaning Nov. 1 is the deadline.

More than 183,000 Franklin County residents receive SNAP benefits and most of them are children and seniors, said Joy Bivens, deputy Franklin County administrator of health and human services.

Immigrants and refugees made up about 56% of Franklin County’s population growth between 2020 and 2023, said Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley.

“The proposed changes to SNAP benefits will put many of these families in jeopardy,” she said. “They are people who have endured trauma, made tremendous sacrifices and risked their lives to give their families security and freedom. These individuals often arrive with no local family connections and no established community. Without this support, they are often left to navigate life in an unfamiliar country with very limited resources, they face food insecurity, housing instability and limited access to health care.”

Approximately 1.39 million Ohioans receive an average of $190 of SNAP benefits each month, ODJFS Spokesperson Tom Betti said. Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines — $32,150 a year for a family of four — to qualify for SNAP.

“When families can’t rely on SNAP, they are forced to spend their limited income on food, and often at the expense of medical care, rent or utilities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty,” said Franklin County Commissioner John O’Grady. “Losing SNAP benefits isn’t just about hunger, it’s about health, stability and opportunity. Children may face developmental display delays. Families may confront chronic health issues.”

SNAP helps stabilize families when they are new to the U.S., said Jewish Family Services CEO Karen Mozenter.

“They have done everything right, and they are eager to contribute as Americans,” she said. “Cutting off the support that helps them feed their families and care for them while they find their footing in a new country, that hurts them and that hurts all of us.”

The Mid-Ohio Food Collective is serving 58% more families now than at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, said President and CEO Matt Habash.

“Unfortunately, we don’t expect those numbers to go down,” he said. “The cost of housing, the cost of groceries, the cost of health care, and more are all putting pressure on household budgets, and now we’re dealing with cuts to SNAP — America’s first line of defense against hunger.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-94/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-1287472642-2048x1365-1-1024x6831746533271-11761296680.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=CuVmDKNI,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:33.586106

Elsewhere around the country, it will be at least days before the Guard could be deployed in Portland, Oregon, and federal appeals judges are weighing whether hundreds of California National Guard members should remain under federal control.

President Donald Trump’s push to send the military into Democratic-run cities despite fierce resistance from mayors and governors has unleashed a whirlwind of lawsuits and overlapping court rulings.

Here’s what to know about legal efforts to block or deploy the National Guard in various cities:

Judge weighs Guard in Chicago while awaiting Supreme Court decision

U.S. District Judge April Perry on Wednesday blocked the deployment of Guard troops to the Chicago area until the case has been decided either in her court or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes. Perry had already blocked the deployment for two weeks through a temporary restraining order, or TRO.

Attorneys representing the federal government said they would agree to extend the order but emphasized that they would continue pressing for an emergency order from the Supreme Court that would allow for the deployment.

“Every day this improper TRO remains in effect imposes grievous and irreparable harm on the Executive,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing Tuesday.

Lawyers representing Chicago and Illinois have asked the Supreme Court to continue to block the deployment, calling it a “dramatic step.”

Guard deployment in Portland also in limbo

An appeals court said Monday that Trump could take command of 200 Oregon National Guard troops, but a separate court order still blocks him from actually deploying them.

U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, issued two temporary restraining orders earlier this month. One prohibited Trump from calling up Oregon troops so he could send them to Portland. The other prohibited him from sending any Guard members to Oregon at all after he tried to evade the first order by deploying California troops instead.

The Justice Department appealed the first order and — in a 2-1 ruling Monday — a 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel sided with the administration.

However, Immergut’s second order remains in effect, so no troops may immediately be deployed. She has scheduled a hearing for Friday on the administration’s request to dissolve that order. Meanwhile, the state is asking the 9th Circuit to reconsider Monday’s ruling.

California legal battle goes before appellate panel

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in Pasadena heard arguments Wednesday related to Trump’s deployment of Guard troops to Los Angeles.

A district court found the administration violated federal law when it sent troops to Los Angeles in June after protests over Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Judge Charles Breyer handed California Gov. Gavin Newsom a victory on June 13 when he ordered control of California’s Guard members back to the state. But in an emergency ruling, an appeals court panel sided with the Trump administration, putting Breyer’s decision on hold and allowing the troops to remain in federal hands as the lawsuit unfolds.

The appeals court is now weighing whether to vacate Breyer’s June order.

The same three-judge panel is also handling the Trump administration’s appeal of Breyer’s Sept. 2 ruling, which found the president violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law prohibiting military enforcement of domestic laws.

Groups aim to stop Guard deployment in DC

In Charleston, West Virginia, a state court hearing is set for Friday in a lawsuit filed by two groups seeking to block deployment of the state National Guard to Washington, D.C. More than 300 Guard members have been in the nation’s capital supporting Trump’s initiative since late August.

A separate federal court hearing centers on a request by District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb for a temporary injunction to stop the deployments of more than 2,000 guardsmen.

Forty-five states have entered filings in that case, with 23 supporting the administration’s actions in D.C. and 22 supporting the attorney general’s lawsuit.

Republican governors from several states also sent units to D.C. Although the emergency period ended in September, more than 2,200 troops remain. Several states told The Associated Press they would bring their units home by Nov. 30, unless extended.

Democrats sue to stop Guard deployment in Memphis

In Tennessee, Democratic elected officials sued last Friday to stop the ongoing Guard deployment in Memphis. They said Republican Gov. Bill Lee, acting on a request from Trump, violated the state constitution, which says the Guard can be called up during “rebellion or invasion” — but only with state lawmakers’ blessing.

Since their arrival on Oct. 10, troops have been patrolling downtown Memphis, including near the iconic Pyramid, wearing camouflage uniforms and protective vests that say “military police,” with guns in holsters. Guard members have no arrest power, officials have said.

He followed agents’ vehicles and then honked to warn others when he was pulled over. Masked federal officers pointed a gun at him and a staffer, attempted to break his car window and took photos of their faces, before issuing a warning, he recounted.

“We were non-violent,” Huynh said of Tuesday’s incident, part of which was captured on video. “We identified ourselves as an elected official and my hands were visible.”

As the Trump administration intensifies an immigration crackdown across the nation’s third-largest city and its suburbs, elected officials in the Democratic stronghold have been increasingly caught in tense encounters with federal agents. Members of the Chicago City Council and their staff, state legislators and congressional candidates report being threatened, handcuffed and detained in recent days.

The tense political atmosphere comes as President Donald Trump has vowed to expand military deployments and jail Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson over immigration policies the Republican claims protect criminals. But Illinois Democrats deem the actions as scare tactics and a calculated acceleration. The clashes, amid constant arrests of immigrants and protesters, have emerged as a top campaign issue in Illinois’ March primary where an unusually high number of congressional seats are open.

“This is an escalation with the interests of creating fear and intimidation in my community and in all of Chicago,” said Alderman Mike Rodriguez, whose ward includes heavily immigrant and Latino neighborhoods.

During an enforcement operation Wednesday in the city’s Mexican enclave of Little Village and adjacent suburb of Cicero, at least eight people, including four U.S. citizens, were detained, he said.

Two of those citizens work in his office, including chief of staff Elianne Bahena, and were held for hours. Bahena also serves on an elected police accountability council. Rodriguez said they did nothing wrong but didn't offer exact details.

“Trump sent his goons to my neighborhood to intimidate and in the process of helping people out, my staff got detained,” he said Thursday amid continued federal presence in Little Village. Among other things, agents deployed chemical agents and detained a 16-year-old, activists and elected officials said.

While the operation’s focus has been concentrated in Latino neighborhoods and suburbs, federal agents have been spotted all over the city of 2.7 million and its many suburbs. Word of pedestrian and traffic stops outside schools, stores, courts and an O’Hare International Airport parking lot used by rideshare drivers have triggered waves of frustration amid the city’s active immigrant rights network and residents who follow vehicles, blow warning whistles and take videos.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended its operations, including the detention of U.S. citizens, saying they are temporarily held for safety. The agency, which didn't answer questions about Rodriguez’ staff, accused Huynh of “stalking” agents.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said agents had to assess if he was a threat.

“This behavior is unbecoming of a public servant and is just another example of sanctuary politicians putting our officers at risk,” she said in a statement.

Also this week, City Council member Jessie Fuentes filed a federal tort claim seeking $100,000 in damages after agents grabbed and handcuffed her earlier this month at a hospital. She said she was checking on a person who was injured while being pursued by immigration agents and asked for a signed judicial warrant on the person’s behalf. She was handcuffed and let go outside the hospital. She wasn't charged.

“It is indeed a frightening time, when unidentified federal agents shove, grab, handcuff, and detain an elected official in the exercise of her duties,” said Jan Susler, Fuentes’ attorney.

Huynh, who was elected to the Illinois House in 2022, is also running for Congress to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky, among four open House seats in safely Democratic territory. Other candidates in the crowded primary have also publicized their opposition outside a federal immigration processing center, including Kat Abughazaleh who was thrown on the ground by federal agents as she protested.

For Huynh, who came to the U.S. in the 1990s from Vietnam and was granted political asylum, the feeling is eerily familiar.

“My family came as refugees from the Vietnam War where people were being picked up by the secret police all the time. We believed in the American ideal of due process,” he said. ""It is very concerning that in this country right now and very disturbing right now that we are living under this authoritarian regime.”",https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/c278143e-e38e-45e7-bc2b-4ddef29bbcf9/wirestory_7624ff7cae0b58f9b8606deacffa2474_16x9.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-24 11:59:15.226221

Although ICE has sold its surveillance campaign as necessary to locating and deporting undocumented immigrations, the Trump administration has signaled that the technologies will also be used on American citizens.
In September, Trump signed an executive order designating antifa a domestic terrorist organization and signaled that federal agencies, including ICE, should devote resources to investigating the network.
Any political organizing people do,"" she continued, is ""typically on social media now, or over the phone.""
The expansion of tracking and surveillance technology deployed by ICE coincides with the Trump administration's crackdown on services used by the public to share information about federal immigration enforcement.","While a federal judge scrutinizes the constitutionality of tactics used by federal immigration authorities during ongoing protests in Chicago, these same agencies are quietly amassing behind-the-scenes surveillance technology. Originally slated to target undocumented immigrants, the technology is now being used to investigate protesters of President Donald Trump's mass deportation campaign.

Backed by funding from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has entered into contracts with companies to provide surveillance capabilities like facial recognition algorithms, an iris-scanning identification app, controversial spyware on smartphones, and a real-time smartphone location and social media tracking system. In September alone, ICE racked up $1.4 billion in new surveillance technology contracts, the highest in at least 18 years, according to The Washington Post.

These contracts are in addition to any privately owned surveillance networks to which ICE has access. Flock Safety, for example, has allowed ICE to access over 80,000 of its AI-powered license plate reader cameras installed nationwide, according to 404 Media. The expansive—and growing—mass surveillance camera network captures the license plate number, make, model, and any distinctive features of all passing vehicles, making it possible to track cars and, by extension, drivers, often without a warrant.

Although ICE has sold its surveillance campaign as necessary to locating and deporting undocumented immigrations, the Trump administration has signaled that the technologies will also be used on American citizens. In September, Trump signed an executive order designating antifa a domestic terrorist organization and signaled that federal agencies, including ICE, should devote resources to investigating the network. Todd M. Lyons, acting director of ICE, told Glenn Beck during an interview shortly after the executive order was signed that the agency would ""track the money,"" ""ringleaders,"" and ""professional agitators"" who are ""being brought in"" from outside the Chicago area to protest against immigration enforcement. But whether from Chicago or elsewhere, protester or ""domestic terrorist,"" constitutional rights and limitations still apply, although adherence by federal agencies is being questioned.

Critics of mass surveillance have long warned that intrusive technologies could be used to violate Americans' privacy rights. ""We don't know if law enforcement or ICE are getting search warrants to deploy this spyware,"" Maria Villegas Bravo, counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told the Post. ""It's also a First Amendment issue because your phone contains all your communications, all your expressions…it has your contact lists, it has your social media. Any political organizing people do,"" she continued, is ""typically on social media now, or over the phone.""

The expansion of tracking and surveillance technology deployed by ICE coincides with the Trump administration's crackdown on services used by the public to share information about federal immigration enforcement. Since early October, the Justice Department has successfully pressured social media platforms, including Meta, Apple, and Google, to remove online groups and apps that share where ICE and other immigration agents have been sighted. Although private companies are not governed by the First Amendment and are free to set their own rules about acceptable speech, it is extremely concerning that the federal government would use its power and influence to blatantly interfere with Americans' otherwise protected free speech.

The courts and public are right to worry about the constitutional violations taking place in plain view by immigration agents during protests and enforcement operations, and officers must be held accountable. But those same actors must also be held responsible for the privacy violations that are less obvious and happening behind the scenes.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/10/10-22-25-v1-a-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 05:17:42.106429

The student, whose name was not released, had attended a routine immigration check-in at the Federal Building in Des Moines on Sept. 30, according to advocates with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, and was detained by ICE officials at the building briefly before being taken to the Hardin County Jail in Eldora.

After being transferred to the Iowa jail, the student was later sent to a detention center in Louisiana before being deported to a Central American country, according to the advocacy group. Iowa MMJ did not respond to further questions about the student’s immigration status or background; though the Des Moines Register reported his guardian was not able to speak with him for four days following his detainment, and then did not hear from him until Oct. 12, when he had been deported.

DMPS officials said in a statement shared with media that the school district was “aware that one of our high school students was detained by federal immigration authorities late last month.”

“This situation did not occur on or near school property,” The statement said. “We understand that news like this can cause concern among our students, families, and staff. Our schools are committed to being safe, welcoming places for every student with principals, teachers and staff who care about their well-being.”

The news of the DMPS student’s deportation comes after the school district has faced the high-profile arrest of former superintendent Ian Roberts, a native of Guyana who was also arrested and detained by ICE officials in late September. Since his arrest, information has been released through reporting and federal authorities showing Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, and faced previous criminal charges.

The prime minister said on Thursday that the government was planning to expedite the man’s return to France.
The Home Office is continuing to return asylum seekers to France who arrive in the UK on small boats, with 42 returned last week in return for 23 asylum seekers brought to the UK.
The Home Office initially flew small numbers to France on Air France jets but has now switched to using private charters for deportations.
It is thought that at least 10 more people were removed from UK detention centres to France on Wednesday.","The first group of asylum seekers removed to France under the “one in, one out” scheme includes potential victims of modern slavery, people suffering severe depression and those with family in the UK, a new report has found.

Humans For Rights Network (HFRN) interviewed those returned after crossing the Channel in small boats in mid-October while they were staying in their initial accommodation – a marquee next to a railway track in Paris.

The research was announced after the Guardian revealed that an Iranian asylum seeker, who was sent to France last month, returned to the UK just 29 days later and is being held in an immigration detention centre.

He has been referred to the national referral mechanism to investigate a claim that he is a victim of trafficking. The prime minister said on Thursday that the government was planning to expedite the man’s return to France.

A charity that has maintained contact with some of those returned to France has said that more of them may attempt to return to the UK due to the reception conditions in France.

The UK-France “one in, one out” treaty, which came into force on 6 August, allows the UK to detain and rapidly remove people who enter via small boats. In return, the UK will accept an equal number of people through a newly established safe and legal route, subject to security checks.

At the time of HFRN’s research, 24 people had been returned to France and they interviewed 12 of them.

At least three of them had relatives in the UK, including two people with sisters and one with an aunt. One man told the Guardian that he reunited with his sister in the UK for the first time in more than a decade when she visited him in a detention centre. But the contact was brief after he was removed to France shortly afterwards.

Four of the men claimed to be victims of modern slavery – two having experienced it in Libya, one in Ethiopia and one in Yemen. One man was blind in one eye while two others were suffering from severe depression and one experiencing suicidal ideation.

“Overwhelmingly these men were distressed and confused, some had no contact with their lawyer, while others were unsure about what their lawyers had done to make representations regarding these experiences,” the report said.

“HFRN considers that many of the men they engaged with have significant case facts indicating their removal should never have taken place.” The charity claimed accounts of torture from some of the men were not fully investigated by the Home Office before their removal to France.

The Home Office is continuing to return asylum seekers to France who arrive in the UK on small boats, with 42 returned last week in return for 23 asylum seekers brought to the UK. The Home Office initially flew small numbers to France on Air France jets but has now switched to using private charters for deportations. It is thought that at least 10 more people were removed from UK detention centres to France on Wednesday.

A spokesperson for Gatwick Detainees Welfare Group, which supports immigration detainees, said: “We are hearing from people who have been removed to France that they have been given no guidance on how to claim asylum or access legal support there. The impact on people who are currently detained for France is causing further anxiety and confusion, as well as suicidal thoughts.

“People in France have reported that they cannot access medical care, do not understand what is happening in their case, and many are frightened of being harmed or found by smugglers. People tell us they may risk their lives again and undertake unsafe journeys through desperation.”

One asylum seeker, who is part of a group of 11 who have been moved from Paris to new accommodation in Marseille, told the Guardian: “We don’t know what is happening to us. I have been given an appointment with the French authorities for next Monday but nobody has told me what it is for.

“Many of us have been threatened with removal to other EU countries because we were previously fingerprinted in those countries. Some people are scared of this happening and have now left the accommodation and are sleeping on the streets.”

A Home Office spokesperson said: “Those arriving in the UK on small boats illegally will now be detained and returned thanks to the deal. We make no apologies for cracking down on illegal migration and securing our borders, and we are ramping up the pilot. We continue to work closely with our French counterparts to ensure the pilot operates effectively.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3737deec96d645c992ac4ab535747595338c54aa/525_0_4000_3202/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c6ebccff595bbd4e145919856c82c72",N,,2025-10-24 01:57:00.325090

The shutdown will last at least until Tuesday, when the Senate is scheduled to vote next on legislation to reopen the government.
Federal workers received partial paychecks, only for the days they worked before the shutdown began Oct. 1, what will be their final compensation as long as the shutdown continues.
Democrats have contested the memo, with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., calling it “another baseless attempt to try and scare” federal workers.","The Senate voted 54-45, short of the 60 votes needed to advance, against the effort that would have allowed active-duty military and some federal workers who aren’t furloughed to continue receiving paychecks during the shutdown.

Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., and John Fetterman, D-Pa., voted with Republicans to support the measure.

Following a more than 22-hour-long speech from Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., that began Tuesday night, the Senate voted 54-46 on Wednesday, falling short of the 60 votes needed to move the bill forward (no new Democrats crossed the aisle).

The bill failed again, receiving 50 “yes” votes and 43 “no” votes as seven senators did not vote.

The bill failed in a 51-45 vote, with four senators abstaining from voting and the same three members of the Democratic caucus—Fetterman, Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., and Angus King, I-Maine—voting with Republicans to advance the bill, while Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., again voted with all other Democrats against it.

A federal judge blocked firings the Trump administration has carried out during the shutdown for at least two more weeks, granting a request for a restraining order filed by federal employee unions.

Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought said the Trump administration wants “to be very aggressive where we can be in shuttering bureaucracy, not just the funding,” during an appearance on “The Charlie Kirk Show” broadcast from the White House, adding he wants to close the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau within “the next two, three months,” alleging overburdensome regulations on financial institutions.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the shutdown could cost the federal government $15 billion in output daily, warning it was beginning to “cut into muscle” of the U.S. government, he said while speaking at CNBC’s Invest in America Forum, calling on Democrats to “break away” and vote with Republicans to reopen the government.

The Senate voted 49-45 in favor of a Republican-backed bill to reopen the government, which needed 60 votes to clear the filibuster.

The White House budget office said in a post on X it will “continue the RIFs [reductions in force], and wait,” blaming “the Democrats’ intransigence” for the shutdown.

The Office of Management and Budget sent layoff notices to about 4,200 government workers Friday, with the steepest cuts hitting the Treasury Department and Department of Health and Human Services, though it rescinded some hours after announcing them, including hundreds at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Reuters reported Monday, citing an unnamed source familiar with the issue.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a press conference raised the alarm of the shutdown approaching record territory, warning that the country was “barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history.”

Kalshi’s forecast for the shutdown based on betting on its predictions market rose above 37 days, before falling slightly to 35.2—which would make it the longest government shutdown in history, breaking the record set during the first Trump administration in 2019 when a shutdown lasted 35 days.

The predictions market was offering 68% odds the shutdown will last more than 30 days and a 51% chance it will last more than 35.

Consumer sentiment was virtually unchanged from last month, dipping from 55.1 to 55, according to the University of Michigan, which reported that consumer surveys indicate the shutdown hasn’t impacted consumers’ views of the economy so far, while inflation and labor market prospects remain top concerns.

Kalshi forecasted a 28-day shutdown, with a 59% chance of it lasting more than 25 days, 50% odds it will last more than 30 days and 33% for more than 35 days. The shutdown will last at least until Tuesday, when the Senate is scheduled to vote next on legislation to reopen the government.

Federal workers received partial paychecks, only for the days they worked before the shutdown began Oct. 1, what will be their final compensation as long as the shutdown continues.

President Donald Trump said “we’ll be making cuts that will be permanent, and we’re only gonna cut Democrat programs,” in his latest threat to force Democrats to vote in favor of the Republican spending plan to reopen the government.

The Senate rejected the GOP-backed bill for a seventh time, in a 54-45 vote, short of the 60 needed to break filibuster, with no new Democratic votes supporting the legislation.

The Senate voted 54-45 for the Republican spending plan, failing to reach the 60-vote threshold needed to pass, and 52-47 against a Democratic proposal.

Johnson told reporters “I hope that the furloughed workers receive back pay, of course,” but acknowledged “there are some legal analysts who are saying that that may not be appropriate or necessary, in terms of the law requiring that back pay be provided.”

Johnson said he’s spoken to Trump about the issue, and the president agrees “he doesn’t want people to go without pay.”

Trump said “in four or five days” there will be “substantial” job cuts and “a lot of those jobs will never come back” if the shutdown continues, adding “we have a lot of things that we're going to eliminate.”

Federal workers might not receive back pay for days they have been furloughed, White House budget chief Russ Vought said in a memo, arguing a 2019 law that mandated back pay is invalid and that Congress must appropriate funds specifically for that purpose in order for employees to be paid, multiple outlets reported.

Democrats have contested the memo, with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., calling it “another baseless attempt to try and scare” federal workers.

Republicans rejected a Democratic-backed measure that would have kept the government open and also funded subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that are set to expire at the end of the year, after a vote of 50-45 largely along party lines.

A second “clean” funding bill pushed by Republicans, which would have kept the government open until at least Nov. 21 under current spending levels, also failed after a 52-42 vote—falling short of the 60-vote threshold to overcome the filibuster in the Senate.

Speaking at Monday’s press briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt blamed Democrats for the shutdown and the firings the Trump administration has threatened to enact as pressure on the opposition party.

When asked if the administration has started firing government employees, Leavitt said the Office of Management and Budget is “continuing to work with agencies on who unfortunately is going to have to be laid off if this shutdown continues.”

The Senate rejected a GOP-backed bill to avert a shutdown until at least Nov. 21 in a 54-44 vote—failing to reach the 60 votes required to advance—and also voted down the Democratic proposal.

Earlier Friday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Johnson told reporters they wouldn’t negotiate with Democrats on their demands to extend tax credits in the Affordable Care Act in exchange for their votes to break the 60-vote filibuster threshold.

The September labor market report was put on hold as the Bureau of Labor Statistics is closed due to the shutdown.

Vought announced $2.1 billion in federal funding for two major Chicago infrastructure projects—extension of the Red line and modernization of the Red and Purple lines—was “put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.”

It’s the latest move by the White House targeting federal funding in a Democratic-led state as it seeks to pressure Senate Democrats to vote alongside Republicans for a new federal funding plan that would lift the shutdown.

Thune told reporters senators would not vote over the weekend on a funding plan to avert a shutdown, meaning it would likely last until at least Monday.

Trump doubled down on threats to punish Democrats for withholding their votes on legislation to avert a shutdown, announcing he would meet with Vought “to determine which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Vought said the Office of Management and Budget was canceling $8 billion in Biden-era energy projects “to fuel the Left’s climate agenda” in states won by Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, including Colorado, California, New Jersey and New York, though it’s unclear what projects specifically will be affected.

Vought also warned in a call with House Republicans on Wednesday other infrastructure projects in New York, home to Congress’ top Democratic leaders, are under review and said the government could begin permanent layoffs due to the shutdown in a matter of days, Politico reported, citing four anonymous sources.

The administration also halted $18 billion in funding for two major New York City infrastructure projects—the Hudson Tunnel and Second Avenue Subway—to “ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles,” Vought said, with the Department of Transportation warning a review of the funding could take longer due to the shutdown.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d6c32f1206fc8b2f99b507/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-10-24 02:56:40.668321

Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biodiversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe filed suit over the summer alleging the detention center violates federal environmental laws.
But a federal three-judge panel on Sept. 4 reversed, noting that because the site had not received federal dollars, and was entirely state-run, federal environmental regulations don’t apply.
“There’s a growing mountain of evidence that Alligator Alcatraz was built in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Samples said.
“Meanwhile, the government is dragging its feet in court to dodge accountability — using the federal shutdown as an excuse to delay the appeal.","Environmental groups’ request that a federal court shutter the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center was paused Wednesday because of the government shutdown.

Led by the non-profit Friends of the Everglades, a coalition of activists had asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider its September decision to keep open the migrant detention center, located in the heart of the Everglades, despite environmental concerns.

But the court on Wednesday agreed with the Department of Homeland Security that the case should be paused until government attorneys can work again.

“The motion to stay the appeal is granted. The movant is directed to file a notice with the court when the purpose for the stay is obviated,” the two-sentence order reads.

Although this comes just weeks after the court expedited the appeal and scheduled oral arguments for January, the federal government’s shutdown on Sept. 30 set off a cascade of missed pay, furloughed workers, and in-limbo cases.

So, on Oct. 10, government attorneys, noting that many Justice Department lawyers are banned from working until the government comes online again, asked for a pause on the case until “DOJ attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions.”

How did we get here?

The state created the sprawling, 3,000-bed facility atop the seldom-used Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Big Cypress National Park, drawing scrutiny from Democrats, immigration groups, and environmental organizations since its July 1 opening.

Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biodiversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe filed suit over the summer alleging the detention center violates federal environmental laws. A district judge agreed, ordering Florida to shut down the center by September’s end. But a federal three-judge panel on Sept. 4 reversed, noting that because the site had not received federal dollars, and was entirely state-run, federal environmental regulations don’t apply.

A week later, DHS and Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie revealed that Florida had applied for federal reimbursement — though Friends of the Everglades believes the request was made earlier. On Sept. 30, the state received more than $608 million to pay for the construction, transportation, and equipment costs of the facility

The plaintiffs soon after appealed, asking the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider. When DHS pointed out that some government staff couldn’t work during the shutdown, Friends of the Everglades called the situation “regrettable” but argued it didn’t outweigh the environment “harms” caused by dragging out the case.

“An indefinite stay in this case … would cause Plaintiffs ongoing and irreversible harm where the federal action being challenged — the construction and operation of an immigration detention center in the Everglades that imperils sensitive wetlands, endangered Species, and communities in the area — would continue during the indefinite stay period,” the attorneys wrote.

When the Eleventh Circuit released its order against them, Eve Samples, executive director of the Friends of the Everglades, put out a statement calling the move a ruse to avoid accountability.

“There’s a growing mountain of evidence that Alligator Alcatraz was built in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Samples said. “Meanwhile, the government is dragging its feet in court to dodge accountability — using the federal shutdown as an excuse to delay the appeal.

“We’re more resolved than ever to keep fighting to restore the lower court’s injunction to protect the Everglades.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54627147996_e1b101abe3_k.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 11:22:51.336565

The ICE facility has been the site of ongoing protests denouncing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration in Portland.

As of Monday, the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition (PIRC) is operating out of a previously vacant unit of the Gray’s Landing building, which is also home to low-income housing.

PIRC is a nonprofit that works with immigrants and immigrant families to provide education and support, including resources to people with appointments at the ICE field office.

Joseph Grayson, a Portland resident and frequent protester outside of the ICE facility, told KATU it's a no-brainer for PIRC to operate right next door.

""It's awesome, especially for the people that's going through the immigration process,"" Grayson said. I think that would give them a little more solace, a little more security; knowing that someone is here to fight for them other than just their family; somebody with a voice that might know the legal system.""

In a letter written to Gray’s Landing residents on Monday, Margaret Salazar, CEO of REACH Community Development, which owns the building, wrote in part, “Starting this Monday, an organization called Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition (PIRC) will be operating out of a previously vacant commercial space in the Gray’s Landing building.”

According to Jaymee Cuti, spokesperson with the city of Portland, the city of Portland-initiated conversations between PIRC and REACH Community Development two weeks ago, writing, “The City of Portland proudly supports immigrants pursuing citizenship – and ensuring fair treatment for anybody interacting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”

Lauren Schmidt, REACH Fundraising & Public Relations Manager, told KATU their partnership with the city “ensures that PIRC can operate in a secure, designated space while maintaining the safety, privacy, and comfort of Gray’s Landing residents.

Long-time resident of Gray’s Landing Susan Dooley says she doesn’t mind the move and says she understands the location is ideal for the organization’s purpose.

“I think it’s probably a good idea, because if they have to go over there [to the ICE facility], it’s right across the street; they don’t have to go very far,” Dooley said. “It doesn’t bother me. They’re gonna have to have it somewhere.”

Other tenants are not so keen on the idea, concerned that it will bring even more conflicts amid ongoing protests in the area.

Gray’s Landing residents, including Dooley, say they did not receive a notice until the move was finalized, and told KATU they wish they had a say in the matter.

According to Schmidt, the collaboration with the city of Portland and PIRC “is part of REACH’s broader commitment to supporting community stability and minimizing disruption around the building due to its close proximity to the ICE facility.”

Residents of Gray’s Landing have continuously voiced their concerns with the noise and chemicals around the ICE facility.

Dooley told KATU the use of tear gas by federal agents is interfering with her ability to breathe.

“For the last few weeks, I have been extremely disoriented, and I actually have fallen three times in my apartment the last few weeks,” Dooley said. “I just feel very weak and extremely tired all the time.”

In the letter, Salazar also acknowledged the activity around the facility and said REACH is advocating for city support to help clean sidewalks as chemical munitions are continuing to be deployed on a weekly basis.

“REACH has purchased in-unit air purifiers, which will be arriving in multiple shipments beginning next week and continuing through the end of the month,” Salazar wrote to residents. “We wanted to bring these to you sooner, but delivery times were lengthier than we had hoped.”

Gray's Landing resident Lashawnda Shavers said she has lost trust in management and said this comes after she says she has been reaching out for help for months.

""You're out here tap dancing that you're doing something because you care about the community, residents, and immigrants, but no you haven't,"" Shavers said about REACH. ""I emailed in June about support for me and the other residents, and I was told to contact local authorities.""

“Yesterday, I granted a pardon for Lue Yang, a devoted family man and respected leader in Michigan’s Hmong community,” Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday morning.
Whitmer’s statement explained that the pardon sets aside Yang’s conviction, allowing him to move forward without the conviction on his record.
Despite the pardon, Yang still faces threats of deportation, as he was slated to depart on an ICE flight to Laos as of Wednesday night.
“On behalf of Khone’s son, Khamsay’s sister, Lue Yang’s wife, Ann, and their families, we are all urging ICE to bring these men home.","Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced on Thursday she had granted a pardon request for Lue Yang, a Hmong refugee and president of the Hmong Family Association of Lansing who was detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in July over a decades-old criminal conviction.

Yang was born in a refugee camp in Thailand, and came to the U.S. in 1979 as his parents fled Laos due to war and persecution for their support of the United States during the Vietnam War. In 1997, Yang was convicted on a home burglary charge, accepting a plea bargain and served a 10-month sentence.

In 2018, Yang’s conviction was expunged, however, the federal government does not recognize the expungement. Yang’s conviction complicated his immigration status, and he has been denied while applying for citizenship, State Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren), explained in a video advocating for Yang’s release. On July 15, Yang was detained by ICE while at work, and he has remained in custody since.

“Yesterday, I granted a pardon for Lue Yang, a devoted family man and respected leader in Michigan’s Hmong community,” Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday morning.

Whitmer’s statement explained that the pardon sets aside Yang’s conviction, allowing him to move forward without the conviction on his record.

Despite the pardon, Yang still faces threats of deportation, as he was slated to depart on an ICE flight to Laos as of Wednesday night.

However, Aisa Villarosa of the Asian Law Caucus, which has been working with Yang’s attorney, told the Michigan Advance that, to the best of their knowledge, Yang remains in the U.S., noting that the lack of transparency from ICE leaves family members lawyers and advocates to cobble together his location.

Xiong, who was also a Hmong refugee, has strongly advocated for Yang’s return. Xiong said she was extremely grateful for the pardon, noting that his family is still facing difficulties in navigating the legal system to have him released.

“I’m grateful for that pardon from the Governor, because that means that [Yang] will have an opportunity to fight for his release, yes, but we can only do that if he is still on U.S. soil or in U.S. air,” Xiong said.

Yang’s attorney is working to vacate his case through the county court system, Xiong said.

Rising Voices, a nonprofit organization focusing on increasing civic participation among Michigan’s Asian American residents, cheered the decision in a statement while addressing the urgent action to keep Yang in the U.S.

“My family and I need Lue to return home where he belongs. This pardon shows the power of humanity and community,” Ann Vue, Yang’s wife said in a statement. “So many people stood with us, checked in on us, and refused to allow us to give up. We applaud and thank Governor Whitmer for her courage in granting Lue this pardon. Now we demand ICE and [the U.S. Department of Homeland Security] to bring Lue home to Michigan.”

On Thursday morning, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) spoke out on the Senate floor about the deportation of several Hmong and Lao men, sharing the story of Khone Segmany, who like Yang, committed a low-level offense as a young man, as well as another man named Khamsay.

“On behalf of Khone’s son, Khamsay’s sister, Lue Yang’s wife, Ann, and their families, we are all urging ICE to bring these men home. They are members of our community, they are fathers, and their families deserve to have them by their side,” Chang said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_20251023_183750.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 01:17:09.857126

However, Trump did not say whether Customs and Border Patrol intends to deploy agents elsewhere in the Bay Area.
Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters.
Oakland and the Bay Area will “collectively stand by our beliefs that terror and that violence inflicted by the Trump administration upon this community are unwanted, unwarranted, and illegal,” Simon said.
Supervisor Nikki Fortunato Bas shared that the Board of Supervisors has invested millions of dollars in immigration legal defense services.","Less than an hour after President Donald Trump called off an immigration enforcement surge in San Francisco, East Bay leaders held a press conference to calm residents and let them know officials are prepared if the administration still moves ahead with operations in this area.

But what exactly a federal surge in Berkeley, Oakland or other cities would look like is anyone’s guess.

Facing a packed conference room in Oakland City Hall, Mayor Barbara Lee acknowledged she has “no information we can bring to you today” about the federal administration’s plans.

“The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” Lee said. “We know border patrol agents are being stationed on the Coast Guard Island, but let me be clear, we are fully prepared.”

Trump posted on Truth Social that he decided to call off a planned immigration enforcement campaign in San Francisco this Saturday after having a phone call last night with Mayor Daniel Lurie, who expressed concern that it would harm the city’s economic recovery.

However, Trump did not say whether Customs and Border Patrol intends to deploy agents elsewhere in the Bay Area. Sources told Cityside that deployments in the East Bay are still a possibility.

Lisa Hoffman, co-executive director of the East Bay Sanctuary Covenant, said her organization — which provides legal and social services, and leads know-your-rights trainings — is preparing for the possibility that federal authorities will launch operations on this side of the bay.

The advocacy group is encouraging those who could be at risk of deportation to stay home as much as they can.

In an email alert Wednesday, it advised that schools and hospitals are “generally safe,” but specifically recommended people avoid “Home Depots, the flea market and other high-traffic community spaces.” Hoffman said the advice was based on “what we’ve heard and also what we’ve seen in other cities,” where Home Depot stores have been targeted by immigration authorities.

“For those who have more protected legal status, we need to be standing up for those who may not have as much protection in this moment and offering help,” she said, which might include making trips to grocery stores or schools for neighbors who are undocumented.

“This is the time for us to be showing up for each other,” Hoffman said.

The “confusing and inconsistent” messages about the operation has added to the anxiety that both clients and staff feel at Oasis Legal Services, a nonprofit that supports LGBTQ+ immigrants, spokesperson Mateo Sánchez said. The organization is offering to meet with clients virtually or by phone, rather than having them come into its Berkeley office, Sánchez said, and has given staff the option of working from home in the coming days and weeks. That plan did not change in light of Trump’s announcement Wednesday morning.

“ICE is still around,” Sánchez said. “We don’t know what it means for the Bay Area more widely.”

Officials encourage peaceful protests

Lee and other elected officials, union representatives, and faith leaders encouraged residents to look out for one another and to peacefully protest the administration. But officials also warned people not to “take the bait” by committing any acts of violence against federal officers.

“We know that they’re baiting Oakland, and that’s why San Francisco is suddenly off the table,” said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson. “So I’m not going to be quiet about what we know is coming. We know that their expectation is that Oakland is going to do something to cause them to make us the example.”

Earlier this morning, hundreds of protesters gathered near a road that leads to an island in the Oakland estuary that houses Coast Guard facilities, where CBP agents were reported to be arriving. Demonstrators who attempted to block the road were forced to disperse after agents deployed two flash bangs so several CBP vehicles could get through.

Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters. But there are limits to that non-cooperation. Dickson noted that her office can’t stand in the way of a legal warrant. Assistant Oakland Police Chief James Beere said his department has no authority to oppose or prevent federal authorities from conducting immigration operations in Oakland.

“I want to make it clear that if anyone attempts to enter your house or detain you, and they’re not in uniform or they don’t show credentials, please call 911 immediately,” Beere said.

Congresswoman Lateefah Simon said her office will protect members of the community, including children, families, officers, and protesters.

Oakland and the Bay Area will “collectively stand by our beliefs that terror and that violence inflicted by the Trump administration upon this community are unwanted, unwarranted, and illegal,” Simon said.

In her State of the City speech Wednesday night, Berkeley Mayor Adena Ishii told an audience of supporters, “The moment that we’ve been preparing for as a city has arrived.”

Ishii echoed calls for people to express their opposition to the federal action peacefully.

“The feds are looking to make an example of us — they want a reason to send the National Guard here,” she said. “We want to circumvent them. When we protest, we must protest like we always do: peacefully and with intention.”

Ramped up efforts to defend against deportations

Several officials summarized efforts they’re taking to bolster the region’s defenses against federal incursions. Supervisor Nikki Fortunato Bas shared that the Board of Supervisors has invested millions of dollars in immigration legal defense services. The board also recently agreed to create an office focused on immigrant affairs to coordinate services throughout the county.

Lourdes Martinez, directing attorney of the immigrant rights practice at Centro Legal De La Raza, said ICE has already been operating in Alameda County. Her group, which runs a pro bono immigrant legal defense program, is anticipating an escalation, similar to what’s been seen in Washington D.C., Chicago, and Portland.

“If there has been deployment of federal law enforcement, it has really strengthened ICE and their ability to execute more detentions,” Martinez said. “So that is what we’re bracing for.”

The county also revived this year a rapid response hotline, which residents can use to call in reports of ICE activity. Martinez encouraged people to call the line instead of spreading unverified reports on other platforms. She also shared practical advice for immigrants, including that people should memorize important phone numbers and gather and keep safe documents like passports and medical records. She also recommended that people use PIN passcodes on their phones and consider disabling fingerprint or facial recognition on their cellphones.

“Just remember we are living under difficult times where ICE is allowed to racially profile,” she said.

Mike McBride, pastor of the Berkeley church The Way, advised young people to “not get caught up” engaging with federal officers, and to carry IDs and attend know-your-rights trainings.

“We will outlast this wickedness in high places, Oakland will counter hate, lies, and misinformation with love for all people,” McBride said. “Truth, justice, peace and joy. And we beg the Congress, please release the Epstein files.”",https://newspack-berkeleyside-cityside.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7741-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 23:56:25.713997

The leaf blower ordinance was adopted by the City Council in 2021, banning the use of gasoline or propane-powered leaf blowers after April 1, 2023.
Tickets for the use of these leaf blowers will only be issued to property owners in the village, rather than contractors.

The moratorium’s purpose is to ensure landscapers’ safety and mitigate confusion regarding reporting of an ordinance violation by community members, according to the city’s website.

“We put a moratorium on enforcement of our leaf blower ordinance, and this is after (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) covered landscapers in Evanston just yesterday, and we received numerous requests from the community and from councilmembers to pause enforcement during this time,” Chief Legislative Policy Advisor Liza Roberson-Young said at the city’s Community Preparedness & Empowerment Seminar on Wednesday night.

Roberson-Young confirmed at the event that ICE targeted a landscaper in Evanston Tuesday.

Early Wednesday morning, an entire landscaping team was detained by ICE agents near the intersection of Waukegan Road and Church Street in Morton Grove, a Chicago suburb west of Evanston, according to an Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights alert sent around 11:18 a.m.

The moratorium is one of the efforts the city has taken to protect residents against federal agents. Since the beginning of the year, the city has strengthened its Welcoming City ordinance and more recently, City Council voted to establish “ICE free zones” on city property.

The leaf blower ordinance was adopted by the City Council in 2021, banning the use of gasoline or propane-powered leaf blowers after April 1, 2023.

Previously, violations of the ordinance with a signed witness statement and detailed description of the violation taking place were to be submitted to the city during business hours or to the Evanston Police Department’s non-emergency line outside of business hours. Violators received written warnings for first offenses and then increasing fines for further violations.

This will not be enforced under the temporary moratorium, which is effective through Dec. 31.

On Oct. 14, Oak Park also issued temporary changes to the enforcement of its own ban on gasoline-powered leaf blowers in reaction to heightened activity of federal agents in the area. Tickets for the use of these leaf blowers will only be issued to property owners in the village, rather than contractors.

Nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Republicans, the facility has been a source of controversy.

What we know:

The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request from the Trump administration to halt proceedings while the shutdown continues.

The lawsuit, filed by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — later joined by the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida — challenges the facility’s operation on environmental grounds. The plaintiffs argue that federal law requires an environmental impact review before projects like the detention center can proceed.

In August, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered that operations at the facility be wound down. However, in September, a three-judge appellate panel stayed that order while the federal government appealed.

What we don't know:

It remains unclear when the case will resume, as the duration of the shutdown will determine when Department of Justice attorneys can return to work. The long-term future of the detention center is also uncertain.

The backstory:

The detention center has been a flashpoint in Florida’s immigration and environmental debates. Environmental advocates say it sits within sensitive Everglades habitat and was constructed without the legally required environmental assessments.

The case has drawn attention from both immigration attorneys and state watchdog groups. Separate lawsuits have been filed on behalf of detainees claiming inadequate legal access, and Friends of the Everglades has accused the state of withholding public records about the facility’s funding and management.

At the event, organized by the nonprofit Children’s Rights, panelists spoke on a variety of issues, including U.S. immigration policies, zero-tolerance school discipline and the harm caused by racial inequities in the foster care system.

A second panel discussion featured child welfare advocates, parents and former foster youth who spoke out against family separation and injustice perpetuated by child maltreatment investigations.

Panelists came together in response to what they view as a concerning pullback of U.S. participation in the protection of human rights on a global stage. In August, the federal government announced it would withdraw from the Universal Periodic Review — a nearly two-decade old program created by the U.N.’s Human Rights Council (HRC) that calls for a peer review of human rights records for all 193 member states.

According to Reuters, a U.S. state department official said participating in the review would imply endorsement of the council’s “persistent failure to condemn the most egregious human rights violators” and that the U.S. would not be “lectured about our human rights record by the likes of HRC members such as Venezuela, China, or Sudan.”

Global advocates denounced the U.S. decision to back out of the review, which occurs roughly every five years. Reports are reviewed by other members who offer non-binding recommendations. The U.S. was due to submit its report this November but has until July 2027.

Youth advocates consider the decision a signal of federal officials’ increasing apathy about the futures of vulnerable young people.

“They know that this is a review that will highlight the violations that are happening daily,” Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Human Rights Program, said about the federal government.

Dakwar serves on a prominent New York based civil rights panel that advises the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. The group released a first-of-its-kind report last year demonstrating persistent discriminatory treatment of Black families in the state’s child welfare system, and asked Congress to implement certain changes.

Panelists came together Wednesday to demonstrate their unwillingness to allow these issues to be ignored, despite the government “doing everything in its power to circumvent accountability,” activist Joyce McMillan said.

“We have to hold them accountable and bring the human rights recommendations to them and push for the changes, whether to change the laws as they stand, abolish some of those laws that are really harmful and to enact ones that are consistent with international human rights law,” Dakwar added.

Domestic injustice also addressed

Although the global role of the U.S. prompted the gathering, domestic concerns drove the discussions.

Former foster youth on one panel described a culture of loneliness, abuse, and lack of mental healthcare access in foster care.

“Our stories carry the evidence that policies alone can’t capture — the fear of a knock on the door, or the loss of your child without due process.”

— Activist Tatiana Rodriguez

Youth advocate Jasiyah Gilbert, 24, spoke about the trauma he endured when he was separated from his family and placed in a group home. His mother struggled with housing and mental health issues, which the child welfare agency classified as neglect.

“It was a very carceral, jail-like environment where they’re told when to eat, when to use the bathroom,” Gilbert said of his and other foster youth’s experiences in congregate care settings. “Often, their education is sacrificed.”

Foster children frequently run away and end up homeless after being separated, he added. Solutions to the problem should focus on strengthening families by providing housing vouchers, cash assistance and other community services, he said.

Activists April Lee from Philadelphia and Tatiana Rodriguez of Massachusetts emphasized the importance of sharing parental perspectives regarding CPS investigations and foster care with policy makers.

“I also survived the system as a third generation foster youth and a parent being investigated, and I eventually lost my son,” Rodriguez shared. “Our stories carry the evidence that policies alone can’t capture — the fear of a knock on the door, or the loss of your child without due process.”

Panelist and attorney David Shalleck-Klein called the harms caused by the child welfare system “one of the most important civil rights issues of our time,” and pointed to a history of “illegal” practices by child welfare agencies in New York. Last year, he was part of a team that filed a class-action lawsuit defending the rights of parents under a child maltreatment investigation.

It’s easy for attorneys to identify that Fourth Amendment rights are violated when government agents enter homes without court orders, Shalleck-Klein said, or when “children are torn from parents” without judicial oversight.

“The hard part,’’ he said, “is understanding: How do we use the tools that we have as advocates to end up at a place where that stops happening?”",https://imprintnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unitednations.jpg,N,,2025-10-24 01:00:46.185599

6:30 p.m. — Day 1 rally at Embarcadero, “We cannot claim victory yet”

Despite the “surge” of federal troops being called off, a crowd began to gather at Embarcadero Plaza on Wednesday evening bearing signs declaring “No Kings” and “No ICE or troops in the Bay.”

As the plaza filled with people, the event kicked off with local singer La Doña and a spiritual ceremony from the Danzantes del Bahia. Inside the plexiglass enclosure of the plaza’s temporary padelball court, a few muscular men in short shorts bounced around the astroturf, seemingly oblivious to (or unconcerned by) the goings-on.

“Whose head is spinning from all the news in the last 48 hours?” shouted one speaker. But, she said, “we cannot claim victory yet.” Protesters were encouraged to “adopt a corner” and look out for ICE activity.

“You should be proud of this,” added labor organizer David Huerta. You’ve kept ICE out of San Francisco.”

“But they’re still in Memphis, they’re still in D.C.” he reminded the growing crowd. “We need to continue to stand together.”

Some speeches at the 5pm rally mirrored closely those given at the noon rally, but District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder escalated her language from earlier: “While I’m here, I’ll just say. Fuck Marc Benioff. Fuck Elon Musk. Fuck David Sacks. Any anyone who ever suggested that this was okay.”

Fielder urged attendees to stay vigilant, noting that there was no guarantee that President Donald Trump could change course and send federal agents into the city any time.

District 5 Supervisor Bilal Mahmood condemned the current administration as a “dictatorship” that he compared to the one he lived under in Pakistan as a teenager. Toppling that dictatorship required people in the streets everyday, he said: “When a dictator sees that the people oppose him, he loses his power.”

“So many students didn’t show up in school today,” added Supervisor Chyanne Chen. “We don’t want them in our schools, in our hospitals … San Francisco is a sanctuary city. We will never back down. We will never leave anyone behind.”

Just before 6:30 p.m., organizers prepared the crowd, which now numbered at least a thousand, for a march to the Sansome Street immigration court. Vigils at public libraries tomorrow would continue as planned, they said.

“We didn’t see the invasion that we were worried about,” said Jane, an organizer with Bay Resistance, her voice trembling with emotion as she spoke. “What we did see today, is that the Bay is ready.” And with that, the crowd was on the march.

4 p.m. — An email to city employees on “federal deployment and employee safety protocols”

San Francisco city employees were sent an update on “federal deployment and employee safety protocols” via email on Thursday afternoon.

Employees were reminded that federal law prohibits the City from interfering with federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement. They may not prevent Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from accessing a public area of a city building or transit, said an email reviewed by Mission Local.

At the same time, city and state sanctuary policies prohibit employees from participating in immigration enforcement by giving ICE agents access to non-public buildings or records. Employees must only cooperate if there is a subpoena or warrant issued by a federal court.

They are also not required to show ICE agents personal identification or answer agents’ questions, the email added.

3 p.m. — City announces plan to dedicate $3.4 million more for immigrant legal defense and Rapid Response Network

Hours after President Trump withdrew a threat to send a “surge” of federal agents to San Francisco,” Supervisor Connie Chan announced that San Francisco would direct an additional $3.5 million to immigrant legal defense and the Rapid Response Network.”

The legal defense funds lawyers for immigrants who need representation, and the Rapid Response Network provides a 24 hour hotline for verifying ICE raids and connecting detained immigrants to attorneys.

Chan, the chair of the city’s Budget Committee, made the announcement alongside her co-sponsors Supervisors Bilal Mahmood, Chyanne Chen, Jackie Fielder and Shamann Walton.

“Despite this morning’s news, we know federal agents have been in San Francisco already. For months, we’ve seen how those attempting to follow our legal process abiding by the law at immigration centers are detained during routine check-ins,” Mahmood said.

2:55 p.m. — I told the mayor, “I love what you’re doing,” Trump says

As reported by the New York Times, President Trump spoke highly of Mayor Daniel Lurie at a White House round table. “I love what you’re doing,” he said to the Mayor. The comment comes following a phone call between Trump and Lurie, where Trump stated he would reverse his decision to deploy federal agents in San Francisco, including a planned “surge” in agents on Saturday. It is unclear how surrounding cities in the Bay Area will be affected.

District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder wrote: “I remain concerned that the Mayor’s statement today included that he would ’welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and the U.S. Attorney,’” in response to a previous announcement by Lurie.

At a press conference on Thursday, Fielder said she has “concerns that any federal agency under Trump is actually taking up immigration enforcement,” in response to Lurie potentially working with Pam Bondi and the FBI.

“We cannot have it both ways. We cannot say, I welcome this, but I don’t welcome that,” District 10 Supervisor Shamann Walton added.

12:40 p.m. — Trump’s conversation with Mayor Lurie answers some questions, raises others

At noon, Mayor Daniel Lurie, city department heads,and supervisors gathered in the mayor’s office to address President Donald Trump’s decision to call off the “surge” of San Francisco.

What exactly that “surge” would look like did not seem to have been defined over the course of Lurie’s conversation with Trump.

Lurie did not give answers to which federal agents would no longer be coming to the city — whether it be the National Guard, the border patrol agents, ICE — or all of them.

Lurie also said that his conversation did not include what will happen to other Bay Area cities.

“I was told the surge was being called off,” Lurie said. “He only spoke about San Francisco. So all I can say is what he told me.”

In addition to Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Lurie said he has also spoken with United States Attorney General Pam Bondi about working together to “hold drug traffickers accountable.”

In a Truth Social post, Trump said that he called Lurie after speaking with Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO — who on Oct. 9 called for the National Guard to come to San Francisco — and Jensen Huang, the president and CEO of NVIDIA.

Lurie said that he had not asked anyone to make calls on San Francisco’s behalf — “he picked up the phone and called me.”

Lurie affirmed that even with the “surge” called off for now, San Francisco will remain ready.

“I think we as a city should be prepared for any scenario,” Lurie said.

12:20 p.m. — Oakland mayor unsure if The Town is still a target

Oakland mayor Barbara Lee tells Mission Local that the situation is “fluid” and “all we know is what the press is reporting.” She confirms that “I haven’t heard from the president.”

Following a briefing from Lurie’s office, area politicians believe that the area will return for whatever passes as the “status quo.” There is no indication feds will instead raid nearby Bay Area cities. But there is no assurance that it won’t happen.

Meanwhile, Immigration enforcement activity has risen sharply in Oakland, according to Alameda County’s Rapid Response Network (ACILEP). It reported that its call volume increased from an average of 10 calls a day to 50 by 11:30 a.m.

Neither the Asian Law Caucus nor the Rapid Response networks in San Francisco or San Mateo County could confirm whether the cancellation of a federal deployment in San Francisco also included a stand-down of planned immigration operations in the region.

“No one knows for sure right now” whether Trump’s immigration enforcement will escalate across the Bay Area, said Lauren Nguyen of the Asian Law Caucus said.

12.01 p.m. — Despite news that the president has called off federal agents from entering San Francisco, at least 100 protesters gathered at City Hall for a rally at noon.

One man, Noah, came all the way from Sacramento, where he has been protesting daily outside an ICE facility where he believes people are being detained.

He said he wasn’t affiliated with an organization, and it has been just “me myself and I, and a couple of friends that are passionate about human rights.”

“If there was ever a time for us to be unified in San Francisco, it is now,” said Supervisor Shamann Walton, who started off the rally on the steps of City Hall. “We do not trust this administration. To say you’re not coming after you say you’re coming… we want to make sure our community is prepared.”

Rally emcee Sofia Bastida asked those gathered about the purported change in plans for ICE to enter San Francisco: “How are we feeling about that?”

Attendees hiss in response.

Supervisor Jackie Fielder accused tech billionaires like Marc Benioff, Elon Musk, and David Sacks of bringing about the current situation.

“I condemn every tech billionaire who supported this,” Fielder said. “We are here because Benioff of Salesforce put this idea into Trump’s head.”

“We cannot have tunnel vision,” said Olga Miranda, the head of the Local 87 labor union. She urged unity across the Bay Area. “An injury to one, an injury to all.”

As cars and trucks drove past City Hall, drivers honked in solidarity.

Those present were attentive and ready for action. Asked to repeat the rapid response network phone number, most in the crowd appeared to already know it and chanted the number in unison. (For those in San Francisco, the number is 415-200-1548.)

Celi Tamayo-Lee of SF Rising assured the crowd that the fight would continue and that the 5 p.m. mass rally to unite the region is still on.

That, she said, “is where we really show what we are about in the Bay Area.”

10:00 a.m. — Plans to deploy federal officers in San Francisco have been called off, according to a statement from Mayor Daniel Lurie.

Lurie wrote that he received a phone call from President Donald Trump last night, though he waited to release the statement till 9:30 a.m. this morning. What arrangements preceded that call are not known.

“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning,” he wrote.

“My team will continue to monitor the situation closely, and our city remains prepared for any scenario.”

Shortly thereafter, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social saying “we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.” He attributed this decision to “friends of mine who live in the area,” naming Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. His post ended: “Stay tuned!”

Advocates say the change only affects the potential National Guard or military deployment, not ICE or Customs and Border Patrol operations.

Border patrol agents already have federal authority to operate in any U.S. city, while National Guard troops generally require legal authorization for domestic use, though those limits have weakened under Trump-appointed judges.

The fate of other Bay Area cities was not mentioned. Mission Local‘s message for Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee has not yet been returned.

Protesters march outside Coast Guard Island

2:15 p.m. — Two protestors arrested by California Highway Patrol

Over 60 California Highway Patrol officers in riot gear marched in on protesters. Using batons, they pushed protestors off the street to make a tunnel for a caravan of vehicles to exit the base. Two protesters were arrested and walked off with their hands zip-tied behind their backs. One man, who resisted being moved, was grabbed by CHP officers and subdued to the ground with an elbow to the neck.

10:03 a.m. — Trump says federal agents “will not surge” S.F.

President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that after a phone call with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie last night, the federal government “will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.”

The post follows days of uncertainty and online rumors that Trump was planning a mass raid at a Home Depot within 40 miles of San Francisco this weekend.

Trump wrote that “friends of mine who live in the area called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge” because Lurie was making “substantial progress” on crime. He added that business leaders, including Jensen Huang and Marc Benioff, had contacted him to express optimism about the city’s recovery.

Still, organizers and advocates are urging caution, noting that Trump’s statement does not necessarily rule out immigration enforcement or other federal activity in the region. They emphasize that people in surrounding cities should stay alert and prepared in case the situation changes.

9:45 a.m. — Alameda Fire Department outside Coast Guard Island

A fire truck and two other Alameda Fire Department vehicles arrive at the intersection of Dennison Street and Embarcadero. They’re met with protesters.

Officers say they’ve arrived to take someone who was injured on the island to the hospital. Soon after, a man who was not involved in the protest is wheeled through the crowd on a stretcher.

The size of the crowd dwindles, but at 11 a.m. protesters are still circling the intersection. What appears to be pieces of a white vehicle and a flash grenade canister still litter the road, on both sides of the U.S. government property line.

9:20 a.m. — In the Mission, some workers stay home, others taking the risk

In the Mission District, many Latino-owned businesses are shuttered. Despite widespread fear, some street vendors continue to sell, and a few stores remain open.

“Since yesterday, there are fewer people out,” said street vendor María V. “They’re very scared.”

María said she’s part of several neighborhood groups keeping watch for any potential presence of federal agents. Some workers who spoke to El Tecolote anonymously said they were required to come into work, but hoped their employers would soon decide to close.

9 a.m. — Protesters singing

As the sun rises, the mood shifts from a standoff in the dark to skipping in the streets; literally, there’s a jump rope. Parents have brought their children. The crowd thins out slightly.

One protester wears a Stewie Griffin mask, another an inflatable chicken suit with a sign that says “Why did the chicken cross the road?” Faith leaders sing “We Shall Overcome” while a clown makes balloon animals.

— Abigail Vân Neely and Mariana Garcia, Mission Local

7:30 a.m. — Vehicle injures protester

The scene is less tense, but even more crowded, with at least 100 people.

Protesters continue to move back and forth along the crosswalk dividing the road to Coast Guard Island, but their numbers have grown, and the pace has slowed to a shuffle.

The road is now impassable. There is a line of cars backed up along Embarcadero East.

One protester, Matthew Leber, 50, limps away from the crosswalk. He says he was struck by the driver of a SUV, who refused to immediately back up when the crowd blocked the road.

“I’m still taking it in. I feel okay. I feel really proud of people standing up here against fascism,” he says. He sits on the curb and props up his leg, which is red.

Leaders reorganize the crowd to keep people moving around four crosswalks at the intersection of Embarcadero East and Dennison St. Observers with the National Lawyers’ Guild take notes to send to attorneys, if needed.

7:15 a.m. — Crowd blocks Border Patrol vehicles, flash grenades deployed

Protestors block a large white vehicle attempting to drive down the one road onto Coast Guard Island, despite organizers’ instructions to keep walking.

An officer gets between the vehicle and the crowd. Other cars start honking. Protesters are told to stay back from the blue paint designating U.S. government property beyond the crosswalk.

Two flash grenades are set off by Border Patrol as pickup trucks carrying a handful of federal agents drive through the crowd and across the bridge.

Protesters who were near the flash grenades, which can cause temporary blindness or deafness, step back to pour water over their faces. A faith leader is covered in debris from the smoke cloud the flash grenades emitted.

U.S. Coast Guard officers form a line opposite the demonstration.

6:30 a.m. — ‘We have to say no’

A couple dozen protesters are standing on either side of the one road leading into Coast Guard Island in Alameda, where federal immigration agents are set to arrive today.

Two U.S. Coast Guard officers are conducting traffic. A white shuttle bus has been let through, along with other cars driven by people who work on the island. There is a checkpoint further down the bridge.

An organizer is reminding protesters to keep moving: if they stand still in the crosswalk across the bridge, the organizer says, it will be considered an “obstruction.” It is still dark.

The organizer says law enforcement has instructed cars to keep driving as pedestrians continue walking back and forth. They play “Antipatriarcha,” a Spanish protest song by Ana Tijoux, on a speaker, and try to address the Coast Guard officers, who do not engage.

“ICE is on the island,” repeats a man who has been standing in the center of the intersection of Embarcadero East and Dennison St. for at least the last half hour. “We have to say no.”

The stream of people repeatedly crossing the road grows. One carries a small dog, called Rudy, short for Rutabaga. Rudy was brought to the protest because “he hates ICE,” his owner said. “He loves all his neighbors and he doesn’t want to lose any.”

Faith leaders begin to sing “We Shall Not Be Moved.”

“So much has been done in this administration under the name of God or some twisted version of Christianity,” said Reverend Penny Nixon with the Peninsula Solidarity Cohort. “In the Christian religion it is very clear everyone is our neighbor.”

Earlier in the day:

News of federal immigration agents coming to the Bay Area confirmed San Francisco officials’ worst fears. Though attention was recently focused on the possibility of the National Guard being sent in, those troops are heavily proscribed in their actions. Immigration agents are not.

More protests were planned for Thursday in San Francisco: The group Bay Resistance called for a “Hands Off the Bay” rally at 5 p.m. at the Embarcadero.

City officials rushed into action on Wednesday. Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a press conference that “Immigration officials are deployed to use aggressive enforcement tactics that instill fear so people don’t feel safe going about their daily lives.” He signed an executive directive reminding city workers that they cannot, in most cases, participate in immigration enforcement.

Mission residents on Wednesday reacted with a range of emotions to the news: shrugs, fear, and support. Many said they are carrying their papers, just in case.

El Tecolote and Mission Local have put together resource guides for those wondering how to protect themselves.

Mission Local and El Tecolote are teaming up to provide a live blog for up-to-date developments in federal immigration agents’ deployment to the Bay Area.

9:55 a.m. — At a food bank in the Mission

Claudia woke up to news of the arrival of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers at the Coast Guard base in Alameda. “The volunteers are fearful right now, “ she said in Spanish. She stood outside of La Ofrenda, a community space that offers free groceries to San Francisco residents. Behind her, about four other volunteers unpacked cardboard boxes of food.

“I feel bad that right now ICE is detaining anyone irrespective of if they have documents or not,” she continued. “They will detain you if you speak Spanish and look Latino or are brown.”

Roberto Eligió Alfaro, executive director of the non-profit Homey S.F., which supports Ofrenda, said that they now serve 200 families, but fear of ICE is keeping some home. Since the start of last month, Alfaro and José Luis Pavón have also helped operate Defensa Del Barrio, a patrol that visits neighbors in the Mission to inform them of their rights if they encounter ICE. They’ve met with about 50 businesses as well as a hundred families. “We cannot bow down to fear,” said Pavón in Spanish. “That is what Trump wants.”

Over on the 14 Muni, a woman from Daly City said in Spanish, “Truthfully, I’m not fearful about this. I’m OK.”

Others expressed worry over the news. An elderly man named Terry said he was worried that if President Trump cuts EBT and other resources he relies on, he and his neighbors could “end up on the streets.”

“If they’re coming to intimidate and toughen us up, I’ve got a problem with that,” Terry said, of CBPs arrival. “I know a lot of people that I haven’t seen lately, and I think they know that ICE is coming and that they’ve gone underground.” He added, “It makes me feel bad; it’s them, but it could be me next.”

“The world is messed up, period,” added Douglas, another man. “It’s going to take a while to fix it.”

6:30 a.m. — Immigrants carry passports ahead of potential crackdown

Last night, residents in the Mission District reacted to the planned deployment with emotions ranging from fear to calm.

More are carrying documents to prove citizenship, and at least one thought it was a good idea to send in federal agents. Many were still unaware that the president’s threats to deploy troops had escalated, with agents set to land at the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda on Thursday.

Those in the know largely remained calm.

“I’m good. I’m okay. I have papers, I have my license. I work here every day,” said Luis Ledesma who runs a jewelry stall near 22nd Street. He said he usually carries a copy of his documents with him, though he forgot to bring them today.

Others also said they are carrying their documents, believing that having proof of their status was the best way to prevent harm when faced with federal immigration agents. That hasn’t always been the case.

Originally from Nicaragua, Myriai Evarra, 59, and her cousin Chalina Mena, 62, have been carrying their passports and Real IDs with them everywhere for the last year, “just in case.” On Wednesday evening they were engaged in a spirited debate at the 24th Street Mission BART Plaza.

Evarra argued that federal agents should come to San Francisco to “clean up the drugs.” Mena disagreed.

When Mena insisted that immigration agents will not be involved in drug-related enforcement, Evarra insisted that “they will at least do something.”

The federal agents are “not going to fix fentanyl or the drugs. That’s an excuse to go after immigrants. I am angry because they are going to get very violent with people,” said Mena. When asked if she was afraid, she said she was more “uncomfortable” than afraid.

6 a.m. — How to prepare for immigration enforcement

Consulting with attorneys and immigration advocates, Mission Local has compiled a list of know-your-rights tips for people in San Francisco.

For protesters:

If you plan to participate in a protest, have a plan to contact legal assistance, such as the National Lawyers Guild’s S.F. Bay Area chapter.

You have the right to peacefully assemble and to record law enforcement officers in public spaces.

If stopped by law enforcement, you have the right to remain silent and don’t have to answer questions about your immigration status.

If you are stopped on the streets:

You must stay where you are until an officer tells you that you are free to go.

You don’t have to unlock your phone for any government officer who does not have a warrant.

For immigrants and their families:

When encountering law enforcement, you have the right to remain silent and are advised to refuse to answer questions about your birthplace, immigration status, or how you entered the country.

You have the right to refuse a search, and to prevent immigration enforcement agents from entering your home or workplace without a valid warrant signed by a judge.

You have the right to speak with a lawyer first and ask for interpretation services. Do not sign any document before talking to an attorney.

Keep the red card with you to assert your rights under the U.S. Constitution. These cards can also be used in various ways, including being slipped under your front door or being given directly to immigration enforcement offices to declare your rights to remain silent.

Save the number 415-200-1548 on your phone. This is the San Francisco Rapid Response network’s 24-hour hotline that connects detained immigrants and their families with legal aid and support.

Fill out an emergency preparedness plan in case you are arrested, such as the one offered by the San Francisco Immigrant Legal & Education Network. Make sure both you and your family member have your A-Number, full name, date of birth and country of origin. Make copies of your passport and immigration documents and ensure your family can access them.

Carry evidence that you have been in the United States for longer than two years to reduce the risk of being placed in a deportation process without the chance to argue your case.

Last night:

About 5,000 people attended an online mobilization call held by Bay Resistance on Wednesday evening to prepare for the arrival of federal agents in the Bay Area, according to organizers.

Speakers from labor groups, attorneys, and nonprofits called for peaceful protests, but also action. They gave attendees advice on to interact with federal agents, document detentions, and to inform a rapid response network if they saw immigration enforcement.

Organizers also urged participants to join an adopt-a-block program to observe areas where immigrant day laborers might congregate. Meanwhile, hundreds of questions flooded in from attendees eager to participate.

Emily Lee of the Bay Rising Alliance, who led the call, said organizers have learned from federal agents’ actions in other cities and that the group is prepared for the coming days.

She called for humor and joy in the coming actions that would start early Thursday morning, with a vigil on the road from the Alameda Coast Guard Island to San Francisco.

“We are not going to give them the spectacle they want,” she said.

The assertion came in response to a question from Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan of the Federal District Court in Washington. Judge Sooknanan was exploring the government’s position in a challenge brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which claims the extraterritorial detention is illegal.

She asked if Kristi Noem, the secretary, could send immigration detainees to any U.S. military base around the world.

“I don’t see why not,” replied August E. Flentje, a senior Justice Department lawyer.

Judge Sooknanan is deciding whether to confer class action status on migrants held in homeland security custody at the U.S. base at Guantánamo Bay. The A.C.L.U. requested that status, arguing that the operation is illegal because the men are in a limbo between deportation and detention on U.S. soil, where they have greater rights.

Over the summer, the Trump administration also held eight men at a U.S. military base in Djibouti while it fought and defeated a court challenge over its plans to deport them to South Sudan.

The A.C.L.U. challenge accuses the current administration of housing small numbers of men at Guantánamo, rather then in U.S. facilities, as part of a messaging strategy “to frighten immigrants, deter future migration, induce self-deportation and coerce people in detention to give up claims against removal and accept deportation elsewhere.” It has called conditions inhumane, and the detainees’ access to legal counsel inadequate.

“The land is going to be next,” Trump said during a press conference after a roundtable with members of his administration.
During the press conference Thursday, Trump denied a Wall Street Journal report that the country flew Air Force B-1 bombers near Venezuela earlier in the day.
Some analysts have speculated that the Trump administration’s anti-narcotics efforts are actually a pretext for trying to oust President Nicolás Maduro, who Trump has called a “narco-terrorist”.
Democrats and even some of Trump’s strongest supporters have questioned the administration’s military strikes against Venezuela.","Donald Trump said on Thursday that his administration could soon expand its military attacks on alleged drug smugglers from Venezuela and also begin pursuing them on land.

Trump, who has faced questions over whether he has the legal authority to use lethal force against the people in boats from Venezuela, said during a press conference he was not sure whether the administration would seek approval from Congress to attack people from the South American country over land.

“The land is going to be next,” Trump said during a press conference after a roundtable with members of his administration. “And we may go to the Senate; we may go to the Congress and tell them about it, but I can’t imagine they’d have any problem with it.”

Trump and the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, have justified the nine strikes in the Caribbean and Pacific side of South America, which have killed at least 37 people, by describing the alleged drug traffickers as terrorists.

“Just as al-Qaida waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth posted on social media Wednesday, adding that “there will be no refuge or forgiveness – only justice”.

Francisco Miranda, a U.S. citizen born in California, was allegedly arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials outside his work in North Portland Oct. 2.

After threatening him with a dog and holding him at the Portland ICE facility for several hours, ICE officials drove Miranda back to his work with no explanation for his detainment.

On Monday, a representative from California and a Connecticut senator announced the joint congressional investigation of arrests of U.S. citizens by immigration officials since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term.

In a statement, U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats, said, “President Trump has embraced the use of federal immigration agents to terrorize communities nationwide whose politics he disfavors, a campaign that has increasingly ensnared U.S. citizens.”

Garcia is a ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. Blumenthal is a ranking member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.

Their announcement of the “bicameral inquiry” came after an investigation by ProPublica found more than 170 American citizens have been detained by immigration officials this year.

Michael Fuller, a Portland attorney representing Miranda, said he spoke with Blumenthal about Miranda’s arrest on Monday.

Fuller said he hopes the inquiry reveals what sort of probable cause existed for Miranda’s “false arrest.”

The attorney said he has asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to explain probable cause for Miranda’s arrest, but the agency has not responded. As previously reported, Fuller sent a tort claim to DHS and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem Oct. 6.

The tort demanded DHS produce documents that showed probable cause by Oct. 13.

‘What do you mean ‘overstay’?’

When ICE agents confronted Miranda in the parking lot outside his work around 6 a.m. Oct. 2, he immediately told them he was an American citizen and tried to show them his driver’s license, according to Fuller.

The federal agents then showed Miranda a photo of himself working on a fishing boat more than 10 years ago and asked, “Is this you?”

Miranda responded that it was him and restated that he was a citizen. The officers then said he was here on an “overstay,” suggesting he stayed in the U.S. beyond the time authorized by a visa.

In a video of the arrest, which Miranda filmed and his attorney shared with OPB, Miranda is heard saying, “What do you mean overstay? I don’t know what that is.”

Speaking with OPB on Wednesday, Fuller said, “I just hope to find out exactly – where did they get this information and why did they find it reliable enough to dispatch seven armed agents to come arrest and detain our client?”

Fuller said the only sort of explanation they’ve received for Miranda’s arrest came when ICE agents were driving him back to his work and told him sometimes the parents of people born outside the U.S. lie to their children about where they were born.

Miranda had a federally-approved Real ID, his attorney said, which is only available to citizens and legal residents.

In their own letter to Noem sent Monday, Blumenthal and Garcia also asked for documentation explaining the arrests of Miranda and other detained citizens.

The letter notes how the impacts of Trump’s escalation in immigration enforcement disproportionately impact certain communities, including the Portland area, and states the arrests coincide with “an alarming increase in racial profiling.”

After Miranda’s arrest, U.S. Rep. Janelle Bynum, the Democrat whose district includes Milwaukie, also called for an investigation into Miranda’s arrest.

“These ICE raids are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act, when the U.S. Marshalls would hunt down and kidnap Black Americans,” Bynum said in a press release about the incident.

The Trump administration’s threats and harassment have spooked immigrant workers and businesses alike, and Los Angeles has at times felt like the epicenter of that tumult.","When Kent Wong died Oct. 8, labor and immigrant rights leaders across the country mourned the loss of a giant. For decades, Wong’s calm presence and iron will spurred significant advances in protections for immigrants and workers, especially those who were undocumented.

In Los Angeles, where the activist, organizer and educator was born and lived, the sense of grief among Wong’s friends and his longtime colleagues has been palpable. But the immigrant and labor movements also are wrestling with a different issue: What will happen to the myriad projects throughout California of which Wong was such a driving force?

“I worry about what the future’s going to be like without him,” said David Sickler, the former longtime regional director of the AFL-CIO, who was among the earliest organizers of immigrant labor in Los Angeles in the late 1980s and worked extensively with Wong on the issue over the ensuing years. Noting such Wong-led efforts as UCLA’s Dream Resource Center to support undocumented youth, Sickler added, “I am concerned for the many movements that he’s been a part of.”

By one friend’s count, Wong was actively involved in 14 different labor- and immigrant-related projects when he died at 69 from cardiopulmonary failure. Among his most recent achievements was guiding and supporting the 2023 creation of new labor research centers at five University of California campuses: UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside and UC San Diego. Those join existing labor research facilities at UC Merced, UC Berkeley and Wong’s longtime professional home, the UCLA Labor Center.

“Those [new] centers are in their infancy,” Sickler said. “Without seasoned, guiding hands like Kent’s, they can stumble and fail, and universities can just get rid of them” — a concern that feels all too valid amid the Trump administration’s multipronged ongoing attack on university funding.

'Unwavering commitment to protecting and uplifting immigrant workers'

A fifth-generation Chinese American, Wong spent his career building a case for such initially unpopular ideas as protections for immigrant workers. He was a staff attorney for the Service Employees International Union, then led a seemingly endless series of initiatives — all of which had labor and immigration justice at their heart. (Disclosure: SEIU is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)

Vice president of the California Federation of Teachers. Founder of the Asian Pacific American Labor Alliance. Board chair for the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. And, for more than 30 years, director of the UCLA Labor Center and a lecturer at the university. (Disclosure: CFT is a financial supporter of Capital & Main.)

Wong’s tenure at UCLA’s labor center saw the expansion of staff from three members to 42. With the support of state Sen. Maria Elena Durazo (D-Los Angeles), a longtime colleague, Wong led an effort that secured $15 million in one-time state funding to establish a permanent home for the center in L.A.’s MacArthur Park neighborhood, within walking distance of nearly two-dozen labor union offices.

“At the heart of everything Kent did was his unwavering commitment to protecting and uplifting immigrant workers, whose struggles he understood deeply and whose dignity he fought to defend,” Durazo said in a statement upon Wong’s passing.

Wong’s father was a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, his mother a psychiatric social worker. He graduated from the now-shuttered People’s College of Law, a four-year, unaccredited public interest law school in Los Angeles whose aim was to train legal advocates who would address inequities in the law and society.

Wong’s locus of activity was L.A., but his work took him all over California, across the country and around the world. Nearly 20 years ago, he spearheaded the process that led to the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor signing sister-city agreements with labor councils in both Shanghai and Beijing. These efforts led to the sharing of information and perspectives on labor standards, working conditions and multinational corporations that operated in both countries.

He was working on setting up a meeting of U.S. and Palestinian labor academics on many of the same issues earlier this summer. And in July, in the face of ICE and Homeland Security raids on workers and businesses in his home city, Wong facilitated a nonviolence training session for an estimated 1,400 people at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

'I'm helping to show you the moral pole'

Nonviolent resistance was at the heart of Wong’s work, but that concept is hardly as passive as the words might make it appear.

“To some people, nonviolence means doing a peaceful protest — but nonviolent resistance is a much more profound concept,” said Larry Frank, a longtime colleague of Wong’s at the UCLA Labor Center and a former deputy mayor of Los Angeles. “Nonviolent resistance means being able to create a moral force that publicly challenges what leadership is doing, and what is necessary in terms of resistance.”

Wong understood such principles well. He was mentored by the Rev. James Lawson Jr., a lion of the civil rights movement. For years, Wong and Lawson, who died in 2024, co-taught the course “Nonviolence and Social Movements” at UCLA.

Wong’s greatest professional gifts may prove the most difficult to replicate. Friends remembered him for his unique ability to quickly identify someone’s strengths and see where and how those might best be integrated into a specific labor or justice project.

“He’d spend a few minutes with somebody, and then his instincts would tell him what they’d be good at,” Sickler said. “He seemed to understand the talent they possessed — and whether they were genuine or not. He could read ‘phony’ pretty quick.”

Wong also maintained a respectful posture toward those who disagreed with him, a disarming and effective approach that feels increasingly rare in 2025. But Wong’s even demeanor was never to be mistaken for a lack of conviction.

“It wasn’t so much like, ‘We’re fighting on an issue and I’m going to craft a middle ground.’ That was not his vibe,” said Roxana Tynan, executive director emerita of the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy. “It was more like, ‘I’m helping to show you the moral pole here. You should come over here with me and my pals. It’s way more fun.’”

'A huge force in the movement'

Wong loved good food, and he and his wife, the community organizer and activist Jai Lee Wong, hosted friends for many a Chinese meal for which he hand-selected the ingredients from local markets and cooked everything himself. He was a jazz fan who’d go out of his way to find a good club on the road. He was a devoted husband and father. But he was fundamentally a person who felt called to a purpose that could, at times, be all encompassing.

“He was, for me, the most strategic thinker and strategic actor I’ve ever worked with,” Frank said. “He had put in this work to establish relationships with labor, but also with businesses, with management. All the pieces that made him so effective, he had built over many, many years, thoughtfully, strategically. And then he was able to move so many pieces of work forward in this town — a huge force in the movement.”

The movements for labor and social justice will continue, albeit in extremely challenging circumstances. The Trump administration’s threats and harassment have spooked immigrant workers and businesses alike, and Los Angeles has at times felt like the epicenter of that tumult.

Wong’s mass training session on nonviolent resistance in L.A. this summer, designed to instruct activists and organizers on how to effectively respond to such emergencies, was a direct response to the Trump-directed incursion into his city. It was the kind of cause that animated his life and work — and his absence from these battles, to which he constantly brought both resolve and respectfulness, is still difficult for colleagues to imagine.

Another group of recruits was dismissed after medical issues or failing the physical fitness requirements.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement is flush with cash for an aggressive recruiting campaign to fulfill Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda. But new recruits are reportedly failing physical fitness requirements and entering training programs before the agency performed background checks or finished a screening process.

ICE officials have discovered that some recruits failed drug testing or had disqualifying criminal backgrounds while they were already enrolled in training, according to NBC News.

Since the beginning of a summer hiring surge after the president approved $178 billion to expand the agency into one of the most expensive police agencies in the world, ICE has dismissed more than 200 new recruits while they were in training for falling short of requirements, according to agency data reviewed by NBC.

Most did not meet physical and academic standards — including failing open-book tests — while several were dismissed for their criminal backgrounds or over safety concerns that were flagged in background checks, the outlet reported.

At least one recruit at the agency’s training academy in Brunswick, Georgia, had been previously charged with strong-arm robbery and battery stemming from a domestic violence incident, according to a Homeland Security official speaking to NBC.

Several recruits also had not submitted fingerprints or gone through any background checks at all before entering the six-week training course, officials said.

Homeland Security deputy secretary Tricia McLaughlin claimed that a majority of new recruits are former law enforcement officers who go through a different hiring process; per ICE policy, applicants are required to pass drug tests and undergo a security check before they enter training.

McLaughlin said the figures in NBC’s report are “not accurate” and “reflect a subset of candidates in initial basic academy classes.”

“The vast majority of new officers brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy,” she said. “This population is expected to account for greater than 85 percent of new hires. Prior-service hires follow streamlined validation but remain subject to medical, fitness, and background requirements.”

The Trump administration has aimed for hiring 10,000 ICE agents by next year, or roughly doubling its footprint, with a major boost to the agency’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division.

Critics have warned that hitting that 10,000 target — without adequate guardrails to screen future agents and know exactly who is filling those roles — the government could open the door to repeat past mistakes, as ICE faces intense legal scrutiny over allegations of abuse and illegal use of force as Trump surges federal officers into cities across the country.

“The loosening of hiring standards and training requirements is unacceptable and will likely result in increased officer misconduct — similar to or worse than what occurred during a small surge in hiring U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in the early 2000s,” Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem this week.

“Exacerbating our concerns, DHS has gutted offices responsible for overseeing ICE officers and ensuring accountability for use-of-force incidents,” he added. “Given these developments, greater congressional oversight of ICE’s hiring is essential.”

To boost recruitment, Homeland Security offered a “maximum $50,000 signing bonus” and student loan forgiveness. DHS also dropped age limit requirements, allowing people as young as 18 years old to apply and opening ICE to recruits older than 40 years old.

The training period at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Georgia shrunk from 13 weeks to eight — and then six.

Recruits must also pass a physical fitness test, including running 1.5 miles under 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

But dozens of new recruits were sent packing because they couldn’t pass a legal exam, in which officers are allowed to use their books and notes for a test on the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Fourth Amendment.

Another group of recruits was dismissed after medical issues or failing the physical fitness requirements. “It’s pathetic,” one career ICE official told The Atlantic.

The federal government has been struggling to enroll physically fit personnel to join the ranks since even before Trump, with military branches also regularly failing to meet recruiting goals.

One Pentagon study found that more than three-quarters of Americans between the ages of 17 and 24 were ineligible for service because they were overweight, unable to pass an aptitude test, afflicted by physical or mental health issues, or ruled out by a criminal record.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/23/15/13/ICE-Detains-Immigrants-Inside-New-York-City-Courthouses-ocas0cn5.jpeg?trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-23 21:01:20.997564

From Los Angeles to Chicago, Portlandand New York, the evidence is ample enough that wherever Trump sends in the immigration agency, people get hurt. And not just protesters and immigrants.

That includes 13 police officers tear-gassed in Chicago earlier this month. And, now, a U.S. marshal.

Which brings us to what happened in South L.A. on Tuesday.

Federal agents boxed in the Toyota Camry of local TikToker Carlitos Ricardo Parias — better known to his hundreds of thousands of followers as Richard LA. As Parias allegedly tried to rev his way out of the trap, an ICE agent opened fire. One bullet hit the 44-year-old Mexican immigrant — and another ricocheted into the hand of a deputy U.S. marshal.

Neither suffered life-threatening injuries, but it’s easy to imagine that things could have easily turned out worse. Such is the chaos that Trump has caused by unleashing shock troops into U.S. cities.

Rather than take responsibility and apologize for an incident that could’ve easily been lethal, Team Trump went into their default spin mode of blaming everyone but themselves.

Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that the shooting was “the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest.”

Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli chimed in on social media soon after: “I urge California public officials to moderate their rhetoric toward federal law enforcement. Encouraging resistance to federal agents can lead to deadly consequences.” Hours later, he called Times reporter James Queally “an absolute joke, not a journalist” because my colleague noted it’s standard practice by most American law enforcement agencies to not shoot at moving vehicles. One reason is that it increases the chance of so-called friendly fire.

Federal authorities accuse Parias of ramming his car into agents’ vehicles after they boxed him in. He is being charged with assault on a federal officer.

Time, and hopefully, evidence, will show what happened — and very important, what led to what happened.

The Trump administration keeps claiming that the public anger against its immigration actions is making the job more dangerous for la migra and their sister agencies. McLaughlin and her boss, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, keep saying there’s been a 1,000% increase in assaults on immigration agents this year like an incantation. Instead of offering concrete figures, they use the supposed stat as a shield against allegations ICE tactics are going too far and as a weapon to excuse the very brutality ICE claims it doesn’t practice.

Well, even if what they say is true, there’s only one side that’s making the job more dangerous for la migra and others during raids:

La migra.

It turns out that if you send in phalanxes of largely masked federal agents to bully and intimidate people in American cities, Americans tend not to take kindly to it.

Who knew?

We’re about to enter the sixth month of Trump’s plan to rid the country of undocumented immigrants. Sycophants are bragging that he’s doing the job, but they’re not caring to look at the mess left in its wake that’s becoming more and more perilous for everyone involved. They insist that those who are executing and planning raids are professionals, but professionals don’t make constant pendejos out of themselves.

Professionals don’t bring squadrons to chase after tamale ladies or day laborers, or stage flashy raids of apartments and parks that accomplish little else than footage for propaganda videos. They don’t go into neighborhoods with intimidation on their mind and ready to rough up anyone who gets in their way.

A ProPublica investigation showed that ICE has detained at least 170 U.S. citizens this year, many whom offered proof that they were in this country legally as la migra cuffed them and hauled them off to detention centers.

Professionals don’t lie like there’s a bonus attached to it — but that’s what Trump’s deportation Leviathan keeps doing. In September, McLaughlin put out a news release arguing that the shooting death of 38-year-old Silverio Villegas González in Chicago by an ICE agent was justified because he was dragged a “significant distance” and suffered serious injuries. Yet body cam footage of local police who showed up to the scene captured the two ICE agents involved in the incident describing their injuries as “nothing major.”

Closer to home, a federal jury in Los Angeles last month acquitted an activist of striking a Border Patrol agent after federal public defender Cuauhtémoc Ortega screened footage that contradicted the government’s case and poked holes in the testimony of Border Patrol staff and supervisors. Last week, ICE agents detained Oxnard activist Leonardo Martinez after a collision between their Jeep and his truck. McLaughlin initially blamed the incident on an “agitator group ... engaged in recording and verbal harassment,” but footage first published by L.A. Taco showed that la migra trailed Martinez and then crashed into him twice — not the other way around.

Professionals don’t host social media accounts that regularly spew memes that paint the picture of an American homeland where white makes right and everyone else must be eliminated, like the Department of Homeland Security does. A recent post featured medieval knights wearing chain mail and helmets and wielding longswords as they encircle the slogan “The Enemies are at the Gates” above ICE’s job listing website.

The Trump administration has normalized racism and has turned cruelty into a virtue — then its mouthpieces gasp in mock horror when people resist its officially sanctioned jackbootery.

This evil buffoonery comes straight from a president who reacted to the millions of Americans who protested this weekend at No Kings rallies by posting on social media an AI-generated video of him wearing a crown and dropping feces on his critics from a jet fighter. And yet McLaughlin, Noem and other Trump bobbleheads have the gall to question why politicians decry la migra while regular people follow and film them during raids when not shouting obscenities and taunts at them?

As I’ve written before, there’s never a nice way to conduct an immigration raid but there’s always a better way. Or at least a way that’s not dripping with malevolence.

Meanwhile, ICE is currently on a hiring spree thanks to Trump’s Bloated Beastly Bill and and has cut its training program from six months to 48 days, according to The Atlantic. It’s a desperate and potentially reckless recruitment drive.

And if you think rapidly piling more people into a clown car is going to produce less clown-like behavior by ICE on the streets of American cities, boy do I have news for you.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/11b73f0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8256x4334+0+585/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F66%2F67%2F5ed35c45442fb42a524b3260fc73%2Fgettyimages-2240700506.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:32.466983

“Swapping out Illinois license plates on Illinois licensed vehicles is illegal,"" Giannoulias said in a video posted to YouTube. ""And as Secretary of State, I have zero tolerance for these types of illegal activities.""

“No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways,"" Giannoulias said in a release containing the video. This is a matter of public safety and protecting the wellbeing of our communities.”

Giannoulias' message begins by showing a video that recently circulated on social media that appeared to show an ICE agent standing near a vehicle, saying ""you can record all you want. We change the plates out everyday.""

He went on to say that his office was investigating the allegations and launching a public, ""Plate Watch Hotline"" for people to report such activity. To make a report, residents can call the Secretary of State’s Plate Watch Hotline at (312) 814-1730 or email platewatch@ilsos.gov, Giannoulias said.

According to Giannoulias' office, state law says penalties for displaying a plate on a vehicle for which it was not authorized for use, or obscuring or modifying license plates in any way, include fines and potential jail time.

""In addition, the Secretary of State’s office has the authority to suspend or revoke the vehicle’s license plates in such instances,"" the release said.

JB Pritzker launching commission on Trump's immigration raids - Chicago Tribune,Olivia Olander,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/23/illinois-accountability-commission-immigration-raids/,"Now, in a move that could bolster both his public messaging and the state’s legal efforts to fight the Trump administration, Gov.
Pritzker has repeatedly acknowledged that Illinois, like other states, has few direct tools to counter federal actions beyond litigation and public accountability efforts.
While the panel will be empowered to recommend steps to hold the federal government accountable, Pritzker acknowledged it will have no subpoena power.
The panel will hold hearings and gather testimony from local officials, legal experts, faith leaders and journalists, with an initial report expected in January, according to the governor’s office.
The videos also have helped other state officials, activists and journalists keep track of federal officials’ actions in neighborhoods, even as the agents themselves remain largely masked and anonymous.","For weeks, Chicagoans and suburbanites have recorded masked federal agents pursuing people down streets, detaining them, and loading them into unmarked cars — scenes that have at times descended into chaos amid President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.

Now, in a move that could bolster both his public messaging and the state’s legal efforts to fight the Trump administration, Gov. JB Pritzker is seeking to channel those videos, testimonials and any allegations of misconduct into a centralized record overseen by a new “accountability commission.” The panel, he said, will track and scrutinize the administration’s actions with an eye toward future efforts to hold federal officials and employees accountable.

Announced Thursday in an executive order establishing the commission, the move follows weeks of resistance from Democratic-led states that have sought to challenge the Trump administration’s law enforcement crackdowns largely through the courts. Pritzker has repeatedly acknowledged that Illinois, like other states, has few direct tools to counter federal actions beyond litigation and public accountability efforts.

Hamstrung by the state’s limited authority to restrict federal immigration agencies, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol, Pritzker said the commission will serve as a means of collecting and preserving evidence — material that could be used by a future Congress, presidential administration or in potential legal proceedings. While the panel will be empowered to recommend steps to hold the federal government accountable, Pritzker acknowledged it will have no subpoena power. It has no direct law enforcement authority.

The commission may, in the end, function as much as a public forum as a means for legal action, amplifying awareness of federal agents’ conduct as it documents possible abuses.

The panel will hold hearings and gather testimony from local officials, legal experts, faith leaders and journalists, with an initial report expected in January, according to the governor’s office.

“We have a duty to ensure that the truth is preserved, so the public can know what their elected and appointed officials have done, and so the courts and the Congress can eventually hold people accountable,” Pritzker said. “Donald Trump is counting on your silence. We are counting on your courage.”

Since the latest wave of federal immigration enforcement began in early September, local officials have said they are exploring a range of options to push back against what they describe as the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive tactics in Chicago and the suburbs.

Pritzker’s executive order also comes as former Mayor Lori Lightfoot separately said this week that she and a group of attorneys were working to establish a nonprofit organization to serve as a “centralized archive” of alleged misconduct by ICE and Border Patrol agents, according to Fox 32. It’s unclear if the two efforts would work together. Pritzker and Lightfoot had a sometimes-tense relationship while she was mayor.

Though it’s not clear how strong the teeth of the new commission will be, its creation is the next step for Pritzker after he has asked Illinoisans, even before “Operation Midway Blitz” launched on Sept. 8, to record and share ICE and Border Patrol activity. In late August, during a news conference along the Chicago River with elected leaders across Chicago and the state, Pritzker issued a warning “to Trump administration officials who are complicit in this scheme, to the public servants who have forsaken their oath to the Constitution to serve the petty whims of an arrogant little man, to any federal official who would come to Chicago and try to incite my people into violence as a pretext for something darker and more dangerous: We are watching and we are taking names.”

Some videos people have taken were used in announcing Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s office’s case that obtained a federal judge’s temporary restraining order holding off the Trump administration from commanding National Guard troops onto city and suburban streets. The videos also have helped other state officials, activists and journalists keep track of federal officials’ actions in neighborhoods, even as the agents themselves remain largely masked and anonymous.

Pritzker’s order appears to centralize that information at the state level. The federal Department of Homeland Security, for its part, has discouraged journalists and others from sharing videos of federal agents, saying ICE and Border Patrol agents have been subjected to physical threats, which it says have increased by “one thousand percent.”

The commission is expected to be chaired by former federal judge Rubén Castillo, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago who also served as a director and regional counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the Latino civil rights and advocacy group known as MALDEF. He represented the group in redistricting cases that led to the creation of the first Hispanic-majority congressional district in Illinois and to an increase in the number of Latino-majority aldermanic and state legislative districts.

Pritzker announced his appointments to six of the nine expected seats on the new board. In addition to Castillo, Pritzker named former judge and federal prosecutor Patricia Brown Holmes, who is expected to serve as vice chair. The commission is set to last for a year but could be extended, according to the executive order.

A Homeland Security spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Illinois House Republican Leader Tony McCombie, in a statement, called the commission “another taxpayer-funded political stunt.”

The Trump administration is now heading into the eighth week of “Operation Midway Blitz,” during which at least 1,500 arrests have been made, the Department of Homeland Security has reported. The sight of ICE and Border Patrol has become common throughout Chicago and the suburbs, as agents have repeatedly detained people first and sought information about them later, without immediate regard for citizenship or legal status.

DHS has said it’s going after the “worst of the worst,” or individuals who both lack legal status and have committed violent crimes, and it has provided several examples of people arrested in the past two months that it says fit that description. But other studies have shown that many people arrested and detained as part of nationwide sweeps have been American citizens or had no criminal record.

The department has not released comprehensive lists of detainees widely.

Pritzker’s order follows Wednesday’s legal win for the state in its ongoing fight against allowing National Guard troops to be part of the crackdown: A federal judge in Chicago indefinitely extended her restraining order barring Trump from deploying the troops to Illinois as both sides await a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.

Other legal efforts against the Trump administration’s actions have come from outside the state government. In a separate lawsuit, a federal judge ruled earlier this month that federal agents violated the rights of news reporters and protesters who were responding to immigration arrests in Chicago and restricted some of the agents’ future actions.

Mary Meg McCarthy, executive director of the National Immigrant Justice Center and another expected member of the board, on Thursday drew a comparison to a 1991 report about the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in Chile, which she said she had lived under in the 1980s.

“This report became a critical resource as Chileans worked to reestablish democratic and human rights norms,” she said. When she returned to the U.S., she added, “I never, never imagined that one day, I would be living through a similar authoritarian regime. But here we are.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctc-l-pritzker-economic-club-04_244976626-e1761252007700.jpg?w=1024&h=719,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:00.404725

Pritzker told CBS News, in an exclusive interview, the state is documenting ""unlawful attacks"" by ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers under Operation Midway Blitz.

""They are attacking people on the ground — ICE, CBP — going after people just because they're Brown or Black,"" Pritzker said. ""No one above them is holding them responsible.

He described reports of Black Hawk helicopters, military-style weapons, and the mass detention of civilians, including children being zip-tied.

""There are people who just don't believe it until they see it,"" he said. ""We've seen pastors hit with pepper balls while praying outside ICE facilities. Peaceful protesters tackled or shot with tear gas and rubber bullets for exercising their First Amendment rights. ... That's why we're telling everyone: record it, document it, send it in.""

In his interview with CBS News, Pritzker detailed the timeline on these accountability efforts.

""We are taking those cases to court, and again we are winning. So we're taking action now. I don't want to make it seem like nothing is happening,"" he said.

The governor said they're taking cases to court now, but other actions could take years, when there's a change in administration at the White House.

""Someone's got to hold them accountable, and whether it's the courts now or the elected officials later, we've got to make sure we have a record to show,"" he said.

Pritzker said a report will be issued this January related to the work of the commission. They've created a website people can use to track this work and to report activity at ilac.illinois.gov.

Asked about this week's federal court decision blocking the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago, Pritzker praised the ruling but voiced concern about what may come next.

""The courts have done a very good job stopping the worst offenses, but I'm disturbed that the Supreme Court might allow federalized National Guard troops when there is no insurrection, no rebellion,"" he said.

Pritzker said he welcomes help from the FBI, DEA, and ATF to combat illegal guns and drugs, but rejected any military-style presence.

When asked what he'd say directly to CBP Chief of Patrol Bovino, who oversees the federal operation, Pritzker offered a pointed message: ""Follow the law. Follow your own protocols. Do right by the citizens of the United States who live here in Illinois. And, finally, pronounce the name of our state correctly. It's Illinois, not Illinoise.""

Bovino defends enforcement actions, claiming ""absolute chaos in the streets""

On Thursday, Bovino also talked with CBS News and pushed back on Pritzker's claims.

""Pritzker probably ought to set a hotline up for himself, for all the abuses that illegal aliens perpetrate on American citizens,"" Bovino said, accusing him and other Democratic leaders of spreading ""fake news"" about racial profiling. He denied that CBP agents have targeted neighborhoods by race or acted outside policy.

""We've arrested individuals from 30 non-Latino countries,"" he said. ""We go where the threat is.""

Bovino defended his agency's tactics, saying federal agents in Chicago have made nearly 2,700 arrests since Sept. 6 and used ""exemplary"" force amid what he called ""absolute chaos in the streets.""

""We've arrested a lot of very bad individuals: Latin Kings members, bona fide terrorists, and things like that,"" Bovino told CBS News.

Bovino said roughly 70% of arrests nationwide involve people with ""criminal or immigration history,"" though he declined to provide specific figures for Chicago, when pressed repeatedly. Earlier this month, CBS News Chicago dug into the data behind the arrests, and found some of the numbers reflected people arrested outside of Illinois.

Bovino also defended agents seen deploying tear gas and pepper balls at protesters outside the Broadview detention facility, despite a federal court order restricting chemical agents.

""The use of force I've seen has been exemplary, the least amount necessary to accomplish the mission,"" he said. ""Those protesters were trespassing and had been given multiple warnings. That was absolutely in line with policy.""

Bovino dismissed concerns that agents fired from elevated positions or above the waist, insisting, ""It doesn't matter where you fire from. That's not a violation of policy.""

Asked if any agents had been disciplined for excessive force, Bovino said, ""To my knowledge, no.""

He also defended the possible deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago, saying they would guard federal facilities, not patrol city streets.

""That was fake news,"" he said. ""It was never the intention for National Guard to be on the streets.""

Bovino described Chicago as a ""model"" for nationwide immigration enforcement and said CBP's mission will continue until ""we arrest them all or they self-deport.""

""We're here to protect taxpayers from violence and crimes by illegal aliens,"" Bovino said. ""We've had enough, and we're not going anywhere.""

— GOP leaders are starting to mix it up

— Timeline slips for crypto market bill

The shutdown is going into next week — at least. And senators are getting restless.

There’s little hope of movement anytime soon, with President Donald Trump leaving Washington Friday for a trip to Asia for at least several days.

“Everybody knows Mike Johnson is not going to take a single step without Donald Trump’s permission,” Sen. Brian Schatz, a senior appropriator and the Senate’s next Democratic whip, told Mia. “He has to get involved.”

But after weeks of daily votes on the House-passed continuing resolution, Republican leaders are starting to mix it up a bit. Today they’re hoping to split Democrats by holding a vote on a bill from Sen. Ron Johnson to pay troops and some federal workers on the floor. That’s not expected to get enough Democratic support to pass.

Senate Republicans are looking to keep the pressure on next week. Senate Majority Leader John Thune took the step Wednesday to make two other bills available for a vote: another troop pay bill from Sen. Dan Sullivan and a bill to pay TSA employees and air traffic controllers from Sen. Ted Cruz.

They’re also discussing voting on a bill from Sen. Josh Hawley that would fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits for the duration of the shutdown, Jordain Carney reports. (Read on for much more on the coming food-aid cliff.)

Meanwhile, talk of a new CR is heating up as Nov. 21, the expiration date for the House-passed stopgap, draws closer. Some Republicans are eyeing a punt though January or March. Other conservatives are pushing for a CR through December of next year, a plan that’s not likely to fly with appropriators.

“I’d like to get it done this year and not push it into next year,” said Sen. John Boozman, who oversees Military Construction-VA spending. “Although there’s good arguments for doing that, we don’t have a whole lot of time left.”

While there’s little hope of an immediate path out of the shutdown, the mood appears to be lightening, at least. Sens. Rand Paul and Gary Peters are hosting a bipartisan lunch today, and Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Mike Rounds — who are part of the informal group trying to find an off-ramp — said they are planning to attend.

“There is a little bit of a better spirit. Something must be happening,” Sen. Kevin Cramer told Jordain about the vibe among senators Wednesday night.

THE LEADERSHIP SUITE

Lawmakers brace for the SNAP cliff

Millions of low-income Americans are on track to lose access to food aid Nov. 1, Meredith Lee Hill reports, but it’s not moving Democrats off their shutdown stance.

Asked Tuesday about the SNAP benefits cliff, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said “it should change Republicans’ calculus, that they should sit down and negotiate, negotiate a way to address this crisis.”

At least 25 states plan to inform SNAP participants they won’t receive checks next month, including California, an overwhelmingly Democratic state with 4.5 million program recipients, Grace Yarrow reports. The food-aid cliff has largely flown under the radar as Democrats focus on the launch of open enrollment for Affordable Care Act insurance plans, also on Nov. 1.

“We’re people who want Americans to have health care and food,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. “The Republicans, evidently, don’t care whether they have either.”

Trump and GOP lawmakers are, for now, blaming Democrats for risking hunger for low-income Americans. But White House officials are aware of the consequences for their own voters and are beginning to weigh their options to fill the hole, according to three people granted anonymity to discuss the deliberations.

Blumenthal: New Russia sanctions aren’t enough

The top Democrat on a bipartisan effort to punish Russia for the war in Ukraine praised new sanctions issued by the Trump administration Wednesday — but thinks they don’t go far enough.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal told Calen the new effort hitting major Russian oil companies is “a step in the right direction,” but that the secondary sanctions legislation he is spearheading with Sen. Lindsey Graham — which Trump has been reluctant to green-light — is still necessary.

Their bill would impose sanctions on countries lawmakers say are “fueling the Russian oil machine,” like China, India, Brazil and Hungary.

“Until we have those kinds of sledgehammer sanctions on the enablers economically of Russia’s slaughter, Putin will continue to think he has a green light from Trump to continue the assault,” Blumenthal added.

Graham thanked the president for his sanctions move Wednesday, and encouraged him to keep going after Russian oil companies “and the customers that buy their cheap oil and refuse to help Ukraine.”

How Senate Republicans rejected Ingrassia

Senate Republicans for months quietly raised concerns with the White House about Paul Ingrassia’s nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel before he withdrew from consideration Tuesday, Hailey Fuchs, Daniel Lippman and Jordain report.

The GOP pushback accelerated in July following a meeting between Ingrassia and bipartisan Senate Homeland Security Committee staff, where he professed to have little memory of inflammatory social media posts and writings, according to three Democratic aides who were present and granted anonymity to discuss the conversation.

“His most typical response was that he’s posted so many things he couldn’t recall,” said one of the aides.

Sens. Johnson, Hawley, Rick Scott and James Lankford were among the Republicans with concerns about Ingrassia’s nomination.

“Several of us … had direct conversations with the White House for a couple of months, actually,” Lankford said.

POLICY RUNDOWN

TIMELINE SLIPS FOR CRYPTO MARKET BILL — Crypto executives left a series of meetings on Capitol Hill Wednesday worrying that negotiations over a landmark bill establishing cryptocurrency regulations will slip into next year, Jasper Goodman, Declan Harty and Meredith report.

The meetings came after bipartisan crypto market structure legislation stalled earlier this month, with one industry official saying it would now be a “miracle” if the bill passes this year. Senate Democrats, in particular, have bristled at deadlines being imposed after negotiations and chided crypto CEOs for their response to a leaked Democratic proposal for regulating decentralized finance.

Sen. Ruben Gallego told the CEOs he was “really fucking pissed about” the industry’s response and warned them not to “be an arm of the Republican Party.”

“They used you all and your megaphones to fuck us,” Gallego said in the meeting.

CRAPO EYES MORE TAX POLICY EXTENSIONS — Senate Finance Chair Mike Crapo told Benjamin and Meredith he’s “hopeful” the Senate can pass and enact an extenders package at the end of the year.

“We had those … together at the end of last year, and they didn’t get included [in the megabill],” Crapo said Wednesday. “I’m hopeful that we’ll find a vehicle, and yeah, I think that there should be one. But you know, in this Congress, you never know what’s going to be possible.”

The GOP’s big, beautiful bill extended most of the tax provisions that were due to expire at year’s end. But some provisions — such as a credit for businesses that hire certain veterans, ex-felons and other groups who have had trouble finding employment — are still at risk of lapsing in a few months.

House Ways and Means Chair Jason Smith has also expressed interest in reversing the curtailed gambling deduction that was included in the megabill. Crapo reiterated he wouldn’t oppose that if his members pushed for it.

Crapo huddled in Smith’s office Wednesday, though he wouldn’t share details of the discussion.

DIGNITY ACT DISCUSSIONS — Rep. Maria Salazar said Wednesday she’s confident the White House will come around to support her bill to create a “dignity status” for undocumented immigrants.

“It’s common sense. So it will happen, because I do trust that this president gets it and will get it done,” the Florida Republican said at a news conference on a bill that hasn’t seen significant movement since its reintroduction in July.

She argued Trump would see the legislation as beneficial to the economy.

“Just watch, because he knows that this problem is imminent,” Salazar said. “The country needs a secure workforce, otherwise we will not be able to have the economy that we need to have to continue being the No. 1 economy in the world.”

Salazar, joined by Democratic Rep. Tom Suozzi, said they are “talking to everybody,” including House leadership.

TUNNEL TALK

REPUBLICANS TANK ICE MISCONDUCT TRACKER — Republicans are threatening to block House Oversight Democrats from creating a “master ICE tracker” on their minority committee website that would document the unlawful detention of Americans by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Top Oversight Democrat Robert Garcia said Tuesday the plan was to launch the tracker over “the next couple of weeks” and to include “every single instance that we can verify” of unlawful ICE arrests and civil rights abuses.

But Rep. Bryan Steil, who chairs House Administration, denounced the initiative Wednesday. His panel has oversight authority of the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, which oversees websites hosted on the House’s network.

“The House of Representatives absolutely will not maintain a website that tracks or doxes I.C.E. agents,” Steil said in a statement.

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.","By MADELEINE MOORE/Salem Reporter

The state of Oregon is asking a federal judge to dismiss a Marion County lawsuit over immigration records, saying state law is clear that the county can’t share information about men on parole for local crimes with federal immigration authorities.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion Monday in U.S. District Court in Eugene to dismiss the lawsuit, which county officials filed Aug. 18 to seek clarity on whether they could share contact information and other details about men on parole with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Because state law unequivocally prohibits Marion County from producing the requested information without a court order, and because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies, there is nothing further for this court to do,” Rayfield wrote.

The motion is the latest in an ongoing back-and-forth between Marion County, the state and federal authorities who say they are trying to locate several men in Salem who served prison time for violent crimes and should be deported.

ICE sent subpoenas to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office on Aug. 1 asking for information about five men on parole, according to the county’s lawsuit. The lawsuit named Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Marion County said that a federal judge needs to resolve conflicts between Oregon’s so-called sanctuary law, state public records law and federal law. The county compiled information to respond to the ICE subpoenas but has not provided them as of Tuesday, according to Marion County counsel Steve Elzinga.

Oregon sanctuary law generally bars agencies from sharing information with immigration authorities for enforcement purposes, unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Rayfield argued that ICE does not have authority to inspect the information under the state’s public records law. The subpoenas sent to Marion County were signed by a special agent, not a judge. That means they are not to be cooperated with under Oregon law, Rayfield argued.

Rayfield said that previous court rulings have made clear that sanctuary and federal law do not conflict, and that if a judge orders to enforce subpoenas, agencies are then required to provide the information.

“And yet, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed this lawsuit instead, seeking an advisory opinion from this court rather than following well-established processes under state and federal law – processes that have been in place for many years without the need for lawsuits or further clarification,” Rayfield wrote in the motion.

In a statement Tuesday, Marion County disputed Rayfield’s argument that there is no conflict between state and federal laws.

“The state’s assertion that there is no legal uncertainty fails a basic smell test when there is an obvious federal-state clash over subpoenas requesting public records of violent criminals and the majority of Oregon’s sheriffs and counties who are caught in the middle say that legal clarity is needed,” Elzinga said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office separately filed a lawsuit Oct. 1 to enforce subpoenas sent to Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties requesting information on 10 men previously convicted of crimes in the counties. In that case, Marion County asked a judge to order it to release information to ICE, according to an Oct. 6 filing. No such order has been issued yet, federal court records show.

Twenty Oregon counties and all but two of the state’s sheriffs support Marion County’s lawsuit seeking clarification on immigration subpoenas.

In a letter sent to Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Oct. 6, counties said Marion County should ask a judge to “issue a detailed opinion that provides the type of clarity that will help all local governments ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

In its subpoenas, ICE sought personal information on five men on parole in Marion County for serious crimes, including rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping and theft. ICE later rescinded one subpoena due to “discrepancies in biographical information,” an email from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Salem Reporter filed a public records request Sept. 18 for the information ICE requested in its administrative subpoenas and received the records a week later without exemptions or redactions. The news publication was not charged for the records.

The records, which include home addresses, employers and phone numbers for each of the men, were also provided to OPB and KOIN 6, according to a declaration by Elzinga.

Providing the records to news outlets underscores a key claim in Marion County’s lawsuit. The county argued that under state public records law, information about people on parole is a public record that anyone can obtain through a public records request.

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.

In the motion, he cited state law that says people who are allowed to inspect public records include “any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, association or member or committee of the Legislative Assembly.”

Public bodies and the federal government are not included in Oregon’s definition of who is allowed access to public records, Rayfield said.

“Here, the administrative subpoenas issued by ICE are issued under federal government authority, not in anyone’s individual capacity, do not state that they are public records requests and do not invoke the Oregon public records law on their face,” he wrote in the motion.

The ICE special agent who signed the subpoenas could have access to the information if the information was requested on behalf of an individual, and not a public agency, according to Rayfield’s motion.",https://lincolnchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cropped-LC-favi-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-23 21:01:29.247095

However, deployments in the East Bay are still a possibility; Trump’s comments about calling off a “surge” operation were only focused on San Francisco.
“We know that they’re baiting Oakland, and that’s why San Francisco is suddenly off the table,” said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson.
Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters.
Assistant Oakland Police Chief James Beere said his department has no authority to oppose or prevent federal authorities from conducting immigration operations in Oakland.","Less than an hour after President Donald Trump called off a federal “surge” in San Francisco, Oakland leaders held a press conference to calm residents and let them know officials are prepared if the administration still moves ahead with operations in the East Bay.

But what exactly a federal surge in Oakland or other cities would look like is anyone’s guess.

Facing a packed conference room in Oakland City Hall, Mayor Barbara Lee acknowledged she has “no information we can bring to you today” about the federal administration’s plans.

“The federal administration, of course, has escalated its rhetoric and its enforcement posture in the Bay Area,” Lee said. “We know border patrol agents are being stationed on the Coast Guard Island, but let me be clear, we are fully prepared.”

Trump posted on Truth Social that he decided to call off a planned immigration enforcement campaign in San Francisco this Saturday after having a phone call last night with Mayor Daniel Lurie, who expressed concern that it would harm the city’s economic recovery. In a post on X, Governor Gavin Newsom wrote that “Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason” and touted the Bay Area as “a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we’ve done.” Newsom added that his office will continue to monitor the situation.

However, deployments in the East Bay are still a possibility; Trump’s comments about calling off a “surge” operation were only focused on San Francisco.

With those stakes in mind, Lee and other elected officials, union representatives, and faith leaders encouraged residents to look out for one another and to peacefully protest the administration. But officials also warned people not to “take the bait” by committing any acts of violence against federal officers.

“We know that they’re baiting Oakland, and that’s why San Francisco is suddenly off the table,” said Alameda County District Attorney Ursula Jones Dickson. “So I’m not going to be quiet about what we know is coming. We know that their expectation is that Oakland is going to do something to cause them to make us the example.”

Earlier this morning, hundreds of protesters gathered near a road that leads to an island in the Oakland estuary that houses Coast Guard facilities, where CBP agents were reported to be arriving. Demonstrators who attempted to block the road were forced to disperse after agents deployed two flash bangs so several CBP vehicles could get through.

Oakland and Alameda County law enforcement officers don’t cooperate with immigration authorities on civil matters. But there are limits to that non-cooperation. Dickson noted that her office can’t stand in the way of a legal warrant. Assistant Oakland Police Chief James Beere said his department has no authority to oppose or prevent federal authorities from conducting immigration operations in Oakland.

“I want to make it clear that if anyone attempts to enter your house or detain you, and they’re not in uniform or they don’t show credentials, please call 911 immediately,” Beere said.

Congresswoman Lateefah Simon said her office will protect members of the community, including children, families, officers, and protesters.

Oakland and the Bay Area will “collectively stand by our beliefs that terror and that violence inflicted by the Trump administration upon this community are unwanted, unwarranted, and illegal,” Simon said.

Several officials summarized efforts they’re taking to bolster the region’s defenses against federal incursions. Supervisor Nikki Fortunato Bas shared that the Board of Supervisors has invested millions of dollars in immigration legal defense services. The board also recently agreed to create an office focused on immigrant affairs to coordinate services throughout the county.

Lourdes Martinez, directing attorney of the immigrant rights practice at Centro Legal De La Raza, said ICE has already been operating in Alameda County. Her group, which runs a pro bono immigrant legal defense program, is anticipating an escalation, similar to what’s been seen in Washington D.C., Chicago, and Portland.

“If there has been deployment of federal law enforcement, it has really strengthened ICE and their ability to execute more detentions,” Martinez said. “So that is what we’re bracing for.”

The county also revived this year a rapid response hotline, which residents can use to call in reports of ICE activity. Martinez encouraged people to call the line instead of spreading unverified reports on other platforms. She also shared practical advice for immigrants, including that people should memorize important phone numbers and gather and keep safe documents like passports and medical records. She also recommended that people use PIN passcodes on their phones and consider disabling fingerprint or facial recognition on their cellphones.

“Just remember we are living under difficult times where ICE is allowed to racially profile,” she said.

Pastor Mike McBride advised young people to “not get caught up” engaging with federal officers, and to carry IDs and attend know-your-rights trainings.

“We will outlast this wickedness in high places, Oakland will counter hate, lies, and misinformation with love for all people,” McBride said. “Truth, justice, peace and joy. And we beg the Congress, please release the Epstein files.”",https://oaklandside.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7741-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 19:01:11.356928

Catch up quick: A federal immigration subpoena is seeking employment records for 10 businesses whose employees sponsored unaccompanied immigrant children, but state legislation that Polis signed in 2021 limits cooperation to criminal matters.

A Denver judge ruled in April that administration staffers could not release the records.

State of play: Now Polis is using private legal counsel to seek the case's dismissal and allow the release of a limited batch of records to ICE, court documents show.

The move is generating more controversy and blowback for the governor, who defended his actions when Axios Denver asked about the issue Wednesday.

In response, Polis continued to suggest the subpoenas are connected to a criminal matter even though a judge rejected that premise.

The intrigue: The private attorneys working with Polis billed the state $104,000, the Post reported.

The overall bill set aside $150 billion for immigration enforcement, with about $30 billion of that total going directly to ICE. To put that in context, Republicans nearly quadrupled the agency’s budget and ensured that ICE is far better funded than other law enforcement agencies, including the FBI.

In practical terms, this doesn’t just mean that the agency is suddenly flush with taxpayer cash. It also means ICE is hiring a lot of new personnel. The White House has said it intends to double the agency’s workforce, including 10,000 new deportation officers whom the president wants to deploy in January.

Its recruiting efforts, however, aren’t going especially well.

The Atlantic reported this week, for example, on the latest from an ICE training academy in Georgia, where more than a third of the new recruits have failed a relatively easy personal fitness test (do 15 pushups and 32 situps, and run 1.5 miles in 14 minutes).

One career ICE official told The Atlantic that the failure rate is “pathetic.” The same report highlighted a recent email from ICE headquarters to the agency’s top officials that lamented having many “athletically allergic candidates.”

As brutal as these details are, the scope of the problem is apparently even broader. NBC News reported:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed new recruits into its training program before they have completed the agency’s vetting process, an unusual sequence of events as it rushes to hire federal immigration officers. ... ICE officials only later discovered that some of the recruits failed drug testing, have disqualifying criminal backgrounds or don’t meet the physical or academic requirements to serve, the sources said.

According to the report, which has not been independently verified by MSNBC, “nearly half of new recruits who’ve arrived for training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center over the past three months were later sent home because they couldn’t pass the written exam, according to the data. The academic requirement includes an exam in which officers are allowed to consult their textbooks and notes at the end of a legal course.”

Or put another way, almost half of these recruits failed an open-book test.

I won’t pretend to know what the White House and ICE officials intend to do about this, but it’ll be worth watching to see if the agency lowers its standards to make it easier to deploy to American streets these “athletically allergic” agents who can’t copy answers out of a book to pass an exam.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251023-ICE-recruitment-zz-576ac0.jpg",N,,2025-10-23 19:01:38.060791

“It could be done in literally an hour,” he told Migrant Insider Thursday.","WASHINGTON — On Wednesday, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, announced his caucus would launch a “master ICE Tracker,” a digital record keeper designed to expose what he called “unconstitutional detentions and civil-rights violations” by federal immigration agents.

MIGRANT INSIDER IS SPONSORED BY:

“American citizens are being dragged off the streets by masked men and thrown into detention cells without access to a lawyer or even a phone call,” Garcia said. “No one, regardless of their background or appearance, should live in fear of being thrown behind bars by their own government because of their race or what they look like.”

According to committee staff, the tracker will compile verified reports from the public, advocacy groups, attorneys, and congressional field offices into a searchable database of ICE and CBP misconduct. “The tracker documents unconstitutional actions after they occur — it’s about accountability,” Garcia spokeswoman Sara Guerrero told Gizmodo.

A senior aide to another oversight Democrat who declined to be named in this article called the project “ICE Tracker Dot Gov” while acknowledging the tool is unlikely to be housed at that specific web address — for now. Registering a dot gov domain requires following a formal, identity-verified process managed by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) through the Get.gov platform. The dot gov top-level domain is reserved exclusively for verified U.S. government organizations at any level … federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and special-purpose entities.

GOP Resistance — and an Irish Provocation

Just after Garcia’s announcement, House Republicans led by Chair Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) vowed to block the tracker from being hosted on official servers, including the dot gov domain registrar. It’s unclear if House Republicans have the authority to block domain registries, but Secretary Kristi Noem almost certainly does, as CISA is part of the Department of Homeland Security.

“The House of Representatives absolutely will not maintain a website that tracks or doxes I.C.E. agents,” Steil said, breaking from MAGA talking points that have conflated tracking as doxxing throughout early Trump’s second term.

For example, MAGA stalwart Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.), lead sponsor of the Protecting Law Enforcement from Doxxing Act, absurdly claims activists are endangering agents merely by naming them.

Dominick Skinner, the founder of ICE List, a crowdsourced website that publicly identifies agents involved in raids, was recently named and shamed by Blackburn on her senate website. “Apparently the work we’ve been doing made her uncomfortable enough to cite me as the reason behind a new bill in Congress,” Skinner wrote afterward. “They want to criminalize transparency.”

A former homeless youth from Ireland now living in Amsterdam where Blackburn has zero jurisdiction, Skinner told Migrant Insider he views unmasking as moral reciprocity: “We survived because the world accepted us as migrants. I believe in frictionless borders, equal opportunity, and that in a fair world migration wouldn’t even be an issue.”

For now, ICE List operates from servers in Europe — beyond U.S. jurisdiction and, as he jokes, “safe unless they invade the Netherlands.”

A Bicameral Oversight Offensive

Garcia’s announcement of the House Oversight Committee’s ICE tracker follows a joint letter to Noem from Garcia and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) demanding records on the detention of U.S. citizens by immigration agents.

Their inquiry cites ProPublica’s investigation showing that at least 170 U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained this year — many held for days without water or phone access. “It’s unclear how a wrongly ensnared U.S. citizen is supposed to prove their citizenship to armed agents who don’t believe their passport or REAL ID is real,” they wrote.

ICE’s Public Collapse

Garcia’s “master tracker” lands as ICE’s standing with the public hits historic lows. In February, half the country viewed ICE favorably; by June, that number flipped — 52 percent unfavorable, 39 percent favorable, with nearly 40 percent “very unfavorable.” August Pew polling placed ICE alongside the IRS as one of the least-trusted U.S. agencies.

Among Democrats, approval sits at 13 percent, and independents disapprove nearly two-to-one. Trump, meanwhile, seems unaware that ICE is now less popular than the IRS.

Apple Joins the Firewall

The same cannot be said for the digital efforts of stateside advocates building tools to alert and catalog ICE raids. American tech companies have largely embraced the far-right’s drive to protect ICE from public accountability.

As Migrant Insider scooped earlier this month, Apple and Google quietly removed the DeICER app from its App Store after a law-enforcement complaint, invoking an anti-hate-speech rule normally reserved for shielding marginalized groups.

Apple’s notice claimed the app’s “purpose is to provide location information about law-enforcement officers that can be used to harm such officers individually or as a group.” The decision effectively made federal agents a protected class inside Apple’s ecosystem — a striking inversion of corporate civil-rights logic.

Developer Rafael “RC” Concepcion, a former Syracuse journalism professor, said DeICER had 30,000 users when Apple pulled it. “It isn’t meant to harvest people — it’s meant to inform people,” he said. “Recording public officials is not harassment. It’s democracy.”

From DeICER to Windbreaker: Tech Built for Oversight

Concepcion now wants to repurpose his privacy-first technology for Congress.

His latest platform, Windbreaker, could power the new federal tracker.

“It could be done in literally an hour,” he told Migrant Insider Thursday.

In a proposal sent to Garcia’s office reviewed by Migrant Insider, Concepcion offers Windbreaker to Oversight Democrats, describing a system that verifies reports through GPS and photo metadata, cross-checks authenticity, and stores no personal data.

“This isn’t software waiting to be funded,” the proposal reads. “It’s a shared infrastructure waiting to be adopted.” Not a week after Apple killed his app on their platform, Concepcion is already working with organizations in Chicago, North Carolina, and Massachusetts.

“DEICER platform could be implemented across states and can be used as a reporting structure and citizen facing platform to answer questions and inform on their rights,” he said on Thursday. “To get a whole of state approach ± you need to show that you’re willing to solve problems. That’s where these tools can be most helpful,” he added.

“A Ledger, Not a Map”

“This is a ledger,” a senior aide to Garcia Wednesday of the first-ever federal ICE tracker, adding: “It’s time Congress started keeping receipts.” How those receipts are gathered and where they are kept will matter.

In addition to banning DEICER, Apple also removed an app just last week that was meant to be platform for crowdsourcing evidence of abuses by immigration agents emboldened by a reckless policy dash to create a new secret police force with national jurisdiction and the blunt, sweeping authority to operate with utter impunity in American communities, especially those of color.

MY TAKE: Garcia has the opportunity to do something very important and impactful with his “master ICE tracker.” Now, he must execute by rolling out the tracker in coming weeks, as promised; then work with his colleagues in Congress and allies everywhere to encourage participation on a national level.

A minimum effort (a Google Form occasionally tended on the backend by an intern) will not due for this, not when Garcia has the chance to arm Americans with a digital sledgehammer aimed squarely at the black box of our ongoing federal immigration enforcement catastrophe.

On Wednesday, Illinois secretary of state Alexi Giannoulias unveiled a new initiative called the “Plate Watch” hotline, encouraging residents to report cases in which law enforcement vehicles appear to be using invalid or altered plates to evade identification during federal immigration raids.

In a video statement online, Giannoulias pointed to a viral video in which a federal immigration officer can be seen telling a protester next to his car that he can record him all he wants since “we change the plates out everyday”.

“I have a big problem with that … Swapping out Illinois license plates on Illinois registered vehicles is illegal and as secretary of state, I have zero tolerance for this type of illegal activity. We are investigating these allegations as we speak,” Giannoulias said.

“No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways. This is a matter of public safety and protecting the wellbeing of our communities,” he added.

Under Illinois state law, penalties for displaying an unauthorized license plate, obscuring or modifying license plates in any way include fines and potential jail time. The Illinois secretary of state’s office also has the authority to suspend or revoke the vehicle’s license plates in such instances.

Additionally, Illinois registered vehicles must display license plates in both the front and the back. Vehicles registered in other states may only require a rear license plate and all vehicles driving on Illinois roads must have proper licensing in accordance with laws of their state, the Illinois secretary of state’s office said.

Earlier this month, a US district judge ordered federal immigration officers in the Chicago area to wear body cameras following repeated deployments of pepper balls, smoke grenades, tear gas against protestors and even local police.

As the Trump administration ramps up federal immigration raids – drawing widespread opposition from the public, Democratic lawmakers and civil rights groups, several states are moving to block immigration officers from hiding their identities. The push follows instances of agents using unmarked vehicles to detain people on the streets without identifying themselves or presenting warrants.

In September, California passed a bill to ban masks for most law enforcement officers from concealing their faces while carrying out their operations.

Earlier this summer, Democratic senators introduced legislation that would require federal immigration officers to visibly display their agency name and either their own name or badge number, ensuring that tactical gear or clothing does not obscure it. The bill would also ban non-medical face coverings that conceal an officer’s identity.

Leavitt's comment at Thursday's White House press briefing, in which she also criticized other ICE tracker apps that ""left-wing activists have created,"" came after Noem took to X to warn against the proposal, announced this week by Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif.

""Let’s call this what it is: a pipeline that will funnel information on American law enforcement directly into the hands of anarchists, domestic terrorists, and cartel members,"" Noem claimed in her post.

The post included a clip of Garcia at a news conference alongside Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass on Monday in which he announced the plan for Democrats on the House Oversight Committee to launch such a tracker on its website.

“Over the course of the next couple of weeks, the Oversight Committee will be launching on their website a master ICE tracker where we are going to be essentially tracking every single instance that we can verify that the community will be able to send us information on,” the California Democrat said. “And it will be all available in one central place.”

Garcia, who is the top Democratic member of the Oversight Committee, joined Bass at the news conference in Los Angeles in a bid to put a spotlight on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement actions in the city and call for a congressional investigation, according to a press release from the mayor’s office.

The same day, Garcia, along with Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, who is the top Democratic member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in the upper chamber, sent a letter to Noem demanding answers and records relating to reports of wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens.

A day before Noem's post, Bondi took to X to similarly highlight the tracker announcement and accuse Garcia and Blumenthal for ""trying to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.""

“@TheJusticeDept has ZERO tolerance for violence against law enforcement — we will prosecute any person who physically assaults our agents,"" Bondi's post continued.

Garcia responded to Bondi with his own post on X, appearing to reference a ProPublica report earlier this month about 107 American citizens being arrested by DHS as well as the saga on Capitol Hill regarding the release of files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

“Hey @AGPamBondi, ICE detaining over 170 U.S. citizens is not them 'just doing their jobs,'"" Garcia wrote. “But since you have the time to tweet at me—when are you going to stop covering for pedophiles and release the Epstein files?”

President Donald Trump made immigration and border security an essential focus of his pitch to voters as a candidate in 2024, promising to carry out the largest “mass deportation"" effort in history, and the issue has been a central focus of his second term in office.

The administration’s enforcement actions in communities across the country have led to an outcry from Democrats, who have launched efforts pushing back, such as seeking to ban agents from wearing masks and requiring them to visibly show their badges. A handful of Republicans, meanwhile, have urged Trump to focus efforts on immigrants with criminal records specifically.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime foe of the president, this week said her office was launching a portal to review federal immigration enforcement actions in her state.

“New Yorkers who were present should submit videos or photos, and we will review and investigate any violations of the law,” James wrote in a post on X.

Los Angeles became ground zero for Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to American cities when he sent units to the streets against the wishes of California’s Democratic governor to quell protests against his administration’s immigration enforcement actions.

Local news reported that the Oregon Guard units remained sequestered at Camp Rilea, out on the coast, and a detachment of California National Guard members (pre-trained for crowd-control duties) were cooling their heels at Camp Withycombe, just outside Portland.","The Trump administration’s National Guard Tour 2025 has rolled from coast to coast, and Portland is the latest venue. LA was the first stop before they decided to hit up D.C., then swung back around to Memphis, and now Oregon’s taking center stage. Okay, sure, the whole tour bus analogy doesn’t really work when you consider that National Guard troops are deployed locally and don’t literally travel like a minor league baseball team, but you get the point.

If you’ve been following the federalization of the National Guard over state objections, you know it’s been met with plenty of resistance — including in the courts. A federal judge eventually ordered their withdrawal after ruling that deploying the Guard in California violated the Posse Comitatus Act (which generally bans domestic use of the military for law enforcement unless Congress specifically authorizes it). In Chicago, multiple lawsuits quickly led to a series of restraining orders blocking troop activity.

Here’s a detailed look at how we got here, what’s happened so far in the courts, and where things stand.

POTUS v. PDX

The roots of Oregon v. Trump trace back to a summer marked by escalating tensions over immigration enforcement and protest activity near Portland’s ICE facility. This past June, federal authorities arrested an asylum-seeker at Portland’s Immigration Court for the first time. That catalyzed a series of small but persistent protests outside the city’s ICE building.

While these protests were initially more energetic, sometimes involving up to 100 people, they quickly tapered off. By late summer, most demonstrations involved fewer than 30 participants and rarely required police intervention. Portland Police Bureau (PPB) officers monitored the situation closely, activating specialized teams only when necessary, and local officials repeatedly emphasized that they had matters under control.

Despite this, POTUS began referencing Portland in public statements as a city “under siege” from “domestic terrorists,” promising to restore order with “Full Force” if necessary. Late last month, Trump posted on Truth Social that he was directing the newly-rebranded “War Department” to deploy troops to “protect War ravaged Portland” and its ICE facilities from Antifa and other “domestic terrorists.”

That same day, Major General Timothy L. Rieger requested that Oregon Governor Tina Kotek authorize mobilization of the state’s National Guard for federal purposes—a request she firmly rejected. Hours later, Secretary Hegseth issued a memorandum federalizing 200 members of the Oregon National Guard for a period of 60 days – but state and local officials were already one step ahead.

Oregon and Portland Push Back

Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield immediately teamed up with Portland City Attorney Robert Taylor. The same day the memo was issued, these two jointly filed a comprehensive federal lawsuit challenging the President’s orders on statutory and constitutional grounds. The 34-page complaint laid out an aggressive argument that Trump had trampled state authority and disregarded limits on federalizing the Guard.

The core legal battlefield quickly emerged around 10 U.S.C. § 12406: the Cold War relic that authorizes a president to call up a state’s guard only in the event of “invasion, rebellion,” or failure of regular forces to enforce federal law. The plaintiffs argued that none of these circumstances remotely applied in Portland: there had been no foreign invaders, no insurrection, and, if anything, federal police had been overzealous in their ICE-related activities.

To bolster their point, Oregon borrowed an idea from its sunnier southern neighbor and invoked the Posse Comitatus Act. The lawsuit made clear: no matter how heated the President’s rhetoric about ""war-ravaged Portland"" or ""domestic terrorists,"" civil unrest in the form of burnout ICE protests did not meet any of these high bars. State sovereignty, the Tenth Amendment, and the principles of separation of powers, they said, were all being bulldozed in the process.

Marching Orders Meet Court Orders

Rayfield and Taylor sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) seeking to halt any mobilization, and federal District Court Judge Karin Immergut granted the motion on October 4. She noted that the protests had barely registered as a disturbance in recent weeks, let alone an emergency justifying military intervention. Immergut was unconvinced by the White House’s insistence on “rebellion” and found little merit in the notion that Portland constituted some ungoverned war zone in need of troops.

But that relief didn’t last long. Within twenty‑four hours, reports surfaced that the Trump administration was exploring a workaround: if Oregon’s National Guard couldn’t deploy, out‑of‑state units would. The War Department began organizing troops from California and Texas (roughly 300 and 400 soldiers respectively) to supplement federal law enforcement in Portland.

Plaintiffs rushed back to federal court and secured a second TRO on October 5 – this time specifically barring deployment of any federalized National Guard members (homegrown or borrowed) within Oregon’s borders. In rapid-fire succession, the Trump administration appealed both orders to the Ninth Circuit and requested an emergency administrative stay to unfreeze the deployments.

Ninth Circuit Raises the Stakes

On October 8, a Ninth Circuit panel issued an administrative stay, basically tabling Judge Immergut’s earlier TRO while it considered whether to leave the Guard benched for longer. Meanwhile, the legal filings piled up in both directions, with amici from former military brass to state governors weighing in.

Then, on October 20, a divided three-judge Ninth Circuit panel issued its highly-anticipated ruling. By a 2-1 vote, the court found that Trump had at least a “substantial likelihood” of prevailing, siding with the argument that stretched-thin federal law enforcement and national security needs could justify his invocation of §12406(3). The majority stressed that under federal law, the President is owed broad deference on questions of necessity — especially when regular forces are (in the administration’s view) tied up or insufficient in responding to unrest.

Judge Susan Graber’s strongly dissented. She insisted that the record showed nothing close to a rebellion or failure of federal forces, and warned that military intervention without hard evidence eroded the most basic state and constitutional protections.

Next Tour Stop: SCOTUS?

Does that mean that Guard boots are on Burnside? Not quite. The TROs, for now, remain largely intact pending additional Ninth Circuit review.

In the aftermath, both deployed and would-be deployed troops found themselves parked in legal limbo. Local news reported that the Oregon Guard units remained sequestered at Camp Rilea, out on the coast, and a detachment of California National Guard members (pre-trained for crowd-control duties) were cooling their heels at Camp Withycombe, just outside Portland. Neither group was permitted to set foot in Portland proper.

Governor Tina Kotek did little to mask her irritation as she requested more information from the federal government and called for judicial oversight. Attorney General Rayfield pushed even further, petitioning the Ninth Circuit for an en banc review, raising the stakes and framing the legal drama as an issue of deep constitutional consequence. While the courts haggle over briefing deadlines, it’s very possible the Supreme Court will decide to step in.

(AP) — Women taken into custody by U.S. immigration agents while pregnant say they received inadequate care in a letter Wednesday that calls on the Trump administration to stop holding expectant mothers in federal detention facilities.

The letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of a broader campaign in recent months by Democrats and immigrant rights groups to draw attention to what they say is the mistreatment of pregnant detainees.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended its care, saying pregnant detainees get regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support and accommodations “aligned with community standards of care.”

In addition, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement Wednesday that such detentions are “exceedingly rare” — and that pregnant women currently account for less than 1% of the total number of ICE detainees in custody. The agency didn’t provide additional figures related to detainees who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing — data that Democrats have sought for months.

The letter sent by the American Civil Liberties Union cites accounts from pregnant women who say they were shackled while being transported, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days and given insufficient food and water while detained in Louisiana and Georgia.

The ACLU said that over the past five months it has met with more than a dozen females who were pregnant while in ICE custody — including some who had a miscarriage while detained. The women reported “gravely troubling experiences,” the letter states, including lack of translation during medical encounters and medical neglect. One suffered a “severe” infection after her miscarriage.

When asked about the letter, McLaughlin called it “another disgusting attempt to smear ICE.” She argued that the ACLU used “unsubstantiated” and “unverifiable claims.”

In an interview with The Associated Press, one of the women said she was kept in handcuffs while being transported to Louisiana — a journey that lasted five hours and spanned two plane rides. The woman, who has since been released from custody and given birth, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of facing retaliation during her ongoing case.

An officer told her he considered taking off the handcuffs but worried she would escape. “How am I going to escape if I’m pregnant?” the woman said she responded.

She said she felt as if she’d been kidnapped and experienced dizziness, nausea and vaginal bleeding. During her time in detention, she said pregnant women were not offered special diets and described the food as horrible. She alleged that detainees had to “beg” for water and toilet paper.

The ACLU’s letter is the latest call for an investigation into the arrests and treatment of pregnant detainees.

Senate Democrats wrote Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in September, expressing concerns about the “prevalence and treatment” of pregnant, postpartum and nursing women in ICE custody. They demanded that the agency stop detaining such people unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”

“Proper care for pregnancy is a basic human right, regardless of whether you are incarcerated or not and regardless of your immigration status,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California Democrat. She signed onto a Democratic Women’s Caucus letter to DHS officials in July sharing concerns about the “treatment of women” and demanding answers — including how many have given birth while detained.

Kamlager-Dove said she’s working on legislation that would “severely restrict the use of restraints on pregnant, laboring and postpartum women who are in federal custody.”

ICE guidelines already say that agents “should not detain, arrest, or take into custody for an administrative violation of the immigration laws” people “known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing,” based on a policy sent to the AP by DHS. But the document does state that such people may be detained and held in custody under “exceptional circumstances” or if their release is prohibited by law.

The policy also prohibits using restraints on pregnant detainees, but here too there are exceptions — including if there is a serious threat that the detainee will hurt herself or others, or if “an immediate and credible risk” of escape cannot be “reasonably minimized” through other methods.

The raids come as Chicago awaits the Supreme Court’s upcoming decision on whether Trump can deploy the National Guard to the city or not. White House lawyers have argued immigration agents cannot enforce federal law without the help of the military. Also on Oct. 22, administration lawyers agreed to leave in place a lower court judge’s decision barring troop deployments until the higher court rules.

Agents in the morning descended on the commercial corridor of Little Village, a South Side neighborhood and heart of Chicago’s Mexican community. Photos and video from the scene show masked U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents sprinting after people and local business owners locking their doors ahead of agents.

""A reign of terror was brought upon our neighborhood,"" local Ald. Mike Rodriguez told USA TODAY. ""They took at least eight people, of those eight, four were U.S. citizens, and two were members of my staff.""

The raids on the city’s most prominent Mexican neighborhood come as part of President Donald Trump’s Operation Midway Blitz, his Chicago-area immigration enforcement crackdown. Trump launched the blitz on Sept. 8, saying it was needed to catch ""the worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants. Many local critics say instead innocent people are being left terrorized.

Federal judges in the Northern District of Illinois handling cases related to the blitz have begun issuing rulings against the president over Homeland Security’s aggressive tactics and barring the White House from deploying the National Guard.

But the rulings out of the federal courthouse in downtown Chicago have not slowed the pace of immigration enforcement raids throughout the region. On Oct. 22, agents raided the historic South Side Mexican community and a neighboring suburb; on Oct. 21, an Illinois state house representative says federal agents stopped him at gunpoint for documenting raids on the North Side; and a Chicago alderwoman says she was also stopped by agents for documenting their activities.

Homeland Security officials did not respond to requests for comments on the raids.

Agency spokespeople last answered questions about the blitz on Oct. 8, saying ""ICE and U.S. Border Patrol officers have arrested more than 1,500 illegal aliens — including criminal pedophiles, murderers, child abusers, kidnappers, gang members, and armed robbers.""

Here’s the latest on the blitz in Chicago.

Is the National Guard coming?

Trump moved to deploy hundreds of Illinois and Texas National Guard troops to the Chicago region as part of his blitz campaign. But a federal judge in downtown Chicago temporarily barred him from doing so.

White House lawyers had argued that a potential ""rebellion"" was underway in Chicago. Trump administration lawyers cited protests outside a local immigration enforcement facility and in response to federal agents making arrests in city neighborhoods.

U.S. District Judge April M. Perry questioned whether the Homeland Security allegations White House lawyers cited in their arguments were ""tethered to reality.""

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld Perry's decision. But Trump’s lawyers appealed again and the case is now before the Supreme Court. It’s unclear when they could rule.

Trump administration lawyers have agreed to let Perry’s order barring the National Guard deployments remain in place until the Supreme Court rules. Legal experts say the White House’s offer indicates they believe the high court will rule in their favor, according to reporting by the Chicago Sun-Times.

Federal judge questions ICE over aggressive tactics

A group of journalists, clergy and protesters also filed a lawsuit against Homeland Security agents over their use of chemical weapons on people in the Chicago area. In an Oct. 9 court hearing, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Eric Hamilton said federal agents had deployed $100,000 of non-lethal weapons to stop ""rioters"" from hindering immigration enforcement.

U.S. District Judge Sara L. Ellis issued an order limiting agents’ use of chemical weapons in the Chicago area and compelling them to wear identification.

Ellis amended her order a week later on Oct. 16 to ensure agents wear body-worn cameras after she was concerned that immigration agents were not following her orders. She also ordered top Homeland Security officials into court to testify.

Customs and Border Patrol Deputy Incident Cmdr. Kyle Harvick and Deputy Immigration and Customs Enforcement Field Office Director Shawn Byers both told the judge on Oct. 20 that agents were following her orders to issue warnings before using chemical weapons.

Locals being teargassed say they have not heard any warnings being used. Harvick and Byers’ testimony comes after Perry found in a separate case that Homeland Security’s account of events in the city was not reliable.

Harvick also justified federal agents shooting a local pastor with a pepper ball. A clip of the incident shows Rev. David Black standing among a group of protesters before he’s shot directly in the head by an agent posted on a rooftop building.

""What’s not being shown is he was given multiple commands to move,"" Harvick said.

Byers said 75 people have been arrested in the Chicago area in connection with attempting to block immigration enforcement.","https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/17/USAT/86745755007-20251016-t-174224-z-535581252-rc-2-d-4-haduh-0-z-rtrmadp-3-usashutdownlawenforcement.JPG?crop=2975,1675,x0,y154&width=2975&height=1675&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-23 14:17:24.903104

The friends “called last night to ask me not to go forward with the surge,” because “the Mayor, Daniel Lurie, was making substantial progress,” Trump wrote in a post to his Truth Social platform.

“I spoke to Mayor Lurie last night and he asked, very nicely, that I give him a chance to see if he can turn it around,” Trump wrote. “I told him, ‘It’s an easier process if we do it, faster, stronger, and safer but, let’s see how you do?’”

Nvidia declined to comment on behalf of Huang. CNN has also reached out to Salesforce for comment on behalf of Benioff.

Trump had long signaled he planned to deploy resources to San Francisco after similar operations in Washington, DC, Memphis, Portland, Oregon, and Chicago.

But in a separate statement Thursday morning, Lurie said Trump had assured him during a Wednesday night call that he “was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco.”

Remember: Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff backtracked last week from comments suggesting Trump should send the National Guard to San Francisco.

The mother of Katie Abraham — an Illinois woman who authorities say was killed at age 20 in a drunken-driving hit-and-run collision by a man who was in the United States illegally — said she is breaking her silence after her daughter was made the face of President Donald Trump’s amped up immigration enforcement push in Chicago.

“Losing a child unlocked a pain I never knew existed. Losing a child to a crime adds to the depths of despair. Having my child’s legacy be associated with a politically charged and controversial operation instead of the positivity and light she contributed to those within her community is simply unbearable,” Abraham’s mom, Denise Lorence, wrote in an op-ed for the Chicago Tribune, headlined “My daughter is the face of Operation Midway Blitz. I am reclaiming her legacy.”

The Department of Homeland Security said in September that launched the enforcement push, which it named “Operation Midway Blitz,” in Abraham’s honor.

“I have not spoken out since it began, but as Katie’s mother, I can no longer stay silent,” Lorence continued. “The Department of Homeland Security said its immigration enforcement operation in Chicago is named in Katie’s honor. But Katie would not have wanted this.”

She said she decided to speak out after realizing the operation’s association with her daughter wasn’t going away.

“She would not have wanted to be associated with a campaign that targets Chicago — a city she not only loved but felt safe in,” Lorence said.

Her daughter wasn’t political, she avoided confrontation and “was the person people wanted to be around,” she said.

“Whether or not you agree with Operation Midway Blitz is not the story I am here to write,” Lorence wrote, but “she did not choose to be thrust into this political spotlight to advance an operation she knew nothing about.”

Lorence acknowledged that Abraham’s father, Joe Abraham, and his wife agreed that Katie’s name could be used for the operation. Joe Abraham previously told CNN the federal government failed “miserably” in protecting his daughter and that state politicians ignored her death, and by extension, “let it happen.”

President Donald Trump said he feels empowered to send troops into any city he sees fit after an appeals court ruling this week endorsed his deployment into Portland, Oregon.

The Trump administration is urging the US Supreme Court to allow a similar deployment to Chicago, and the justices are reviewing whether lower federal courts were correct to block Trump from deploying hundreds of troops to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city’s suburbs.

Here are the legal battles playing out:

California

The Trump administration is planning to send federal agents to San Francisco as early as today ahead of an immigration and crime crackdown, a source told CNN. Plans for the deployment had not been finalized and could be called off due to publicity, the source said.

San Francisco’s mayor announced citywide preparations to respond to deployments, and Gov. Gavin Newsom threatened to sue over the action. “It might be that the Trump administration will send National Guards, or at least attempt to, in connection with and in conjunction with the ICE raids that seem imminent in San Francisco,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said.

Newsom also was critical of the possible impact of deployments on upcoming elections. “You send masked men to the cities you want to militarize,” he told reporters. “You dial it up around election time. … You suppress the vote.”

Newsom announced he will deploy the California National Guard under his command on a “humanitarian mission” to support food banks as the government shutdown stalls food benefits.

Meanwhile, an appeals court is weighing whether to limit Trump’s ability to continue deploying members of National Guard troops to the Los Angeles area.

Oregon

A federal judge in Oregon will hold a hearing Friday over whether to dissolve or suspend a restraining order that bars the deployment of National Guard soldiers to Portland.

The state of Oregon and city of Portland are pushing for an appeals court to reconsider its ruling allowing the federal government to deploy the National Guard.

The brief calls for an “en banc” review, which would involve a larger group of judges from the appeals court revisiting the ruling that was handed down in a 2-1 decision from a three-judge panel earlier this week.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, is urging the court not to grant the review.

Illinois

US District Court Judge April Perry ordered an extension of the order blocking the deployment of National Guard troops to Chicago through final judgment after she temporarily blocked the deployment in the state this month.

The extension will likely remain in place until there’s a full trial on the issue or the Supreme Court weighs in.

Tennessee

Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris said there had been a “surge” in arrests, bookings and bail settings for misdemeanor offenses in Memphis that is linked to the arrival of some federal agents and National Guard troops to the city.

Harris and other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit last week against the governor and the state’s attorney general for allowing the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis at the direction of Trump.

The buildup comes after the Republican president said he plans to deploy troops to crack down on crime in the city, with the San Francisco Chronicle reporting that more than 100 federal agents have been dispatched to a U.S. Coast Guard base across the Bay.

San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who has painstakingly tried to avoid Trump’s ire, responded to the escalation with a messaging pivot. … While still not mentioning Trump by name in a livestreamed address, he offered his sharpest critique of the federal administration yet, projecting a sense of unity to a liberal city waiting on edge.

“These tactics are designed to incite backlash, chaos and violence, which are then used as an excuse to deploy military personnel,” Lurie said, surrounded by local law enforcement leaders and members of the Board of Supervisors. “They are intentionally creating a dangerous situation in the name of public safety.”

Details of the enforcement operation are unclear, including whether Trump intends to also call up California National Guard troops as he has done in other blue cities. … Jaime Ruiz, a spokesperson for Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, did not directly respond to a question about whether Guard members will be involved.

“DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens — including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists — in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco,” Ruiz said in an email.

The enforcement operation could involve immigration sweeps in other major Bay Area cities, including San Jose and Oakland. It comes after tech billionaires like David Sacks, Trump’s crypto and AI czar, and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called for the president to send in the military (Benioff later apologized for his comments).

But those remarks, among others, appear to have piqued Trump’s attention. On Sunday, he suggested local leaders or residents had asked for federal intervention: “The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco,” Trump told Fox News.

The White House has not clarified whom Trump was referring to, and city leaders say they’ve had no contract with Trump’s administration.

The threat of federal agents or National Guard rolling down Market Street has caused San Francisco politicians to lock arms — a rare moment of unity for a city where moderate and progressive Democrats are often bitterly divided.

“This is a moment where everyone has got to put aside their political differences and stay strong,” said former Board of Supervisors President Aaron Peskin, a leader of the city’s progressive wing and a frequent critic of Lurie. “This is not a comfortable position for the leader of any American city to be in.”

WHERE’S GAVIN? Nothing official announced.

CAMPAIGN YEAR(S)

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: SWALWELL FOR GOVERNOR? — Polling being conducted this week is testing how Eric Swalwell would fare if he ran for governor, Playbook has learned.

Lisa Tucker, a political consultant for Swalwell, told Playbook the survey did not come from the representative’s camp and that she didn’t know who was responsible for it. But the poll, viewed by Playbook, is nevertheless stirring chatter about Swalwell’s future.

One question tells respondents that Swalwell “could run in 2026 for either Congress or Governor,” before asking whether he’d be more effective in fighting the president in Congress or as governor.

Another tests Swalwell’s chances in a horse race against the major candidates who are in the race already. But first, it tells respondents that Katie Porter’s critics have faulted her for a “reputation for mistreating and bullying her staff” and for claiming special interests spent to “rig” last year’s Senate race against her.

Swalwell fueled rumors that he was considering running when, last week, he criticized Porter at a press conference after videos surfaced of her threatening to walk out of an interview and tearing into a staffer.

“To what I saw with Katie Porter, when you’re taking on a fascist, you can’t get flustered, and as we’re looking to who’s going to replace Gavin Newsom, we need a fighter and a protector, and not somebody who gets flustered,” Swalwell told reporters.

The survey had an overwhelmingly positive slant, suggesting it was commissioned by people supporting Swalwell. Questions tested the Congress member’s favorability after prompting respondents with information on his upbringing, a video of him at a “No Kings” protest, and by telling them that he supported the tough-on-crime Proposition 36 in a break with many Democrats.

Swalwell hasn’t said whether he’ll run, and Tucker declined to comment further.

REDISTRICTING WARS

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: CARUSO PONIES UP — Rick Caruso, the will-he-or-won’t-he contender for governor (or Los Angeles mayor), is putting his own stamp on his support for Proposition 50, Newsom’s redistricting ballot measure. Caruso, who previously pledged to financially support the effort, is sending out mail and robocalls to roughly 100,000 prospective Democratic voters in Los Angeles urging them to vote yes.

The advocacy, which costs just shy of $100,000, is distinctly Caruso-centric. The mail piece features five different photos of the real estate developer, while the robocall features his voice chiming in with “urgent news for my fellow Democrats.”

“Republicans in Texas have rigged next year’s election to give themselves five new Congressional seats. It’s wrong and California has to push back,” Caruso says in the call.

The advertising is being done independently of the official ballot measure committee led by Newsom-land, though Playbook has been told the campaign got a heads-up that Caruso would be weighing in. Top Democrats on the campaign had been irked that Tom Steyer, another billionaire — and potential gubernatorial candidate — had flooded the airwaves with its own ads that touted Steyer’s push for impeachment, a politically fraught topic the ‘yes’ side had steered clear of in its own messaging. A spokesperson for the Newsom-led committee declined to comment on Caruso’s late-breaking involvement. — Melanie Mason

GERRYMONEYING — It’s not as much as he won playing cards in Las Vegas, but Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, like Newsom a potential presidential candidate in 2028, donated $250,000 to Newsom’s committee supporting the Yes on Prop 50 campaign.

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: MAPPING LATINO POWER — Prop 50 would not only maintain but enhance Latino voters’ power in California House races, political scientists at CalTech and Cal Poly Pomona conclude in a new analysis.

The redrawn maps would keep the current number of Latino-majority districts in California, 16, while adding two districts in which 30 to 50 percent of voting-age people are Latino.

“Our analysis finds that the proposed map will likely not negatively impact Latino voting power,” political scientists Raquel Centeno and Jarred Cuellar write. “The proposed map instead diffuses and enhances that power across more districts, and in many ways reflects the changing demographics of communities within the state.”

Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia’s district would no longer have a Latino majority if Prop 50 passes, while Republican Rep. Ken Calvert’s seat — which would shift westward and become more Democratic — would gain Latino-majority status. (Garcia is running for reelection in what would still be a safe seat, while Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis is pursuing Calvert’s redrawn district.)

CA vs. TRUMP

FIRST IN POLITICO: DRILL GAVIN DRILL — The Trump administration plans to propose opening federal waters in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to offshore drilling, a move that is likely to antagonize coastal states governors — and make a direct jab at Gavin Newsom, Ben Lefebvre reports.

Full details of the plan were not yet known, but a push to bring drilling rigs to untouched sections of the U.S. coastline brought bipartisan opposition when Trump tried to carry out a similar plan during his first administration.

NEWSOMLAND

RISKING HEAVEN — Newsom suggested Trump’s allies are at risk of not getting into heaven, saying they’ll “have a lot to reconcile at the pearly gates,” Juliann Ventura writes.

“To see people in positions of power and influence do absolutely nothing when they must know better — and I believe they do … Boy, they’re going to have a lot to reconcile at the pearly gates,” Newsom said at a press conference Wednesday during the California Economic Summit in Stockton, in California’s Central Valley.

AND GETTING ‘GRACE’ — Newsom, asked if he had advice for Porter, a front-runner to succeed him, following the viral videos of her berating a staffer and threatening to walk out of an interview, offered support instead, Juliann writes in.

“Oh, I got no advice,” Newsom told reporters in Stockton on Wednesday. “I need advice. We all do, a little humility when you’re in this business. We all have those moments. So I don’t, I know people, it’s political, and people are, you know, jumping to cast whatever criticism or aspersion. She acknowledged that. And so look: a little more humility and grace, because I think all of us have been on the other side of you and your camera, those moments where we weren’t our best self. So, no advice in that respect but I think grace.”

HOUSING

SHORT-TERM PAIN — A fight over short-term rental houses and vacation homes is brewing in San Diego. City Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera has proposed asking voters in the city to approve a new tax on the nearly 11,000 properties that are being rented out for short-term use, either by individuals or through companies such as Airbnb, as well as vacation homes. The goal is to free up housing for people who live in San Diego and generate revenue for a city that was forced to raise fees and cut services to close a $350 million budget deficit earlier this year.

“It’s about restoring fairness and balance in our housing market,” argues Elo-Rivera, who’s aiming to get the measure before city voters on the June ballot. Details are in flux, but the initial proposal suggests an annual tax of $5,000 per bedroom, generating about $133 million.

But the proposal could be in for a rough ride, judging by its debut Wednesday before the council’s Rules Committee. Around 100 people testified against it, railing against a tax that would be in addition to the registration fees and transient occupancy taxes they already pay, and likely drive some of them out of the business altogether. Opponents say it would eliminate jobs for cleaners, handymen and landscapers who service the properties and provide fewer options for tourists. Supporters include housing advocates and municipal unions as well as city residents who say the proliferation of short-term rentals has hollowed out neighborhoods and made it harder to live in one of the most expensive American cities.

In the end, it cleared the committee in a 3-1 vote. City Councilmember Raul Campillo was the lone dissenter, arguing the measure unfairly punishes San Diegans who own short-term rentals, will hurt the economy, won’t generate as much revenue as projected and, at a minimum, should be held until the November ballot, when more people vote. The proposal will get a full financial analysis by the city and is expected to come back for another vote in January. — Ben Fox

EDUCATION

QUESTIONNAIRE BLOWBACK — The California Faculty Association apologized for a questionnaire it circulated to candidates running for public office that asked if they had accepted money or endorsements from the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California following fierce blowback from Jewish lawmakers and organizations. In a statement Wednesday, CFA acknowledged the question “created an impression that we are specifically targeting Jewish groups” and apologized for “not being more careful with the formulation of that question, and the confusion and hurt feelings that this article has caused.”

The 29,000-member union said it shouldn’t have included JPAC, which does not make campaign contributions or endorse candidates, in the question and only intended to “have a discussion on issues like academic freedom in order to engage in conversation as part of our endorsement process.”

CFA’s apology came a day after members of the Legislature’s Jewish Caucus said it wouldn’t work with the union unless it acknowledged the “offensive and inappropriate nature of this question” and committed to “not discriminate against Jews or those who seek to partner with the Jewish community.” — Eric He

BAY AREA

END OF THE WUNDER-YEARS — Jim Wunderman, the longtime president and CEO of the Bay Area Council, announced he will leave the business advocacy group at the end of the year to take a job as head of public affairs for California Forever — tech titan Jan Sramek’s vision to build a massive new city in the fields of rural Solano County.

In his resignation letter, Wunderman touted the potential he sees in California Forever, including its pitch to create advanced manufacturing jobs and a major working shipyard. He added, “The notion of producing quality, affordable, dense, market rate housing and middle wage jobs at scale is so attractive and epitomizes everything we stand for.”

During Wunderman’s 22-year tenure at the Bay Area Council, the organization emerged as a powerhouse in shaping civic affairs and the regulatory climate in one of the nation’s most affluent regions.

CLIMATE AND ENERGY

THE NUMBERS ARE IN — The dust has settled on the Trump administration’s $8 billion axing of Energy Department funding, and California was the biggest loser in the nation. The feds cut more projects in the Golden State than anywhere else, according to a POLITICO analysis. Now, many of the state’s congressional leaders are calling foul, demanding a formal investigation into the terminations. Read last night’s California Climate to find out whose funding got cut and what the state’s leaders have to say about it.

Top Talkers

RIDING HIGH — A CBS/YouGov poll had Prop 50 passing with 62 percent support, one of the highest marks of any public survey on the redistricting measure. Of the supporters, three-quarters said they were motivated by a desire to oppose Donald Trump — who has been central to the yes campaign’s messaging.

CONSUMER WATCHDOG WOOFS — Consumer Watchdog produced a podcast featuring accounts of people whose homes burned in this year’s Los Angeles fires to show “how large insurance companies deny consumers the benefits they are owed in the wake of disasters.” The advocacy group’s attempt to shape public opinion comes as Los Angeles homeowners face surcharges to help insurers pay for the fires.

No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways.","Gov. JB Pritzker announced on Thursday the creation of the Illinois Accountability Commission, a new state body tasked with investigating and documenting alleged civil rights abuses tied to federal immigration enforcement operations.

Priztker said the order establishes the commission within the Illinois Department of Human Rights to ensure ""truth, transparency and justice"" amid what he described as ""military-style assaults"" carried out under the Trump administration’s ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

""In the short time, we have witnessed countless acts of harassment and intimidation and brutality and abuse of power perpetrated against law-abiding civilians across our communities,"" Pritzker said. ""Trump's masked agents have detained innocent Americans, citizens and legal residents.""

The Illinois Accountability Commission will focus on three core missions: Creating a public record of reported abuses, documenting the impact on families and recommending actions to prevent further harm.

The commission will be chaired by Ruben Castillo, former chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

Pritzker said the commission’s findings would serve as an official record for future accountability efforts.

""It is imperative that none of the impropriety, brutality and harassment perpetrated upon our people goes unnoticed. Every instance of abuse of law, breaking or violent, and violations of rights needs to be documented and archived,"" Pritzker said.

Immigration agents in Chicago

Local perspective:

The new executive order comes a day after aChicago alderman said federal immigration agents detained multiple people in Little Village, including U.S. citizens and two of his staff members.

Ald. Michael Rodriguez (22nd Ward) said the agents detained two members of his staff, Jacqueline Lopez and Elianne Bahena, the alderman’s chief of staff who also serves as an elected police commissioner.

Both staff members are U.S. citizens, Rodriguez said.

""All residents have the right to peacefully observe ICE/CBP activity. The federal government continues to claim that those who exercise their rights are breaking the law – these claims have been repeatedly proven as false,"" Rodriguez said in a statement.

The alderman added that the agents were ""operating lawlessly, demonstrating utter disregard for our constitutional rights.""

According to community members, a total of eight people were taken into ICE custody.

By Wednesday evening, city officials confirmed that Lopez, Bahena, and others detained during the incident were released from ICE custody after seven hours.

Border Patrol Chief Greg Bovino talked to Fox News about the Little Village raid yesterday. He said he didn't see his agents do anything wrong.

""[I was at] a protest there in the Little Village area of Chicago just now and I watched our agents. They operate with extreme professionalism. They do everything right. I've not seen one instance of something that was out of control …. We are well versed in everything from the use of force to Title 8 immigration law. What we do is legal, ethical and moral,"" Bovino said.

License plate swapping

Dig deeper:

Pritzker's announcement comes a day after Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias issued a warning to federal immigration agents after reports surfaced that ICE agents have been changing or flipping state-issued license plates while carrying out what he described as ""military-style deportation efforts"" in the Chicago area.

A video circulating on social media appears to show a federal agent telling someone, ""You can record all you want. We change the plates out every day.""

In response, Giannoulias said, ""Swapping out license plates or tampering with them to avoid or conceal detection is illegal, unsafe and will not be tolerated in Illinois. No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways. This is a matter of public safety and protecting the wellbeing of our communities.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox32chicago.com/www.fox32chicago.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/vlcsnap-2025-10-23-09h41m26s784.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-23 14:02:43.207728
,Agencies,2025-10-23 17:32:53+00:00,CNN,"Inside ICE's messy effort to hire 10,000 more officers | CNN Politics",Priscilla Alvarez,,,,,https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/23/politics/ice-recruiting-problems-deportation-agents,"The administration has cut down training for ICE officers to 47 days.
“I would say that 97% of them would pass.” “Why would a law enforcement agency want a candidate who can’t pass the physical standards, firearms standards or the basic law enforcement standards.
Former law enforcement officers who have been hired by ICE can complete courses virtually.
We already know what happens when you hire a law enforcement agent with this speed and with this attitude,” Pierce said.
CBP’s hiring push then opened the federal agency up to risk.","When the Trump administration secured billions in funding for the Department of Homeland Security, officials immediately kicked off an aggressive push to hire thousands more deportation officers. It came with a hefty financial incentive: up to a $50,000 signing bonus.

But the effort has hit roadblocks every step of the way.

Multiple sources tell CNN that behind the scenes, ICE was ill-prepared to onboard a surge of agents in a matter of months, resulting in cut corners and people slipping through the cracks, including an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration who had to be plucked out of the pool of candidates after the agency flagged them to ICE.

“It’s a shit show,” an administration official familiar with the efforts told CNN.

The ongoing recruitment efforts were the source of tension in a multi-agency meeting this week with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the driving force behind President Donald Trump’s deportation agenda. Miller expressed frustration with senior ICE officials over the slow pace at which new recruits are hitting the streets to make immigration arrests, according to the administration official.

The signing bonus also prompted discussions internally because it’s not contingent on a key part of the hiring process, which is passing the academy, another source said. Even candidates who don’t pass the academy and are slotted for administrative jobs are still pocketing thousands of dollars.

Current and former ICE officials have argued that the agency — housed under DHS — has historically been strapped for resources and personnel. When Trump signed his sweeping agenda bill into law, it set up ICE to be the most well-funded police force in the federal government over the next four years. ICE alone is set to receive nearly $75 billion through 2029.

When the hiring push first got underway this year, local law enforcement, military veterans, and retired ICE employees received emails from the administration, urging them to join the ranks of the federal agency charged with Trump’s deportation agenda. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took to the airwaves. And the department flooded social media with callouts for so-called “Homeland Defenders,” and medieval images, painting officers as knights.

By January, the agency aims to bring on board 10,000 deportation officers, according to DHS. The speedy hiring push has resulted in minimal background checks, absent or confusing instructions for new hires, and physically unfit people showing up to the academy, sources told CNN. In some cases, human resources was not effectively communicating what field office new hires had to report to or how much they would be paid.

Within ICE and even up to the White House, “HR is not equipped to hire en masse. … No one has support staff to support this,” one former senior ICE official told CNN.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has assigned some of its staff to assist ICE HR staffing operations amid the influx of applications, which DHS says is upwards of 175,000 applicants.

In a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin dismissed the idea that the department was struggling in its recruitment efforts and said the agency is maintaining its “high fitness and training standards.”

“CNN is cherry picking individual cases out of the more than 175,000 applications of individuals who applied to join ICE law enforcement to help us remove murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists from our country,” she said. “The fact of the matter is the vast majority of new officers — more than 85% — brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy.”

CNN has also reached out to the White House for comment

A ‘borderline impossible’ task

To become an ICE officer, there are multiple steps involved, including applying online; being virtually sworn in if hired; reporting for duty at a field office; as well as attending the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Brunswick, Georgia, where almost all federal law enforcement officers receive training.

The process can often take months. The administration has cut down training for ICE officers to 47 days.

According to sources familiar with the current hiring process, there are no longer interviews, marking a change from previous hiring practices. The agency is conducting provisional clearances with a promise of fuller background checks down the line, and officers are virtually swearing in new hires instead of doing so in person.

The Atlantic and NBC News earlier reported on some aspects of ICE’s recruiting struggles.

Former ICE officials told CNN that the agency faced challenges before when it tried to ramp up onboarding, including during the first Trump administration, because of rigorous vetting and training.

“They’re trying to do something borderline impossible and they’re doing it too fast,” said Scott Shuchart, former head of policy at ICE during the Biden administration.

Current and former officials chalk up the confusion among new recruits to the speed and overwhelmed staffing operation. New recruits, for example, are getting unclear guidance on when to show up to their assigned field office and then either inquiring with the academy or just showing up, according to multiple sources.

Other recruits are being pulled because of poor vetting. In one scenario, an informant for the DEA was conditionally offered a job with ICE, but DEA caught it and contacted ICE. In another case, an individual had a pending gun charge, arrived at the academy and was sent home when it came to light.

The DEA declined to respond. Due to the government shutdown, the agency’s public affairs unit tends to only respond to inquiries related to imminent threats to public safety and security.

FLETC offers multiple courses, including academic classes on the Fourth Amendment and immigration law, as well as physical arrest techniques and firearm instruction.

One of the impediments to quickly adding large numbers of gun-toting officers has been the physical requirements, according to multiple sources. Recruits are expected to do 32 sit-ups, 15 push-ups, and run one-and-a-half miles in under 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

More than 200 people have been terminated from the academy for not meeting physical or academic standards, according to a source, meaning that they are returned to their field office where they could be assigned administrative work and return to the academy at a later date.

Robert “Bob” Burnett, a longtime firearms instructor at FLETC who is now retired, told CNN that when he was at the academy, it was exceedingly rare for a recruit to drop out. “I didn’t see that very often,” he explained. “I would say that 97% of them would pass.”

“Why would a law enforcement agency want a candidate who can’t pass the physical standards, firearms standards or the basic law enforcement standards. It would be a liability. Most civilian jobs have special requirements to get the job. In my opinion, it’s a no brainer,” Burnett, who trained at the academy for more than two decades, told CNN.

Former law enforcement officers who have been hired by ICE can complete courses virtually.

Lessons from past surges

It’s not the first time the Department of Homeland Security has tried to quickly hire thousands of federal agents.

In the late 2000s, US Customs and Border Protection significantly increased its hiring of officers and agents. Between fiscal year 2006 through 2011, the agency increased the number of officers and agents along the US southern border by nearly 10,000, according to a 2012 Government Accountability Office report that reviewed CBP’s hiring practices. That was in a span of years; ICE is trying to accomplish the same in a matter of months.

The agency’s PR push at the time included advertisements at NASCAR, bull riding contests, among other places, said Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at Third Way, a think tank. “The advertisements were very much like the advertisements you’d see for video games — the bad guys and the good guys,” she added.

It’s reminiscent of what DHS is doing today.

“We already know how this is going to go. We already know what happens when you hire a law enforcement agent with this speed and with this attitude,” Pierce said.

CBP’s hiring push then opened the federal agency up to risk. The GAO report cited Homeland Security officials who testified that CBP’s increased hiring had “amplified the incentives and opportunities” for corruption, among other concerns.

“In particular, there have been a number of cases in which individuals, known as infiltrators, pursued employment at CBP solely to engage in mission-compromising activity,” the report found, adding that the agency also held concerns about employees who engaged in “corruption-related activities.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-04t173405z-1496775371-rc23lgatiepu-rtrmadp-3-migration-usa-new-york.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-23 14:17:28.384122

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Miccosukee Tribe, sued federal and state agencies this summer, alleging they didn't follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.
However, that injunction was put on hold in early September when the appellate court panel in Atlanta issued a stay, pending the outcome of an appeal, allowing the facility to stay open for the time being.
Two other lawsuits challenging operations at the Everglades detention center are proceeding in federal court in Florida.","A federal lawsuit that temporarily had interrupted operations at an immigration detention in the Florida Everglades dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz"" was paused Wednesday by an appellate court because of the government shutdown.

Earlier this month, U.S. government attorneys had asked the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to stay proceedings in the case because funding for the Justice Department, as well as the Department of Homeland Security which is a defendant, had expired because of the government shutdown.

They requested the pause until appropriations were restored by Congress.

The appellate court on Wednesday granted the request. While the facility was built and operated by the state of Florida and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing the state for $608 million.

Attorneys for the environmental groups that had sued the federal and state governments over environmental concerns about the facility said that the administration of President Donald Trump had been litigating hundreds of cases around the country during the shutdown.

""Apparently, the government has sufficient money and manpower to operate a detention center in the heart of the Everglades to detain foreign born workers, but not enough to file a brief in court to justify its conduct, which the trial court held unlawful,"" said Paul Schwiep, one of the attorneys.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Miccosukee Tribe, sued federal and state agencies this summer, alleging they didn't follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams agreed and ordered in August that the facility needed to wind down operations within two months. However, that injunction was put on hold in early September when the appellate court panel in Atlanta issued a stay, pending the outcome of an appeal, allowing the facility to stay open for the time being.

An opening appellate brief from the federal government had been due on Friday.

Two other lawsuits challenging operations at the Everglades detention center are proceeding in federal court in Florida.

As detentions rise, the trend may continue - NPR","Ximena Bustillo, Rahul Mukherjee",,,,,https://www.npr.org/2025/10/23/nx-s1-5538090/ice-detention-custody-immigration-arrest-enforcement-dhs-trump,"According to a review of deaths by NPR, at least 20 people have died in ICE custody so far this year.
The number comes as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years.
This summer, ICE received about $70 billion to hire more staff, including deportation and detention officers, and increase its detention space.
Additional investigations were conducted by the ICE Health Services Corps and the Immigration Office of Detention Oversight.
DHS has begun a process to hire more medical professionals including nurses and pharmacists as it expands its hiring across ICE, including deportation officers and detention personnel.","Immigration and Customs Enforcement has recorded its deadliest year since the early 2000s as agency officials push to increase the number of people in its custody.

According to a review of deaths by NPR, at least 20 people have died in ICE custody so far this year. The number comes as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years.

Deaths reached a peak in 2025 for the first time since 32 deaths were recorded in 2004, and 20 deaths were recorded in 2005.

Former agency officials are warning that increased detention population, decreased oversight, an increase in street and community arrests and continued difficulties staffing medical teams will result in more deaths. This summer, ICE received about $70 billion to hire more staff, including deportation and detention officers, and increase its detention space. Across the country, media and immigration advocates have reported overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and health care access — a byproduct of a rapid scaling-up of immigration arrests.

""Can staffing actually keep pace with the increase in population? And that becomes particularly challenging in more remote locations where it was already difficult to find qualified staff willing to come out and work,"" said Peter Mina, who worked at ICE for nearly a decade including most recently as the deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. ""And that just places risk all across the system, including, unfortunately, individuals in detention facing medical conditions that might result in their death.""

ICE did not respond to an immediate request for comment on the count.

Mina's former office at DHS was among those that would conduct investigations following a detainee death. Additional investigations were conducted by the ICE Health Services Corps and the Immigration Office of Detention Oversight. CRCL was among the oversight offices at the department that saw hundreds of staff cuts earlier this year. Other CRCL employees have previously told NPR that the gutting of their office could result in more deaths in custody.

During the ongoing government shutdown, DHS has confirmed, the Office of Detention Oversight is not working.

So far this month, two more detainees have died in custody. Medical conditions surrounding deaths over the last calendar year have included tuberculosis, strokes, respiratory failure and about three possible suicides. Each preliminary report includes a synopsis of the detainees' immigration and criminal histories, as they have for past administrations, as well as the events leading to the time of death.

One reason for the rise in deaths, former employees said, is that there are just simply more people in detention.

""With that kind of spike in population, there's going to be a need for additional staffing both on the medical and mental health side, as well as even from an officer standpoint,"" Mina said.

The types of arrests being made by federal immigration officers this year are different, too. Claire Trickler-McNulty, a former ICE official who worked under former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, said that previously most of the agency's detainees either came from the border or from local law enforcement custody.

In these cases, she said, those coming from the border tended to be younger and healthier; or health care records were generally established for those who had been previously detained in prisons or jails.

""Whereas when you pick somebody up on the street, it's a lot of unknowns. Do they have chronic medical conditions they're not even aware of? Do they have addiction issues?"" McNulty said. ""The systems and triaging and maybe even the resources to really appropriately care for people when taking in such a varied population probably should increase.""

Since the early months of the administration, officials have touted focusing their arrests in the ""interior"" of the country, as numbers of crossings at the southern border have steadily decreased.

DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told NPR in a statement that detainees receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care.

""With all these healthcare services and access to medical care ICE provides illegal aliens in detention, it should come as no surprise to the media that as we expand detention space, we need to hire more medical professionals,"" McLaughlin said.

But both Mina and McNulty said that hiring medical staff at immigration detention facilities has long been a challenge for the agency. According to a review of detainee deaths since 2004, three detention facilities have held the most deaths: Eloy Federal Contract facility just outside Phoenix; Krome Services Processing Center in Florida; and Stewart Detention Center in Georgia.

A 2021 DHS Office of Inspector General report identified ""remote locations, a cumbersome hiring process, and competing opportunities"" among the challenges to retaining and recruiting medical staff. The Eloy and Stewart facilities were specifically mentioned as among those experiencing these difficulties.

DHS has begun a process to hire more medical professionals including nurses and pharmacists as it expands its hiring across ICE, including deportation officers and detention personnel.

""ICE is actively recruiting healthcare professionals, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, pharmacists, and health administrators, to support the expanded detention capacity enabled by the historic funding provided under President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill,"" McLaughlin told NPR in a statement.

""Just like with the general population, unfortunately, people will die over a period of time for any series of medical ailments,"" Mina, former deputy officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties at ICE, said. ""But the real question is: In a given case, were there circumstances or actions taken or not taken that suggest that that death may have been preventable?""",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/5644x3175+0+296/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F45%2Fbc%2F30d267024e79850063187235ecb6%2Fgettyimages-2235817850-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 13:17:15.356538

Authorities allege that Carlitos Ricardo Parias, a TikTok creator with a large following online, tried to ram federal agents’ vehicles with his vehicle in an attempt to flee after agents surrounded him and boxed in his car. He was shot in the elbow during the incident while a ricochet bullet hit a deputy US marshal in the hand.

Parias was charged with assault on a federal officer and was expected to appear in court on Wednesday, but the US attorney’s office reported that proceedings had been delayed as Parias was still in the hospital.

As the Trump administration has waged its aggressive campaign of mass deportations, with raids across southern California, Parias has filmed US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations.

On the TikTok profile Richard LA, Parias has for months been posting videos of federal agents arresting people, along with footage of protests and car collisions.

The 44-year-old is a well-known local figure who recently received recognition from the office of Curren Price, a Los Angeles city council member, for his impact on the community and “unfiltered portrayal of real life [that] has fostered a loyal following”.

“Richard is a pillar of our community, a fearless citizen journalist whose authentic storytelling has consistently uplifted the unheard voices of South Central Los Angeles,” Price’s office said in a statement.

On Tuesday morning, federal agents set up surveillance near his home because he was the “subject of an administrative arrest warrant” and had allegedly evaded capture in the past, according to court documents. As Parias began to drive away, agents boxed his car in, preventing him from leaving.

The agents approached Parias and ordered him to exit the vehicle, court documents say, alleging he began moving the car forward and back, “making contact” with the other vehicles. The back of the car began to fishtail and his spinning tires created large plumes of smoke, causing the agents “to fear that Parias would successfully dislodge the Camry … and injure them”, the complaint states.

An agent broke a side window on the vehicle, which did not “subdue” Parias, Bill Essayli, the acting US attorney, said in a statement, adding that an agent then opened fire and wounded Parias and a deputy US marshal.

A witness told ABC7 that Parias seemed nervous and afraid and agents fired rubber bullets and teargas. Video obtained by the Los Angeles Times showed Parias screaming for help after the shooting and firefighters responding to the scene.

Essayli said in a statement: “Vehicles are deadly weapons. Anyone who uses them against federal agents risks arrest, imprisonment and life-threatening injuries.”

If convicted, Parias could face a sentence of up to eight years in prison.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb367febebeaeca65827fe924c095ce5f51ded00/399_0_4001_3200/master/4001.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=93b9c5554ba609ee5b3dea1004241cef",N,,2025-10-23 13:17:20.242017

The letter also arrives weeks after the Guardian learned the state department appointed a dedicated official to handle Ibrahim’s case.
Rubio is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Thursday for a 48-hour visit, following JD Vance, who arrived on Tuesday.
The Guardian first became aware of the teenager’s case after his 20-year-old American-Palestinian cousin Sayfollah Musallet was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers.
Huckabee has not similarly spoken out about Ibrahim’s detention.","More than two dozen Democratic lawmakers have written to the secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the US ambassador to Israel urging them to help secure the release of Mohammed Ibrahim, a 16-year-old Palestinian-American citizen who has been held in Israeli military detention for nearly eight months.

Ibrahim, a dual Palestinian-American teenager from Florida, was arrested in a raid on his family’s West Bank home in February when he was 15 years old. Israeli forces allegedly blindfolded and handcuffed the boy at 3am, according to the letter led by senators Chris Van Hollen and Jeff Merkley and representatives Kathy Castor and Maxwell Frost.

“As we have been told repeatedly, ‘the Department of State has no higher priority than the safety and security of US citizens abroad,’” the lawmakers wrote. “We share that view and urge you to fulfill this responsibility by engaging the Israeli government directly to secure the swift release of this American boy.”

The letter follows the Guardian’s initial reporting on Ibrahim’s detention in July, which noted that he lost a significant amount of weight and contracted scabies, according to state department correspondences obtained by the Guardian.

The group of 27 lawmakers, including Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Adam Schiff and Raphael Warnock, said they had “grave concern” over Ibrahim’s treatment and demanded a response by 3 November detailing what efforts the Trump administration has made to secure his release.

In August, more than 100 US human rights, faith-based and civil rights organizations separately sent their own letter to Rubio demanding Ibrahim’s immediate release. The letter also arrives weeks after the Guardian learned the state department appointed a dedicated official to handle Ibrahim’s case.

Rubio is scheduled to arrive in Israel on Thursday for a 48-hour visit, following JD Vance, who arrived on Tuesday. Rubio’s trip will include meetings with the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and comes as Trump envoys Jared Kushner and Steven Witkoff are also in the country discussing the transition to the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal.

Ibrahim has been accused of throwing rocks at Israeli vehicles in the West Bank in two separate incidents, according to court documents reviewed by the Guardian, though the lawmakers note that “no evidence has been publicly provided to support this allegation”. His family has not been able to contact him directly, receiving updates only through US embassy staff and former detainees.

The lawmakers also point to the March death of Walid Ahmad, a 17-year-old Palestinian who collapsed and died in Megiddo prison after six months of detention for allegedly throwing rocks. His autopsy showed he died from extreme malnutrition, torture, scabies and denial of medical care. Lawmakers warned that “it is the responsibility of the US government to ensure that this recent tragedy does not repeat itself with Mohammed.”

In a recent interview with Defense for Children International-Palestine, Ibrahim described receiving “extremely insufficient” meals, with breakfast consisting of just three tiny pieces of bread and a spoonful of labneh, and lunch amounting to half a small cup of undercooked rice, a single sausage, and three pieces of bread. “Dinner is not provided, and we receive no fruit whatsoever,” he said.

The Guardian first became aware of the teenager’s case after his 20-year-old American-Palestinian cousin Sayfollah Musallet was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers. To date, no arrests have been made in his killing, though the US ambassador, Mike Huckabee – one of the recipients of the new letter – called it a “criminal and terrorist act” and demanded Israel “aggressively investigate the murder”. Huckabee has not similarly spoken out about Ibrahim’s detention.

Palestinians in the occupied West Bank are subject to Israeli military law and tried in military courts, where there have been well-documented concerns about due process. Ibrahim has been denied all contact with the outside world except for visits from US embassy officials, while his court hearings have been routinely postponed.

Israel’s prison service did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e931575871b874e562aa664f0a93ff19a0e0bfb/0_72_1240_992/master/1240.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ee3134c5c0eedf9d263c8a1f1dc2ef87",N,,2025-10-23 13:00:52.997435

All six are charged with conspiracy to bring illegal aliens into the United States, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injuries and resulting in death.
According to court documents, from October 2021 to February 2023, all six worked with other smugglers to facilitate the travel of illegal aliens from Guatemala through Mexico into the United States.
According to the charges, they also provided illegal aliens with scripts and instructions on what to say if apprehended.
The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the arrests and extraditions.","A 41-year-old Guatemalan national is set to make his initial appearance in U.S. federal court on charges stemming from a crash of a tractor-trailer packed with at least 160 illegal aliens – many of them Guatemalan – that killed more than 50 people, including unaccompanied children, and injured over 100 more, the Justice Department announced today.

Authorities arrested Daniel Zavala Ramos aka Dany ZR in Boquerón, Guatemala, Aug. 7 pursuant to a U.S. extradition request and he was surrendered to U.S. authorities Oct. 21. He is expected to make his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Diana Song Quiroga in Laredo this morning.

The extradition is the result of sustained coordination between the Justice Department and Guatemalan authorities following an international enforcement operation carried out Dec. 9, 2024, the third anniversary of the tragedy. The extradition marks yet another significant step in the Justice Department’s efforts to bring those responsible to justice.

Also charged are Tomas Quino Canil, 37, Oswaldo Manuel Zavala Quino aka Osvaldo ZQ, 25, Josefa Quino Canil De Zavala, 43, and Alberto Marcario Chitic aka Alberto De Jesus, 32, who were all taken into custody in Guatemala Dec. 9, 2024. U.S. authorities arrested Jorge Agapito Ventura aka Jorge Ventura, George Ventura or El Raitero, 33, at his residence in Cleveland, Texas, the same day. All are now in federal custody pending further criminal proceedings.

All six are charged with conspiracy to bring illegal aliens into the United States, placing life in jeopardy, causing serious bodily injuries and resulting in death.

According to court documents, from October 2021 to February 2023, all six worked with other smugglers to facilitate the travel of illegal aliens from Guatemala through Mexico into the United States. They allegedly recruited them, collected payment and arranged travel by foot, microbuses, cattle trucks and tractor-trailers.

In some instances, the scheme allegedly involved the smuggling of unaccompanied minors. According to the charges, they also provided illegal aliens with scripts and instructions on what to say if apprehended. The indictment further alleges some of the individuals they recruited died or suffered serious bodily injury as a result of the Dec. 9, 2021, crash.

If convicted, all face a maximum penalty of life in federal prison and a possible $250,000 maximum fine.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s – Homeland Security Investigations’ Counter Proliferation Investigations Group in Washington D.C. conducted the joint investigation with HSI offices in Guatemala and Mexico with substantial assistance of HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit and HSI offices in Houston and Laredo, Customs and Border Protection’s National Targeting Center, Operation Sentinel, Border Patrol, Liberty County Constable, Precinct 6; ICE - Enforcement and Removal Operations in Houston, U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Texas and Justice Department’s Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training.

The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant assistance in securing the arrests and extraditions. Guatemalan and Mexican prosecutors, with the support of law enforcement officials from both countries, were also instrumental in furthering the investigation.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jennifer Day and Mary Lou Castillo are prosecuting the case along with Senior Trial Attorney Danielle Hickman of the Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section with substantial assistance from HRSP Latin American Specialist/Historian Joanna Crandall.

The indictment is the result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha. JTFA, a partnership with Department of Homeland Security, has been elevated and expanded with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border, including the Southern District of California, Districts of Arizona and New Mexico and Western and Southern Districts of Texas. Dedicated support is provided by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, Office of Enforcement Operations and the Office of International Affairs, among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 420 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 370 U.S. convictions; more than 315 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

This case is part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the DOJ to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces and Project Safe Neighborhood.

The Italian prime minister spoke to heads of state and government before a European Council summit meeting in Brussels on Thursday morning.

The Telegraph understands she set out a plan to reform the ECHR so that it can meet modern-day challenges over illegal immigration, such as people smuggling gangs.

It should lead to a first political debate on reforms in the Council of Europe, which is based in Strasbourg and is not an EU body but a larger human rights watchdog.

The roadmap was drawn up in coordination with Alain Berset, the secretary general of the Council of Europe, she told leaders from Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, the European Commission, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Greece, Latvia, Malta, Poland and Sweden.

They agreed that senior officials would meet in Rome on Nov 5 to continue discussing international conventions and illegal migration.

“Prime minister Meloni provided an update on the work in progress on how the international conventions match the challenges of irregular migration and on upcoming initiatives,” an Italian government spokesperson said.

“The leaders agreed to continue to maintain close cooperation not only within the EU and the Council of Europe, but also, more generally, in various international contexts in order to promote more effectively the European approach to the orderly management of migration flows.”

The European Court of Human Rights is part of the Council of Europe and was set up to enforce the ECHR, which has been criticised for tying governments’ hands on illegal immigration.

Sir Keir Starmer has vowed the UK will never leave the ECHR, despite calls from the Tories and Reform UK to quit it, but he does want to restrict the ways it is used to fight deportations.

Nearly 37,000 migrants arrived in the UK by small boats this year, more than the total for the whole of 2024, Home Office figures showed on Thursday.

The Prime Minister argues, like Ms Meloni, that mass migration is a far greater problem now than it was when the international laws were drafted after the Second World War.

“We need to look again at the interpretation of some of these provisions, not tear them down,” he said earlier this month.

Since his election last year, Sir Keir has held talks on illegal migration with Ms Meloni and Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister.

Ms Frederiksen, a Left-wing leader who defeated a surge in support for Right-wing parties with a tough migration policy, chaired the meeting in Brussels and also wants ECHR reform.

Before the meeting in Brussels, Ms Meloni told the Italian parliament that the breakfast meeting would help find “innovative solutions” to illegal migration.

“It will be an opportunity to take stock of the issue of international conventions and the need to ensure that their implementation allows us to address the challenges of modern irregular migration – challenges that were unthinkable when those conventions were written, and signed by Italy,” the hard-Right leader said.

“On this occasion, we will propose to our partners a roadmap that, in cooperation with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Mr Berset, should lead in the coming months to an initial political debate on the topic in Strasbourg.”

Ms Meloni’s Albania plan, where migrants picked up in the Mediterranean would be processed in non-EU Albania, has been mired in legal difficulties.

Denmark has an agreement with Rwanda to process asylum seekers, but the deal is on hold amid concerns over possible legal barriers, including the ECHR.

The Netherlands is also preparing to send failed asylum seekers to Uganda in a plan that is expected to face legal challenges.

In her recent speech to the UN General Assembly, Ms Meloni took aim at so-called activist judges.

“These rules were established at a time when mass irregular migration did not exist and nor did human traffickers,” she said in New York.

“These conventions are no longer current in this context and, when they are interpreted in an ideological and unidirectional way by politicised judges, they end up trampling on the law, rather than upholding it.”

Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands have made the informal talks on migration a fixture of European Council summits.

Fourteen EU states, including Germany, Poland, Austria and Hungary, have taken part in meetings of the “migration hawks”, as they are called in Brussels.

Ms Meloni has already led a successful push in Brussels to reform migration laws to make it easier to deport failed asylum seekers and house them in camps outside the EU.

In the first eight months of this year, 112,000 people crossed illegally into Europe, down 21 per cent from 2024 and 52 per cent from the same period in 2023. The EU has signed return deals with non-EU countries, while its member states have cracked down on illegal immigration and moved to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers.

All 27 EU member states, as well as the UK, belong to the 46-state Council of Europe and are signatories to the ECHR.

A Council of Europe spokesman told The Telegraph: “Secretary General Alain Berset acknowledges prime minister Meloni’s outreach. He stresses that political dialogue and collaboration within the Council of Europe is the right method to addressing migration on our continent. And he reaffirms the importance of ensuring the integrity of the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.”

,Human Rights,2025-10-23 13:32:45+00:00,Free Movement,New suitability rules will apply to Appendix FM and other human rights applications,Alex Piletska,,,,,https://freemovement.org.uk/new-suitability-rules-will-apply-to-appendix-fm-and-other-human-rights-applications/,"The new version, in SUI 11.3, applies to all four types of breaches of immigration law, past and present: SUI 11.3.
Appendix FM Applications under Appendix FM, namely applications as a partner, parent or child of a British or settled person (or someone with another type of qualifying leave), will usually engage Article 8 ECHR.
That is not the case with applications founded on Article 8 ECHR rights like the applications under Appendix FM.
Appendix Private Life Like Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life had previously enjoyed slightly more generous category-specific suitability requirements, which were confusingly also found in Appendix FM for some of the applications found in this section but which harmonised with Part 9 in others.
This has been retained, with the references to the Appendix FM suitability grounds amended to “SUI 2.1.","One of the biggest changes introduced by the most recent statement of changes is not so much the replacement of the Part 9 grounds for refusal with a new yet very similar “Part Suitability” but rather the way these rules will now apply in full to the following applications that previously enjoyed carve-outs and exceptions:

Appendix FM

Appendix Private Life

Appendix Adult Dependent Relative

Appendix Settlement Family Life

There are also other minor amendments, including incorporating the exceptions for overstayers currently found in paragraph 39E into Part Suitability.

These changes take effect from 11 November 2025. Aside from some very limited exceptions which will be discussed below, there are no provisions for considering an application under the old rules where an application is lodged before this date but decided after.

Part Suitability

As discussed above, many of the various carve outs for different application routes are now gone, replaced with this:

SUI 1.1. This Part applies to all routes under these rules, except:

(a) Appendix EU; and

(b) Appendix EU (Family Permit); and

(c) Part 11 (Asylum), except Part Suitability does apply to paragraphs 352ZH to 352ZS, and 352I to 352X; and

(d) Appendix Service Providers from Switzerland; and

(e) Appendix Settlement Protection.

There are still some limited exceptions for some routes:

SUI 1.2. For the following Appendixes, only the stated provisions of this Part apply:

(a) For applications for permission to stay under Appendix Domestic Worker who is a Victim of Modern Slavery, paragraphs DWMS 2.1: SUI.2.1(c), SUI.2.2, SUI .3.1, SUI.3.2, SUI 5.1(b), SUI 5.1(c), SUI 5.2, SUI 5.5, SUI 9.1., SUI 9.2., SUI 10.1., SUI 14.1, SUI 14.2., SUI 24.1, SUI 28.1, SUI 29.1; and

(b) For applications permission granted under the Agreement, paragraphs SUI 2.2, SUI 3.2, SUI 5.2, SUI 5.5., SUI 8.2, SUI 10.2., and SUI 27.2 apply where the criminal offence or adverse conduct occurred after 11pm on 31 December 2020; and

(c) for applications for permission to stay under Appendix ECAA Extension of 14 Stay, paragraphs SUI 2.1, SUI 3.1, SUI 5.1, SUI 5.3., SUI 8.1, SUI 9.1, SUI 10.1, SUI 16.1, SUI 17.1 and SUI 27.1, and in relation to such permission paragraphs SUI 2.2, SUI 3.2, SUI 5.2, SUI 5.5, SUI 8.2, SUI 10.2. and SUI 27.2 apply where the criminal offence or adverse conduct occurred after 11pm on 31 December 2020.

The only other part of the rules exempt from the regime is Appendix Electronic Travel Authorisation.

Because the new appendix uses the simplified “permission” to refer to permission to enter and permission to stay (including settlement), there is a provision that stipulates that people with settlement are excluded from any rules that allow for permission to be cancelled (also known as curtailed):

SUI 1.4. Where a person has settlement and is in-country (not including at the UK border) their permission can only be cancelled on the grounds contained in section 76 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

The rest of Part Suitability is substantially identical to the current Part 9 rules, aside from the following changes.

This is reflected in the changes to para 6.2 of the rules, which now defines permission as “either permission to enter or permission to stay and includes settlement”, with effect from 11 November 2025.

Although people with settlement who are in the UK are protected from having their indefinite leave to remain curtailed by the above provision, this does not appear to be the case for people with indefinite leave who are outside the UK or at the border. As this represents a potential risk for indefinite leave to remain holders, it may be a good idea to naturalise as a British citizen as soon as possible, just to be on the safe side.

Additional ground for refusal under Appendix FM

There will now be an additional ground for refusing entry clearance applications where there is a safeguarding concern, which will presumably (though not explicitly) only apply to children:

SUI 6.1. An application for entry clearance under Appendix FM must be refused if the decision maker considers the applicant’s parent or parent’s partner poses a risk to the applicant.

Grounds for refusal on the basis of deception

The substance of these grounds has been retained under the new rules, with a minor amendment to the wording. At present, the grounds refer to refusal or cancellation of existing permission where the decision maker “can prove that it is more likely than not the applicant used deception”. This has been changed to “the decision maker is satisfied the applicant used deception”:

SUI 9.1. An application for entry clearance or permission must be refused where the decision maker is satisfied that the applicant used deception by:

(a) making false representations or providing false documents or false information in relation to the application (whether or not relevant to the application); or

(b) not disclosing relevant facts in relation to the application.

SUI 9.2. Permission extended under section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 may be cancelled where the decision maker is satisfied the applicant used deception by:

(a) making false representations or providing false documents or false information in relation to an application (whether or not relevant to the application); or

(b) not disclosing relevant facts in relation to an application.

We will have to wait and see if this represents a change in how allegations of deception are considered, particularly in light of any updated guidance, though my feeling is that this is unlikely to be the case because of the substantial case law on this subject which will still apply to the new rules.

The other minor change is that the new wording of the mandatory ground for refusal on the basis of deception now specifies that the relevant way that deception is used for the purposes of these provisions is by making false representations, false documents or false information, or by not disclosing material facts, whereas the previous version simply said “used deception”, though I don’t think anything turns on this.

Previous breach of immigration law

Under the current rules, the definition of “previously breached immigration laws” is found in the “Interpretation” section at para 6.2 of the rules and reads “a person previously breached immigration laws if they overstayed or used deception in relation to a previous application”, which means that, in my view at least, other breaches of immigration law such as breaching conditions of leave or being an illegal entrant aren’t technically caught by it.

The new mandatory and discretionary grounds for refusal on the basis of past breaches are identical to the current ones, only the term is now fully defined:

SUI 11.4. An applicant will be treated as having breached immigration laws if, aged 18 or over, they:

(a) overstayed their permission, unless an exception in SUI 11.5. or SUI 11.6. applied to that period of overstaying; or

(b) breached a condition attached to their permission, unless entry clearance or further permission has subsequently been granted in the knowledge of the breach; or

(a) were (or still are) an illegal entrant; or

(b) used deception in relation to a previous application (whether or not 19 successfully).

The typo in the “a, b, a, b” lettering above is not mine.

The current version of para 9.8.3 allows for an application for permission to stay to be refused on a discretionary basis where the applicant had previously failed to comply with the conditions of their permission unless permission has been granted in the knowledge of the previous breach. The new version, in SUI 11.3, applies to all four types of breaches of immigration law, past and present:

SUI 11.3. An application for permission may be refused where the applicant is, or has been, in breach of immigration laws as defined in SUI 11.4

The “unless permission has been granted in the knowledge of the previous breach” exception still applies to a breach of conditions but not the other three breaches of immigration law in SUI 11.4.

That means that someone who is applying for settlement, for example, who had previously overstayed but was since granted leave, could potentially face a refusal of their application because of that past overstaying, though it’s too early to know how widely this power will be used in practice, as it remains a discretionary ground.

The other change is the simplification of the confusingly-drafted para 9.8.2 (“contrived in a significant way to frustrate the intention of the rules”), which under the new rules will read:

SUI 11.2. An application for entry clearance or permission to enter may be refused where:

(a) the applicant has previously breached immigration laws as defined in SUI 11.4; and

(b) the application was made outside the relevant time period in SUI 12.1; and

(c) the applicant has acted to frustrate immigration controls (see SUI 11.7.).

This is further defined as follows:

SUI 11.7. An applicant will be treated as having acted to frustrate immigration controls, if aged 18 or over, they (for example):

(a) failed to cooperate with the redocumentation, arrest or removal process; or

(b) used a false identity; or

(c) failed to report as required or absconded from immigration custody or bail; or

(d) obtained state or public authority benefits, tax credits, employment or goods or services they were not entitled to or accessed housing in the private rented sector; or

(e) used multiple identities; or

(f) participated in immigration related crime.

I don’t love the “for example” that precedes the list, as it makes it clear that the list is not exhaustive. However, this is still preferable to the wording of the current version, which is incorrectly drafted, and which also excludes some of these examples, only for them to turn up in the guidance.

Exceptions for overstayers

These provisions, currently found in para 39E of the rules, are being imported into Part Suitability wholesale:

SUI 13.1. An applicant will not be treated as an overstayer if:

(a) their application was made within 14 days of their previous permission expiring, and the decision maker considers that there was a good reason beyond the control of the applicant or their representative, provided in or with the application, why the application could not be made in-time; or

(b) the application was made:

(i) following the refusal or rejection of a previous application for permission which was made in-time; and

(ii) within 14 days of:

(1) the refusal or rejection of that previous application; or

(2) the expiry of any permission extended by section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971; or

(3) the expiry of the time-limit for making an in-time application for administrative review or appeal in relation to the previous application (where applicable); or

(4) any administrative review or appeal in relation to the previous application being concluded, withdrawn, abandoned or lapsing; or

(c) the period of overstaying was between 24 January 2020 and 31 August 2020; or

(d) the applicant has, or had, permission on the Hong Kong BN(O) route, and the period of overstaying was between 1 July 2020 and 31 January 2021: or

(e) the period of overstaying:

(i) is between 1 September 2020 and 28 February 2023; and

(ii) is covered by an exceptional assurance.

SUI 13.2. For the purpose of SUI 13.1(e)(ii), “exceptional assurance” means a written notice given to a person by the Home Office stating that they would not be considered an overstayer for the period specified in the notice.

All of the above changes take effect from 11 November 2025, with no transitional provisions. That means that even if an application is lodged before this date, it will be considered under the new rules if it is decided on or after 11 November 2025.

Application to human rights applications

Although the changes to the grounds themselves are mostly minor, the impending application of all of these grounds to the human rights routes like Appendix FM, which previously benefited from more generous category-specific suitability rules, is unprecedented.

Before I go on to the minutiae of the category-specific changes, which mostly touch on exceptional circumstances but not in a way that will sufficiently reassure you, I just want to pause to consider what this means. To use the Appendix FM partner route as an example, if you are lodging an entry clearance application under the new rules, the following suitability grounds will now apply to you for the first time:

Mandatory refusal for a conviction for which the applicant was imprisoned for at least 12 months, no matter how much time has passed since then

Discretionary refusal for any other convictions, including out of court disposals, no matter how much time has passed since then

Mandatory cancellation of permission where someone has been convicted of an offence with a sentence of over 12 months

Mandatory re-entry bans for breaching immigration laws, including relevant overstaying (there are still exceptions for e.g. overstaying for less than 30 days)

Discretionary refusal for current or previous breaches of immigration law for in-country applications

Of course, applications like these have a human rights dimension so the application of these new provisions isn’t quite as straightforward as when these kinds of grounds for refusal were first introduced to apply to other categories like work and study routes. This is explicitly recognised by the preamble to Part Suitability:

Where a refusal under this Part would be incompatible with the UK obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) the route specific rules set out the approach to be taken.

I will look at these category-specific changes below.

Appendix FM

Applications under Appendix FM, namely applications as a partner, parent or child of a British or settled person (or someone with another type of qualifying leave), will usually engage Article 8 ECHR. Accordingly, these routes contain provisions for waiving some of the requirements where someone doesn’t meet the rules.

GEN 3.1-3.2

GEN 3.1 of Appendix FM provides an exception for people who cannot meet the financial requirement, provided all other requirements of the rules are met, and allows for other sources of income to be taken into account. GEN 3.2 is a more general provision that allows an application to be granted when any of the other requirements are not met.

In both cases, the applicant has to show that there are “exceptional circumstances which would render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or remain, a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because such refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child or another family member”. This is a high threshold and in practice, grants of leave under these provisions are rare.

The new rules amend these provisions so that an application can only be granted on the basis of these exceptional circumstances if the applicant doesn’t fall foul of particular Part Suitability provisions:

D-ECP.1.2A. Where paragraph GEN 3.2(3) applies but the applicant does not meet the suitability paragraphs SUI 2.1., SUI 2.3., SUI 4.1., SUI 5.1., in Part Suitability, the application on Appendix FM will be refused.

Those four grounds of refusal are as follows.

(1) SSHD personally directed the applicant to be excluded, exclusion order or deportation order:

SUI 2.1. An application for entry clearance or permission must be refused where:

(a) the Secretary of State has personally directed that the applicant be excluded from the UK; or

(b) the applicant is the subject of an exclusion order; or

(c) the applicant is the subject of a deportation order, or a decision to make a deportation order

(2) Excluded person under 8B(4) of the 1971 Act:

SUI 2.3. An application for entry clearance must be refused where the applicant is an excluded person, as defined by section 8B(4) of the Immigration Act 1971, and the person does not fall within section 8B(5A) or 8B(5B) of that Act.

(3) Exclusion from the Refugee Convention:

SUI 4.1. An application for entry clearance or permission must be refused where a decision maker:

(a) has at any time decided that paragraph 339AA (exclusion from Refugee Convention), 339AC (danger to the UK), 339D (exclusion from a grant of humanitarian protection) or 339GB (revocation of humanitarian protection on grounds of exclusion) of these rules applies to the applicant; or

(b) has decided that paragraph 339AA, 339AC, 339D or 339GB of these rules would apply, but for the fact that the person has not made a protection claim in the UK, or that the person has made a protection claim which was finally determined without reference to any of the relevant matters described in paragraphs 339AA, 339AC, 339D or 339GB.

(4) Criminality:

SUI 5.1. An application for entry clearance or permission must be refused where the applicant:

(a) has been convicted of a criminal offence in the UK or overseas for which they have received a custodial sentence of 12 months or more; or

(b) is a persistent offender who shows a particular disregard for the law; or

(c) has committed a criminal offence, or offences, which caused serious harm.

These exclusions also apply to applications that rely on EX.1 (relationship with a qualifying child or insurmountable obstacles to the couple living outside the UK), as the relevant paragraphs dealing with those applications have been amended in line with the above.

The effect of this appears to be that where any Part Suitability mandatory grounds for refusal are engaged, the only way your application can still succeed is if the “exceptional circumstances” exemption under GEN 3.2 applies, as long as the relevant ground is not one of the four excluded suitability grounds listed above.

Transitional provisions

All of these changes take effect on 11 November 2025, though all of the relevant category-specific changes in Appendix FM do have transitional provisions that mean that an application will be considered under the previous rules if lodged on 10 November 2025 or earlier.

This is slightly confusing, as the Part Suitability changes take effect on 11 November 2025 without any transitional provisions.

Case study

Frank is a US national who was convicted of an offence 20 years ago for which he received a custodial sentence of 14 months.

On 10 November 2025, he lodges an entry clearance application to join his British husband in the UK. All the other requirements of the route (other than potentially suitability) are met. His application is decided on 22 January 2026.

When his application is decided, the decision maker will look at the Appendix FM rules as they were on 10 November 2025, other than a few minor differences that don’t have transitional provisions, such as references to para 39E now referring to Part Suitability, which do not make substantive changes to suitability.

Under the previous suitability rules, found in Section S-EC: Suitability of Appendix FM, he would qualify for entry clearance because his sentence was for more than 12 months but less than four years, and more than 10 years have passed since. So, looking at just Appendix FM as it was on 10 November 2025, the application should be granted.

However, the decision maker will presumably also have to also look at Part Suitability, as there are no transitional provisions for when that takes effect on 11 November 2025, and the first section of Part Suitability says that it applies at all applications without any carve out for Appendix FM. Under Part Suitability, he must be refused under SUI 5.1(a) because of his sentence of over 12 months.

Assuming that there is a point to the transitional provisions, there are two possible options for what they were intended to do:

(1) The Home Office intended for anyone who applies under Appendix FM before 11 November to have their application decided under the old suitability rules, without reference to Part Suitability, and they just didn’t notice that Part Suitability will apply to all applications decided after 11 November because they thought preserving the old Appendix FM suitability rules for people like Frank would be enough.

In that case, Frank’s application would succeed, as long as those instructions were communicated to the relevant decision makers.

(2) The Home Office intended Part Suitability to apply to Appendix FM applications lodged before 11 November so what they wanted to preserve through their transitional provisions for people like Frank is the original definition of GEN 3.2, which in this case and for anyone who applies before 11 November, will be capable of waiving all requirements of Part Suitability, including the four grounds that can never be waived for anyone applying under the new rules.

The effect of this is that Frank faces a mandatory refusal under SUI 5.1(a) unless he can show that there are exceptional circumstances that would “render refusal of entry clearance, or leave to enter or remain, a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, because such refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant, their partner, a relevant child or another family member”.

If Frank includes strong evidence to this effect, the application may be granted. Otherwise, the application would be refused.

Rules as written, the correct interpretation must be (2), otherwise the Home Office would have applied transitional provisions not just to the various changes to Appendix FM but also to the repeal of the first section of Part 9, which deals with which routes it applies to. But this might just be an oversight.

Article 8 compatibility

There are still human rights considerations to be taken into account, even beyond the fact that Appendix FM is, at least in theory, drafted in a way as to be compliant with Article 8. There will undoubtedly be cases where the new rules mandate a refusal but where that refusal would nevertheless breach the applicant’s human rights and thus should still succeed.

There are no provisions, for example, for someone currently in the UK as a partner under Appendix FM who has a historic conviction and who would now presumably be subject to a mandatory refusal at the extension stage. It is difficult to imagine someone with a conviction for which they were sentenced to 13 months’ imprisonment in the 1970s, and who has lived in the UK for seven years with their British spouse and minor British children, being required to leave the UK because they no longer qualify under the new rules at the extension stage.

When the current version of the Part 9 suitability rules came into effect, they only applied to non-human rights applications like work and study routes, so the people who were suddenly excluded from further grants of leave or settlement had limited avenues to challenge these decisions. That is not the case with applications founded on Article 8 ECHR rights like the applications under Appendix FM.

Appendix Private Life

Like Appendix FM, Appendix Private Life had previously enjoyed slightly more generous category-specific suitability requirements, which were confusingly also found in Appendix FM for some of the applications found in this section but which harmonised with Part 9 in others.

The main change is just Part Suitability applying to this appendix without any carve-outs. The route currently contains a human rights exception:

PL 8.1. If the applicant does not meet the suitability requirements (subject to PL 8.2), or does not meet any of the eligibility requirements in PL 3.1., PL 4.1. or PL 5.1. the decision maker must be satisfied that refusal of permission to stay would not breach Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention on the basis of private life.

PL 8.2. Where PL 8.1. applies and the applicant falls for refusal under suitability paragraphs S-LTR.1.2., S-LTR.1.3., S-LTR.1.4., S-LTR.1.5., S-LTR.1.6 or S-LTR 1.8. of Appendix FM of these rules the application on the Private Life route will be refused.

This has been retained, with the references to the Appendix FM suitability grounds amended to “SUI 2.1. SUI 3.1., SUI 4.1., or SUI 5.1. of Part Suitability”, which are the four excluded grounds for refusal referred to above.

The current rules include an exception to some of the grounds for refusal and the new rules retain this exception without substantive amendment:

PL 12.4. Where any of the following occur during the applicant’s qualifying period for settlement, the applicant must be refused settlement unless the applicant has completed a continuous qualifying period of 10 years with permission as set out in PL 12.6. and has completed 5 years continuous residence with such permission after the date of the first grant of permission after the suitability ground came to the attention of the decision maker:

(a) involvement in a sham marriage or civil partnership (SUI 8.1. of Part Suitability); or

(b) use of false documents or information or deception (SUI 9.1. and SUI 10.1. of Part Suitability); or

(c) litigation debt owed to the Home Office, unless the debt has been paid (SUI 17.1. of Part Suitability); or

(d) debt to the NHS, unless the debt has been paid, or the total value of outstanding charges is under £500 (SUI 16.1. of Part Suitability); or

(e) the applicant has breached the conditions of their permission (SUI 11.1. of Part Suitability).

These changes take effect on 11 November 2025, with no transitional provisions.

Appendix Adult Dependent Relative

As above, the main change is the Part Suitability will now apply to these applications without any carve-outs.

This appendix contains a human rights exception:

ADR 7.1. If the applicant does not meet all the suitability requirements (subject to ADR 7.2) or does not meet all of the eligibility requirements in ADR 3.1. to ADR 6.4., but the decision maker is satisfied that refusal of the application would breach Article 8 of the Human Rights Convention, because it would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant or their family, the applicant will meet the Article 8 ECHR eligibility requirement.

ADR 7.2. Where ADR 7.1. applies and the applicant falls for refusal on suitability grounds under S-EC.1.2 to S-EC.1.5, or S-LTR.1.2 to S-LTR.1.6. of Appendix FM of these rules the application as an Adult Dependent Relative must be refused.

These remain in the new rules unamended, which is presumably a mistake, as the exclusionary provision in ADR 7.2 refers to the suitability rules in Appendix FM that the statement of changes deletes in their entirety. Until they are amended in a future statement of changes, it seems ADR 7.2 will have no applicability.

As with Appendix Private Life, this route already contains the same exception to the five grounds for refusal listed above for in-country applications, which have been retained under the new rules.

These changes take effect on 11 November 2025, with no transitional provisions.

Appendix Settlement Family Life

Again, the main change is that Part Suitability will now apply to these applications without carve-outs.

As with Appendix Private Life and Appendix Adult Dependent Relative, this route already contains the same exception to the five specified grounds for refusal, and this has been retained under the new rules.

At the White House luncheon on Tuesday, Mr. Trump happily celebrated Mr. Vought as “Darth Vader,” for the fear provoked by the man behind the administration’s determined drive to strip spending power from Congress.
“You’re doing a great job, I have to tell you,” Mr. Trump declared of Mr. Vought.","By almost any measure, Congress is failing. And flailing.

The government is shut down for the 22nd day, with many federal workers not being paid, agencies and museums closed, and top lawmakers making no serious effort to resolve the disruptive impasse. Congressional staff members have begun referring to themselves as volunteers.

The House has, quite literally, ground to a halt. The chamber has not voted since Sept. 19 and Speaker Mike Johnson refuses to call members back, preventing them from doing any legislative work. He has refused to seat a new duly elected Democratic member from Arizona one month after her victory, though he encouraged her to return home and work for constituents she does not yet officially represent because he won’t administer her the oath of office.

As the Trump administration shifts billions of dollars around to take care of its priorities during the shutdown with scant input from lawmakers, ignoring Congress’s clear constitutional supremacy over the power of the purse, Republicans in control have done nothing to push back.

“The Congress is adrift,” said Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska. “It’s like we have given up. And that’s not a good signal to the American public.”

Since assuming office in January, Mr. Trump and his top aides, seasoned from their first stint in the White House, have aggressively and enthusiastically usurped congressional power with little resistance from G.O.P. leaders in the House and the Senate. In many instances, they have willingly ceded their prerogatives and cheered on the president.

Even as administration policies threaten economic harm to huge swaths of rural America that they represent, congressional Republicans have been mainly silent as Mr. Trump has unilaterally imposed and threatened tariffs to achieve his own strategic, political and economic goals. Never mind that the Constitution gives Congress chief responsibility for levying tariffs.

The administration has embarked on deadly military operations off the coast of Venezuela and Colombia without the consent of Congress and no call from Republican lawmakers to scrutinize any oversight of the activities, even as the Pentagon cracks down on media coverage and communications with Congress.

Despite deep bipartisan support for sanctions on Russia over its war with Ukraine, Republicans have repeatedly reversed course and delayed legislative action because of mixed signals from Mr. Trump, who only days ago exhibited a willingness to restrain Moscow before he again pulled back. On Wednesday, his administration announced new penalties on Russia but still sidestepped Congress, which has pressed for more stringent measures.

Mr. Trump himself suggested this week that Congress had little left to do after passing its sweeping domestic policy and tax bill this year since Republicans had packaged all of his top priorities into the special filibuster-proof measure adopted solely with G.O.P. votes.

“There is a real danger that self-inflicted wounds by this institution will imperil it,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. “I think people are shaking their heads that Congress has reached this point in America.”

Democrats have been largely steamrolled by Mr. Trump and his Republican allies all year. They have relied on the courts to hold the line against illegal actions by the White House, a hope that has met with mixed success.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, and his members are now employing what little leverage they do possess by denying Republicans the 60 votes they need to pass a short-term spending bill to fund the government. They are demanding that Republicans join them in extending pandemic-era Obamacare insurance subsidies that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year to avoid big premium increases on millions of people.

But Mr. Johnson and Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, refuse to negotiate with Democrats until they approve the short-term spending bill, creating the impasse that has shuttered much of the government.

And Republican leaders have made it clear that they view their role as subordinate to the president, saying they won’t open talks with their Democratic counterparts unless Mr. Trump allows them to do so.

The current shutdown has been distinguished from past ones by a marked lack of urgency to resolve it, with senators repeating the same failed votes for days on end in a “Groundhog Day” exhibition before flying home for the weekends. The House chamber, on the other hand, has remained entirely empty except for occasional brief pro forma sessions in an extraordinary display of absenteeism.

Mr. Johnson has said he wants lawmakers to stay away to keep the pressure on Democrats. But there is a belief among both Democrats and Republicans that he doesn’t want to take the risk that fractious House members could convene and make his job holding the line more difficult.

He has also used the excuse of the House being out of formal session to refuse to swear in Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, who was elected in September in a special election to replace her late father, Raúl.

There are evidently some limits to what Congress will swallow. Republicans this week pressed the White House to withdraw the nomination of Paul Ingrassia to head the Office of Special Counsel after Politico disclosed a series of racist and offensive texts he sent.

Senate Republicans also raised the alarm on behalf of cattle ranchers who have been battered in recent years after Mr. Trump suggested that he might increase imports of Argentine beef to bolster markets there. The administration showed signs of heeding their calls.

But the funding impasse now has top Republicans talking about the possibility of a yearlong extension of current federal spending. That would further undermine Congress’s authority, shifting the power to shape spending from the once formidable Appropriations Committees to the White House and its budget director, Russell T. Vought.

At the White House luncheon on Tuesday, Mr. Trump happily celebrated Mr. Vought as “Darth Vader,” for the fear provoked by the man behind the administration’s determined drive to strip spending power from Congress.

“You’re doing a great job, I have to tell you,” Mr. Trump declared of Mr. Vought.

Then Senate Republicans gave a round of applause to the man eager to render them irrelevant.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/22/multimedia/22DC-ASSESS-top-hvmk/22DC-ASSESS-top-hvmk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 09:56:52.545066

“Our agencies remain committed to supporting the rule of law within our jurisdictions, regardless of whether they are state, local, or federal operations,” they said in the statement.
This story was originally published October 22, 2025 at 1:56 PM.","The Canyon County Sheriff’s Office and Caldwell Police Department released a joint statement Wednesday saying they wanted to clarify the situation around Sunday’s raid in Wilder, which was not an ICE-led operation, despite what the Department of Homeland Security indicated.

In a statement to the media Tuesday, Homeland Security said that “ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation” and that “as part of the operation ICE law enforcement officers arrested 105 illegal aliens.”

The raid at La Catedral Arena, where four people were arrested as part of an FBI criminal investigation on alleged illegal gambling, was in fact led by the FBI’s Treasure Valley Metro Violent Crime and Gang Task Force, according to Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram.

The FBI has said several times that it was the lead agency and that ICE was there “as part of the broader federal team to process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations.”

In their joint statement, Donahue and Ingram criticized Homeland Security for putting out a statement that was “deeply misleading to the public.”

“To be clear, this was not an ICE-led enforcement action,” the pair stated. “The statement released by DHS yesterday claiming responsibility for dismantling a criminal organization was completely false and a serious misrepresentation of the facts.”

Roughly 200 law enforcement agents were present at the racetrack, including Caldwell and Nampa police, and Canyon County officers, who were part of the task force. There were 10 agencies represented in total.

Five people have been charged in the gambling operation, after a fifth was arrested Monday night, and Homeland Security said ICE agents took 105 people into custody over their immigration status.

Donahue and Ingram said they normally would limit any comments on “active federal investigations,” but “we feel it’s important to address the confusion caused by recent public statements from the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).”

They also noted that questions about the raid and cases should be directed to the FBI’s Salt Lake City Field Office.

“Our agencies remain committed to supporting the rule of law within our jurisdictions, regardless of whether they are state, local, or federal operations,” they said in the statement.

Democratic San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said Wednesday that ""our communities have already endured the painful impact of aggressive immigration enforcement.
""For the last 10 months, we have been taking steps to prepare for this kind of escalation here in San Francisco,"" he continued.
""Immigrants are the small business owners, essential workers, community leaders, and neighbors who make San Francisco a place that we are proud to call home.
""San Francisco will never stand by as our neighbors are targeted, and neither will I.""","President Donald Trump's assault on immigrants in Democrat-led cities continued Wednesday with confirmation from the US Coast Guard that its base in Alameda, California is preparing to host 100 federal agents—whose looming arrival is seen as ""a likely precursor"" to the Republican deploying National Guard troops to San Francisco.

The San Francisco Chronicle initially reported that agents from Customs and Border Protection (CBP)—an agency in the US Department of Homeland Security—were headed to the Bay Area, citing a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity. A spokesperson from the Coast Guard, also part of DHS, then confirmed that the base would serve as a ""place of operations.""

""This support of DHS agencies continues the Coast Guard's operations to control, secure, and defend US borders and maritime approaches,"" the spokesperson said in a statement to multiple local media outlets. ""Through a whole-of-government approach, we are leveraging our unique authorities and capabilities to detect, deter, and interdict illegal aliens, narco-terrorists, and individuals intent on terrorism or other hostile activity before they reach our border.""

As KQED pointed out Wednesday, the region has already seen increased immigration enforcement in recent months:

Since May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and CBP officials have been escalating operations throughout the Bay Area, moving to have undocumented immigrants’ asylum cases dismissed and arresting them outside of courtrooms and ICE field offices.

More than 2,000 people were arrested in San Francisco's ""Area of Responsibility"" between January and July 2025, according to Mission Local.

The reporting on the federal agents due to start arriving in the Bay Area on Thursday followed various threats from Trump to send National Guard soldiers into San Francisco, as he has with Los Angeles, California; Washington, DC; Portland, Oregon; and Chicago, Illinois. The president and Republican Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee have also collaborated to deploy National Guard troops in Memphis.

A federal judge has blocked the National Guard deployment in Illinois—where ICE's Operation Midway Blitz is ongoing—but the Trump administration has appealed to the US Supreme Court. Citing two unnamed officials, CBS News' Camilo Montoya-Galvez reported on social media Wednesday that Border Patrol's Gregory Bovino, who has led immigration raids in Chicago and Los Angeles, ""is expected to be involved in the operation"" in the Bay Area.

Elected officials across California have condemned the deployment of federal agents and Trump's threats to send National Guard troops. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom—a likely 2028 presidential candidate—declared in a Wednesday video on social media that ""this is right out of the dictator's handbook.""

Newsom accused Trump of sending in masked immigration agents to cause ""anxiety,"" so he can then justify deploying the National Guard. As the governor put it, ""This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.""

Democratic San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said Wednesday that ""our communities have already endured the painful impact of aggressive immigration enforcement. At the same time, we continue to see escalated operations across the country, with military personnel on the ground in cities like Chicago and Portland.""

""For the last 10 months, we have been taking steps to prepare for this kind of escalation here in San Francisco,"" he continued. ""Just a few minutes ago, I signed an executive directive that will build on these preparations, strengthen the city's support for our immigrant communities, and ensure our departments are coordinated ahead of any federal deployment.""

""Immigrants are the small business owners, essential workers, community leaders, and neighbors who make San Francisco a place that we are proud to call home. They fuel our economy—contributing nearly $275 billion in output and $23 billion in annual tax revenue across California,"" he added. ""San Francisco will never stand by as our neighbors are targeted, and neither will I.""

Meanwhile, in Alameda, where the base is located, the city said in a Wednesday statement that ""the Alameda Police Department (APD) is not a part of this operation, and APD does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants.""

The city also shared various resources and stressed its commitment ""to the values of dignity, inclusivity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of ethnic or national origin, gender, race, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, or immigration status.""

Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a former speaker of the House of Representatives, said Tuesday that ""San Francisco does not want or need Donald Trump's chaos. Our city takes great pride in the steps we've taken to significantly increase public safety and reduce crime—without the interference of a president just seeking headlines.""

California Attorney General Rob Bonta this week threatened to sue over any deployment of the National Guard, as did San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu—who on Monday urged the US Supreme Court ""to uphold the bedrock legal principle that domestic law enforcement is not the military's job.""

""San Francisco has seen historic drops in crime,"" Chiu said, ""and our local law enforcement are more than capable of keeping our city safe while upholding First Amendment rights.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61879173&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C171%2C0%2C171,N,,2025-10-23 14:02:46.420132

Transportation secretary joins House Republicans to discuss shutdown impact on travel

We’re hearing now from Sean Duffy, the secretary of transportation, who is repeating the Republican party line that the reason Democrats refuse to pass the continuing resolution to reopen the federal government is because they are trying to appease a “a radical base” that is “out of control”.

Duffy said that 28 October was the first day that air traffic controllers will go without a full paycheck.

“I want to reiterate we are all about safety,” Duffy said. “But again, I can’t guarantee you that your flight is going to be on time. I can’t guarantee you that your flight is not going to be canceled.”

Vance says West Bank annexation legislation is an 'insult'

Amy Sedghi

Vice-president JD Vance has said that Israel would not annex the West Bank, the day after Israeli lawmakers voted to advance two bills paving the way for the territory’s annexation.

“If it was a political stunt it was a very stupid political stunt and I personally take some insult to it,” Vance said on the tarmac as he wrapped up his visit in Israel.

“The West Bank is not going to be annexed by Israel, the policy of the Trump administration is that the West Bank will not be annexed by Israel, that will continue to be our policy,” he added.

Earlier, as secretary of state Marco Rubio travelled to the region, he warned Israel against annexation. “I think the president’s made clear that’s not something we can be supportive of right now,” Rubio said as he boarded his plane. Annexation moves are “threatening for the peace deal”, he told reporters.

Donald Trump has repeated his insistence that Chicago needs federal law enforcement on its streets. In a post on Truth Social he wrote:

14 people were shot over the weekend in Chicago, four DEAD! What does failed Governor Pritzker, and the equally pathetic Mayor, say now? BRING IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, AND BRING THEM IN NOW!!!

This comes after the Trump administration filed an emergency appeal to the supreme court, after an appeals court upheld a federal district judge’s decision to block the deployment of the national guard to Chicago.

Just a note that the latest failed vote on a funding bill to reopen the federal government took place after Jeff Merkley, the Democratic senator of Oregon, wrapped up a marathon speech on the Senate floor that lasted almost 23 hours.

Aided by placards behind him, declaring “Trump is violating the law”, the 68-year-old lawmaker issued a far-ranging critique of the administration’s policies.

“The fight isn’t over-we need to keep standing together to resist Trump’s attempts to tighten his authoritarian grip,” Merkley said, after wrapping his floor speech, that came in a couple of hours shy of breaking the record set by his Democratic colleague, Cory Booker, who spoke continuously for more than 25 hours back in April.

Shutdown enters day 23 as Senate Republicans push bill to fund troops

The government shutdown entered its 23rd day, with little end in sight. On Wednesday the Senate failed, for the 12th time, to pass a House-passed stopgap funding bill.

Today, the upper chamber will also vote on legislation to continue paying federal workers who haven’t stopped working during the shutdown, as well as members of the military. The Shutdown Fairness Act is co-sponsored by Republican senator Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin.

The snag? It also needs 60 votes to advance, and Democrats look poised to hold out.

More than half of Americans, including about three in 10 Republicans, believe president Donald Trump is using federal law enforcement to go after his enemies, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll that also found growing concern about US political divisions nine months into his second term in office.

Some 55% of poll respondents in the six-day poll, which closed on Monday, agreed with a statement that the Republican president is using law enforcement to target his enemies, while 26% disagreed and the rest were unsure or did not respond.

Some 85% of the poll respondents who identified themselves as Democrats agreed, as did 29% of the Republican poll takers.

Trump’s justice department in the past month has brought criminal charges against three prominent adversaries of the president, including former FBI director James Comey, New York state attorney general Letitia James and former national security adviser John Bolton. All three have denied wrongdoing.

The US justice department has historically kept an arm’s length distance from the president, seeking to protect prosecutorial independence. Trump campaigned ahead of the 2024 presidential election with pledges for retribution against his enemies.

He had particular disdain for Comey and James, who had led criminal probes against him that he contends were politically motivated. Trump has denied ordering the justice department to indict his foes, though last month he appeared to push federal prosecutors to charge Comey and James.

New York City’s three mayoral contenders had a fiery debate on Wednesday night in their final televised face-off less than two weeks before voters decide the city’s next leader on 4 November.

Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani, independent Andrew Cuomo and Republican Curtis Sliwa participated in a tense and often chaotic discussion. The current mayor, Eric Adams, who dropped out of the race weeks earlier, once again did not attend.

“It’s us versus them,” Sliwa declared in his opening remarks, grouping Cuomo and Mamdani together despite their mutual disapproval of one another.

Mamdani opened by accusing both rivals of focusing more on urging each other to drop out than on offering new ideas. The former governor’s allies have urged Sliwa to withdraw to consolidate anti-Mamdani votes, though it is unclear how many conservatives would back Cuomo.

Cuomo claimed Mamdani “has no new ideas” and merely rehashed ideas from former mayor Bill de Blasio, prompting Mamdani to fire back: “I have plans for our future, my opponents only have fear.”

Beginning with the topic of ICE raids in New York, Cuomo said federal immigration agents should not focus on quality-of-life offenses like street vending, calling those a police matter. He added he would have personally called Donald Trump to rein in ICE.

Sliwa countered that, unlike Cuomo and Mamdani, he would “negotiate with Donald Trump and try to get the best deal possible”. Mamdani hit back, calling Cuomo “Donald Trump’s puppet”.

The two then sparred over which candidate Trump preferred. Cuomo claimed Trump wanted Mamdani elected so he could “come in and take over the city”, calling the progressive “Trump’s dream”.

The debate later turned to the city’s record 150,000 homeless students. Mamdani spoke about plans to double a program pairing shelter families with city workers for regular check-ins. Cuomo said the “homeless rate has more than doubled” since he left office, without clarifying his figures.

Pregnant women have reported bleeding, miscarriages, being shackled and other instances of medical neglect while in US immigration custody, according to a group of prominent civil rights organizations.

The groups – which include the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and its Louisiana chapter, the National Immigration Project, Robert F Kennedy Human Rights, Sanctuary of the South and Sanctuary Now Abolition Project – sent a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Senate committees on Wednesday, describing interviews with more than a dozen women.

“ICE has issued detainers, arrested, and taken pregnant individuals into custody, even after they have informed officers of their pregnancy, in violation of agency guidance,” the letter said.

It noted in particular that ICE had “detained several cases of pregnant individuals arising from domestic disputes. This practice endangers survivors of domestic violence, particularly pregnant individuals, who are more vulnerable to abuse and violence.”

Some of the pregnant women reported being shackled and held in other restraints during transport; detention in solitary confinement; delayed and substandard prenatal care; denial of prenatal vitamins; inadequate food; lack of interpretation and translation in medical encounters; medical care without informed consent; and medical neglect leading to dangerous infection after miscarriage, the letter said.

The letter specifically detailed the experience of six women held in two detention centers in Basile, Louisiana, and Lumpkin, Georgia.

The New York state attorney general, Letitia James, rolled out a “Federal Action Reporting Portal” form urging New York residents to share photos and videos of federal immigration enforcement action across the state, just a day after a high-profile ICE raid rattled Manhattan’s Chinatown and prompted hundreds to come out in protest.

A US congressman revealed in a Wednesday press conference that four US citizens were arrested and held for “nearly 24 hours” after Tuesday’s raid. Protests broke out in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.

“Every New Yorker has the right to live without fear or intimidation,” James wrote in a statement announcing the portal.

“If you witnessed and documented ICE activity yesterday, I urge you to share that footage with my office. We are committed to reviewing these reports and assessing any violations of law.”

The form offers spaces to submit images and video footage of the raid, as well as a place to indicate location information. Before submitting, users must check a box that indicates that “the attorney general may use any documents, photographs, or videos I provided in a public document, including in a legal proceeding or public report or statement”.

The Guardian has contacted James’s office for more information.

White House East Wing will be torn down ‘within days’ even as no plans filed for Trump’s new ballroom

Lauren Aratani

Trump administration officials confirmed to various outlets on Wednesday that the White House’s East Wing will be demolished “within days”, a revelation given the administration has not submitted plans for the new ballroom to the federal agency that oversees construction of federal buildings.

In discussion with reporters in the Oval Office, Donald Trump was asked by Jeff Mason of Reuters to respond to the widespread surprise that the entire East Wing is being torn down. Trump said the wing he described as a separate building “was never thought of as being much; it was a very small building”.

“Rather than allowing that to hurt a very expensive, beautiful building,” he continued. “In order to do it properly, we had to take down the existing structure.”

Then, pointing at a model of the new ballroom on a table in front of him, and a new structure leading to the ballroom in the location where the East Wing used to be, Trump added: “The way it was shown, it looked like we were touching the White House. We don’t touch the White House.”

“That’s a bridge, a glass bridge going from the White House to the ballroom,” Trump said, of the new structure that will replace the East Wing.

Trump said the result is “going to be probably the finest ballroom ever built” and that the ballroom is “being paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine”.

The New York Times, citing a senior administration official, reported that the ballroom plans will mean the demolition of the entire East Wing. The official also said the demolition should be finished by this weekend.

Two Trump officials told NBC News similar information, saying the entire East Wing of the White House will be demolished “within days”.

The US has sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil, Russia’s two largest oil companies, as the Trump administration increased pressure on the Kremlin to negotiate an end to its war against Ukraine.

The sanctions were the first against Russia since Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, and were targeted to cut key revenues from oil sales that finance the Russian war machine.

The move against Russia marks the latest swing of the pendulum under the Trump administration from coercing Kyiv to sue for peace to growing frustration with Vladimir Putin’s maximalist demands.

“Now is the time to stop the killing and for an immediate ceasefire,” said the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, in a statement announcing the sanctions against Russia. “Given President Putin’s refusal to end this senseless war, Treasury is sanctioning Russia’s two largest oil companies that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Treasury is prepared to take further action if necessary to support President Trump’s effort to end yet another war. We encourage our allies to join us in and adhere to these sanctions.”

The British government sanctioned Rosneft and Lukoil last week. The EU has sanctioned Rosneft, the Russian state-owned oil company, but not Lukoil, which is privately owned, largely due to exemptions for Hungary and Slovakia, which buy Russian oil.

Trump, speaking in the Oval Office with the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, on Wednesday, also confirmed he had cancelled a planned summit with Putin in another sign of a breakdown in negotiations between Washington and Moscow.

“We cancelled the meeting with President Putin,” Trump said. “It didn’t feel right to me. It didn’t feel like we were going to get to the place we have to get so I cancelled it. But we’ll do it in the future.”

The US military has for the first time attacked and destroyed two boats on the Pacific side of South America, as part of its controversial fight against what it says are drug-trafficking activities.

The strikes – on Tuesday night and then early on Wednesday – killed five people, according to the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth. They came on top of at least seven other strikes in the Caribbean that have killed at least 32 people and raised tensions with Colombia and Venezuela.

Hegseth released a brief video of the Tuesday night strike, showing a small boat, half-filled with brown packages, moving along at sea. Several seconds into the video, the boat explodes and is seen floating motionless in flames.

In a post on social media, Hegseth took the unusual step of equating the alleged drug traffickers to the terror group that conducted the attacks on the US on September 11, 2001.

“Just as al-Qaida waged war on our homeland, these cartels are waging war on our border and our people,” Hegseth said, adding that “there will be no refuge or forgiveness – only justice”.

The Colombian president, Gustavo Petro, who is in the midst of a spat with Donald Trump over the boat strikes and tariffs, said: “The attack on another boat in the Pacific … killed people. It is murder. Whether in the Caribbean or Pacific, the US government strategy breaks the norms of international law.”

Venezuela is a major drug transit zone, but the eastern Pacific Ocean, not the Caribbean, is the primary area for smuggling cocaine.

The University of Virginia (UVA) has become the latest institution to agree to the Trump administration’s demands concerning discrimination in admissions and hiring following significant pressure from the justice department.

The deal, which the department announced on Wednesday, comes after the president of the esteemed public university resigned in June to resolve a justice department investigation into UVA’s diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

If the president, Jim Ryan, had stayed in the job, he was told “hundreds of employees would lose jobs, researchers would lose funding, and hundreds of students could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld”, according to Mark Warner, a Democratic senator from Virginia.

The deal means the justice department will end its investigation into the school, while the school agreed “not engage in unlawful racial discrimination in its university programming, admissions, hiring or other activities. UVA will provide relevant information and data to the Department of Justice on a quarterly basis through 2028,” the announcement states.

The University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and Brown had already reached agreements with the Trump administration to have federal funding, which had been cut, restored in exchange for settlements concerning claims of alleged antisemitism. They also agreed to demands such as adopting the administration’s definitions of male and female.

Trump poised to send scores of federal agents to San Francisco

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I am Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news lines over the next few hours.

We start with the news that the Trump administration appears poised to send dozens of federal agents to the San Francisco Bay Area for a major immigration enforcement operation, prompting condemnation from California leaders.

Details of the deployment were still emerging, but it will reportedly involve more than 100 federal agents, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The agents are reportedly set to begin using the US Coast Guard base in Alameda, a city located across the bay from San Francisco. It remained unclear whether national guard troops would also be involved.

The deployment follows weeks of threats by Donald Trump to target the Democratic-run city. California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, criticised the move, calling it “right out of the dictator’s handbook”.

“He sends out masked men, he sends out border patrol, he sends out ICE, he creates anxiety and fear in the community so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the [national] guard,” Newsom said in a video statement. “This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.”

Mia Bonta, the state assembly member who represents Alameda, denounced the arrival of federal agents in her district as “authoritarian theatrics”. “This is against our values as Alamedans to have our city used as a staging ground to inflict fear, terror and state-sponsored violence across the Bay,” she said.

San Francisco is the latest major city targeted by Trump’s campaign of mass immigration arrests. The deployment is expected to trigger a showdown between the administration and local leaders, who have pledged to block militarized immigration enforcement in the city.

San Franciscans have been readying for months for Trump to make good on repeated threats to send troops to the city. At a Wednesday afternoon press conference, San Francisco’s mayor, Daniel Lurie, reiterated that the city was prepared.

“For months, we have been anticipating the possibility of some kind of federal deployment in our city,” said Lurie, adding that he had taken further executive actions on Wednesday to “strengthen the city’s support for our immigrant communities, and ensure our departments are coordinated ahead of any federal deployment”.

Donald Trump said Vladimir Putin was not being “honest and forthright” in Ukraine talks, the US treasury chief has said. The sanctions against Rosneft and Lukoil came a day after a planned Trump-Putin summit in Budapest was shelved, with Washington expressing its disappointment at the lack of progress in ceasefire negotiations with Moscow.

Trump administration officials confirmed to various outlets on Wednesday that the White House’s East Wing will be demolished “within days”, a revelation given that the administration has not submitted plans for the new ballroom to the federal agency that oversees construction of federal buildings.

The president declared himself the arbiter of whether or not his own administration should pay him damages over past federal investigations, telling reporters that any such decision “would have to go across my desk”. Trump insisted on Tuesday that the government owed him “a lot of money” for previous justice department investigations into his conduct, while at the same time asserting his personal authority over any potential payout.

A small boat half-filled with brown packages is seen moving along at sea and then explodes and floats motionless in flames, in a brief video released by the US defence secretary, Pete Hegseth. The operation happened off coast of Colombia, marking the first such strike in the Pacific. Seven previous attacks in Caribbean killed at least 32 people.

The University of Virginia (UVA) has become the latest school to agree to the Trump administration’s demands concerning discrimination in admissions and hiring after significant pressure from the justice department.

Graham Platner, a Democratic candidate for the US Senate in Maine, said on Wednesday that a tattoo on his chest has been covered to no longer reflect an image widely recognised as a Nazi symbol.

Oregon Democrat Jeff Merkley spoke for nearly 23 hours on the Senate floor to press the case that Trump is acting as an authoritarian by prosecuting political enemies and deploying the military into Merkley’s home town of Portland.

The congressional Department of Homeland Security oversight committees should hold public hearings to examine agents’ excessive use of force. They should consider legislative remedies to strengthen oversight and accountability of immigration enforcement operations.

(Chicago, October 23, 2025) – Federal law enforcement agents have since mid-September 2025 used excessive force against peaceful protesters, legal observers, volunteer street medics, and journalists during demonstrations outside a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in suburban Chicago, Human Rights Watch said today. Protests at the Broadview, Illinois facility escalated following the start of ICE’s “Operation Midway Blitz” on September 8 and an increase in immigration raids and seizures throughout the Chicago area.

Based on accounts by witnesses and videos that Human Rights Watch analyzed, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agents—sometimes in the presence of state and local police, and other federal agents—repeatedly used excessive force against small groups of protesters who appeared to pose no threat to the agents or to public security, and against clearly identifiable journalists, legal observers, and volunteer street medics. They detained dozens of protesters, and at least one journalist and one volunteer street medic. The violent response comes on the heels of law enforcement’s use of excessive force against protesters opposing immigration raids in June in Los Angeles.

“This is not crowd control, but a campaign of intimidation,” said Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch. “Federal agents are using chemical irritants and firing projectiles at peaceful protesters, volunteer street medics, and journalists in broad daylight. The message is clear that dissent will be punished.”

Human Rights Watch interviewed 18 people who were present during the Broadview protests: 7 protesters, 4 journalists, 1 volunteer street medic, 2 immigration rights advocates, and a religious leader. Researchers also analyzed 17 videos recorded during the protests that were posted to social media or provided to researchers. On October 17, Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem summarizing these findings, posing questions, and offering the opportunity to comment, but has not received a response.

Witnesses and video confirm that DHS agents used tear gas and fired projectiles directly into groups of protesters, including from the detention facility roof, often without warning, and without protesters appearing to pose any risk to agents. Witnesses and verified footage show there were sometimes as few as 10 protesters and never more than 250.

Raven Geary, a journalist who attended over two dozen protests at the detention facility and was shot in the face with a pepper spray projectile on September 26, said she has been to many protests over the years but that, “I have never seen anything like this response in my life. There is no rhyme or reason to the violence agents are resorting to.”

Two volunteer street medics described attending to dozens of people, most of whom needed treatment for exposure to chemical irritants, and some for projectile impact injuries.

Ashley Vaughan, a protester who uses a cane, said that on September 12, agents shot them with pepper balls, causing them to momentarily “black out.” On September 19, agents shot Reverend David Black in the head with a pepper ball while he was peacefully praying near the facility, in an incident captured on video. According to the National Lawyers Guild of Chicago, at least 10 legal observers have been injured.

The lawyers guild said that from September 19 to October 14, federal agents and state and local officers detained at least 78 people at the protests. Two people interviewed, and the colleague of a third, said they were held for 6 to 12 hours and denied access to their attorneys despite numerous requests.

DHS issued a statement on September 19 saying, “rioters assaulted law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.” It also posted photographs on X of what it said were two “pyrotechnic smoke bombs,” two guns, and two pen knives that it had confiscated from protesters. Human Rights Watch could not independently confirm these claims. All those interviewed said they never saw protesters attack law enforcement in any way, or attempt to damage property, consistent with the content Human Rights Watch reviewed.

A coalition of media organizations and individual plaintiffs, including journalists and protesters, filed a class action lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against President Donald Trump and senior officials from DHS, ICE, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Justice, and other federal agencies, citing the use of excessive force, suppression of free speech and religious expression, and unlawful arrests. In response, on October 9, a US district court issued a temporary restraining order, placing limits on protest policing tactics by federal law enforcement deployed throughout northern Illinois. Photographs apparently show federal agents on October 14 deploying chemical irritants against protesters on the south side of Chicago in an incident that could potentially violate the restraining order.

During the protests, federal agents have repeatedly used excessive and unnecessary force, and in many cases have simply attacked protestors and others without provocation. These findings also implicate civil rights protections under the US Constitution, as well as DHS policies, which include restrictions on when and how law enforcement agents may use force to disperse protests.

The congressional DHS oversight committees should hold public hearings to examine agents’ excessive use of force in the Chicago area, Human Rights Watch said. They should subpoena internal ICE records related to enforcement planning, as well as arrest and use-of-force protocols. Committees should engage independent civil and human rights organizations to provide testimony and evidence and consider legislative remedies to strengthen oversight and accountability of immigration enforcement operations.

“The federal government is not just violating the human rights of protestors here,” Wille said. “These violent abuses are part of a broader assault on US democratic norms and institutions.”

For more details on the Broadview protests and applicable legal standards, please see below.

Operation Midway Blitz

Operation Midway Blitz resulted in the arrest of over 1,000 immigrants in the Chicago area from September 8 to October 3, 2025, according to DHS. DHS agents took many of them to the Broadview detention facility, where demonstrations have taken place since August.

In one fatal incident, an ICE officer shot at a Mexican migrant near Chicago on September 12. On September 30, federal agents raided a South Shore apartment complex using aggressive and violent tactics, detaining 37 people—many without warrants—including US citizens. On October 4, federal agents shot and injured a woman in Brighton Park during an immigration operation, claiming her vehicle hit a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicle.

Excessive Use of Force

After the federal government initiated Operation Midway Blitz on September 8, protesters who had already been gathering outside the detention facility began to appear in larger groups and more often. On September 23, ICE put up a reinforced perimeter fence around the detention facility, pushing the protesters away and onto side streets, witnesses said.

A volunteer street medic present outside the detention facility every Friday since August 8 said that agents’ actions against anyone standing outside the detention facility began to escalate over the course of September: “Initially you could be on the sidewalk, but if you took a step onto the driveway, agents would yell at you. Then as the days passed, it became that anyone stepping on the driveway would get shot with pepper balls. Then, anyone just on the street was getting hit by pepper balls. Then, they put up the fence, and now it’s anyone who gets near the fence gets hit with pepper balls.”

The medic also said that, early on, agents sometimes issued “get back” warnings on an intercom system and on occasion warned they were about to fire tear gas, but that they had completely stopped doing so by mid-September.

Reverend David Black, who began attending the protests on August 29, said agents escalated their use of force over September and that while the number of protesters increased, they remained peaceful.

Photographs and videos analyzed show DHS agents repeatedly deployed a range of what is called “less lethal force” against protesters, including tear gas, pepper balls, and foam projectile rounds, a type of kinetic impact projectile designed to some degree incapacitate or deter a target through blunt force trauma rather than penetration.

All witnesses said that agents used less-lethal force without warning and against people who posed no threat to them. Those interviewed also said they did not see protesters using force against agents. They said they saw some protesters trying to block ICE vehicles by standing in front of them.Two witnesses said that on some occasions, protesters kicked tear gas cannisters away from them, apparently to protect themselves. One video uploaded to X on September 27 shows at least two tear gas canisters being thrown back in the direction of agents. A journalist said that some protesters threw soft toys at agents. Some protesters wore gas masks and held plastic shields to protect themselves.

Law Enforcement Agencies at the Broadview Protests

According to those interviewed and the media content reviewed, almost all DHS agents at the protests had their faces covered, obscuring their identities, and many were not wearing badges or uniforms that otherwise clearly identified their positions within their agencies, undermining accountability as well as basic protections from arbitrary detention or abuse.

Based on witness accounts and analyzed footage, Human Rights Watch identified the following agencies and units from the DHS at the protests in various configurations at different times: ICE, including Enforcement and Removal Operations and Homeland Security Investigations; CBP, including the Border Patrol Tactical Unit; and the Federal Protective Service.

Agents were also often present from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as were local and state law enforcement officials.

Senior leaders of agencies have appeared at the protest site, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the US Border Patrol’s commander-at-large Gregory K. Bovino. On October 3, Noem told a group of agents from various federal agencies: “We are going to go hard. We are going to hammer these guys … we are going to prosecute them … we are not taking this anymore … We are going to give you guys all the authority that you need to go out there and arrest these individuals who are advocating for violence against you.”

After that, Bovino, a Border Patrol chief from California appointed to lead operations in Chicago, said: “That crowd there is an unsafe crowd ... we are going to roll them all the way out of here. And when they resist, what happens? They get arrested. So, it’s now going to be a free arrest zone.” Noem then added that the agents’ role was to “make sure that these individuals aren’t allowed to conduct this activity anymore.”

Three witnesses said state troopers, Broadview local police, and members of the Cook County Sheriff’s Office and Northern Illinois Police Alarm System were there. At times, they helped push protesters away from the area around the detention facility and made arrests, witnesses said. According to the lawyers guild, during protests on the weekend of October 10, state troopers clubbed protesters with long wooden batons, throwing people to the ground and in one instance, dragging a woman across a concrete barrier and through the street. One video uploaded to YouTube on October 5 shows state troopers pushing and arresting protesters near the detention facility.

Firing Kinetic Impact Projectiles and Tear Gas Directly at Protesters

In the cases Human Rights Watch documented outside the detention facility, agents appeared most often to have used chemical irritants, including CS (a type of tear gas), CN (mace), and OC (pepper spray), as well as foam projectile rounds. The chemical irritants were dispersed by grenades, sprayed from large cylinders, and contained in pepper balls, which are small, circular projectiles filled with a chemical irritant fired from a compressed air launcher resembling a paintball gun. Under international human rights standards, the use of less-lethal force and riot control agents such as tear gas is appropriate only when nonviolent means are not effective and even then, should be used with restraint and according to criteria of proportionality.

Ashley Vaughan, who carries a cane, said that, at around 6 p.m. on September 12, agents standing on the detention facility’s roof shot them in the face and body with pepper balls while they were livestreaming. Vaughan said they briefly lost consciousness. When they came to, they saw approximately 15 to 20 agents leaving the detention facility and attempting to push protesters back.

“I was trying to get up,” they said. “[The agents] were probably about a foot in front of me as they were shooting at me.” Vaughan said a few protesters tried to help them up and that agents shot at all of them at least 10 more times. “I couldn’t see for a few days due to the swelling. I had two black eyes. I’m lucky I didn’t lose my vision,” Vaughan said. Vaughan’s wounds took several weeks to heal.

A video verified by researchers shows Vaughan on the ground outside the detention facility. One agent points his pepper ball launcher toward Vaughan and fires. At least six pepper ball impact points can be seen on the sidewalk. Agents continue to fire pepper balls at Vaughan and other protesters as Vaughan gets up and is helped away.

At around 6 p.m. on September 19, Reverend Black, of the First Presbyterian Church of Chicago, said he was praying with his hands outstretched with a small group of protesters outside the detention facility. Agents positioned on the roof started firing pepper balls at the group. “They seemed to be targeting my head, because the first couple of rounds hit my head and face ... I was praying; there was no justification for them to open fire on us.”

Human Rights Watch verified two videos uploaded to Facebook and Instagram on the same day that show Reverend Black standing with his hands outstretched, with three agents positioned directly above him on the roof of the detention facility. All three appear to shoot several projectiles in the direction of Black, with at least two hitting him, one in the torso and a second in the head.

As protesters rinsed his eyes with water, 15 to 20 agents left the detention facility and began pushing protesters into a street opposite the detention facility. Then, Black said, agents indiscriminately sprayed the protesters with mace, “soaking” him in the chemical agent. A video Human Rights Watch verified shows agents pushing Black and other protesters away from the detention facility and one of the agents spraying Black in the face with a chemical irritant from less than a meter away. Black had to leave the protests for around an hour to be treated but was not seriously injured.

Also on September 19, a protester who asked not to be named said he saw agents firing from the roof of the detention facility, and that multiple projectiles hit him in the head and left hip.

A volunteer street medic said that on September 26, he mostly helped people flush out their eyes that day, he remembered his colleague treating someone with a forehead laceration caused by a pepper ball fired at close range. The medic also treated someone who had a severe nosebleed after being hit in the face and the back of the head. Another volunteer street medic said he saw an officer yell, “Hey, bitch,” at a protester before shooting at her with pepper balls.

Stuart Hall, 66, a protester and army veteran, said that on September 26 at around 8 a.m., he was standing near the detention facility when agents fired on him: “I hadn’t been advancing [towards the facility], but the pepper balls hit me—two in the legs, two in the torso, and one in my arm.”

Also on September 26, a volunteer street medic said an agent on the roof started firing foam projectile rounds, but that the medic himself “could not see any provoking action from the crowd.” He said the agent also fired at someone playing guitar, and that the round went through the wooden body of the guitar. Another protester described the same incident.

Another volunteer street medic said that on September 26, agents fired on protesters who were reading letters of solidarity pinned to the detention facility’s fence: “I treated one older woman who had just walked up to the fence to read a note and got shot with pepper balls.”

Human Rights Watch analyzed a video posted to Instagram on September 26 of a protester covered in wounds consistent with being shot at close range with kinetic impact projectiles such as pepper balls.

Witnesses said that agents frequently deployed tear gas directly at protesters, rather than above their heads or in front of a crowd. One video posted to X the evening of September 27 that Human Rights Watch analyzed shows agents deploying tear gas canisters directly at protesters. Firing tear gas canisters directly at individuals, particularly if aimed at the head, rather than above their heads or in front of crowds, can prove fatal.

Hitting and Other Physical Violence

Agents also resorted to using physical violence with their hands against protesters for no justifiable reason, protesters and other witnesses said.

On September 19, a volunteer street medic said he saw an officer grab and hold someone in a headlock unprovoked.

On September 26, a protester said he was trying to ask agents a question, when they started kicking and kneeing him in the face and back. At one point, he said, agents had him pinned to the ground, with someone shoving his left cheek and jaw into the ground with their knee, while he felt pressure to his back and spine. A friend who had been standing next to him was violently tackled to the ground by multiple agents, he said. The protestor shared a video of the incident with Human Rights Watch.

A protester said that on the morning of October 3, DHS agents came out of the detention facility to disperse the crowds:

The agents seemed aggravated that people were not moving. An officer wearing a black gaiter mask and baseball cap ripped off my gas mask and upper cut my lip and nose with his palm. Soon after that, agents went from pushing to grabbing bodies. I counted four agents who grabbed onto my breasts. The same officer who tore off my gas mask grabbed and pushed my left breast so hard, it left a bruise where his thumb was under my breast.

Violence Against Journalists, Observers, Medics

Raven Geary, a journalist, said she saw agents fire in the direction of journalists on at least 12 occasions from the beginning of September to early October. She said journalists were wearing lanyards around their necks with their media affiliations, and many had “Press” markings on their bags and helmets.

She said agents firing at people followed journalists as they were dispersing and ducking for cover. In one case, she said, agents sneaked up on two journalists hiding behind a vehicle and fired a pepper spray projectile directly at one, causing a bloody nose.

On the morning of September 26, Geary said she and about six other journalists hid behind a vehicle when agents opened fire on a group of protesters without warning. Agents pursued the journalists from the gate of the detention facility, firing at them. Geary raised her head to look above the hood of the vehicle and an officer wearing a skull motif face mask fired a pepper spray projectile directly at the camera Geary was holding up to her face. “I felt a tremendous pain on the side of my face,” she said. She was left with bruising and a swollen face for days. Geary said she saw patches on the officer’s uniform including one indicating he worked at an ICE field office in Pheonix and one indicating an Arizona border county.

Also on September 26, Paul Goyette, a journalist who been covering the protests since August 29, said multiple agents shot pepper balls directly at his chest. Goyette said agents fired a projectile at his friend that day and his friend had to go to the hospital with a concussion. Goyette said his friend, a former marine, identified the projectile that hit him as a baton round (a type of kinetic impact projectile).

The class action lawsuit says that Charles Thrush, a journalism student and reporter for Block Club Chicago, was reporting on the protests on September 26 when agents shot him in the left hand with pepper balls with no dispersal warnings. Thrush was wearing clearly identifiable press credentials around his neck, standing apart from protesters, and videotaping federal agents as they fired pepper balls at two protesters attempting to shelter behind a collapsible umbrella. Thrush said in a sworn declaration, that on several occasions that day, agents deployed tear gas at him at close range though his press pass was visible. Thrush continued to experience chemical burning from the pepper balls and tear gas for 12 hours.

An agent targeted and shot a CBS reporter, Asal Rezaei, with pepper balls as she drove past the detention facility on September 28, when there was no protest. “A masked ICE agent pointed his weapon and shot directly at my car. He saw that my window was open,” Rezaei said in a CBS News report. “I was sitting right there with my window open. A lot of it went inside my car and on my face. I immediately felt it burning, and I started throwing up.” CBS news reported that the Broadview Police department is investigating the incident.

Human Rights Watch also analyzed a video posted to Instagram at 8:40 p.m. on September 27, according to the timestamp. The video shows agents firing tear gas at journalists standing on the opposite side of an intersection near the detention facility. Many start coughing. No evidence of a warning can be seen or heard in the video.

The U.S. Press Freedom Tracker cited other incidents of agents shooting at journalists with pepper balls and tear gas cannisters outside the detention facility.

Adriano Kalin, a photojournalist, said that on the morning of September 26, he saw agents open fire on a group of legal observers who were sitting on the ground with their backs to the detention facility, while wearing identifiable green hats. According to a lawyers guild spokesperson, on September 19, an agent shot a legal observer with a pepper ball in the neck and on September 27, an agent shot a legal observer directly in the face. The lawyers guild said that during protests on the weekend of October 10, state troopers clubbed multiple legal observers.

One of the volunteer street medics said that agents regularly impeded him and his colleagues from treating injured protesters by shooting pepper balls at them, ordering them to move, or pushing them while they treated victims. He said an agent fired directly at him, “while I was on my knees trying to help this guy who was hit.”

Both volunteer street medics said on September 27, at around 8:30 p.m., agents fired chemical irritants into and then dismantled two medical tents that the medics were using to triage and treat injured protesters.

Vaughan said that agents in front of the detention facility fired projectiles at volunteer street medics, preventing the medics from evacuating Vaughan after they were injured by pepper balls on September 19. Instead, Broadview police agents later evacuated Vaughan to an ambulance, which then took them to the hospital along with other injured protesters.

Arrests

Of those arrested between September 19 and October 14, at least 20 individuals were released without charge, while about 58 were charged with offenses under federal, state, or local law, according to the lawyers guild.

One protester said that on September 26, agents assaulted and then detained him while he was trying to speak to them. DHS agents detained him for over 12 hours inside the detention facility, repeatedly interrogated him about the contents of his bag, and why he had attended the protest, and denied him medical treatment though he was in pain from being kicked, kneed, and slammed to the ground when detained. He was also denied access to his lawyer, despite his lawyer’s efforts to gain access. He was eventually released without charge.

A journalist, Steve Held, was detained and held for over six hours before being released without charge, during which time his attorney was denied access to him, Geary said.

Applicable Legal Standards

International Law

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which the United States is a party, protects the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. US obligations under the covenant extend to authorities at every level of government: federal, state, and local. The Unites States is thus obliged to ensure that all law enforcement personnel respect human rights.

The ICCPR allows only for limited restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly that are “necessary in a democratic society” to protect a narrow range of important interests including public order, public safety, and the rights of others. Restrictions on the right should be carefully tailored. More specifically, they should both be necessary for and proportionate to a permissible ground for restriction. Restrictions justified on grounds of public safety require the authorities to demonstrate “a real and significant risk to the safety of persons (to life and security of person) or a similar risk of serious damage to property.”

Under international human rights standards, law enforcement should only use force if other means to address a genuine threat have proved ineffective or have no likelihood of achieving the intended result. When using force, law enforcement should provide clear warnings, exercise restraint, and act proportionately, taking into account both the seriousness of the offense and the legitimate objective to be achieved.

Federal Law

The First Amendment of the US Constitution guarantees the right to free speech and peaceful assembly. These rights are a core pillar of the country’s system of governance. US courts have evolved a deep jurisprudence governing permissible regulation of, and limitations on, the exercise of these rights. The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable search and seizures by law enforcement, including the use of excessive force during an arrest or other seizure.

DHS Use of Force Policies

Events at the detention facility demonstrate that DHS agencies have not followed their own written policies, which are substantially aligned with international human rights standards on the use of force by law enforcement.

DHS written policy allows law enforcement agents to use force only when no reasonably effective, safe, and feasible alternative exists, and only the level of force that is objectively reasonable under the circumstances. An updated 2023 DHS policy prohibits the use of deadly force against individuals who pose a threat only to themselves or property, and bans chokeholds unless deadly force is otherwise authorized.

Within DHS, ICE has written standards that authorize force only after all reasonable efforts to resolve a situation have failed. ICE agents must use only the amount of force necessary to gain control of a detainee, protect safety, prevent serious property damage, or maintain facility order. Force must never be used as punishment, and restraints must not be applied to the neck or in ways that restrict breathing or cause pain. While ICE does not have a protest-specific policy document, its enforcement actions during protests are subject to DHS oversight.

The appellate court on Wednesday granted the request.
While the facility was built and operated by the state of Florida and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing the state for $608 million.

An opening appellate brief from the federal government had been due on Friday.","A federal lawsuit that temporarily had interrupted operations at an immigration detention in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” was paused Wednesday by an appellate court because of the government shutdown.

Earlier this month, U.S. government attorneys had asked the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to stay proceedings in the case because funding for the Justice Department, as well as the Department of Homeland Security which is a defendant, had expired because of the government shutdown.

They requested the pause until appropriations were restored by Congress.

The appellate court on Wednesday granted the request. While the facility was built and operated by the state of Florida and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing the state for $608 million.

Attorneys for the environmental groups that had sued the federal and state governments over environmental concerns about the facility said that the administration of President Donald Trump had been litigating hundreds of cases around the country during the shutdown.

“Apparently, the government has sufficient money and manpower to operate a detention center in the heart of the Everglades to detain foreign born workers, but not enough to file a brief in court to justify its conduct, which the trial court held unlawful,” said Paul Schwiep, one of the attorneys.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Miccosukee Tribe, sued federal and state agencies this summer, alleging they didn’t follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams agreed and ordered in August that the facility needed to wind down operations within two months. However, that injunction was put on hold in early September when the appellate court panel in Atlanta issued a stay, pending the outcome of an appeal, allowing the facility to stay open for the time being.

ICE arrests 105 people in southwest Idaho raid, U.S. Department of Homeland Security says

The comments come a day after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin credited ICE for the operation, where she said ICE arrested 105 people for immigration violations. The FBI previously announced five arrests of people linked to the alleged illegal horserace gambling operation in Wilder at La Catedral Arena.

“Over the weekend, ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation,” she said.

Idaho law enforcement, DHS at odds over which agency led operation

In a joint statement released Wednesday, Canyon County Sheriff Kieran Donahue and Caldwell Police Chief Rex Ingram said DHS’s claim that ICE led the law enforcement action “was completely false and a serious misrepresentation of the facts. It was also deeply misleading to the public.”

“The operation was led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Metro Violent Crime and Gang Task Force with support from multiple federal, state, and local partners,” Donahue and Ingram said in a written statement. “The Canyon County Sheriff’s Office and Caldwell Police Department, who are both longstanding members of the Metro task force, were on scene assisting with the criminal investigation. ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) were present for the identification and processing of individuals illegally present in the United States.”

Asked about the statement by the Canyon County sheriff and the Caldwell police chief, DHS spokesperson McLaughlin told the Idaho Capital Sun: “Our statement is correct so he must have misspoken.”

The local officials said they “generally limit our comments when it comes to active federal investigations.” But they said they felt it was “important to address the confusion caused by” DHS’s recent statement.

ICE, FBI deny zip tying children. ACLU of Idaho says answers still needed.

Advocates who were at the scene of the raid have denounced aggressive tactics they say they saw used, including law enforcement detaining everyone at the venue, children being zip-tied, and people being struck with rubber bullets.

The FBI and ICE have denied children were zip-tied.

McLaughlin told the Sun that “ICE didn’t zip tie, restrain or arrest any children.” FBI spokesperson Sandra Yi Barker said in a statement Wednesday that “Reports suggesting children were zip-tied or hit with rubber bullets during the October 19 FBI-led operation in Wilder are completely false.”

ACLU of Idaho spokesperson Rebecca De León told the Sun that answers are still needed.

“We are frustrated with the lack of transparency and obfuscation by the agencies involved. All agencies had been preparing this despicable event for a long time, so they should be able to answer questions and be accountable to taxpayers now. And we are demanding answers now,” she said in a statement. “Who was in charge of this effort? Who authorized such an egregious use of force for gambling? How many agencies were involved and what weapons were at their disposal? Who authorized zip tying children?

The organization sent a letter to ICE officials Wednesday demanding that such detainees be released and that the agency conduct a review to ensure they are abiding by federal regulations. The ACLU said it has met with more than a dozen women over the past five months, including those who were pregnant or recently experienced a miscarriage, while held at ICE facilities. The women say they were shackled, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days, and given insufficient food and water.

BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — Women taken into custody by U.S. immigration agents while pregnant say they received inadequate care in a letter Wednesday that calls on the Trump administration to stop holding expectant mothers in federal detention facilities.

The letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of a broader campaign in recent months by Democrats and immigrant rights groups to draw attention to what they say is the mistreatment of pregnant detainees.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended its care, saying pregnant detainees get regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support and accommodations “aligned with community standards of care.”

In addition, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement Wednesday that such detentions are “exceedingly rare” — and that pregnant women currently account for less than 1% of the total number of ICE detainees in custody. The agency didn't provide additional figures related to detainees who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing — data that Democrats have sought for months.

The letter sent by the American Civil Liberties Union cites accounts from pregnant women who say they were shackled while being transported, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days and given insufficient food and water while detained in Louisiana and Georgia.

The ACLU said that over the past five months it has met with more than a dozen females who were pregnant while in ICE custody -- including some who had a miscarriage while detained. The women reported “gravely troubling experiences,” the letter states, including lack of translation during medical encounters and medical neglect. One suffered a “severe” infection after her miscarriage.

When asked about the letter, McLaughlin called it “another disgusting attempt to smear ICE."" She argued that the ACLU used “unsubstantiated” and “unverifiable claims.”

In an interview with The Associated Press, one of the women said she was kept in handcuffs while being transported to Louisiana — a journey that lasted five hours and spanned two plane rides. The woman, who has since been released from custody and given birth, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of facing retaliation during her ongoing case.

An officer told her he considered taking off the handcuffs but worried she would escape. “How am I going to escape if I’m pregnant?” the woman said she responded.

She said she felt as if she'd been kidnapped and experienced dizziness, nausea and vaginal bleeding. During her time in detention, she said pregnant women were not offered special diets and described the food as horrible. She alleged that detainees had to “beg” for water and toilet paper.

The ACLU's letter is the latest call for an investigation into the arrests and treatment of pregnant detainees.

Senate Democrats wrote Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in September, expressing concerns about the “prevalence and treatment” of pregnant, postpartum and nursing women in ICE custody. They demanded that the agency stop detaining such people unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”

“Proper care for pregnancy is a basic human right, regardless of whether you are incarcerated or not and regardless of your immigration status,” said Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove, a California Democrat. She signed onto a Democratic Women's Caucus letter to DHS officials in July sharing concerns about the “treatment of women” and demanding answers — including how many have given birth while detained.

Kamlager-Dove said she's working on legislation that would “severely restrict the use of restraints on pregnant, laboring and postpartum women who are in federal custody.”

ICE guidelines already say that agents “should not detain, arrest, or take into custody for an administrative violation of the immigration laws"" people “known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing,"" based on a policy sent to the AP by DHS. But the document does state that such people may be detained and held in custody under “exceptional circumstances” or if their release is prohibited by law.

The policy also prohibits using restraints on pregnant detainees, but here too there are exceptions — including if there is a serious threat that the detainee will hurt herself or others, or if “an immediate and credible risk"" of escape cannot be “reasonably minimized” through other methods.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Carlitos Ricardo Parias, who they said was in the US illegally, allegedly rammed law enforcement vehicles with his car while trying to flee an immigration arrest.

Officers fired shots and struck Mr Parias' elbow, and a US marshal was hit in the hand by a ricochet bullet, the DHS said. Both were hospitalised with non-life threatening injuries.

Mr Parias, who routinely documents immigration enforcement operations in the Los Angeles area on social media, was charged with assault on a federal officer.

Mr Parias, a 44-year-old Mexican national, has documented Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity in south Los Angeles for months. He had previously been recognised by a city councilman for his commitment to keeping the community ""informed, empowered and protected"".

He was scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday, but his hearing has been postponed to an undecided date.

Tricia McLaughlin, a DHS spokeswoman, said the incident showed ""the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest"".

She claimed law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in threats against them.

In a statement, the US Attorney's Office said Mr Parias was the subject of an administrative immigration arrest warrant and had avoided capture before.

Agents saw Mr Parias leave home in a grey Toyota Camry and drive down a street. Law enforcement officers used their vehicles to box in his car, hoping to prevent him from escaping.

The US Attorney's Office said that federal agents then approached the Camry and gave Mr Parias orders to exit the car and submit to arrest.

Mr Parias ""ignored those commands and drove the Camry both forward and back, hitting two of the law enforcement vehicles"".

He spun the Camry's tires, which spewed smoke and debris in to the air that struck some of the agents, and led the car to fishtail. Agents, worried for their safety, broke the driver's side window to subdue Mr Parias, the statement said.

""A vehicle is a deadly weapon,"" acting US Attorney Bill Essayli said.

LA City Councilmen Curren Price, whose office honoured Mr Parias for his community service, said he was deeply saddened by the incident and stood in solidarity with Mr Parias and his family.

""Richard is a pillar of our community, a fearless citizen journalist whose authentic storytelling has consistently uplifted the unheard voices of South Central Los Angeles,"" Price wrote on social media.

The Coast Guard is focused on ensuring safe and secure operations in support of federal partners.

“Sending troops to San Francisco?” Gov.","SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) — The Trump administration is sending more than 100 federal agents to San Francisco, KRON4.com has learned. The news, which was first reported in the San Francisco Chronicle, was confirmed by KRON4 network partner, NewsNation.

According to a NewsNation source, the agents could arrive as early as Thursday. The contingent of federal officers includes members of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.

They have been dispatched to Coast Guard Island in Alameda, according to NewsNation’s sources. The Coast Guard is part of the Department of Homeland Security.

KRON4 News reached out to the United States Coast Guard and received the following statement from a spokesperson:

“The U.S. Coast Guard is providing facility support to Customs & Border Protection as requested, in a supporting role. The Coast Guard is focused on ensuring safe and secure operations in support of federal partners. All questions about the operation should be directed to CBP, the lead agency.”

“At this time, I have not received any report of ICE agents being sent to Base Alameda,” they added.

The City of Alameda released a statement Wednesday saying that the Alameda Police Department is not part of the operation and does not enforce federal immigration laws.

The deployment follows weeks of President Donald Trump ratcheting up the rhetoric around sending the National Guard to San Francisco, which currently ranks 26th nationally in violent crime. Trump raised the prospect of federal intervention in SF in a White House news conference last week.

Over the weekend, the president doubled down, telling Fox News, “We’re going to San Francisco next.” During the Fox segment, Trump hinted that he would be willing to invoke the Insurrection Act to deploy troops to the city.

On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said the department would be going into San Francisco “at the direction of the president.”

San Francisco city leaders, including Mayor Daniel Lurie and District Attorney Brooke Jenkins, along with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, have been adamant that federal troops are neither wanted, nor needed in the City by the Bay.

“Sending troops to San Francisco?” Gov. Newsom tweeted. “Do it and we’ll sue.”

“Our city attorney is equipped to take necessary legal action,” Mayor Lurie reiterated during a public announcement Wednesday.

“Sending the military will not help our city or our country,” he added.

KRON4 reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and received the following statement:

“As the Secretary said on Monday, DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens—including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists—in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco.

As the Trump administration intensifies its crackdown on immigration, an increasing number of U.S. citizens are finding themselves caught up in the sweeping actions.

A recent investigation by ProPublica reveals that more than 170 American citizens have been detained by immigration agents during the first nine months of this push.

Our own Liz Landers recently spoke with the mother of one of these individuals.

Liz Landers:

A 15-year-old boy with disabilities was handcuffed outside of a Los Angeles high school in August after federal immigration agents mistakenly identified him as a suspect. The boy was waiting in a car with his mother while his sister registered for classes inside.

The family is suing the Trump administration, alleging racial profiling, false arrest and assault. Federal officials have denied any wrongdoing and say they were conducting a targeted operation.

For more on what happened that day and why the family is taking legal action, we are now joined by Andreina Mejia, the boy's mother.

Andreina, walk us through what happened that day. What happened when federal agents approached your car?

Andreina Mejia, Mother of Detained American Child: I was on the phone, and something told me to look up, when I just seen this white truck approaching my car, and it looked like coming directly to me, where I'm like, oh, my God, did they lose control? Like, he's going to hit my car.

And I just seen these two men get off from the front pointing their guns at me and my son, like, actually at our car. I had my window a little bit down. They just came one from my side, the other one from my son's side, and they just opened our doors. They took me out. They took my son out.

All I remember me telling my son is like: ""Don't make any movement. Just follow instructions,"" just because, in my mind, I'm like, OK, they're pointing guns. If they see my son trying to reach for something, I don't know if they're going to shoot.

So I was trying to maintain him calm. And after that, I'm just seeing that they pulled him out. And I'm like: ""What's going on?""

The guy's like; ""Oh, like, we're looking for somebody and your son fits that description.""

So, I’m like:

""I mean, who are you guys looking for?"" And they showed me a picture. And I'm like: ""That's not my son. Like, my son is with me at all times.""

So, after that, they let my son come towards me. As my son was approaching me,he started crying and just hugged me. And I didn't really appreciate the comment that the guy did where he just called my son: ""Oh, we confuse you with somebody else, but just look at the bright side. Like, you're going to have an exciting story to tell your friends when you go back to school.""

I just looked at him. And, as a mom, it hurt me, because I was just thinking, there's nothing exciting about getting guns pointed at you.

Liz Landers:

Walk me through what it was like to hear a law enforcement officer say to you and your child that you would have an exciting story to share after they had drawn their weapons towards you?

Andreina Mejia:

I was really upset just because, like I said, there's nothing exciting about that, and especially how can you be approaching somebody without first asking, oh, let me see an identification to see who you are?

I mean, you just can't be targeting people just because, oh, you look like that person or because you guys got the same color skin. Yes, my son is a bit darker than me, but especially a minor. I mean, I'm the mom. You could approach me and be like, oh, we're looking for somebody. What's your son's name? I would have gave it to you.

Liz Landers:

How did your son react? And you have said that he is a student with disabilities. How did that shape how he understands what happened that day?

Andreina Mejia:

Hold on. I just hate talking about it, because I get all the emotional.

Well, he completely doesn't understand. Like, the phase that he had of confusion, it was just like, I guess he was just trying to wrap his head on, like, what's going on? I mean, it's not an everyday thing that somebody just randomly gets guns pointed at them, like, especially when you're not doing anything.

I was just trying to explain it to him to the best of my ability, just because I know, if somebody were to ask him something, he won't really understand what you guys are asking him. He has this thing where he always looks at me to try to be like, OK, mom, explain it to me in a way where I know I'm going to understand.

Even though he's 15, his brain is pretty much kind of like a 8- or 9-year-old.

Liz Landers:

Customs and Border Protection said in a statement to the ""News Hour"" that — quote — ""Agents were conducting a targeted operation on criminal illegal alien Cristian Alexander Vasquez-Alvarenga, a Salvadorian national and suspected MS-13 pledge with prior criminal convictions in the broader vicinity of Arleta.""

The administration here is denying wrongdoing and saying that this was simply a case of mistaken identity during a targeted operation. What is your response to that?

Andreina Mejia:

I mean, they're wrong for that because, number one, for my son being a special kid, where in their right mind do they think that he's going to be gang-affiliated?

Second, it's, like I said, my son doesn't need my side. And that's for the same reason, because my son does not look his age. He looks older. I don't want people to be thinking, no, no, he's not certain age. He's an older person. Maybe she's lying.

So for — when I heard that, that they were looking for this person and that he was apparently Salvadorian, I'm not — we're not Salvadorians. At this point, it's like, what now? Who's going to help my son deal with a situation where there's time still that it's hard for me as his mom to wake him up in the morning to go to school?

Sometimes, he doesn't want to go to school. Sometimes, he has good days. Sometimes, he has bad days. Sometimes, he says he can't sleep. Right now is a little bit more calmer, but in the beginning, when it was recent, I would be driving and just like making sure he was OK and, out of nowhere, he would just get emotional.

So I will pull over and I'm like: ""What's going on?""

And he's just like: ""Oh, now I don't feel safe, because now I feel that whenever we're in the street, I have to look at my surroundings.""

Liz Landers:

What message do you have for federal officials?

Andreina Mejia:

They just need to be more professional and not just target innocent people.

All this that they're doing is unacceptable. And just I see all these different videos, and it breaks my heart, just because I'm like, what world are we living in now? Like, even to me that I go out and, even though I'm born here, I'm even scared sometimes to go, because I'm like, what about them mistaking me by somebody that doesn't have papers, and I tell them I do, and they don't care, and they still try to grab me in a way where they could hurt me?

Liz Landers:

You have filed a lawsuit. What is next for you in this incident?

Andreina Mejia:

I just want justice, and I just want them to take accountability for what they did, because, like I said, before all this happened, I feel that my son was a bit different.

And now, with this whole situation, it's like I said. He has this good moment. He has this bad. And he just tells me like: ""No, I don't want to go to school."" And, oh, he's going to go to school. We're going to get through this. And me, as his mom and his protector, I mean, I'm always going to make sure that he's good.

Liz Landers:

“Day 1 of me asking the @DHSgov to go and clean up Canal street in NYC where hoards of illegals are brazenly selling fake goods in broad daylight,” she posted.
“The NYPD had no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon,” the police department posted on X.
“@realDonaldTrump claims he’s targeting the “worst of the worst.” Today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street,” Hochul said in a statement.","An immigration sweep targeted New York City vendors just days after a conservative influencer tagged Immigration and Customs Enforcement on social media to “check this corner out.”

Hundreds of angry New Yorkers clashed with federal agents Tuesday afternoon at the city’s famed Canal Street, an area which for years has been a not-so-underground market for knock-off designer handbags, watches, perfumes and sunglasses as well as phones and other electronics.

Protesters attempted to block immigration agents from carrying out the operation when scenes turned ugly.

The day after the raid, which resulted in nine arrests of migrants and four protestors, signs were posted on light poles in the area. They warned migrants about he raids and told them to call for help from inside a “non-public” space such as a church, where agents need a judicial warrant to make arrests.

On Wednesday, Canal Street was quiet with few vendors when typically many are out selling knock-off items.

""I was like, whoa. You usually see them all, packed full, everywhere on the streets. Today, pretty quiet,"" tourist Aye Soe told ABC 7.

On Tuesday, Savanah Hernandez, a right-wing political commentator with Turning Point USA, appeared to take credit for the anti-immigration crackdown after alerting the Department of Homeland Security to activity in the area over the weekend.

“It does really seem like the admin is watching and responding to what’s being reported on X,” Hernandez said in response to another user who congratulated her.

Hernandez shared a video from the corner of Canal Street and Broadway on October 19.

“The entire sidewalk is filled with illegals who state they are from Senegal and I watched as they fled police,” Hernandez said. “Perhaps @ICEgov should go check this corner out.”

She followed up with another post Monday. “Day 1 of me asking the @DHSgov to go and clean up Canal street in NYC where hoards of illegals are brazenly selling fake goods in broad daylight,” she posted.

Hernandez replied to Customs and Border Patrol’s X account Tuesday morning and told the agency to “go check out Canal St in New York City.”

“There are easily 30-40 illegals there daily that are selling fake goods,” Hernandez wrote. “Would be an easy sweep and send a strong message to the sanctuary city of NY.”

Federal agents swooped on the area and made a number of arrests Tuesday afternoon.

Protesters surrounded masked officers and in one instance, attempted to block their vehicle from driving off as they shouted “ICE out of New York” and other chants.

Agents were seen pushing protesters to the ground, and threatening them with pepper spray, before detaining several of them.

As more New Yorkers joined the fray, some of the federal agents retreated on foot, followed by jeering protesters and honking vehicles. Additional federal agents, armed in combat gear and carrying long guns, also arrived with a military tactical vehicle known as a BearCat and made additional arrests.

A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said the agents were carrying out an enforcement operation against sellers of “counterfeit goods” when “rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement.”

New York officials condemned the operation while the NYPD clarified it was not involved.

“The NYPD had no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon,” the police department posted on X.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul called out President Donald Trump as she condemned the use of pepper spray on New Yorkers.

“@realDonaldTrump claims he’s targeting the “worst of the worst.” Today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street,” Hochul said in a statement. “You don’t make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers.”

New York Democratic Mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani said the tactics were “aggressive and reckless.”

“Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety,” Mamdani said. “It must stop.”

Outgoing Mayor Eric Adams said the city had no involvement in the action and was still gathering details.

“Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/22/00/Immigration-Canal_Street_Sweep_29607.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-23 00:17:28.606900

On October 15, Hegseth and deputy Steve Feinberg sent a memo to Pentagon officials announcing a new policy mandating that any communications they have with Congress or state elected officials must first be approved by the Defense Department’s legislative affairs office. That office is currently led by Donald Trump appointee Dane Hughes.

Information such as mandated congressional reports, requests for information by lawmakers, drafting and technical assistance, and legislative correspondence must be approved by the office, the memo says. Previously, individual offices within the Pentagon managed their own communications with lawmakers.

Hegseth and Feinberg also ordered the legislative affairs office to compile a report of the Pentagon’s interactions with Congress to address “issues, inefficiencies or misalignments” within 90 days. It instructs the office to present proposals to “enhance compliance.”

The memo was issued on the same day that the vast majority of journalists covering the Pentagon walked out last week, after Hegseth implemented new, restrictive rules that put a major gag on the information journalists are allowed to access.

This has left the Pentagon without a dedicated set of journalists from major news outlets. Critics say the rules are disturbing, and a step toward government censorship.

The memo, first reported by Breaking Defense and confirmed with officials by The Associated Press, says that the move is necessary for the Department of Defense to “achieve our legislative goals.”

“This requires coordination and alignment of Department messaging when engaging with Congress to ensure consistency and support for the Department’s priorities to re-establish deterrence, rebuild our military, and revive the warrior ethos,” the memo says.

“Unauthorized engagements with Congress by [Department of Defense] personnel acting in their official capacity, no matter how well-intentioned, may undermine Department-wide priorities critical to achieving our legislative objectives,” Hegseth and Feinberg go on.

Top Pentagon Spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement that the move is a “pragmatic step” that is meant to “facilitate increased transparency.”

“This review is for processes internal to the Department and does not change how or from whom Congress receives information,” he said.

However, the move has already been criticized by those who say that it will make it harder for Congress to access necessary information.

“Congress decides who Congress will talk to, and the continued efforts of the secretary to wall off the department is not consistent with past tradition, and I frankly don’t think it’ll fly with the members or leaders of the committee,” House Armed Services Committee member Rep.

Inspectors General OIGs, as established by the Inspector General Act of 1978 (IG Act), exist within departments and agencies of the Executive Branch.
The IG’s responsibility to conduct oversight of Executive Branch departments and agencies and identify and report any waste, fraud or abuse within them appears to fit naturally alongside Congress’s investigative and oversight functions.
Practical Considerations for the IGs Placement While moving IGs to the Legislative Branch appears to be a potentially viable solution for protecting their ability to expose corruption and government waste, there are practical benefits to their present placement in the Executive Branch.
If Congress were to consider moving IGs into the Legislative Branch, Congress may need to reenvision or reduce some IG functions along those lines.","Almost immediately upon taking office for his second term, President Donald Trump unlawfully fired 17 inspectors general (IGs), and over the course of this year has taken actions to demote and replace at least three others, hindering these crucial officials’ efforts to serve as an important guardrail against government waste and corruption. In some cases President Trump has nominated replacements with questionable qualifications, overtly partisan backgrounds, or prior ties to the agency heads they would oversee. These actions effectively politicize and threaten IG independence and demonstrate a clear necessity for Congress to establish stronger protections to ensure that IGs are empowered to conduct government oversight free from interference, intimidation, and threat of retaliation. One way that Congress can do that is by moving the Offices of Inspector General (OIGs) into the legislative branch.

Inspectors General

OIGs, as established by the Inspector General Act of 1978 (IG Act), exist within departments and agencies of the Executive Branch. Although Congress gave the president the power to appoint and remove IGs, Senator Thomas Eagleton emphasized during a floor debate on the legislation that the “‘most important’ characteristic of the inspectors general” would be their independence.

For the nearly 50 years since, IGs have provided critical independent oversight that has improved the integrity of the United States government. Congress has used its oversight powers to highlight threats to IG independence and has repeatedly used its spending power to ensure agency cooperation with IG audits and investigations. For example, Congress successfully leveraged funding for the Department of Commerce General Counsel to compel the agency to provide the IG with access to records that it had threatened to withhold.

Still, the independence and protection of IGs has been an ongoing concern for Congress, motivating multiple legislative reforms intended to protect them from arbitrary removal. For instance, Congress passed the Inspector General Reform Act of 2008, which established a requirement that Congress be notified in writing no later than 30 days before the removal or transfer of an IG, and provisions of the Securing Inspector General Independence Act of 2022, which required the Executive to provide Congress with a detailed account of the justification for its removal of an IG and that the IG remain in place for 30 days while Congress considers that justification. Immediately after the first firings, Senators Grassley and Durbin wrote to Trump, noting that “Congress was not provided the legally required 30-day notice and case-specific reasons for removal, as required by law.” And in September, a district court found it “obvious” that Trump violated these laws when he fired IGs en masse in January, but stayed the case pending Supreme Court review and held that the court could not reinstate them.

Current Threats to IG Oversight and Independence

President Trump has cited his authority as president under Article II of the Constitution to justify numerous actions which appear to have effectively eroded the independence of IGs. During his first term in office, President Trump took at least 25 discrete actions encroaching on the independence of IGs, including firing two permanent IGs, removing three acting IGs without any clear justification, and asserting that he would prevent the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery from communicating with Congress about administration misconduct and obstruction without “presidential supervision.” Trump’s actions at that time drew bipartisan criticism from Members of Congress.

In his second term, Trump’s actions to remove IGs and eviscerate their ability to conduct effective independent oversight are far more unabashed. Notably, in June, Trump removed and replaced the Department of Education’s Acting Inspector General, René L. Rocque, less than two weeks after she reported to Congress that her office had “experienced unreasonable denials and repeated delays” from administration officials in response to requests for “access to documents, staff, and information,” thereby preventing her office “from discharging [its] statutory mission.”

To justify this removal, President Trump wrote to Congress:

“I have determined that the changed priorities of my Administration (as compared to the previous one) will be better reflected with new leadership in this Office.”

Congress specifically designed IGs to not be tied to a particular administration because they are supposed to provide oversight and accountability regardless of political party or who currently occupies the Oval Office. The IG Act is explicit that IGs are to be appointed “without regard to political affiliation and solely on the basis of integrity and demonstrated ability in accounting, auditing, [and] financial analysis.” Contrary to President Trump’s assertions, IGs are not intended to reflect, or carry out, the policy priorities of the current administration. Their function is to conduct oversight and investigations with purposeful detachment from administration priorities and goals.

In his letter, President Trump cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2019 decision in Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau arguing that the Constitution gives the president “the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties.” That case said that the president could remove the head of an agency – the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) – despite Congress legislating statutory protections stating that “the President may remove the Director only for ‘inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.’”

Congress has considered proposals to restrict the president from removing IGs, except “for cause,” but the Supreme Court’s analyses in Seila Law along with a 2010 Supreme Court case, Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, present complex questions as to how Congress could effectively implement “for cause” removal protections for IGs across government. A May 22 Supreme Court order issuing a stay in Trump v. Wilcox effectively overruled the seminal 1935 case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, in which the Supreme Court recognized the ability of Congress to limit the removal of executive branch officials. Now, the Supreme Court seems poised to explicitly overrule that 90-year-old precedent. On September 22, the Supreme Court agreed to hear another case, Trump v. Slaughter, challenging Trump’s removal of a commissioner from the Federal Trade Commission. In the order granting an application for a stay and agreeing to hear that case, the Supreme Court directed the parties “to brief and argue the following questions: (1) Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935), should be overruled.”

Do IGs Belong in the Legislative Branch?

Regardless of one’s view of the Court’s embrace of the unitary executive theory in Seila Law, it is clear that there is a fundamental difference in the nature of the work that an agency head does compared to an IG. The IG’s responsibility to conduct oversight of Executive Branch departments and agencies and identify and report any waste, fraud or abuse within them appears to fit naturally alongside Congress’s investigative and oversight functions.

As the Supreme Court eloquently articulated in the 1927 case McGrain v. Daugherty:

A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or change, and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite information-which not infrequently is true-recourse must be had to others who do possess it.

An essential function of the IG is to inform Congress of how the laws are being executed. As Republican Senator Chuck Grassley explained in Senate floor remarks in 2020 that more than 40 years after he voted in support of the 1978 Act establishing the OIGs: “IGs … help[] Congress watch over the people’s business and ensure the fidelity of agency actions…. In this way, these watchdogs serve an indispensable function in our system of checks and balances” between the Executive and Legislative branches.

Congress similarly serves an indispensable function as the body with the means to effect change and improvements and corrective action through legislation, including through laws making appropriations. It is for precisely that reason that the legislative branch already has, within it, bodies that perform an independent oversight and investigative function – the very same function IGs perform.

The GAO Example

Congress already possesses an oversight analogue. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) performs an oversight function similar and complementary to the mission and work of the IGs across government, and resides within the federal Legislative Branch. Congress created the GAO, originally named the General Accounting Office, in 1921 through the Budget and Accounting Act (BAA).

At the time Congress passed the BAA, it shared present day concerns regarding the Executive auditing itself. The BAA thus transferred the auditing function and responsibility from the then-Comptroller of the Treasury and Assistant Comptroller of the Treasury, originally housed within the Treasury Department, to the GAO, which was established as “independent of the executive departments and under the control and direction” (emphasis added) of a newly created position – the Comptroller General of the United States. As the Supreme Court explained in the 1986 case, Bowsher v. Synar, “Congress created the office [of the Comptroller General] because it believed that it ‘needed an officer, responsible to it alone, to check upon the application of public funds in accordance with appropriations.’”

In the early days of the GAO, it faced resistance from the administration. In the 1930s, there were several attempts to abolish the GAO, weaken it, or to encroach upon its independence. In 1932, President Hoover even attempted to dismantle the agency through Executive Order – a plan that Hoover’s own Budget Director advised against. A congressional committee found that “to interfere with work specifically given by law to an agency specifically created to function independent of the executive branch and on behalf of Congress… would defeat the very purpose of existing law, as it would break down the means of obtaining a uniform accounting system throughout the Government.” In 1971, former Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats wrote of GAO’s role:

Objective information about our national programs and their effects is almost the lifeblood of our national legislature if it is to remain an effective force in our national government and responsive to the needs of the people. [GAO], as an agent of the Congress and accountable only to it, is one of these sources of information.

In an effort to protect the GAO’s, and the Comptroller General’s independence and ability to serve as a nonpartisan oversight arm of Congress, the BAA provided that the Comptroller General would be appointed for a fifteen year term of office, and “not be eligible for reappointment,” ensuring they would serve across administrations and insulating them from partisan political concerns as well as the policy priorities of any particular president. Furthermore, the law provided that the Comptroller General could only be removed for cause “by joint resolution of Congress after notice and hearing,” thereby protecting GAO from the president encroaching on the agency’s independence.

Despite his earlier writings about the importance of the government oversight function, as president, Woodrow Wilson vetoed the first version of BAA that passed Congress because he believed he should be able to fire the Comptroller General, and argued that the BAA’s removal provisions may be unconstitutional. However, when Warren G. Harding later became president, he signed the BAA into law.

In 1980, Congress passed the General Accounting Office Act and established the process that exists today, whereby a commission consisting of congressional leaders recommend nominees to the president for a vacant Comptroller General position. But under this structure, and despite the more than 30 Legislative Branch office and agency heads with varying approaches to how they are appointed, the Comptroller General is ultimately appointed by the president. Perhaps Congress wanted to avoid a confrontation as to whether the law ran afoul the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. In his June 4, 1920 statement accompanying his veto of the BAA after its initial passage, President Wilson argued that “the Congress is without constitutional powers to limit the appointing power and its incident, the power of removal” and that the Appointments Clause, Section 2 of Article II of the Constitution, provides that “all officers whose appointments are not otherwise provided for, shall be appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.” President Wilson wrote, “Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.”

Under the Constitution, as interpreted by the courts, there are two types of officers – principal officers, which can only be appointed by the president with the Senate’s advice and consent, and inferior officers, whose “work is directed and supervised at some level.”

As explained by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), “Congress has periodically examined the procedures used to appoint these officers with the aim of protecting the prerogatives of, and ensuring accountability to, Congress within the framework of the advice and consent appointment process established in Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.” Under that framework, Congress has some flexibility to prescribe, by statute, the method of appointment of inferior officers.

CRS has researched and analyzed the question of how IGs, as they currently serve under the law, fit within the appointments clause, and notes that “the unique functions and discretion provided to IGs under the IG Act do not appear to fit neatly into the typical Appointments Clause classifications, and as a result, whether IGs in fact exercise ‘significant authority’ is an open question that no court has addressed.” However, CRS notes that a U.S. District Court case in the District of Columbia, Jefferson v. Harris, “determined that Members of the Council of the Inspector General on Integrity and Efficiency’s Integrity Committee, which includes IGs, are not officers” of the United States.

Today, Congress and the American people again grapple with how to protect the auditing, oversight, and investigative work of the IGs across the federal government, while they are embedded within the Executive Branch. The solution may be for the current Congress to follow the example its predecessors set when creating the GAO, and passing legislation to move those IG offices into the Legislative Branch. Congress could consider creating a single coordinating agency to facilitate more effective and efficient systemization of oversight and investigations of Executive Branch activities, or allow GAO to play a coordinating role.

Practical Considerations for the IGs Placement

While moving IGs to the Legislative Branch appears to be a potentially viable solution for protecting their ability to expose corruption and government waste, there are practical benefits to their present placement in the Executive Branch. Most notably, operating within Executive Branch departments and agencies, IGs can have direct access to agency records and information as well have ready and direct access to the agency head under the IG Act. For example, IGs can directly access documents, files and information for audit and investigative purposes from agency cloud computing data systems without going through the back and forth of asking for records to be sent to investigators.

In a 1999 case, NASA v. FLRA, involving labor union representation, the Supreme Court analyzed the IG Act and explained the nature of the relationship between the IG and its respective department or agency. Specifically, the Supreme Court found that, as presently situated under the IG Act, an OIG employee is a “representative of the agency” in which they reside. However, the relationship between the OIG and the agency for which it conducts oversight is a product of the statute Congress passed and, thus, could be changed by Congress.

Continuing to consider GAO as an analog to the IGs, the Supreme Court, in Bowsher, examined the placement of the Comptroller General in the Legislative Branch, and the associated limitations of that office. The Court wrote that GAO “is ‘an instrumentality of the United States Government independent of the executive departments,’… [t]hus, because Congress has retained removal authority over the Comptroller General, he may not be entrusted with executive powers.”

As they stand now, IGs arguably perform some traditionally executive functions that may need to be reconsidered if they are to be moved within the Legislative Branch. For instance, many IGs have “law enforcement” powers, including seeking and executing search warrants, carrying firearms, and making arrests. GAO has none of those powers. It has no authority to make arrests, exact fines, or otherwise directly pursue criminal proceedings. Instead, GAO is, generally, limited to making and reporting findings to Congress, the president, or relevant agencies. If Congress were to consider moving IGs into the Legislative Branch, Congress may need to reenvision or reduce some IG functions along those lines.

***

Practically speaking, the IG Act, including the various IGs’ placement and status, afford those officials significant opportunities and tools to conduct effective oversight. Those opportunities and potential efficiencies must be balanced against the opportunity and temptation for the president and administration officials to stifle, obstruct, or seek to control or redirect that oversight for partisan, policy, or even nefarious reasons.

IGs are key players in the fight against corruption. They expose fraud in government contracting, enforce anti-bribery laws, and refer illicit finance schemes for prosecution. A Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee (HSGAC) Minority Staff Report found that the IGs fired by President Trump had produced “a collective monetary impact of over $50 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2024 alone by identifying potential cost savings in federal programs… and achieving actual investigative recoveries…such as fines, settlements and restitution” and also identified as much as “$175 billion in potential savings that could be achieved if federal agencies implement the OIGs’ recommendations that remain open.”

Do the potential benefits of the IGs’ placement in the Executive Branch outweigh the costs? This is a question for Congress to consider, but the Trump administration’s sweeping attacks on federal oversight offices appears to weigh heavily toward congressional action to protect IG independence by moving those officials to the Legislative Branch. Protecting IGs is critical to continued transparency with regard to government programs, and vital to combatting waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2218864038.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 09:56:56.451306

On his first day in office, President Donald Trump rallied federal agencies, including ICE, to start conducting mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.
Regardless of how one might feel about current federal immigration enforcement, hopefully all Americans can agree that any policy issued by any administration must comply with the Constitution.
Under Supreme Court precedent, here is what a constitutional policy looks like: If federal agents want to raid posted, fenced or enclosed property, they need a warrant.
The federal agents who raided Garcia’s worksites and detained him — even after he showed his REAL ID — had none of that.","Leo Garcia Venegas is a natural-born American citizen who just wants to work in peace. But the federal government won’t let him. He has been swept up in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids at work — not once, but twice — where he was assaulted, handcuffed and treated like a criminal by agents of the U.S. government.

Garcia is a construction worker in Baldwin County, Alabama. Every day, he goes to work and helps build the homes needed to support the region’s fast-growing population. And every day, he works in fear. Earlier this month, he partnered with my nonprofit law firm, the Institute for Justice, to file a lawsuit against ICE and several other federal agencies, senior officials and officers responsible for enforcing immigration laws.

It all goes back to early 2025. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump rallied federal agencies, including ICE, to start conducting mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. That effort has involved, in Border Czar Tom Homan’s words, “massively expand[ed]” “worksite enforcement operations.”

Masked agents burst in and started detaining everybody who looked Latino (they left a group of non-Latino workers alone).

Officers storm into the non-public areas of businesses, armed with guns, and often detain anybody who they think looks undocumented. Many of the people swept up in these raids are American citizens. These raids have hit the Alabama construction industry particularly hard. Officers have been raiding private worksites for months. Construction workers, including citizens, are afraid to go to work. Garcia’s experience shows why.

In May, he was working on a posted and fenced site, preparing to lay the foundation for a new home, when masked agents burst in and started detaining everybody who looked Latino (they left a group of non-Latino workers alone). When Garcia told them he was a citizen, the agents tackled and handcuffed him anyway. Even after inspecting his REAL ID — a credential issued only to citizens and lawful residents — the agents kept Garcia restrained for about an hour.

Then, in June, it happened again. Federal agents entered a nearly completed house in which Garcia was working, cornered him and ordered him to exit so they could check his status. Once again, Garcia produced his REAL ID. And once again, the agents refused to accept it. They marched him several blocks to a lineup with other workers they had detained — including another citizen and a lawfully present worker — only releasing him 20 minutes later.

Garcia was not charged with a crime after either raid. After the first raid, the federal government claimed that Garcia “physically got in between agents and the subject they were attempting to arrest and refused to comply with numerous verbal commands.” But Garcia was merely taking out his phone to record the altercation — when an ICE agent grabbed him. And the government has never attempted to justify Garcia’s second arrest.

The fact is, Garcia did nothing wrong. All he ever did was show up to work. And for that, he was deprived of his rights as a U.S. citizen. The government’s difficult relationship with the truth cannot change the reality of what it did to Garcia.

These terrifying raids show no sign of slowing down. Indeed, a recent post by Stephen Miller, Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy and Homeland Security Advisor, suggests the floodgates are now open. According to Miller, the federal government holds the power to “ensur[e] the full and unrestricted enforcement of immigration law in all fifty states.”

That is embarrassingly wrong. The Constitution does not tolerate “unrestricted” power. Indeed, the whole point of the Constitution is to restrict government power. Look at the Fourth Amendment: It protects “[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.”

The bottom line is simple: There is no ICE exception to the Fourth Amendment.

Moreover, the Constitution does not tolerate an ends-justify-the-means approach. Regardless of how one might feel about current federal immigration enforcement, hopefully all Americans can agree that any policy issued by any administration must comply with the Constitution. Under Supreme Court precedent, here is what a constitutional policy looks like: If federal agents want to raid posted, fenced or enclosed property, they need a warrant. If they want to detain people, they need reasonable suspicion that those people are violating immigration or other laws. And if they want to arrest people, they need probable cause.

The federal agents who raided Garcia’s worksites and detained him — even after he showed his REAL ID — had none of that. So, Garcia is suing.

The lawsuit, which will seek class-action status, asks the U.S. district court in southern Alabama to enjoin ICE and its fellow immigration enforcement agencies from conducting any further warrantless construction site raids or suspicionless seizures of citizens and other lawfully present workers — all of which violate the Fourth Amendment and federal regulations that were adopted to limit immigration officers’ power.

The bottom line is simple: There is no ICE exception to the Fourth Amendment. Garcia has every right, as an American citizen, to work on private property without having to fear that armed, masked agents will storm the site without a warrant and detain him just for doing his job. As much as Mr. Miller might like to wish that right away, wishes are not law — the Constitution is.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251020-ice-arrest-zz-991a8a.jpg",N,,2025-10-23 00:17:41.747653

That plan was reported earlier Wednesday by The San Francisco Chronicle. The Department of Homeland Security oversees Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Coast Guard.

The U.S. officials said Border Patrol commander Gregory Bovino, one of the most visible faces of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown, is expected to be involved in the operation. Bovino is currently leading Border Patrol arrests in Chicago, where a judge on Monday ordered him to answer questions about agents' use of force during those operations. He also oversaw the agency's controversial immigration raids in the Los Angeles area this summer.

In a response to CBS News' request for comment, a spokesperson for DHS said, ""DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens-including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists-in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.""

In a video posted on social media Wednesday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, denounced the Trump administration's plans, accusing the president of seeking to create ""conditions for anxiety"" in American cities.

""He sends out masked men, he sends out Border Patrol. He sends out ICE, creates anxiety and fear in the community, so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the Guard in the first place,"" Newsom said.

President Trump has recently floated the idea of dispatching federal agents to San Francisco.

""We're going to go to San Francisco. The difference is I think they want us in San Francisco,"" Mr. Trump said in a Fox News interview that aired over the weekend.

On Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said local residents would protest peacefully if the Trump administration uses ""un-American tactics to target immigrant communities"" in the area.

""This federal administration wants to divide us, but we know San Francisco is strongest when we come together to stand up for each other and our values,"" Lurie added.

As part of an aggressive expansion in deportation efforts across the country, the Trump administration has deployed teams of Border Patrol agents to large, Democratic-led American cities far away from a U.S. border.

When state officials visited the Queens building that year to investigate, a building superintendent and an agent of the management company tried to intimidate potential witnesses with the threat of immigration raids, officials said.

On Wednesday, the division announced that in February it had reached a settlement with the defendants, all of whom were accused of discriminating against people based on their national origin, in violation of state human rights law. The defendants included Parsons 88 Realty, the owner of the building; Zara Realty, the management company associated with the building and dozens of others in Queens and Long Island; and several individuals associated with the companies. The building, which has about 55 units that state officials said were mostly occupied by immigrants, is in the Jamaica neighborhood on Parsons Boulevard near State Route 25.

As part of the settlement, the defendants agreed to pay $55,000 and submit to three years of oversight to ensure they are complying with the terms. They also agreed to display a poster in the lobby of the building reminding renters of protections against discrimination and to remove questions from rental applications related to a tenant’s national origin, state officials said.

A fair housing notice could also be read on Zara’s website on Wednesday.

“It is unacceptable, unconscionable and illegal for housing providers to discriminate against their tenants simply because of where they are from,” Denise M. Miranda, the commissioner of the division, said in a statement on Wednesday.

The agents are reportedly from several agencies including Customs and Border Protection, which traditionally is deployed at the border but has been sent farther afield by President Donald Trump. News of the arrival of these agents came after Trump had threatened to send National Guard troops to San Francisco, saying he has “unquestioned power” to do so.

National Guard troops deployed to the Bay Area would not be able to make immigration arrests. They could, however, offer “cover” for CBP agents who are doing so. This has already taken place in other cities.

In Chicago, Texas National Guard Troops were instructed to protect ICE agents and buildings.

In Los Angeles, troops carrying shields and armed with rifles stood in front of federal buildings and accompanied ICE agents on raids. They escalated tensions by giving protesters a subject to face off with, Los Angeles Times reporter Rebecca Ellis said in an interview with Oregon Public Broadcasting.

It’s possible members of the National Guard in San Francisco would be stationed around federal immigration buildings at 100 Montgomery or 630 Sansome St., where the bulk of immigration arrests in San Francisco have taken place.

Still, unlike ICE or CBP agents, which can largely operate with a free hand, legal experts said National Guard troops deployed to California cannot make arrests without a warrant. Under the Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops must be authorized by the governor to participate in law enforcement against civilians.

That is unlikely to happen locally. Gov. Gavin Newsom has been outspoken against Trump’s deployment.

“He sends out masked men, he sends out border patrol, he sends out ICE. It creates fear and anxiety in the community so that he can lay claim to solving for that by sending in the guard,” Newsom said in a video posted on X. “This is no different than the arsonist putting out the fire.”

A federal judge ruled in June that deploying the California National Guard to participate in civilian law enforcement without Newsom’s consent was illegal. By the end of July, all but 300 of the National Guard troops who had been deployed in Los Angeles were sent home.

Trump has intimated that he would invoke a different law, the Insurrection Act of 1807, to deploy troops to San Francisco. This would allow soldiers to enforce a federal court order, like a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, or suppress an “uprising.”

In most cities, however, National Guard troops are focused on more mundane tasks. In Washington, D.C., where Trump deployed the National Guard back in August, troops have been shoveling mulch, picking up trash, and patrolling train stations. They’ve also asked city leaders for other “beautification” projects to work on.

“We collected approximately 40-plus trash bags with several pieces of debris, some old tires and crates,” said Bernard Aguon, command chief warrant officer of the D.C. Army National Guard, in a statement to the U.S. Department of Defense. “Our goal here is really just to help the community by beautifying areas within the district.”

San Francisco, for its part, is already planning to take legal action if the guard is deployed here, and has joined a coalition of other jurisdictions urging the U.S. Supreme Court to keep the National Guard from Chicago and other cities.

Some of that notoriety has piqued interest in the nonprofit’s origins and the North Platte native behind the group.

Split between countries

TinaMaria Fernandez, 43, is herself the product of a family split by U.S. immigration policy. Her dad, from Mexico, met and married her mom while he was in North Platte working at a local horse-processing plant. Despite a lengthy attempt, his visa was not renewed and the young family lived apart.

“My mother stayed here by the wishes of my father, to raise me in the United States,” Fernandez said. “We’d go and visit my dad in Mexico.”

At one point, Fernandez said, her parents thought they had necessary paperwork in order and her mom and family members traveled south to get him. “They wouldn’t let my dad come back across.”

Eventually, she said, her dad urged his wife to move on. Each began new relationships. Fernandez has siblings and relatives on both sides of the border. To this day, she said, her parents talk sometimes by phone.

“There’s that love, you know, they always say that it’s two countries that separated us and separated our hearts and our family.”

Fernandez said her North Platte childhood was “not the greatest,” and while she wonders how life might have been different had her father been closer, she chooses to believe “everything happens for a reason.”

She said her own immigration-related experiences helps to better understand people she works with through Hope Esperanza, including the Glenn Valley and other federal detainees awaiting deportation at the Lincoln County facility.

“I see, I know the effects of it,” Fernandez said. “My heart goes out to them.”

Her team also has been contacted by McCook representatives seeking guidance on community-building in the town where a state prison is being transformed for ICE detention use. Advocacy groups will not have the same access to the McCook state-federal facility as they do in Lincoln County, Fernandez said. But she said programs akin to those offered by Hope Esperanza could make local immigrant populations feel supported.

Building momentum

One of the organizations that recently recognized Hope Esperanza and founder Fernandez noted that her education and jobs helped prepare her to run the North Platte agency, which is fueled by grants and philanthropic donors and has grown to a team of more than 20 people.

Fernandez earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from the University of Wyoming and a nursing degree from the University of Nebraska Medical Center. She worked as a social worker for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Correctional Services and as a counselor for Lutheran Family Services.

While in nursing school, Fernandez said she was horrified by a particular family’s health care challenges she believed were exacerbated by language barriers. She saw children removed from Spanish-speaking households that likely could have stayed together had parents tapped available support services.

That spurred her to conduct a six-month needs assessment, focusing on the county’s Latino community, the area’s largest minority group. She contacted many of the roughly 90 nonprofits working in Lincoln County to understand why gaps existed. Hope Esperanza formed to help plug the gaps.

Then still a student, Fernandez started small, filling her SUV with food to deliver to families. Her team at one point made and sold enchiladas to help stave off a mom’s eviction.

Fernandez called it “God’s work” that the group’s nonprofit status and structure were newly in place when North Platte learned the region would become home to a Sustainable Beef LLC processing plant, one of the largest processing facilities in the nation.

“God was sending a whole lot more needs our way,” Fernandez said, referring to an incoming workforce that largely would be newcomers of different cultures whose first language is not English.

The rancher-owned plant reportedly will employ up to 850 workers and have a $1.5 billion community impact. Operations launched this spring, following years of preparation.

Hope Esperanza, meanwhile, has been expanding services (Esperanza means hope in Spanish). The operation offers food, clothing and furniture aid; transportation and employment coordination, health and youth programs, safety and cultural events. Integration and language access classes are geared toward newcomers to the city of about 23,000 people.

Ripples of raid four hours away

The group’s statewide notoriety grew after Lincoln County Sheriff Jerome Kramer got the call in June asking if his North Platte-based county jail could accept detainees that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement had arrested in the Omaha raid, four hours away.

Lincoln County had an established contract with the feds to house ICE detainees. But the 63 Glenn Valley workers increased the jail population by about 50%, the sheriff said, at a time when the facility was short-staffed. He said Hope Esperanza was a lifeline.

Kramer already had worked with Fernandez, and participated in bridge-building meetings the nonprofit holds with city and law enforcement officials.

Douglas County Board Chair Roger Garcia, an outspoken critic of the ICE action, said he had never heard about Hope Esperanza before the June 10 Omaha raid. Last week, the annual Hispanic Heritage Awards organized by Garcia and his wife Yanira recognized the group for its response and outreach to the migrant detainees.

“What really impressed us was they were not only providing basic interpretation and translation services, but they were a moral support and a human heart caring for the women going through that difficulty and separation from their families,” Garcia said.

He was told that on one visit to the jail, Hope Esperanza representatives played Selena music and the women inmates danced.

“They had a human moment together to lift up their spirits … in a very difficult moment when they were detained, separated from their families,” Garcia said. “The fact we had Hope Esperanza there was a blessing for those women and for us as a community.”

Garcia and some other immigrant advocates reacted much differently to a recent proposal by the Douglas County sheriff and the then-state director of the League of United Latino American Citizens (LULAC).

Sheriff Aaron Hanson had sought to lease space in the Omaha-based county jail to the feds for ICE detention, framing the idea as both a profitable and humanitarian venture, partly because it would keep Omaha detainees closer to their families.

The prospect was shot down by a majority of the County Board. Garcia has said the increased ICE presence would lead to more fear and local arrests.

“There is a difference between being in favor of detention versus people on the ground helping individuals in these unfortunate circumstances,” Garcia said.

Nebraska Appleseed earlier this month also recognized Fernandez. The Lincoln-based group selected her for its “Roots of Justice Award” even before the raid, and cited ongoing efforts to connect young Latinos to their culture and new workers to community resources.

“She brings a group of diverse community members together on a regular basis to problem solve and plan for the community,” said Appleseed senior welcoming coordinator Christa Yoakum.

Ruby Méndez López said she was impressed by Fernandez’s varied roles, including as a mom and wife. “She’s heading this organization but also is a full-time nurse and does a million other things around North Platte.”

Elephant on her chest

Though the number of detainees from Omaha’s Glenn Valley raid has dwindled to a couple, the Hope Esperanza team said it still meets at least weekly with other migrants held by ICE in the Lincoln County jail.

Staff and volunteers also are working with an influx of newcomers due to the meatpacking plant, providing language access and other services. The nonprofit is trying to launch a health clinic for underserved populations.

Fernandez continues to work on a book that delves into her journey and identity shaped by immigration and separation. She already authored a children’s book about belonging, illustrated by her son Micah and titled “Nico’s New Home.”

She said she has yet to fully process events of the past year related to ramped up immigration enforcement but sometimes feels the weight of an “elephant” on her chest.

“I don’t see politics,” Fernandez said. “I see displaced families. I see separated families, kiddos going to bed at night without their parents. It’s a lot.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47648/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/118272477799200054-e1761167336386-1024x8891761180881.jpeg?h=874824da&itok=c8x2bASD,N,,2025-10-22 20:57:06.792857

ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A federal lawsuit that temporarily had interrupted operations at an immigration detention in the Florida Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” was paused Wednesday by an appellate court because of the government shutdown.

Earlier this month, U.S. government attorneys had asked the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to stay proceedings in the case because funding for the Justice Department, as well as the Department of Homeland Security which is a defendant, had expired because of the government shutdown.

They requested the pause until appropriations were restored by Congress.

The appellate court on Wednesday granted the request. While the facility was built and operated by the state of Florida and its private contractors, federal officials have approved reimbursing the state for $608 million.

Attorneys for the environmental groups that had sued the federal and state governments over environmental concerns about the facility said that the administration of President Donald Trump had been litigating hundreds of cases around the country during the shutdown.

“Apparently, the government has sufficient money and manpower to operate a detention center in the heart of the Everglades to detain foreign born workers, but not enough to file a brief in court to justify its conduct, which the trial court held unlawful,” said Paul Schwiep, one of the attorneys.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, along with the Miccosukee Tribe, sued federal and state agencies this summer, alleging they didn’t follow federal law requiring an environmental review for the detention center in the middle of sensitive wetlands.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams agreed and ordered in August that the facility needed to wind down operations within two months. However, that injunction was put on hold in early September when the appellate court panel in Atlanta issued a stay, pending the outcome of an appeal, allowing the facility to stay open for the time being.

An opening appellate brief from the federal government had been due on Friday.

Two other lawsuits challenging operations at the Everglades detention center are proceeding in federal court in Florida.

Cary López Alvarado, of Hawthorne, California, was nine months pregnant when she was arrested by immigration officials alongside her husband, an immigrant from Guatemala. Alvarado was held overnight but was never sent to a detention facility: After taking her into custody, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) learned she was a U.S. citizen.

Immediately after her release, she began to experience sharp pains in her stomach, according to a claim she filed against the federal government. She gave birth a few days later.

Angie Rodriguez, an immigrant from Colombia, was taken into ICE custody following a routine check-in with immigration officials in July, and soon after found out she was pregnant. At the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center where she was held, Rodriguez could hardly bring herself to eat the small meals that the detention facility served because of how they looked and smelled, and her only other option was buying processed food like instant noodles and chips.

Rodriguez went on to miscarry while in custody, according to a lawsuit she filed against the federal government.

Antonia Aguilar Maldonano, a mother of two from El Salvador, was arrested by ICE on her way to work and detained at the Kandiyohi County Jail in Minnesota for almost a month. Her youngest child is 22 months old and still nursing; he has acid reflux and an allergy to other forms of milk. The jail was not equipped to house someone who was nursing, said Gloria Contreras Edin, her lawyer: It did not have a breast pump when Aguilar Maldonado arrived, forcing her to use her hands to massage milk out until the facility was able to buy a pump.

Lawyers successfully argued for her release on bond — $10,000, paid for by members of her church — while the government makes the case that she be deported.

A Biden-era policy restricts ICE from arresting or detaining immigrants who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing, except in extreme circumstances. While President Donald Trump has not formally rescinded the policy, it’s clear from lawsuits, news reports and advocates for immigrants who are detained that it’s not being followed.

Quantifying the exact number of pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants in custody has become impossible: This March, Congress let lapse a requirement that the administration report twice a year on how many of these immigrants are being held in immigration facilities. Since the fall of 2019, Congress had required the Department of Homeland Security to publicly report the count every six months and include “detailed justification” for every single detained immigrant who was pregnant, postpartum or nursing.

ICE did not respond to The 19th’s request for this data.

While the agency said in a statement in August that pregnant immigrants are receiving sufficient care in custody, medical professionals say the conditions in these facilities can heighten the risk for complications. Limited food can impact nutrition at a vulnerable time; access to medical appointments is spotty and often not aligned with standards of care; and pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees also face the stress of arrest and separation from their families.

The impact of arrests and detention

In 2021, following public outcry against the first Trump administration’s immigration policies, the Biden administration directed ICE not to detain pregnant, postpartum or nursing people except in “exceptional circumstances"" — they are a national security threat or pose immediate harm to themselves or other people. Those who are detained are supposed to be held in facilities suited to appropriate health care. ICE-employed medical professionals are supposed to provide weekly updates on those detainees to relevant agency directors. The ICE Health Service Corps is also supposed to keep consistent records of all pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees, providing monthly updates to the organization’s leadership.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has not formally rescinded that policy, but administration officials argued in court that he had done so implicitly through a sweeping anti-immigration executive order that supercharged immigration enforcement. A federal judge refuted that argument, but on its website, ICE says the policy is “not reflective of current practice.”

“We're seeing more pregnant women detained again after not seeing much of that, at least not in ICE detention,” said Amanda Heffernan, a longtime nurse-midwife and professor of midwifery at Seattle University.

Rebecca Cassler, an attorney at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said her organization’s pro bono program has seen an increase in cases of detained pregnant, postpartum and nursing people. She says no one outside ICE really knows how many, but it’s enough to make her “very concerned.”

Though the federal government has not made public how many pregnant people have been detained, Democratic lawmakers have published multiple investigations documenting known cases.

One report, published this summer by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, identified 14 credible cases of pregnant women being mistreated in detention facilities. The report included a description of pregnant women sleeping on cell floors, one detainee being told to “just drink water” when needing medical support, and another miscarrying alone after days of bleeding.

ICE has disputed the report. ""Pregnant women receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care. Detention of pregnant women is rare and has elevated oversight and review. No pregnant woman has been forced to sleep on the floor,"" ICE said in a statement on its website.

A September 18 letter signed by 29 Democratic senators and addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem directed federal officials to clarify just how many pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding people are being detained, how many have been deported and what health care is being made available to them. DHS has not acknowledged receipt, said a spokesperson for Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who organized the letter.

“We do not know how many pregnant women are in ICE custody, whether U.S. citizen babies have been born in ICE custody, and what provisions have been made for mothers’ and children’s health, safety, and wellbeing,” the senators wrote.

The Women’s Refugee Commission, an advocacy group, is seeking records from Homeland Security pertaining to pregnant, postpartum or nursing individuals who have been detained. It recently launched its own independent tracker, encouraging health providers, lawyers and family members to submit information about pregnant people who have been detained. The commission said it’s too early to provide an accurate count from its tracker.

Zain Lakhani, a lawyer and director of migrant rights and justice for the commission, said credible reports of pregnant people being detained suggest a frequency higher than ICE’s policy would suggest.

“It would be shocking that we would be able to have this level of detained pregnant people under the guidance,” she said. “We are seeing just this shocking number of detained postpartum and pregnant women.”

Workers helping integrate deported immigrants in Honduras told researchers from the Women’s Refugee Commission that nursing women who were deported had not received enough food and water to continue lactating.

“They arrive with hardly any milk — or milk that looks like water — and this affects the babies’ weight,” one worker said, according to a report published by the organization.

The impact of arrests and detention

By the time Aguilar Maldonado left the jail, her breast milk had started to dry up, Contreras Edin said. She is particularly worried about the impact of detention on her children, who were not with her and now follow her wherever she goes, including to the bathroom. Her boyfriend has been deported; she is asking a judge to let her leave voluntarily — a process that has fewer legal penalties than being deported — so she and her children can follow him.

“Her children were traumatized and her youngest was especially traumatized,” Contreras Edin said. “That bond was broken during detention and that left a permanent impression on her children.”

There is no way to ethically research how detention specifically may affect pregnancy outcomes, including whether it could increase the possibility of miscarriage, said Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins University who studies the reproductive health of incarcerated women. But evidence does show that physical and psychological strain — the kind people can suffer while detained — threatens the health of a pregnancy and can mean greater risk of preterm birth.

“I’m very concerned because of the conditions we’ve already heard about that could be increasing the risks of adverse outcomes,” Sufrin said. “I’m very concerned about the outcomes for these moms as well as for the outcomes for their babies.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on the conditions or available accommodations for pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants.

Alvarado, who is seeking $1 million following her arrest, citing “the unconstitutional conduct, unlawful arrest, and the tortious conduct of Border Patrol and ICE agents,” said her daughter is healthy and growing. But she’s still dealing with the aftermath of her detention.

Footage of the arrest shows federal agents holding her hands behind her — despite guidance advising that officers generally not use physical restraints on pregnant people and that, if they do, they should keep a pregnant person’s hands in front.

Her husband has now been deported, and Alvarado has no income. She’s watching her savings dwindle and relying on her family to help care for her little girl. She said she was unsure if she’d have to pick up multiple jobs to make ends meet — and if so, who would be able to care for her infant. She remembers the terror she felt while in government custody.

“Every time I see a news or video, it does rewind in my head,” she said. “It does get me very emotional, seeing stuff like that.”

Victoria Petty, an attorney with the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area who is representing Rodriguez — the woman who suffered a miscarriage in detention — said that she first connected with her client’s husband in late August, about a month after his wife’s detention.

He had left Petty a voicemail and text explaining that his wife was pregnant in a detention center and that he was really worried about her. Days later, he called again. “He’s crying on the other line, and he's like, ‘She had a miscarriage. I don't know what to do. She's in the hospital. Help,’” Petty recalled.

Rodriguez described in court records being “unignorably hungry” inside the Bakersfield, California, detention facility and lacking prenatal health care and education for weeks after her pregnancy was confirmed. Eventually, she began to see brown discharge and was taken to an off-site hospital where, days later, health care providers confirmed she had miscarried.

Petty moved quickly to file a lawsuit claiming unconstitutional detention. Court documents show that upon release from the hospital, Rodriguez was placed in medical isolation at the ICE detention center.

“It was very scary. She was in pain. So after this really traumatic experience, and her going to the hospital and confirming that they did not see the fetus on the ultrasound — after all of that, they brought her back to the detention center and put her in medical isolation,” Petty said, adding that her client was distraught.

Petty said it’s hard to determine whether detention conditions caused or contributed to Rodriguez’ miscarriage, a very wanted first pregnancy. But, she said, it’s important to consider the stress of being suddenly detained in a van — her client is from Colombia; kidnappings and murders have left lasting scars on the Latin American nation — along with the strain and lack of food options in detention.

“These are the conditions that she was in when she was pregnant. And we cannot rule out that having been under that level of stress and fear and having that little care contributed to her pregnancy loss,” Petty said.

Heffernan, who has worked with several immigrants who were detained while pregnant, said she has seen pregnant immigrants get a few small accommodations: being placed in a lower bunk instead of the top bunk for sleep or getting extra milk with their meals and sometimes an extra sandwich or snack before bedtime.

Medical care, she said, can be “very haphazard and spotty,” with prenatal appointments often not happening on schedule.

“You do see people getting a prenatal visit here and there, but not in a timely fashion, and not according to the standard of care for people that are outside,” Heffernan said. “For instance, in a couple of people that I've been in contact with recently, one had been in detention for several months and had had no prenatal care at all. Another had had one visit.”

Pregnant immigrants are also more vulnerable to more severe cases of COVID-19, flu and other illnesses, which spread quickly in crowded places like detention centers.

There is an extensive list of best practices for detained pregnant and postpartum people, Sufrin said, including but not limited to regular access to comprehensive physical and mental health care, nutrition, the ability to exercise and adequate housing.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c2c79b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1800x945+0+128/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F1d%2Fa0%2F3fdc61284733bd03214f659f24b2%2Fice-detention-pregnancy-top.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 19:21:41.684690

A protest organized by The People's Forum, a group that says it advocates for working class and marginalized communities, is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Wednesday in Foley Square.

""We will NOT tolerate ICE's terror in our communities,"" the group wrote on social media.

How Tuesday's operation was carried out draws ire of many

The federal operation provided dramatic visuals. Chopper 2 flew over the scene as DHS investigators drove military-style trucks through Lower Manhattan escorted by armed federal agents.

That, in part, prompted protesters to make their way to 26 Federal Plaza, where the nine men were taken. The demonstration was peaceful, but those in attendance were clearly unnerved about what they saw earlier in the day.

""The manner in which ICE is going into areas and just wreaking havoc, causing unsafe communities — it's very obvious that this isn't making anyone safer,"" one protester said.

""Immigrants are an inherent part of the country. They are not the problem in this country,"" another protester said.

Elected officials were equally angered.

""This is not immigration enforcement. This is lawless terror designed to incite violence to create a pretext for Donald Trump to send the military into New York City,"" Rep. Dan Goldman said Wednesday. ""They are doing it to terrorize New Yorkers, to terrorize our communities, to install fear in New Yorkers. It is unacceptable and it must stop.""

In a post on X on Tuesday, Gov. Kathy Hochul said, ""[President Trump] claims he's targeting the 'worst of the worst.' Today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street. You don't make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers.""

""New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.

""Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals.""

Roberto Mosquera del Peral was one of five men sent to the small kingdom in southern Africa in mid-July as part of the expanding U.S. deportation program to Africa, which has been criticized by rights groups and lawyers, who say deportees are being denied due process and exposed to rights abuses.

Mosquera’s lawyer, Alma David, said in a statement sent to The Associated Press that he had been on a hunger strike for a week, and there were serious concerns over his health.

“My client is arbitrarily detained, and now his life is on the line,” David said. “I urge the Eswatini Correctional Services to provide Mr. Mosquera’s family and me with an immediate update on his condition and to ensure that he is receiving adequate medical attention. I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini.”

An Eswatini government spokesperson referred the AP, which requested comment, to a correctional services official, who didn’t immediately respond to calls and messages.

Mosquera was among a group of five men from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam and Yemen deported to Eswatini, an absolute monarchy ruled by a king who is accused of clamping down on human rights. The Jamaican man was repatriated to his home country last month, but the others have been kept at the prison for more than three months, while an Eswatini-based lawyer has launched a case against the government demanding they be given access to legal counsel.

Civic groups in Eswatini have also taken authorities to court to challenge the legality of holding foreign nationals in prison without charge. Eswatini said that the men would be repatriated, but have given no timeframe for any other repatriations.

U.S. authorities said they want to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Eswatini under the same program.

The men sent to Eswatini were criminals convicted of serious offenses, including murder and rape, and were in the U.S. illegally, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said. It said that Mosquera had been convicted of murder and other charges and was a gang member.

The men’s lawyers said they had all completed their criminal sentences in the U.S., and are now being held illegally in Eswatini, where they haven’t been charged with any offense.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has cast the third-country deportation program as a means to remove “illegal aliens” from American soil as part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, saying they have a choice to self-deport or be sent to a country like Eswatini.

The Trump administration has sent deportees to at least three other African nations — South Sudan, Rwanda and Ghana — since July under largely secretive agreements. It also has a deportation agreement with Uganda, although no deportations there have been announced.

New York-based Human Rights Watch said that it has seen documents that show that the U.S. is paying African nations millions of dollars to accept deportees. It said that the U.S. agreed to pay Eswatini $5.1 million to take up to 160 deportees and Rwanda $7.5 million to take up to 250 deportees.

Another 10 deportees were sent to Eswatini this month and are believed to be held at the same Matsapha Correctional Complex prison outside the administrative capital, Mbabane. Lawyers said that those men are from Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Cuba, Chad, Ethiopia and Congo.

Lawyers say the four men who arrived in Eswatini on a deportation flight in July haven’t been allowed to meet with an Eswatini lawyer representing them, and phone calls to their U.S.-based attorneys are monitored by prison guards. They have expressed concern that they know little about the conditions in which their clients are being held.

“I demand that Mr. Mosquera be permitted to meet with his lawyer in Eswatini,” David said in her statement. “The fact that my client has been driven to such drastic action highlights that he and the other 13 men must be released from prison. The governments of the United States and Eswatini must take responsibility for the real human consequences of their deal.”

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued a preliminary injunction in August calling for winding down operations at the detention center, but a three-judge panel of the Atlanta-based appellate court in September issued a stay of the preliminary injunction as an appeal of Williams’ decision plays out.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed the lawsuit this summer and were joined by the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. They allege violations of a federal law that requires an evaluation of potential environmental impacts before projects such as the detention facility can move forward.

The environmental groups on Oct. 10 urged the appeals court to reject pausing the appeal because of the government shutdown, saying an “indefinite stay” is improper.

The U.S. Department of Justice’s request, also filed Oct. 10, said its lawyers aren’t allowed to work during the shutdown.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the request said.

Wednesday’s order came a month after the three-judge panel agreed to the environmental groups’ request to speed up the case and directed oral arguments to be held in January.

The new order “means that the government is continuing to run this destructive facility while simultaneously arguing that it cannot defend these operations in court,” Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in an email.

“This is a disappointing turn of events, but we’ll be standing at the ready when they’re finally ready to face us in court,” she added.

Friends of the Everglades recently filed a lawsuit in Leon County circuit court alleging the state has improperly withheld public records, including documents about funding, related to the detention center.

House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., attacked the Trump administration's immigration efforts on Wednesday, which he claimed were opposed by Americans.

Jeffries' comments came during his near-daily government shutdown press conference in response to a reporter asking an unrelated question about whether Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) needed scaling back.

""We've all been very outspoken as it relates to the out-of-control behavior unleashed on law-abiding immigrant communities by masked agents hiding their identity and far too often violating the rule of law, often directed at people who are American citizens,"" the top House Democrat answered.

""It's all unacceptable, and it's one of the reasons why the American people have turned on Donald Trump and Republicans with respect to their extreme immigration policies,"" he said.

He then demanded the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) be held ""accountable for the overreach and the extremism that they're being subjected to in terms of what the American people are experiencing.""

""And yet we're seeing none of that accountability coming from Republicans,"" Jeffries continued. ""That's unfortunate, but Democrats will continue to make the case to the American people that this is all abnormal. So much of it is unlawful, and it's got to stop.""

FBI DIRECTOR KASH PATEL VOWS JUSTICE AFTER DHS AGENT'S VEHICLE RAMMED IN CHICAGO

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told Fox News Digital in response, ""ICE officers are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults because of unhinged rhetoric from activists and Democrat politicians smearing heroic ICE officers. Anyone who assaults or otherwise harms law enforcement officers will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""

Attacks on ICE have increased since Trump took office. A woman from North Texas was arrested this week in connection with a violent attack on an Alvarado ICE facility, according to CBS News.

FBI Director Kash Patel previously called the incident a ""planned and coordinated terrorist attack.""

Democrats have spent much of Trump's first year back in office criticizing the actions of ICE, in particular, homing in on accounts of American citizens being improperly detained by federal authorities.

The majority of Republicans have pushed back, arguing ICE has largely done the necessary work of cracking down on illegal immigration.

Jeffries' comments come after Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said the panel would be launching an ICE ""tracker"" to keep tabs on ""incidents"" the agency is involved in.

Oversight Democrats' spokesperson Sara Guerrero said in a statement, ""The tracker documents unconstitutional actions after they occur — it is not a live location tool. Creating this kind of investigatory record is routine and essential in any oversight inquiry.""

""We’re not tracking officers’ locations or putting anyone at risk. We’re publishing records to expose patterns of misconduct and to build a transparent public record for the American people. Our work will always protect the public, law enforcement, and the Constitution,"" she said.

Authorities say the deputy marshal was hit by a ricochet bullet fired by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer at the streamer, Carlitos Ricardo Parias, who was charged Tuesday night with assault on a federal officer. Both suffer non-life-threatening injuries.

Two views

Here is what the videos show:

One video shows a large amounts of smoke coming from a sedan that is boxed between two law enforcement vehicles.

For 25 seconds, smoke continues to rise from the car, as the sound of an engine revs up and down repeatedly.

Then an agent shouts “Shoot him with a pepper ball!”

As the sound from the vehicle goes quiet, 11 shots ring out in rapid succession. The video does not show who fired the shots.

A second video shows the aftermath of the shooting.

Several law enforcement officials surround the sedan. They eventually open the door and appear to pull someone out. The person screams in pain. Officer urge people out of frame to “get back.”

The suspect is placed against a wall and handcuffed. Several officers surround him as he periodically screams out.

A group of firefighters eventually approach the man and render aid.

Suspect hospitalized

Parias remained in the hospital Wednesday, pushing back his arraignment on a charge of assaulting a federal officer to an undetermined date.

In a federal criminal complaint, authorities accused Parias, 44, of ramming his car into agents’ vehicles after they boxed him in and tried to arrest him during an immigration enforcement operation.

Account of the feds

Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli said in a post on X that Parias rammed a Toyota Camry into the law enforcement vehicles in front of and behind him, “spun the tires, spewing smoke and debris into the air, causing the car to fishtail and causing agents to worry for their safety.”

An agent then opened fire, wounding Parias and a deputy U.S. marshal, who authorities said was hit with a ricochet bullet. Both are expected to recover, Essayli said.

In an affidavit, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations said that ICE and the United States Marshals Service had set up surveillance on Tuesday in the neighborhood around a home located on the 400 block of 20th Street, where they believed Parias could be found.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0354556/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5383x2826+0+381/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F6d%2Fd4%2F2f7c87404a18b4c2876b370588e3%2F1527030-me-federal-agent-shot-21.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 19:21:31.620209

U.S. Congresswoman Lateefah Simon’s offices did not immediately respond to questions seeking more information about the potential federal operation.
Also on Wednesday, someone posted on Reddit that ICE and CBP were planning an “invasion” of the Bay Area.
Local immigrant advocacy groups have been planning for stepped up federal operations in the Bay Area.","Social media was flooded Wednesday with rumors of federal agents being sent to Coast Guard Island in Alameda to prepare for massive immigration sweeps. Then the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a single, unnamed source “familiar with the operation,” that the Trump administration has deployed 100 federal agents, including Customs and Border Protection, to the Coast Guard Base in Alameda.

The New York Times confirmed the story after speaking with three people with direct knowledge of the operation, reporting today that Border Patrol agents are headed to the Bay Area as part of an immigration crackdown.

President Donald Trump’s recent threats to order the National Guard into San Francisco have had the whole region on edge, wondering if the Bay Area is about to experience the kind of chaos and violence that have accompanied similar actions in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and now Chicago and Portland, Oregon.

We contacted federal law enforcement agencies, local and state officials, police, members of congress, and others seeking solid information.

Here’s what we’ve learned.

Asked about whether the U.S Customs and Border Protection Agency is sending agents to the Coast Guard base in Alameda for an immigration operation, Jaime Ruiz, a CBP spokesperson emailed the following statement:

“As the Secretary said on Monday, DHS is targeting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens—including murderers, rapists, gang members, pedophiles, and terrorists—in cities such as Portland, Chicago, Memphis and San Francisco. As it does every day, DHS law enforcement will enforce the laws of our nation.”

A Coast Guard spokesperson, Petty Officer Graves, told us earlier today that Coast Guard facilities in Alameda are providing support to Customs and Border Protection, and he referred to an “operation” that’s underway. But he would not comment on that operation and said to contact CBP for more information.

“There’s no report I have yet of ICE agents being here,” Graves said about the Coast Guard’s Alameda base.

A Coast Guard spokesperson told the SF Standard, “Base Alameda is preparing to support CBP agents starting tomorrow as a place of operations.”

State Senator Jesse Arreguín, who represents Oakland, Berkeley, and Alameda, issued a statement earlier Wednesday confirming that a major immigration operation will soon begin.

“When similar deployments have occurred in other cities what we’ve seen are overly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that lead to protests and civil unrest. The President and his goons then point to the unrest they themselves created to justify their tactics and even send in the National Guard,” Arreguín said.

Arreguín urged Oakland and Bay Area residents to be cautious and peaceful if they plan to protest the Trump administration’s operation. “This administration has put their playbook on display and are seeking to create chaos in order to justify additional federal deployments. Don’t take the bait.”

The city of Alameda issued a statement clarifying that its police department “is not a part of this operation, and APD does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants.”

A spokesperson for Berkeley Mayor Adena Ishii referred a reporter to the city manager’s office, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon. U.S. Congresswoman Lateefah Simon’s offices did not immediately respond to questions seeking more information about the potential federal operation.

Rumors of some kind of large-scale immigration crackdown appears to have been first reported by a Youtuber who goes by “Hawk” on Wednesday. In a video, Hawk claimed to have spoken to someone with “close ties to the Coast Guard,” saying that 1,500 agents would be arriving at the Alameda Coast Guard base on Thursday, Oct. 23. Also on Wednesday, someone posted on Reddit that ICE and CBP were planning an “invasion” of the Bay Area. Those claims do not appear to be true at this time.

Local immigrant advocacy groups have been planning for stepped up federal operations in the Bay Area. The group Bay Resistance is hosting a Zoom training Wednesday at 6 p.m. where Bay Area residents can get training in rapid response, community safety, and legal observing and learn about a mobilization plan for the day federal agents arrive.

Meanwhile, in Santa Clara County the Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to raise physical barriers and lock gates to prevent federal immigration agents from using county property for surveillance and arrests. The county plans to put up signs to warn U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents away from those properties. The county is following Chicago’s lead to block immigration enforcement without a court order. Santa Clara County has already expanded a plan to coordinate a counter-response to ICE raids by offering legal aid, shelter, food, child care and other assistance to immigrants.

As a sanctuary city, Berkeley police and other city employees are mandated not to help ICE with an investigation, detention or arrest unless there is a valid, limited-in-scope court warrant signed by a district judge. The city also takes strides to limit the information it keeps about residents’ immigration status, and city employees are required to provide equal access to services regardless of immigration status. The Berkeley school district, UC Berkeley and Berkeley City College have similar policies.

The letter-writers added: We are deeply alarmed by the NPS’ recent changes to Stonewall National Monument.
Earlier this year, Miss Major spoke out against the Trump administration’s attempts to erase transgender history at Stonewall.
They keep continually trying to eradicate us,” Miss Major said in an interview with USA Today.","Dozens of Democratic members of Congress have signed an open letter addressed to the Trump administration, demanding that portions of LGBTQ history that were removed from the Stonewall National Monument be restored.

Back in February, the National Park Service (NPS) eliminated the words “queer” and “transgender” from the Stonewall National Monument website. The monument commemorates the Stonewall Uprising, a 1969 riot in New York City for gay liberation — led by transgender women of color — that laid the foundation for Pride celebrations today.

The decision to remove those references was reportedly made to comply with President Donald Trump’s anti-trans executive order, issued the previous month, which sought to “restore” references to supposed “biological truth” within the federal government — a false notion that rejects the widely accepted scientific fact that gender is not binary or solely determined by a person’s sexual organs.

Last week, 72 Democratic lawmakers in Congress signed an open letter demanding that references to transgender and queer people at the Stonewall National Monument be restored — including Rep. Mark Takano (D-California) and Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-New York), leaders within the Congressional Equality Caucus, as well as Rep. Dan Goldman (D-New York), who spearheaded the effort.

Their letter, addressed to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Acting National Park Service Director Jessica Bowron, noted that the monument is meant to honor “the legacy of the Stonewall Rebellion and the critical role it played in the LGBTQIA+ civil rights movement.”

“This pivotal moment would not have happened without the courage of trans activists, particularly transgender women of color such as Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, who were on the front lines and fought for gay and transgender rights,” the letter stated.

The letter-writers added:

We are deeply alarmed by the NPS’ recent changes to Stonewall National Monument. … This erasure of transgender and queer Americans from the history of Stonewall—or from any part of our national narrative — is a blatant attack on the integrity of public history. The history of Stonewall cannot be told without the stories of transgender Americans.

The letter-writers then expressed concerns that the administration would alter the history behind other monuments, including those relating to Japanese internment camps during World War II, the U.S. genocide of Indigenous Peoples in the Americas, and the enslavement of Black people. Efforts to reshape historical narratives to conform to a political agenda “risk undermining public trust and the credibility of the Park Service,” they wrote.

The signers also said they were “especially troubled with the ongoing implementation of NPS’ June 9th memo that requires all NPS units to post signage to encourage the public to offer feedback on any information that they feel portrays American history and landscapes in a negative light.”

“The lack of transparency on how NPS plans to rewrite ‘negative’ content and incorporate visitor feedback is deeply concerning,” the letter-writers warned. “We must reject any attempts to gloss over or otherwise rewrite difficult chapters of our history.”

The letter from lawmakers came just days after Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, a transgender activist and veteran of the Stonewall uprising, passed away at age 78.

Earlier this year, Miss Major spoke out against the Trump administration’s attempts to erase transgender history at Stonewall.

“It’s just terrible. They keep continually trying to eradicate us,” Miss Major said in an interview with USA Today.

“Being transgender is not the road to hell,” she went on, adding that those trying to erase history were “blinded” by people simply living their lives.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_1022-stonewall.jpg,N,,2025-10-23 01:56:36.605735

“Every New Yorker has the right to live without fear or intimidation,” James wrote in a statement announcing the portal.

“If you witnessed and documented ICE activity yesterday, I urge you to share that footage with my office. We are committed to reviewing these reports and assessing any violations of law.”

The form offers spaces to submit images and video footage of the raid, as well as a place to indicate location information. Before submitting, users must check a box that indicates that “the Attorney General may use any documents, photographs, or videos I provided in a public document, including in a legal proceeding or public report or statement.”

The Guardian has contacted James’s office for more information.

The Chinatown raid, which onlookers say involved more than 50 federal agents, took place in a well-known area of Manhattan where counterfeit handbags, accessories, jewelry and other goods are sold daily en masse – often to tourists.

Videos of Tuesday’s raid show multiple masked and armed federal agents zip-tying and detaining a man, and shoving away onlookers. Throngs of New Yorkers followed the agents through the streets and down the sidewalks. An armored military vehicle was also seen rolling through the city streets.

Outrage over the ICE raid quickly spread – all three mayoral candidates condemned the raid, as did Governor Kathy Hochul.

“Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop,” mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani wrote on X.

New York City immigrant rights groups spoke out as well.

“ICE descended on Manhattan’s Chinatown with military-style vehicles, masked agents and riot gear to target street vendors trying to make a living. This operation had nothing to do with public safety and everything to do with terrorizing immigrant families and communities,” said Murad Awawdeh, president of the New York Immigrant Coalition.

""His criminal history shows he has a history of habitual driving offenses and has been charged multiple times with driving without insurance, driving without a valid license, and speeding.

""During his arrest he did not comply with instructions from the officers and attempted to flee in his vehicle and backed into a government vehicle. He will remain in ICE custody pending removal.

""This is nothing more than a desperate Hail Mary attempt to keep a criminal illegal alien in our country.

Over 100 federal agents have been dispatched to the Bay Area.

Those agents are members of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and have been sent to enact President Trump's anti-immigration crackdown.

There are multiple resources for undocumented immigrants to seek legal help, as well as to educate people on their rights if ICE agents show up at their door.

Over 100 federal immigration agents are headed to the Bay Area.

The San Francisco Chronicle on Wednesday cited an anonymous source who said over 100 agents were sent to the Coast Guard Base Alameda and will begin arriving Thursday.

KTVU independently confirmed that information with an anonymous congressional source, as well as with U.S. Rep Lateefah Simon.

The City of Alameda released a statement that the Alameda Police Department will not be taking part in the federal government's operations, adding that APD does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants. The city also advised those who see ICE activity or who ""need assistance"" to call the Alameda County Immigration Legal and Education Partnership at 510-241-4011 for rapid response and immigration legal services.

""Everyone has the right to peacefully protest, but we urge people to avoid direct interaction with federal law enforcement,"" the city said. ""The City of Alameda is committed to the values of dignity, inclusivity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of ethnic or national origin, gender, race, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, or immigration status.""

KTVU reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE, CBP, and Gov. Gavin Newsom and is awaiting a response.

The backstory:

President Donald Trump has made clear his intentions to carry out mass deportations and to end birthright citizenship, which has guaranteed that U.S.-born babies are citizens regardless of their parents’ status.

In addition, the Trump administration announced on earlier this year that it would allow federal immigration agencies to make arrests at schools, churches and hospitals, ending a policy that had been in effect since 2011.

Immigrant rights organizations, such as the California Immigrant Policy Center, have put together a resources guide to defend community members ""from threats and attacks"" under the Trump administration.

No matter who is president, everyone living in the United States has certain basic rights under the U.S. Constitution, immigrant rights groups say, and undocumented immigrants have these rights, too.

""Knowing your rights calms fears in some respect,"" said Bill Hing, director of the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic at the University of San Francisco. ""Stay silent. You don't have to open your door for an ICE officer unless that officer has a warrant [signed by a judge.] But honestly, there is a lot of anxiety in the community. And I think that the Trump strategy is to instill fear. And unfortunately, that's happened.""

Hing suggested undocumented people seek the counsel of ""competent, honest"" legal counsel or an immigration consultant to see if there is indeed a pathway to lawful permanent resident status. Some of those lawyers can be found through the National Immigration Legal Services Directory.

What to do if ICE shows up at your door

What you can do:

Here are some tips if ICE shows up at your door:

The right to remain silent – it's OK to refuse to speak to ICE. Immigrant rights advocates say not to answer any questions including where you were born or how you entered the United States.

The National Immigration Law Center advises that people carry a know-your-rights card, also known as a ""red card, or ""tarjetas rojas,"" as well as any valid immigration document, and show them if an immigration officer stops you. Red cards in Spanish can be found at the bottom of this page, or you can order one here. Know-your-rights cards can be printed here.

The center also advises that you not open your door simply because ICE agents tell you to. ICE officials must have a warrant signed by a judge, not a deportation officer, to enter your home. To be valid, a warrant must have your correct name and address on it, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Ask the person at your door to slip the warrant under the door to see who it was signed by. If it was not signed by a judge, the Asian Law Caucus said to tell the officers you do not consent to a search and call your rapid response hotline. (*See numbers below)

Immigrants also have a right to speak to their lawyers, and advocates say not to sign any document before speaking to a lawyer. You can simply say, ""I need to speak to my attorney."" A list of lawyers can be found here.

Immigration advocates advise that parents tell ICE agents that they have children if they're worried about being arrested.

Create a safety plan such as memorizing the phone number of family and friends you can call if you're arrested, figure out who will watch your children if you're detained, and keep important documents, like birth certificates, in a safe place that family and friends can access if necessary. The Immigrant Legal Resource Center put together a step-by-step family preparedness plan.

Make sure your loved ones know how to find you in an ICE detention center by looking online. Be sure they know your alien registration number.

Do not carry documents about your country of origin.

Do not carry fake immigration documents or IDs.

Report and document raids and arrests. One hotline is the United We Dream’s hotline to report a raid: 1-844-363-1423. Or texts can be sent to 877877.

If ICE calls or sends a letter to reschedule a check-in, that can often mean they want to detain you. You can call the Asian Law Caucus at 415-896-1701 for legal advice and updates on whether raids are happening elsewhere.

If you feel your rights have been violated, write down everything you remember, including the officers' badges and patrol cars numbers, which agency the officers work for. Get contact information for witnesses. If you get injured, the ACLU reminds you to take pictures of your injuries and file a written complaint with the agency's internal affairs unit.

In addition, the California Immigrant Policy Center compiled a list of ""rapid response networks,"" which are community-based organizations that respond to emergencies such as immigration enforcement, throughout the state.

Arreguín urged Oakland and Bay Area residents to be cautious and peaceful if they plan to protest the Trump administration’s operation.
Also on Wednesday, someone posted on Reddit that ICE and CBP were planning an “invasion” of the Bay Area.
Local immigrant advocacy groups have been planning for stepped up federal operations in the Bay Area.","Social media was flooded today with rumors of federal agents being sent to Coast Guard Island in Alameda to prepare for massive immigration sweeps. Then the San Francisco Chronicle reported, citing a single, unnamed source “familiar with the operation,” that the Trump administration has deployed 100 federal agents, including Customs and Border Protection, to the Coast Guard Base in Alameda.

The New York Times confirmed the story after speaking with three people with direct knowledge of the operation, reporting today that Border Patrol agents are headed to the Bay Area as part of an immigration crackdown.

President Donald Trump’s recent threats to order the National Guard into San Francisco have had the whole region on edge, wondering if the Bay Area is about to experience the kind of chaos and violence that have accompanied similar actions in Los Angeles, Washington D.C., and now Chicago and Portland, OR.

The Oaklandside has contacted federal law enforcement agencies, local and state officials, police, members of congress, and others seeking solid information.

Here’s what we’ve learned.

So far, there’s no official confirmation that a major immigration operation is about to unfold in the Bay Area. But this could soon change.

A Coast Guard spokesperson, Petty Officer Graves, told The Oaklandside earlier today that Coast Guard facilities in Alameda are providing support to Customs and Border Protection, and he referred to an “operation” that’s underway. But he would not comment on that operation and said to contact CBP for more information.

“There’s no report I have yet of ICE agents being here,” Graves said about the Coast Guard’s Alameda base.

Shortly after, the SF Standard reported that a Coast Guard spokesperson confirmed the deployment, saying, “Base Alameda is preparing to support CBP agents starting tomorrow as a place of operations.”

An ICE spokesperson declined to answer questions from The Oaklandside about what’s happening, and also referred us to CBP.

A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection acknowledged receiving questions from The Oaklandside but did not respond.

State Senator Jesse Arreguín, who represents Oakland, Berkeley, and Alameda, issued a statement earlier today confirming that a major immigration operation will soon begin.

“When similar deployments have occurred in other cities what we’ve seen are overly aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that lead to protests and civil unrest. The President and his goons then point to the unrest they themselves created to justify their tactics and even send in the National Guard,” Arreguín said.

Arreguín urged Oakland and Bay Area residents to be cautious and peaceful if they plan to protest the Trump administration’s operation. “This administration has put their playbook on display and are seeking to create chaos in order to justify additional federal deployments. Don’t take the bait.”

The city of Alameda issued a statement clarifying that its police department “is not a part of this operation, and APD does not enforce federal immigration laws or related civil warrants.”

Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee and U.S. Congresswoman Lateefah Simon’s offices did not immediately respond to questions from The Oaklandside seeking more information about the potential federal operation.

Rumors of some kind of large-scale immigration crackdown appears to have been first reported by a Youtuber who goes by “Hawk” on Wednesday. In a video, Hawk claimed to have spoken to someone with “close ties to the Coast Guard,” saying that 1,500 agents would be arriving at the Alameda Coast Guard base on Thursday, Oct. 23. Also on Wednesday, someone posted on Reddit that ICE and CBP were planning an “invasion” of the Bay Area. Those claims do not appear to be true at this time.

Local immigrant advocacy groups have been planning for stepped up federal operations in the Bay Area. The group Bay Resistance is hosting a Zoom training tonight at 6 p.m. where Bay Area residents can get training in rapid response, community safety, and legal observing and learn about a mobilization plan for the day federal agents arrive.

In 2023, MALDEF filed a challenge to STCU’s policy in federal court, claiming it violated federal and state civil rights law.
However, a U.S. District Judge dismissed the federal claim and the case against the credit union.
The dealership later informed Ayala that STCU had refused the loan due to her DACA status.
Founded in 1934, the credit union serves over 274,000 members across 38 locations.","PASCO, Wash.– A Latino civil rights organization is challenging, for a second time, the discriminatory policies of a Spokane, Washington-based credit union for unlawfully denying DACA recipients financial services based on their citizenship or immigration status.

MALDEF (Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund) and Edwardo Morfin, of the Kennewick-based Morfin Law Firm, filed a lawsuit in state court against Spokane Teachers Credit Union (STCU) on behalf of Ana Ayala, 28, a recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). The lawsuit argues that the credit union’s policy violates Washington state civil rights law prohibiting discrimination based on citizenship or immigration status. In 2023, MALDEF filed a challenge to STCU’s policy in federal court, claiming it violated federal and state civil rights law. However, a U.S. District Judge dismissed the federal claim and the case against the credit union. However, the district court did not rule on the state civil rights law claim. A year later, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the district court’s decision. This time, attorneys argue that the credit union’s policy violates the Washington Law Against Discrimination (WLAD), which bars discrimination based on sex, race, color, citizenship, and immigration status.

“Institutions don’t get a pass for violating anti-discrimination law when they make it so clear that they discriminate that no one actually follows through on applying,” said Thomas A. Saenz, MALDEF president and general counsel. “Clearly discriminatory policies violate the law, full stop; we believe that courts will understand that state law bars discrimination, with no immunity for discrimination so notorious that targets of the discrimination refuse to apply.”

In August 2023, Ayala purchased a used car from a dealership. Some weeks later, the car dealership attempted to sell the loan to STCU. The dealership told Ayala that STCU requested additional information and documentation, including her Social Security number. As a DACA recipient, Ayala is authorized to work in the U.S. and has a work-only Social Security number. The dealership later informed Ayala that STCU had refused the loan due to her DACA status.

Internal communications between the dealer and STCU confirmed that the credit union received Ayala’s social security information but opted to deny the loan nevertheless, requiring proof of permanent residency or citizenship, according to the lawsuit. A letter sent to Ayala by STCU also stated that the reason for denying the loan was “incomplete identity information.” Another credit union purchased Ayala’s loan at a higher interest rate.

“Regardless of where or how the loan originated, STCU discriminated against Ayala when it categorically refused to consider accepting the loan because of her work-only Social Security number,” said Luis Lozada, MALDEF staff attorney. “Allowing this behavior will allow financial institutions to engage in discrimination and avoid liability by arguing that an applicant was never denied credit.”

STCU is a member-owned credit union that serves the state of Washington and North Idaho. Founded in 1934, the credit union serves over 274,000 members across 38 locations.

The lawsuit was filed in the Superior Court of Washington in Franklin County and seeks class certification.

“Just because this doesn’t seem to be a big deal to STCU, it’s a huge deal for people like me,” said Ayala. “I am here doing everything I can to make sure I’m perfect in the eyes of the law, and I still get discriminated against. I’m human and should be treated equally as everyone else. This is bigger than me not being approved for a car loan; this is about not discriminating against anyone, no matter your status. I hope STCU can find it in themselves to give people like me a chance, especially when we try our hardest to be perfect for this society.”

This is the 24th lawsuit filed by MALDEF since 2017 that challenges the policies of financial institutions that discriminate against DACA recipients.",https://www.maldef.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/cropped-MALDEF_Mark_Favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-22 18:02:01.715578

At a hearing on that request, Cobb asked if the case would be moot if there was a government lapse.
The lawsuit, filed in July, argued that the federal government had illegally denied members of Congress entry to ICE detention facilities after a flurry of high-profile clashes and denials of entry.
Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said ICE officials denied him entry Oct. 13 to do oversight of the ICE facility in Broadview, Ill., just days after a video showed a violent detention of a 15-year-old constituent.
“Once again, the Trump Administration slammed the door on transparency and accountability,” Krishnamoorthi said in a news release.","The Trump administration has claimed the partial government shutdown also means the end of a requirement that Immigration and Customs Enforcement give congressional access to detention facilities for oversight visits.

The government made the argument in a legal clash with Democratic lawmakers, who had filed a lawsuit against ICE over access to real-time inspections of the facilities and new department guidance that requires at least seven days’ advance notice of a visit.

The lawmakers based that lawsuit on Section 527, a provision included in the fiscal 2024 spending law and applied to funding in the continuing resolution for fiscal 2025, which states that no funds can be used to prevent members or their staffs from entering immigration detention facilities for oversight.

But now the Trump administration says the provision expired on Oct. 1 along with the spending law, and ongoing spending is “not subject to the expired general provision known as Section 527,” according to a notice and declaration from ICE official Ralph Ferguson.

“With the expiration of the FY2025 Continuing Resolution, ICE is no longer using for detention operations (including the adoption and implementation of the Congressional visitation protocols at issue in this action) any funds that were appropriated subject to Section 527,” Ferguson states in the declaration.

The government’s stance that the section has expired, if applied more broadly, could extend to some of the dozens, and sometimes hundreds, of provisions in spending bills that define how the federal government can use funds, commonly known as “riders.”

The same appropriations law includes provisions such as how DHS can lease or renovate buildings, how money can be moved between accounts, and prohibiting alterations on the oath of citizenship and the spending of government funds on pornography.

The government filed the notice in the lawsuit as Judge Jia M. Cobb of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia was deciding whether to grant a request for her to temporarily halt the new DHS guidance on lawmaker visits based on Section 527. At a hearing on that request, Cobb asked if the case would be moot if there was a government lapse.

Ferguson, in his declaration, said that while ICE is incurring obligations for detention in advance of a fiscal 2026 spending bill that reopens the government, that is not subject to the expired Section 527.

And he said certain ICE operations are being funding through money in the reconciliation package, “a distinct source of funding with defined amounts for specific purposes.”

The package signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4 included $45 billion to ICE for expansion of detention capacity, which some critics said did not have adequate checks on how DHS used the funds.

While the Trump administration has made several moves during the shutdown that raised questions — such as diverted military appropriations to ensure paychecks for the troops went out on time — this appears to be the first time it has argued spending bill provisions are not in force during a shutdown.

David A. Super, a Georgetown Law professor who focuses on administrative and constitutional law, called the Trump administration’s argument “remarkably aggressive” and said it would mean “appropriations riders will cease to have a great deal of meaning in many important settings.”

Super said that normally the restriction would keep ICE from using any funds — or anything bought with those funds — from blocking congressional access.

It is “fairly unlikely” that denying entry to members of Congress would not use restricted funds, “because excluding someone requires you to use a computer that may have been bought with those funds, or put up a barrier that was bought with those funds, or threaten to arrest someone with a bullhorn that was bought with those funds,” Super said.

Super also said that in prior government shutdowns, the government has operated to largely keep the status quo, rather than assert broad new authority.

In response to the government filing, Cobb ordered both sides to file a report by Oct. 27 on the issue, giving a chance for the lawmakers to respond, as well as asking whether the legal challenge should be paused during the shutdown.

The lawsuit, filed in July, argued that the federal government had illegally denied members of Congress entry to ICE detention facilities after a flurry of high-profile clashes and denials of entry.

Bay Area Advocates Head To Court To Halt Trump Administration’s Immigration Policies

In a series of recent class action lawsuits, Bay Area civil rights advocates are calling on the federal courts to halt what they call illegal Trump administration policies that are leading to the arrest of asylum seekers, victims of human trafficking and people attending immigration court hearings.

The three lawsuits filed in federal courts in California in recent weeks are part of a larger legal pushback by advocacy groups across the country challenging the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.

At a time when Homeland Security officials tout arrests of “heinous” criminals they call the “worst of the worst,” the lawsuits put the focus on the ways U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has targeted vulnerable people such as domestic violence survivors and those who’ve fled persecution, said UC Davis Law Professor Kevin Johnson. “These are serious constitutional and statutory claims … challenging the efforts of the Trump administration to tighten the immigration enforcement machinery around non-citizens,” he said.

State, County Fund $75 Million Expansion Of Mental Health Care In Humboldt County

Humboldt County is getting tens of millions of dollars for mental health care in an effort to relieve pressure on emergency departments and jails serving those in crisis.

State Senator Mike McGuire this week announced $75 million in state and county funding to expand mental health services in Humboldt County. The money will be used to build a new 20-bed inpatient psychiatric center in Eureka, set to open in 2030. The building will replace the 58-year-old Sempervirens Psychiatric Health Facility.

The Mad River Crisis Triage Center in Arcata also received $5.5 million for a 43-bed facility. The center previously received $12.4 million in contributions from the state, county, local hospitals and donors. The Sorrel Leaf Healing Center in Eureka will also open the region’s first children’s crisis residential program with $750,000 in funding. The program will be located on a 13-acre therapeutic farm.

The majority of them failed to meet ICE’s physical or academic standards, according to the data.
“There is absolutely concern that some people are slipping through the cracks,” the current DHS official said.
As part of the effort, ICE shortened the training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Georgia from 13 weeks to eight weeks.
Fewer than 10 of the new recruits were dismissed because ICE training leaders learned from the recruits during the training program that they had pending criminal charges, failed their drug test or were otherwise considered a safety concern, the officials said.","WASHINGTON — Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed new recruits into its training program before they have completed the agency’s vetting process, an unusual sequence of events as the agency rushes to hire federal immigration officers to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy, one current and two former Homeland Security Department officials told NBC News.

ICE officials only later discovered that some of these recruits failed drug testing, have disqualifying criminal backgrounds or don’t meet the physical or academic requirements to serve, the sources said.

Staff at ICE’s training academy in Brunswick, Georgia, recently discovered one recruit had previously been charged with strong arm robbery and battery stemming from a domestic violence incident, the current DHS official said. They’ve also found as recently as this month that some recruits going through the six-week training course had not submitted fingerprints for background checks, as ICE’s hiring process requires, the current and former DHS officials said.

Per ICE policy, applicants are required to pass a drug test and undergo a security vetting through ICE’s human resources office prior to showing up for the training course. The former officials said that process was more strictly adhered to before a hiring surge that began this summer. That process was meant to weed out disqualified candidates before they would be sent to training.

Since the surge began, the agency has dismissed more than 200 new recruits while in training for falling short of its hiring requirements, according to recently collected internal ICE data reviewed by NBC News.

The majority of them failed to meet ICE’s physical or academic standards, according to the data. Just under 10 recruits were dismissed for criminal charges, failing to pass drug tests or safety concerns that should have been flagged in a background check prior to arriving at training, the data indicated and the current and former DHS officials confirmed.

The officials said there is growing concern that in the Trump administration’s race to expand the number of ICE agents to 10,000 by the end of the year, the agency could miss red flags in the backgrounds of some new recruits and inadvertently hire them.

“There is absolutely concern that some people are slipping through the cracks,” the current DHS official said. The official said many of the issues that have been flagged during training only surface because the recruits admitted they did not submit to fingerprinting or drug testing prior to arriving.

“What about the ones who don’t admit it?” the official said.

In a statement to NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security said most of its new recruits are former law enforcement officers and former ICE officers who go through a different process.

“The figures you reference are not accurate and reflect a subset of candidates in initial basic academy classes,” said DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin. “The vast majority of new officers brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy. This population is expected to account for greater than 85% of new hires. Prior-service hires follow streamlined validation but remain subject to medical, fitness, and background requirements.”

The Atlantic reported this week on the struggle some ICE recruits have had with meeting the agency's physical fitness requirements. The broader scope of issues and specific data have not been previously reported.

ICE has been under pressure from the White House to increase hiring with the funding designated by Congress in the sweeping tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law on July 4. The agency has frequently lagged behind the White House’s arrest goal of 3,000 per day, which they have attributed to a lack of manpower.

As part of the effort, ICE shortened the training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Georgia from 13 weeks to eight weeks. The training was later shortened to six weeks, the DHS official said.

Recruits also are supposed to attest that they can pass ICE’s physical fitness test, which includes sit-ups, pull-ups, and running one-and-a-half miles in under 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

Darius Reeves, who recently left his position as ICE field office director in Baltimore, said he believes the agency’s Aug. 6 decision to waive age limits so that older people can join has led to more recruits failing the physical test.

“These new recruits are dropping like flies,” Reeves said in an interview after speaking with colleagues seeking to bring new hires into the agency. “And rightly so, it makes sense. We’re going to drop the age requirements, of course this was going to happen.”

Nearly half of new recruits who’ve arrived for training at FLETC over the past three months were later sent home because they could not pass the written exam, according to the data. The academic requirement includes an exam where officers are allowed to consult their textbooks and notes at the end of a legal course on the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Fourth Amendment, which outlines when officers can and cannot conduct searches and seizures.

A slightly smaller group was dismissed because they failed the physical fitness test or had medical challenges, though some of those sent home had made clear on their application that they could not meet ICE’s physical requirements but were sent to training anyway, the current and former DHS officials said.

Fewer than 10 of the new recruits were dismissed because ICE training leaders learned from the recruits during the training program that they had pending criminal charges, failed their drug test or were otherwise considered a safety concern, the officials said.

The three sources said the agency’s human resources office is overwhelmed with more than 150,000 new applicants that have applied since ICE began offering $50,000 signing bonuses in August. The HR office is rushing to clear new recruits, which they believe is leading to mistakes.

“They are trying to push everyone through, and the vetting process is not what it should be,” said one of the former DHS officials with knowledge of the agency’s hiring.

The current DHS official likened the pressure on ICE’s human resources employees to clear recruits to “asking them to pull a rabbit out of a hat.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251021-ice-recruit-ch-1629-fb41af.jpg",N,,2025-10-22 17:17:12.481530

But it will require a lot more public outcry to defend America’s disappeared and preserve diversity in this country.
Congress has been largely silent (though it recently announced an inquiry into ICE treatment of U.S. citizens).","The Trump administration aspires to deport a million people in its first year of office. The president has also spoken of the more ambitious goal of deporting 15-20 million undocumented people overall, even if that category probably covers only 14 million folks. The discrepancy of a couple million people shouldn’t bother Trump. He’s happy to deport those with green cards, H-1B visas, and even American citizens.

Deporting a million people in a year is a heavy lift. The previous record, 409,849 people, was during the Obama administration, as part of the 1.5 million deportations he conducted in his first term. Trump, no doubt, wants to best Obama in this category, since he’s determined to outshine the former president in every respect, even the dubious ones.

Despite all the high-profile seizures by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the deals to dump Venezuelans to Salvadoran prisons, and the truly crazy efforts to send people to countries they’ve never even visited like Eswatini and South Sudan, the Trump administration has managed to deport only about 350,000 people through the end of August. That includes the 200,000 by ICE and the rest by Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard, plus some self-deportations. Another 60,000 are languishing in ICE detention centers. The government is currently monitoring about 180,000 families and individuals in its Alternatives to Detention program, which may end up becoming a Preparation for Deportation program.

Most of the people currently in detention—over 70 percent—have never committed any crime, which undermines the claim by the Trump administration that he’s going after the “bad hombres.”

Detention is pretty much a fast track to deportation. After all, detainees often don’t have access to lawyers. As The American Prospect reports, “ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate their detainees from both their families and their lawyers, limiting their ability to get out of their predicaments and increasing misery and hopelessness.” One immigration lawyer told me that some of his clients have disappeared for several days in ICE detention—and these included people who were willing to self-deport.

Trump is not close to meeting his ambitious deportation goals. That’s no comfort to all the immigrants whose lives he has already upended.

ICE Is Not Nice

The scenes involving the round-up of refugees and migrants have been harrowing. Consider this description:

Buses backed up to apartment buildings and were filled with screaming, crying people. Hospital beds were emptied. A cancer patient operated on the previous day was carried away. One woman gave birth while police waited to haul off mother and baby. Younger children were permitted to be left behind, and many parents desperately accepted that choice in the hope that neighbors or orphanages would take them in.

Oh, I’m sorry, I got mixed up. That’s a description of the French police rounding up 13,000 Jewish refugees in 1942 at the behest of their Nazi overseers, as reported by David Wyman in his seminal book, The Abandonment of the Jews.

Here, by comparison, are three snapshots of recent ICE actions:

In Louisiana and Florida:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have in recent days deported the Cuban-born mother of a 1-year-old girl — separating them indefinitely — and three children ages 2, 4 and 7 who are U.S. citizens along with their Honduran-born mothers, their lawyers said Saturday.

In Chicago:

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them. Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

In New York:

On the morning of September 4, dozens of masked federal agents raided a snack bar factory in the small town of Cato, New York. They claimed there was a “violent felon” in the plant, but proceeded to siphon off and hold anyone who looked Latinx. At least 69 workers were initially detained, with 57 still in custody or deported, though some say that could be an undercount. There are multiple reports of aggression — knees on necks, blows to heads — used during the raid.

This is happening not just to the undocumented and those on the rock-strewn path to citizenship. Quite a few American citizens have also been caught up in the ICE dragnet. At least 170 have been detained, according to ProPublica:

Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched. About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.

Much of Trump’s domestic and foreign policy can be understood only by examining them through the lens of his obsession with deporting people and restricting immigration from non-white parts of the world. The question remains: how many laws will the Trump administration break and how many crimes will it commit in this effort to make America predominantly white again?

German citizens failed to stop the Nazis. Will Americans stand up and be counted?

Trump’s Immigration-Obsessed Foreign Policy

In exchange for a payment of about $5 million, the tiny country of Eswatini in southern Africa has agreed to receive up to 160 deportees from a variety of countries. Human rights groups in Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, have challenged the arrangement in court. A U.S. District Court judge also blocked the removal of deportees to third countries back in April, but the Supreme Court lifted that ban in June.

The $5 million is only part of the sweetheart deal. In August, the Trump administration waived all tariffs on Eswatini goods entering the United States—in contrast to the 30 percent rate that South Africa will be paying. A number of countries hoping for tariff reductions or similarly favorable treatment from the Trump administration— Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kosovo, Panama, Rwanda, South Sudan—have also accepted the transport of deportees.

Eswatini does have its limits. It refused to accept Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national that the Trump administration sent to a prison in El Salvador. Garcia was freed and sent back to the States, only to be arrested again by the U.S. government and charged with human trafficking. Afraid that Garcia will be released by court order, the Trump administration is scrambling to find some country that will take him. Garcia is living proof of the administration’s lies—contrary to what Trump has said, he is not a gang member or a human trafficker. No wonder Trump wants him out of the country.

El Salvador has been an enthusiastic backer of Trump’s deportation plans. The country received $5 million to house deportees like Garcia in its horrific prisons. In addition, the State Department recently gave the country its highest safety rating, ahead of France and Spain. Trump has also backed Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s bid to become the country’s leader for life. Finally, the country faces a mere 10 percent tariff on its goods, Trump’s lowest tier.

In one of the least savory parts of the arrangement with El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio cut a deal with Bukele to return several members of the MS-13 gang who were cooperating with U.S. authorities. Bukele wanted them back because they had information about members of his administration who had cut their own deals with the country’s various gangs. It’s best to keep your enemies close, as the expression goes, particularly if you can put them in a dangerous high-security prison.

The immigration issue also affects relations with Venezuela, where the Trump administration has used the threat of Tren de Aragua, and the alleged inroads the gang has made in U.S. society, to step up its efforts to topple the government of Nicolas Maduro.

Trump has attempted to tilt immigration policy in favor of English speakers and white people more generally, even as the overall quotas for immigrants are radically reduced from 125,000 per year to 7,500. Among the proposals considered by the administration is one that would give preference to such groups as Europeans who support the radical right and white Afrikaners from South Africa. The overall purpose is a reduction in American diversity because, as one of the internal proposals argues, “The sharp increase in diversity has reduced the level of social trust essential for the functioning of a democratic polity.”

The administration has also radically increased the fee for a work permit—the H-1B visa—to $100,000. Although there are some exemptions to the new fee, it is clearly designed to restrict entrance to the United States to the wealthy.

Taken together, Trump has treated the “shithole” companies he identified in his first term—the poorer countries of the Global South—as dumping grounds for undesirable elements. And he has put a sign on America’s front door that reads: Wealthy, Christian, Right-Wing Whites Only.

Barack Obama wanted to create an administration that looked like America. Donald Trump wants to create an America that looks like his administration.

How Deportations Shape Domestic Policy

Trump knows a hot-button issue when he touches one, and immigration remains a great way to defeat Democrats who, however anti-immigration some of them have become, will never stoop to the race-baiting lows that Trump uses to wow his supporters. The invading “army” of migrants approaching the Mexico border, the fictitious pet-eaters of Springfield, OH, the “murderers” and “rapists” from points south responsible for all the crime in America: these mendacious memes propelled Trump to victory in 2024.

His immigration policies are no surprise: they were all laid out in detail in Project 2025: stopping refugee resettlement; ending Temporary Protect Status for Haitians, Venezuelans, and others; ending visas for foreign students. Trump has gone further. Even Project 2025 didn’t propose revoking birthright citizenship and ignoring the constitution.

Trump has put ICE raids at the center of his approach, but there has been pushback from Democratic-controlled cities and states. So, the president is sending in the National Guard to ensure greater access and mobility for ICE agents. The use of the U.S. military for domestic operations is unprecedented, of course, and several judges have ruled the president’s actions unconstitutional. Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress “rebellion,” which would allow him to use the military to impose civilian law (his government’s laws). It’s not quite martial law—which is the imposition of military laws on civilians—but it certainly aims in that direction (and the two may well be conflated in Trump’s mind).

ICE, meanwhile, has received a huge surge in funding—$170 billion in new money—at a time of cutbacks in virtually all non-military parts of the federal government. If ICE and associated agencies constituted a military, it would be the thirteenth largest one in the world, as Sarah Lazare and Lindsay Koshgarian point out. The militarization of the United States, at the expense of social welfare, is now directed not just at China or securing access to critical raw materials: it is directed at the U.S. population.

Trump is attacking diversity more generally, as the changes in federal immigration policy suggest. Because birthright citizenship has changed the demographics of the United States, its repeal has been a priority for white nationalists, and they have also cheered Trump’s moves in this direction. Meanwhile, the president is going after diversity in federal institutions, federal grantmaking, and across the U.S. educational system.

At the moment, lawyers and judges are the thin line that holds back the lawlessness of the Trump administration. A few civic groups like the Immigration Defense Project and Freedom for Immigrants are fighting the administration. But it will require a lot more public outcry to defend America’s disappeared and preserve diversity in this country.

As Bad as Nazis?

The Nazis were also obsessed with the diversity of German society in the 1930s. They ultimately decided not just to stigmatize and imprison Jews, Roma, homosexuals, and others. The Nazis killed them in huge numbers.

Trump and his white nationalist allies are currently at the stigmatize and deport stage. They’re content for the moment to let the killing take place elsewhere. The administration is not only erecting higher walls against refugees and immigrants—leading to more deaths among the desperate overseas—it is sending those who thought they’d already made it to safety to warzones (South Sudan), certain imprisonment (Afghanistan, Russia), and failed states (Haiti).

The U.S. business community is heavily reliant on immigrant labor, much of it undocumented, in agriculture, construction, and the food industry. But it has failed to stand up for its immigrant workforce. The international community is busy making deals with Trump, not censuring him. Congress has been largely silent (though it recently announced an inquiry into ICE treatment of U.S. citizens).

At a time when countries around the world are shrinking in population, the United States has remained strong because of all the people who have come here from abroad to work, to contribute to the tax base and Social Security, and, yes, to have babies. So, who will combine the necessary moral and practical arguments to convince the mass of Americans that the very survival of this country depends on immigrants?",https://fpif.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2640469337.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 17:00:39.560534

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem outlined on social media last week these personnel will receive “super checks” by Wednesday covering their next pay period, as well as lost wages from the first few days of the shutdown, and applicable overtime pay.
Among the hundreds of thousands of government employees not being paid are air traffic controllers, who have been deemed necessary employees.
“To think that somehow we can live with, ‘You’ll get paid eventually,’ that doesn’t pay the creditors, that doesn’t pay the mortgage, that doesn’t pay gas, that doesn’t pay the food bill,” Daniels told Fortune earlier this week.
But even furloughing employees during a shutdown or giving them temporarily unpaid leave can end up costing more than just continuing to pay them, Bilmes noted.","Customs and Border Protection border patrol agents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officers, Secret Service Special Agents, and Transportation Security Administration air marshals will continue to be paid during the ongoing shutdown, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed to Fortune. Their pay is covered under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which gave ICE an extra $75 billion in funding.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem outlined on social media last week these personnel will receive “super checks” by Wednesday covering their next pay period, as well as lost wages from the first few days of the shutdown, and applicable overtime pay.

Not all essential workers have been so fortunate. Among the hundreds of thousands of government employees not being paid are air traffic controllers, who have been deemed necessary employees. Many are working 60 hours, six days a week, and some are taking on second “gig jobs,” such as serving at restaurants or driving for Uber or DoorDash, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.

“To think that somehow we can live with, ‘You’ll get paid eventually,’ that doesn’t pay the creditors, that doesn’t pay the mortgage, that doesn’t pay gas, that doesn’t pay the food bill,” Daniels told Fortune earlier this week. “No one takes IOUs, and the air traffic controllers are having to feel that pressure as well.”

The decisions of who gets paid and who doesn’t during government shutdowns depends on department personnel sorting employees into respective groups of essential and non-essential, as well as appropriations for salaries that may or may not be impacted by the lapsed Congressional budget.

But this employee selection process is completely arbitrary and subjective, highlighting a failure of government shutdowns, which are ultimately more expensive than keeping the government operating, according to Linda Bilmes, a public finance expert and senior lecturer at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco estimated for each week the government is shut down, it would translate to a $7 billion economic hit and a 0.1% reduction in U.S. GDP growth, a result, in part, of delayed procurement of goods and a drag on demand.

“There is this overarching dysfunction of the entire process,” Bilmes told Fortune. “Every time you get into one of these situations—which has been on average four times a year for the last four to five years—there is an arbitrariness in who ends up being paid for their work, who ends up working, who ends up being furloughed.”

“The arbitrariness is almost inherent in this dysfunction—a feature as well as being a bug,” she added.

A ‘dysfunctional’ system

There have been 20 government “funding gaps” in the last 50 years, following a 1974 Congressional budget reform law in response to former President Richard Nixon’s impoundment attempts on funds Congress had already allocated. While the president had significant control over the budget for the better part of the 20th century, the 1974 reform put more power in Congress’ hands.

As a result of a series of fiscal and appropriations committees overseeing government budgets, the process of allocating and approving funds is convoluted, Bilmes said. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs has a two-year budget, meaning their funding does not lapse when Congress fails to pass an appropriations bill. The Patent and Trademark Office, conversely, is not funded through Congressionally appropriated money, but rather through patent fees, and likewise do not have employee pay impacted by the shutdown.

But even furloughing employees during a shutdown or giving them temporarily unpaid leave can end up costing more than just continuing to pay them, Bilmes noted. Government contractors are typically furloughed, but unlike many other federal workers, they are not guaranteed—and in many cases, not paid—backpay. These contractors are aware of a potential disruption in income because of the frequency of shutdowns and, as a result, pad their contracts.

Bilmes posited that in order to resolve the arbitrary payment disparities during shutdowns, there should be automatic resolutions, creating an automatic extension of the previous budget. This, however, would not be ideal because it could make less urgent conversations about planning, strategy, and addressing long-term problems that accompany new budget discussions, she said. An alternative would be to have the whole government run on a two-year budget to avoid the quarterly stop-and-go that has become the current precedent.

Otherwise, the process does not serve the American public, Bilmes conceded.

“In my view,” she said, “it’s like spending money on shooting ourselves in the foot and deciding which foot we want to shoot first.”",https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2242203642-e1761154381846.jpg?resize=1200%2C630,N,,2025-10-22 17:17:16.189624

In a case before a federal judge in San José, Bay Area legal groups are seeking to block ICE from rearresting immigrants who had previously been granted conditional release, typically after border agents had determined they were not dangerous and not a flight risk, meaning they were expected to show up for their proceedings in immigration court.

Advocates say ICE has arrested and detained more than 100 immigrants in recent months as they attended mandatory court hearings and ICE supervision check-ins in Northern and Central California, even though they were abiding by the terms of their release and their circumstances had not changed.

Bree Bernwanger, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California, one of the groups filing the suit, said until things shifted abruptly in May, such rearrests were unheard of for ICE’s San Francisco field office.

“ICE’s new policy allows them to make arrests and throw people back into detention without any justification,” she said. “[It] has disrupted people’s lives, it’s torn families apart, and it’s fundamentally unfair and unreasoned.”

ICE officials did not respond to KQED’s request for comment, but the agency typically does not comment on pending litigation.

One of those arrested was Gabriela Vargas Plasencia, who was an engineering student in Peru before she fled death threats and came to the U.S. last year seeking asylum, according to her declaration to the court. She said she and her boyfriend were detained at the border, then released with instructions on attending immigration hearings.

They settled in Oakland, submitted their asylum applications and enrolled in English classes. Once she was granted a work permit, Vargas Plasencia said she found two jobs, at Target and FedEx, working 50 hours a week.

But at court on Sep. 4, she said, a government attorney asked the immigration judge to dismiss their cases. When the couple left the courtroom, Vargas Plasencia said agents in plain clothes grabbed them, took them to the basement and shackled them – all with no explanation. Hours later, they were driven to Bakersfield and locked up at the Mesa Verde Immigration Detention Center.

After lawyers intervened, a federal judge ordered Vargas Plasencia’s release. But in the meantime, she said, her car was towed and she was reprimanded for missing work. Her partner is still in custody. And she said she still has flashbacks to what she called “one of the most difficult and painful experiences I have ever endured.”

“Each time I have to check in with ICE, I feel anxiety and panic all over again,” Vargas Plasencia said in her declaration. “I have never committed any crime, in the United States or anywhere else. I only wish to continue my asylum case peacefully and to build a safe, stable life here; and for my partner to be released soon, as well.”

Bernwanger, the ACLU attorney, says rearresting people who are complying with the conditions of their release is an arbitrary exercise of power that violates the Constitution’s protection against unreasonable seizure.

“We should all be concerned,” she said. “Are we comfortable with a system in which people can just be grabbed off of the street and thrown into detention?”

Can ICE arrest immigrants at immigration courthouses?

While the lawsuit involving Vargas Plasencia centers on the question of why ICE can arrest someone, another recent case deals with the question of where those arrests can take place.

That lawsuit, filed last month by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco, along with the ACLU and others, takes on Trump administration policies instructing ICE and the immigration courts that arresting people at courthouses, formerly off limits, is now acceptable.

Immigrant advocates say detaining people who are following the rules, and may, like Vargas Plasencia, have pending claims to asylum or other relief, will have a “chilling effect,” keeping them away from hearings and denying them access to justice. The administration has denied there’s any evidence for that.

“Conducting these arrests at courthouses, and conducting arrests of people without a justification when you’ve already released them, both of those policies are unlawful for different reasons,” said Bernwanger. “We are seeing ICE use them in coordination to absolutely terrorize people in our community who are just trying to do what the immigration system asks of them.”

The same judge, P. Casey Pitts, who was appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, will hear both Bay Area cases. Pitts has set hearings in both cases for Dec. 9.

Can ICE arrest survivors of trafficking and domestic violence?

Meanwhile, a class action case filed in federal court in Los Angeles last week blasts ICE for arresting, and even deporting, immigrants applying for legal visas as survivors of human trafficking, domestic violence or other serious crimes.

Karen Hernandez is with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, which is representing the immigrants. She said, under the Violence Against Women Act and other laws, these immigrants have permission to be in the U.S while their visas are pending.

“These are folks who have been granted legal protection by Congress,” she said. “The government is basically violating those legal protections.”

One of the named plaintiffs in the case, identified as Camila B., has lived in Los Angeles for more than two decades. In 2021, she was attacked at a bus stop and beaten unconscious, according to the complaint. She cooperated with police, helping them to arrest her attacker, and applied for a U Visa, which offers legal status to undocumented immigrants who’ve suffered serious crimes and assist law enforcement.

Because of the long backlog for applications, the government granted Camila, 46, temporary protection from deportation to her native Mexico while she awaited her visa. But on July 1, as part of ICE’s immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, officers surrounded her tamale stand and arrested her. She was held in detention until July 30, when a judge ordered her released on bond.

Many of the affected immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. But, beginning with the 1994 passage of the Violence Against Women Act, Congress repeatedly expanded protections for immigrant survivors of crime, encouraging them to seek safety and cooperate with law enforcement. Among the protections are special visas for victims of trafficking and other serious crimes that eventually lead to a green card. Congress also provided work authorization, and for years, immigration authorities had policies not to deport people who were in the process of applying for the visas.

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s reversal flies in the face of a federal law against “arbitrary and capricious” policy changes, and says the detentions violate people’s constitutionally guaranteed due process rights.

ICE and Homeland Security officials did not respond to KQED’s requests for comment about the case, but Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin has told other news outlets that every immigrant deported by ICE “has had due process and has a final order of removal — meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”

Hernandez, with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said defending laws like the Violence Against Women Act is very personal to her. She said she was a 3-year-old when her own family moved to the U.S. from Mexico. But her childhood was marked by domestic violence, and it took years for her mother to get free.

“I grew up with a father who was very violent towards my mom,” she said. “And I remember talking to her about this lawsuit as we were working on it. And she just said, ‘If this would have been around when you and I were being harmed by your father, this would’ve protected us.’”

The extent to which the Trump administration is pushing the legal limits on immigration means more lawsuits can be expected, according to Johnson, the UC Davis law professor.

“This administration is just so dogged in its immigration enforcement efforts, we see something new and different almost every day,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary time. The human misery is off the charts.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/06/031523-ICE-Arrest-AP-CM-01-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 16:17:08.967404

On Wednesday, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told Fox News that New York City will see an ""increase in ICE arrests"" because there are ""so many criminal illegal"" immigrants.

""You will see us making those criminal arrests to make New York safe again. It's definitely intelligence driven, it's not random,"" Lyons said. ""We aren't pulling people off the street. There was a specific reason based on criminal intelligence and criminal activity that we showed up on Canal Street,""

On Canal Street Wednesday morning, there was an unusual sense of peace and tranquility on what is usually a hub of illegal commerce.

Empty sidewalks were free of the illegal street vendors hawking fake designer label purses and luxury watches.

If that was the mission of federal agents Tuesday afternoon, to clear the scene of vendors who often hail from West Africa, mission accomplished.

It was a chaotic scene in Chinatown on Tuesday when a swarm of masked immigration officers, ATF and Homeland Security agents, and other federal law enforcement all pushed, pulled, and detained the vendors who are a fixture on the sidewalks of Canal Street.

The show of force quickly generated a rather vocal response from ICE protesters who immediately started recording video and taking pictures of agents at work. Pushing and shoving soon followed.

In a statement, a Homeland Security spokesperson said the agents, ""Conducted a targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City focused on criminal activity related to selling counterfeit goods.""

Jason Jackson, an elevator repairman who works in the area, said he wouldn't be surprised if social media videos taken by ICE supporters led federal agents to target this part of Manhattan.

""I definitely think that is how it went. Because this has been going on for a long time and just out of nowhere, they want to crack down on it,"" Jackson said.

Mayor Eric Adams, in an effort to distant himself and the city from what happened said in a statement in part that ""New Yorkers should know we have no involvement.""

Following the surprise crackdown, New York Attorney General Letitia James launched a portal for members of the public to submit photos and videos of ICE enforcement actions.

In a statement, James vowed to review the materials to determine if any laws were violated, including ""unlawful questioning, detention, or intimidation.""

""Every New Yorker has the right to live without fear or intimidation,"" James said. ""If you witnessed and documented ICE activity yesterday, I urge you to share that footage with my office. We are committed to reviewing these reports and assessing any violations of law. No one should be subject to unlawful questioning, detention, or intimidation.""

The state of Oregon is asking a federal judge to dismiss a Marion County lawsuit over immigration records, saying state law is clear that the county can’t share information about men on parole for local crimes with federal immigration authorities.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion Monday in Eugene U.S. District Court to dismiss the lawsuit, which county officials filed Aug. 18 to seek clarity on whether they could share contact information and other details about men on parole with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Because state law unequivocally prohibits Marion County from producing the requested information without a court order, and because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies, there is nothing further for this court to do,” Rayfield wrote.

The motion is the latest in an ongoing back-and-forth between Marion County, the state and federal authorities who say they are trying to locate several men in Salem who served prison time for violent crimes and should be deported.

ICE sent subpoenas to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office on Aug. 1 asking for information about five men on parole, according to the county’s lawsuit.

The lawsuit named Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Marion County said that a federal judge needs to resolve conflicts between Oregon’s so-called sanctuary law, state public records law and federal law. The county compiled information to respond to the ICE subpoenas but has not provided them as of Tuesday, according to Marion County counsel Steve Elzinga.

Oregon sanctuary law generally bars agencies from sharing information with immigration authorities for enforcement purposes, unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Rayfield argued that ICE does not have authority to inspect the information under the state’s public records law.

The subpoenas sent to Marion County were signed by a special agent, not a judge. That means they are not to be cooperated with under Oregon law, Rayfield argued.

Rayfield said that previous court rulings have made clear that sanctuary and federal law do not conflict, and that if a judge orders to enforce subpoenas, agencies are then required to provide the information.

“And yet, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed this lawsuit instead, seeking an advisory opinion from this court rather than following well-established processes under state and federal law – processes that have been in place for many years without the need for lawsuits or further clarification,” Rayfield wrote in the motion.

In a statement Tuesday, Marion County disputed Rayfield’s argument that there is no conflict between state and federal laws.

“The state’s assertion that there is no legal uncertainty fails a basic smell test when there is an obvious federal-state clash over subpoenas requesting public records of violent criminals and the majority of Oregon’s sheriffs and counties who are caught in the middle say that legal clarity is needed,” Elzinga said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office separately filed a lawsuit Oct. 1 to enforce subpoenas sent to Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties requesting information on 10 men previously convicted of crimes in the counties.

In that case, Marion County asked a judge to order it to release information to ICE, according to an Oct. 6 filing. No such order has been issued yet, federal court records show.

Twenty Oregon counties and all but two of the state’s sheriffs support Marion County’s lawsuit seeking clarification on immigration subpoenas.

In a letter sent to Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Oct. 6, counties said Marion County should ask a judge to “issue a detailed opinion that provides the type of clarity that will help all local governments ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

In its subpoenas, ICE sought personal information on five men on parole in Marion County for serious crimes, including rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping and theft. ICE later rescinded one subpoena due to “discrepancies in biographical information,” an email from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Salem Reporter filed a public records request Sept. 18 for the information ICE requested in its administrative subpoenas and received the records a week later without exemptions or redactions. The news publication was not charged for the records.

The records, which include home addresses, employers and phone numbers for each of the men, were also provided to OPB and KOIN 6, according to a declaration by Elzinga.

Providing the records to news outlets underscores a key claim in Marion County’s lawsuit. The county argued that under state public records law, information about people on parole is a public record that anyone can obtain through a public records request.

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.

In the motion, he cited state law that says people who are allowed to inspect public records include “any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, association or member or committee of the Legislative Assembly.”

Public bodies and the federal government are not included in Oregon’s definition of who is allowed access to public records, Rayfield said.

“Here, the administrative subpoenas issued by ICE are issued under federal government authority, not in anyone’s individual capacity, do not state that they are public records requests and do not invoke the Oregon public records law on their face,” he wrote in the motion.

The ICE special agent who signed the subpoenas could have access to the information if the information was requested on behalf of an individual, and not a public agency, according to Rayfield’s motion.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dan-Rayfield-9_12_25-8-of-16-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:17:10.011543

LOS ANGELES — Federal officers shot a man in the elbow after he rammed his car into law enforcement vehicles while trying to evade arrest Tuesday morning in Los Angeles, authorities said.

A deputy U.S. Marshal assisting with the arrest was hit in the hand with a ricochet bullet, authorities said.

| REGISTER NOW: Protecting major events from drone threats

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents fired defensive shots as the man rammed into their vehicles, Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli identified the man as Carlitos Ricardo Parias, 44, from Mexico and said he was charged with assault on a federal officer. Parias is due in court Wednesday, Essayli said in a statement. He is living in the country illegally, Essayli said.

Essayli said officers had an administrative immigration arrest warrant for Parias, who had “avoided capture before.” McLaughlin earlier said he had “previously escaped from custody.” It wasn’t immediately clear if he had previously been arrested.

Parias runs a TikTok account under the name Richard Noticias LA where he posts as a citizen journalist, including sharing videos and information about immigration enforcement activities.

During the traffic stop Tuesday, authorities boxed Parias in with their vehicles as they tried to arrest him, Essayli said. Parias then rammed into the vehicles in front of and behind him. An agent attempted to break the driver’s side window of the car, but that did not subdue Parias, Essayli said.

As Parias spun the tires, the back of the car began to fishtail, eventually prompting an agent to open fire, Essayli said.

“Vehicles are deadly weapons. Anyone who uses them against federal agents risks arrest, imprisonment, and life-threatening injuries,” Essayli wrote.

U.S. Marshals Service office spokesperson Tlaloc Olvera confirmed one of their officers sustained a non-life-threatening injury and was in stable condition.

“These are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest,” McLaughlin said.

Los Angeles police said they were providing traffic control and were not involved directly in the federal operation.

Last month, an ICE officer fatally shot a suspect during an operation after the man drove his car at officers and dragged one of them.

ICE tracks attacks against its officers and has blamed activists for an increase in attacks, saying their rhetoric encourages people the agency is pursuing to resist arrest.

According to data provided by the agency, there were 172 reported assaults between Jan. 21 and Oct. 1 of this year. That’s compared to 15 reported assaults during the same period last year.

We’re talking about the government shutdown, of course. How did we get here, and what does it mean for the justice system? FindLaw breaks it down.

Shut Down for What?!

The short end of it is this: the current shutdown is the product of a protracted standoff between congressional Democrats and Republicans, which reached a breaking point at the end of last month.

The immediate cause was the failure to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government. Senate Democrats refused to advance a Republican-backed bill that would have eliminated Obamacare subsidies, resulting in a lapse in appropriations and triggering a government-wide shutdown on October 1. Executive branch agencies began furloughing workers and suspending services immediately.

The federal judiciary was able to maintain paid operations for several weeks by relying on reserve funds, court fees, and leftover balances from previous years. However, these stopgap measures were always temporary, and by October 17, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts announced that funding would be exhausted by Monday, October 20.

Judiciary Hits the Wall

The shutdown isn’t breaking news, so why is it newsworthy now? Well, for the first few weeks of the month, the federal judiciary was mostly spared the fate of other government branches thanks to legal fees. The fees are collected from litigants and defendants who use the courts. They help to pay court costs, but they only cover part of the courts’ expenses (the remainder comes from government appropriations). And they can only go so far.

After 20 days of shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees have been furloughed nationally, with another 33,000 federal court staff either performing limited tasks unpaid or placed on furlough. The impasse, driven by heated disagreement over medical care subsidies, has resulted in daily economic losses estimated by some economists at $15 billion. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts reinforced on Friday that, “until the ongoing lapse in government funding is resolved, federal courts will maintain limited operations necessary to perform the judiciary’s constitutional functions.”

As the shutdown drags on, its effects on courts across the country are becoming increasingly severe. Federal courts (including appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts) are now forced to curtail non-essential functions and begin furloughing staff – for the first time since the mid-90s. That’s not great news on its own, but there’s an even bigger problem when you consider the governing law of the country.

Under the U.S. Constitution, judges of courts established under Article III (such as the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeals, and District Courts) are guaranteed life tenure and their salaries cannot be diminished while in office. This ensures judicial independence and continuity even when the government faces funding shortfalls. Therefore, judges must continue fulfilling their constitutional duties (hearing cases, issuing rulings, and maintaining essential judicial proceedings) regardless of whether Congress has passed a funding bill.

But there’s also another snag: the Anti-Deficiency Act. This law prohibits federal agencies and employees from obligating or spending government funds without congressional appropriations. It allows only narrowly defined ""excepted activities"" to continue during a shutdown.

So, how is Uncle Sam planning on reconciling these seemingly opposing laws?

Courts in Survival Mode

Put simply, the judiciary limped along as long as it could by relying on court fees — money paid by litigants to file cases, access court records, and so on — but those funds are only a stopgap. Once exhausted, the courts face the same constraints as the rest of government and have to sharply limit their operations to what’s required by the Constitution and core legal mandates. Against the backdrop of mounting partisan finger-pointing in Washington, this situation is exposing both structural vulnerabilities and the real-world consequences of a budget impasse on the justice system.

It looks like judges will continue to serve as required by the Constitution, but most court employees will only be permitted to perform ""excepted activities"" under the Anti-Deficiency Act. In the judiciary’s case, “excepted activities” include functions required by the Constitution (adjudicating cases and issuing judicial orders), but also work necessary for the “safety of human life or the protection of property,” and “activities otherwise authorized by law.”

That’s not very clear, is it? Here are examples of the kinds of activities that fall into these exceptions and will therefore remain ongoing: security operations; emergency detention hearings; maintaining critical infrastructure like electronic filing systems; essential criminal proceedings or urgent court filings that cannot be postponed without violating rights.

In short, while judges remain constitutionally obligated to serve, the broader judiciary shifts into “survival mode,” sustaining only the most crucial operations under strict legal limits. Most court employees (clerks, administrative staff, researchers, probation officers, and others) cannot work during a shutdown unless their tasks fall into one of those excepted categories. Those who do continue working must do so without pay until Congress restores funding. All other staff are being placed on furlough.

A ‘Funding Crisis’

Senate Judiciary Committee leaders warn that lapses in funding could soon mean “justice delayed—or even justice denied.” The shutdown's impact extends beyond just court staff: federal public defenders, who represent indigent criminal defendants, will not be paid during this period, nor will private lawyers appointed under the Criminal Justice Act.

In fact, payments for private lawyers have already been delayed since July due to earlier budget shortfalls—a situation the judiciary has deemed a ""funding crisis."" Probation officers, judicial clerks, and administrative staff still working are set to receive their last paychecks on October 24 if appropriations do not resume.

The Justice Department has argued in filings that it cannot keep up with hundreds of lawsuits with reduced staff and resources. While that very well may be true, note that only about 11 percent of its workforce has been furloughed, compared with over 80 percent at agencies like Commerce.

Every Court for Itself?

Each individual court is responsible for determining how it will operate during this funding lapse. Unsurprisingly, this has led to a patchwork of responses nationwide.

Some courts have pledged to keep scheduled trials and grand jury sessions running for as long as possible using remaining funds. For example, Chief Judge Virginia M. Kendall of the Northern District of Illinois warned that delays in timely justice are inevitable but assured that enough funding remains for now to continue critical proceedings. At the Supreme Court, the justices plan to keep hearing cases and issuing rulings while the building remains closed to the public. On Monday, the Court announced they will review a high-profile gun law case but that might just be because the Trump Administration urged them to take it up.

Despite all the operational constraints, litigation against the Trump administration continues apace. Judges overseeing lawsuits challenging administration policies have repeatedly denied government requests to suspend cases due to lack of resources. Some deadlines have, of course, been extended, and less urgent matters have been put on hold. But still, many high-profile cases (including those related to immigration enforcement and deployment of federal forces) are proceeding with only minimal interruption.

Trials and Tribulations Ahead

Looking ahead, lawyers and litigants should brace for significant uncertainty and delays. President Trump and House Republicans show no signs of conceding, blaming Democrats for obstructing federal courts and critical services.

With individual courts making their own operational decisions based on available staffing and resources, parties may find scheduled hearings postponed or rescheduled at short notice. Civil litigation involving federal agencies is particularly affected due to widespread furloughs among agency employees who serve as witnesses or provide necessary documentation.

Ultimately, while judges remain constitutionally obligated to serve, the judiciary is now fulfilling only its core functions and under strict legal restraints.

In April, the court held the deportation trial of University of Minnesota international graduate student Doğukan Gunaydin, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for over a month.

Zaske’s firing comes during a time of nationwide dismissals of immigration judges by EOIR, which cites the executive branch’s authority under Article 2 of the Constitution. A spokesperson for EOIR declined to comment, saying the office does not comment on personnel matters.

Fort Snelling Immigration Court oversees immigration cases for Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota residents. The court had over 21,000 new cases filed in 2024 and is currently experiencing a backlog of 38,694 cases, with the number likely to increase before the end of the year.

Former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge at Fort Snelling Ryan Wood said losing another immigration judge will push the limits of an already strained system.

“The court system on January 19th, 2025, was operating at 125%, or more,” Wood said. “The staff, we were running a sprint pace at marathon lengths indefinitely.”

Wood also said the shortage of administrative staff is equally problematic for the case backlog.

“When you think of the amount of staff work it takes to manage a case docket of 40,000 cases, it’s a lot of people,” Wood said. “They are woefully understaffed, and I don’t know how they’re going to keep up with this.”

Along with staffing changes, the way immigration law has been enforced has changed substantially since President Donald Trump took office in January. The number of individuals criminally prosecuted for immigration violations reached around 6,885 in May, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, up from about 3,344 in February, Trump’s first full month in office.

At Fort Snelling, mounting pressure from the federal government to increase immigration enforcement has led to changes in judges’ decision-making. According to Amy Lange, project manager for The Advocates for Human Rights’ court observation project, the Department of Homeland Security has increased the number of motions to dismiss immigration cases, subjecting immigrants to potential detention and deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Lange says judges have repeatedly shifted stances on how to deal with motions for dismissal.

“There were two judges when this first started that weren’t automatically dismissing cases, then obviously there was a lot of pressure that came from above because then they were dismissing every case,” Lange said. “In the last week, we’ve seen two different judges deny a dismissal, and that’s new since early August.”

According to Lange, the administrative staff at the court has rapidly departed. She said that in some cases, staff were provided financial incentives to depart, and in other instances, staff members were fired.

Lange also echoed Wood’s concerns about court system funding and confirmed that former Immigration Judge Zaske’s cases had been reassigned.

“They’re reassigning her cases to other people,” Lange said. “People were showing up for afternoon appearances with Judge Carr, and those hearings had been rescheduled for June, but nobody knew.”

Wood said that Homeland Security Investigations’ and enforcement priorities have shifted under the Trump administration to emphasize immigration.

“They [prosecutors] have metrics; we want to see x number of worksite enforcement actions, x number of prosecutions for child exploitation,” Wood said. “Those metrics have turned to immigration enforcement.”

Fort Snelling currently has six immigration judges. To Wood, the onslaught of firings and pressure on immigration judges has a more discrete motivation of making a mental impact.

“We can’t see a lot of logic in the noise right now, other than that it’s putting fear in the judges,” Wood said. “You’re making close decisions on the bench, and that weighs. On the human level, it’s really tough.”",https://mndaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctimmigrationjudge.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:01:15.372747

The emergency action, issued by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, immediately paused the issuance and renewal of CDLs for noncitizens while states undergo audits of their licensing systems.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said the rule aimed to address ""widespread noncompliance"" and a ""troubling series of fatal crashes involving foreign nationals.""

Attorneys with Public Citizen, the public-interest law firm who have been representing the plaintiffs, argued the rule was imposed without the required public notice or comment period.

MORE |

""It's possible for an agency to act quickly in a true emergency,"" said Cormac Early, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group. ""But this isn't one. DOT based this on just five news stories, without any data showing noncitizen drivers are more dangerous.""

Early said those incidents — which involved drivers who would not have qualified for CDLs under the new rule — do not amount to the kind of “true emergency” required for an interim final rule.

He added that the government failed to analyze how revoking licenses from thousands of legally employed immigrants could impact the economy and public safety.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals, challenged both the process and the substance of the rule, alleging it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and unfairly targeted immigrants who have a legal right to work in the U.S.

Among them is Jorge Rivera, a DACA recipient who has lived in the U.S. since childhood and has owned a trucking company in Cedar City.

Rivera's story gained national attention after he shared a video of himself being denied his CDL renewal at a Utah DMV.

""What do you do when you can't renew your license, and you suddenly have to look for another job?"" said Rivera. ""I'm self-employed, I own my own business, I'll have to hire someone to drive my truck.”

Rivera said his CDL, which is set to expire at the same time he has to reapply for his federal work permit, could be revoked by the end of November.

""You're going to take somebody like me off the road who has 11 years of experience and replace me with someone who just came out of school,"" said Rivera. ""How is that making the roads safer?""

State impact and oversight

According to the Utah Division of Driver License, the state has had 85,586 active CDL licenses and permits — roughly 1,000 of which are limited term, issued to noncitizens with legal work authorizations, including DACA recipients, asylum-seekers and refugees.

State officials said they track CDL-related accidents through the Highway Safety Office. If a crash requires sanctions against CDL privileges, those are reported through the division of court convictions or crash reports.

In order to obtain a commercial driver's license, drivers have to take a training course and pass both a written and driven exam. Some drivers, depending on the class of vehicle, may be required to pass additional tests.

If a driver has several moving violations, they may need to retest.

Rivera said he has followed these requirements consistently for his 11 years of driving.

""Every two years that I renew, they run my paperwork and every two years it passes,"" he said.

What comes next

Early said the plaintiffs are seeking to have the rule vacated, which would allow states to resume issuing and renewing CDLs for legal noncitizens as before.

The DOT maintains that the rule is temporary and aimed at protecting public safety while audits are completed. The agency said it will accept public comments and may modify the policy before finalizing it.

For Rivera, the case has been about more than his own livelihood.

“I’m not asking for special treatment — just to be able to keep working and providing for my family,” he said. “This isn’t just about me. It’s about everyone who’s been doing the right thing and is suddenly told they can’t.”

Public comments on the rule remain open on the Department of Transportation’s website.

The full text of the letter can be found here and below.

Dear Mr. Greer:

I am writing to request that you open an investigation concerning reports that political messaging has been disseminated through federal agency channels during the ongoing government shutdown. This includes reports of a request by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to airports that they air videos framing the cause of the federal shutdown in political terms. I believe that the request from DHS to airports, messaging included in federal government websites and communications disseminated to employees are in clear violation of the Hatch Act and federal restrictions on partisan activity by government employees. This is an inappropriate and wasteful use of taxpayer dollars for political gain that merits a full investigation.

Recent postings on official government websites and reported emails to employees promote a partisan political narrative regarding the causes of the shutdown—activity that federal law expressly prohibits when “directed toward the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.”

Again, the Hatch Act is clear: Federal employees must remain impartial in the performance of their duties, regardless of political climate or leadership. Federal employees, including those on California’s Central Coast, deserve clear guidance to ensure that directives do not compromise their integrity or the public’s trust.

It has been brought to my attention that the website for the Los Padres National Forest under the U.S. Department of Agriculture includes partisan messaging attempting to place blame on Congressional Democrats— another violation of the Hatch Act. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. There are multiple reports that several agencies have issued communications blaming one political party for the ongoing shutdown, using official government resources to amplify these claims. These statements—some of which appeared on agency websites and others distributed internally to staff—frame the shutdown as being “caused by Democrats” or “driven by the left,” language that raises significant Hatch Act concerns. Regardless of which party holds power, such messaging violates the foundational principle that federal agencies serve the American people, not partisan agendas.

These clear violations of federal law demand a prompt and thorough investigation. To ensure accountability and transparency, I respectfully request that the Office of Special Counsel:

Immediately open an investigation into the use of government communications channels for partisan purposes during the shutdown; and

Provide guidance on how your office plans to address these incidents and prevent future violations.

Preserving the impartiality of federal agencies and their employees is essential to ensuring the integrity of our democracy and sustaining the public’s trust in our institutions. I ask that you give this request your immediate attention.

Last Thursday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration in the U.S. District for the District of Columbia over the President’s recently announced $100,000 fee on H-1B petitions. According to the Chamber, the fee violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and would impose prohibitive costs on businesses seeking to take advantage of the visa program.

President Donald Trump announced the new fee in a September 19 Proclamation entitled “Restriction of Entry on Certain Nonimmigrant Workers.” All H-1B visa petitions filed after September 21 are subject to the $100,000 fee, but previously issued visas will not be impacted. The Proclamation cited the continued abuse of the H-1B program to undercut American wages, and the resulting struggles facing college graduates in the job market, particularly STEM graduates. According to the Proclamation:

The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor. The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.

The Chamber of Commerce pushed back in its lawsuit. The complaint in the case claims that the proposed fee would exacerbate a “well-documented labor shortage” by making it more difficult to staff certain positions with H-1B visa holders, particularly in the STEM fields. The complaint goes on to argue that imposing the fee on H-1B petitions would hinder American manufacturing, innovation, and trade, and make the H-1B program prohibitively expensive for many companies. The Chamber of Commerce also contested the President’s authority to impose the fee on the H-1B program in a way that it regards as “flatly contrary to Congress’s directives” as laid out in the INA, namely statutes outlining the implementation of the H-1B program.

Trump administration officials were quick to respond. According to a statement from the White House: “President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H1-B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.” FAIR’s executive director and general counsel Dale Wilcox also supported the new H-1B fee, saying, “The new fee is significant enough to discourage employers who merely want to hire lower wage foreign workers, but not so prohibitive that it will prevent them from petitioning for workers whose skills are truly needed.”",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/H1B%20Visa%2C%20Money%2C%20Passports%2C%20Cracked%20American%20Flag.jpeg.webp?itok=ZaYc8XYL,N,,2025-10-22 13:17:17.123025

The filings follow President Trump’s recent National Guard deployments to major cities, raising alarm that such tactics could extend to polling locations next year. Trump previously made similar threats ahead of the 2020 election, when he claimed he would send law enforcement officials to monitor polling sites. — a move experts warned could intimidate voters and potentially violate federal law.

“The presence of law enforcement or military personnel at polling places risks chilling voter participation and undermining public confidence in the integrity of our elections —– perhaps that is what President Trump is counting on,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “The possibility that this kind of government power might be used to threaten voters exercising their constitutional rights demands scrutiny. Rather than stoke fears of political intimidation, the administration should strengthen trust in our democracy and address the real crises affecting people’s lives.”

Deploying military personnel or immigration enforcement officials to polling places would not be Trump’s first use of federal power to influence the 2026 midterms. With a history of punishing states that refuse to do his bidding, he has publicly pressed states to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm cycle, intervening directly in the redistricting process in states like Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina to lock in additional Republican seats rather than wait for the usual post-census period.

Additionally, Trump ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate ActBlue, the main online fundraising platform for Democratic candidates, while ignoring its GOP counterpart, WinRed. The DOJ has also demanded detailed voter registration data from states, threatening legal action against some Democratic-led states that have not complied.

Trump could mobilize a state’s National Guard over its governor’s objections for blatantly illegal purposes, and courts would be powerless to stop him.
The ruling did not say, or remotely imply, that courts lack authority to review the president’s decision, as Nelson wrongly asserted.
But Congress later stripped out that deferential language and replaced it with explicit restrictions on federalization of the National Guard.
Nelson’s theory would nullify Congress’ constitutional authority over the National Guard by letting the president summon it whenever he wants.","Two judges appointed by President Donald Trump allowed him to deploy the National Guard into Portland, Oregon, on Monday, granting the executive branch sweeping authority to suppress peaceful protests based on false claims of widespread violence. The 2–1 decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rested on a credulous reading of the record: The majority largely accepted the administration’s portrayal of Portland as a “war zone,” dismissing the district court’s extensive findings to the contrary. As dissenting Judge Susan Graber pointed out, Trump’s “illegal deployment of troops” rests on “false pretenses,” “fabrication,” and “propaganda”—all “political theater” that no court should dignify.

As bad as Monday’s decision was, it could have been far worse. In a concurrence, Judge Ryan Nelson argued that the judiciary has no power at all to review (or halt) a president’s deployment of the National Guard to suppress alleged domestic unrest. In Nelson’s view, Trump enjoys absolute discretion to send troops into American cities for any reason he deems necessary, and no court may stand in his way. It may be tempting to dismiss this argument as Nelson’s audition for a Supreme Court seat. But it must be taken seriously, because it is precisely what the Trump administration is now asking SCOTUS to embrace. And it is wrong from top to bottom: As a matter of constitutional principle, statutory text, precedent, and history, there is no remotely plausible argument that courts cannot review a president’s domestic deployment of the National Guard. Indeed, the weight of evidence points in the opposite direction.

Before delving into why Nelson’s claim is wrong, consider its radical and disturbing consequences. Trump could mobilize a state’s National Guard over its governor’s objections for blatantly illegal purposes, and courts would be powerless to stop him. He could send in the Guard to punish voters, protesters, and lawmakers who oppose his agenda—as he is doing in Portland and Chicago—responding to political disagreements with a militarized crackdown. He could flood Democratic cities with troops during an election to obstruct people going to the polls. He could dispatch soldiers to surround critical media outlets, sending the message that dissent will be met with force. The opportunities for repression are boundless, which is one reason why the Framers were so hostile to the idea of a standing army responsible for domestic security.

In light of these dire consequences, one might expect Nelson to mount a robust defense of his belief that Trump’s mobilization of the Guard “may not be reviewed by the federal courts.” But he devoted a sum total of fewer than six pages to this radical claim and spent most of them mischaracterizing Supreme Court precedent. The key case, to his mind, is 1827’s Martin v. Mott, a dispute over President James Madison’s authority to call up the states’ militias (the predecessors to our National Guard) during the War of 1812. In his unanimous opinion, Chief Justice Joseph Story held that Madison’s mobilization was lawful because the British invasion constituted a genuine emergency. The ruling included a sentence that the Trump administration has repeated ad nauseam: “We are all of opinion,” Story wrote, “that the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen, belongs exclusively to the President, and that his decision is conclusive upon all other persons.”

Plucked from context, these words seem to imply that the president alone may determine when there is an emergency that requires state militias, and courts may not second-guess his decision. That’s precisely what Nelson insisted on Monday. But as professor Steve Vladeck has explained, the sentence means something entirely different in the context of the opinion. Mott addressed a debate about whether the president could make the initial determination that an emergency exists, or whether officers lower in the military’s chain of command could do so instead. The Supreme Court, professors Joshua Braver and John Dehn have shown, was concerned about preserving the military chain of command, specifically during a foreign invasion; it wanted to ensure that the commander in chief’s military subordinates could not defy his decision in a crisis.

To that end, Mott announced that the president, rather than officers of inferior rank, could make the first call to deploy the militia in a national crisis. The ruling did not say, or remotely imply, that courts lack authority to review the president’s decision, as Nelson wrongly asserted. That mistake has been definitively debunked by Braver, Dehn, and a comprehensive account of the case by the Constitutional Accountability Center.

There is another reason why neither Mott nor any other 19th-century case that Nelson cites could possibly stand for the proposition that courts may not review the president’s declaration of an emergency: They involved a different statute than the one Trump now relies upon. Those cases interpreted the Militia Acts of 1795 and 1807, which broadly empowered the president to “call forth” the militia to counter an insurrection or rebellion “as he shall think proper.” These statutes gave immense deference to the president’s judgment and imposed few limitations. But Congress later stripped out that deferential language and replaced it with explicit restrictions on federalization of the National Guard. The modern statute allows the president to send in the troops only in the case of insurrection, rebellion, or an inability “with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Nelson ignored this significant revision of the statutory text. He wrote that the current statute “uses similar language” to its predecessors, disregarding Congress’ deletion of a clause that gave more deference to the president. But as Judge Graber pointed out in dissent, today’s statute includes careful limitations on the president’s discretion. And those limits create a “judicial responsibility” for courts to rebuff the president when he deploys the Guard “in a situation far divorced” from what Congress envisioned.

There is, Graber noted, a deeper principle that counsels judicial review here. The Constitution does not give the president control over the militia; it allows Congress to decide when the militia may be called up. Congress has decided when deployment is appropriate and instructed the president to send in troops in those circumstances alone. Nelson’s theory would nullify Congress’ constitutional authority over the National Guard by letting the president summon it whenever he wants. Without judicial review, after all, who could stop him? Congress might try to deny funding for his partisan deployments, but Trump has already asserted the right to redirect money appropriated for other purposes. Combined with his ability to unlawfully withhold federal funds—which SCOTUS recently greenlit—Trump now has a license to take money from programs he dislikes and repurpose it for his own military objectives.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-10-22 16:02:36.434701

The Department of Homeland Security described the operation as a “targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City, focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”.
Trump, she said, “claims he’s targeting the ‘worst of the worst’” but “today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street”.
The city comptroller, Brad Lander, said that “street vendors are not a national security threat” and thanked the “New Yorkers who mobilized quickly”.
The three candidates for New York City mayor also reacted to the raid.","Local and state officials in New York are expressing outrage after dozens of federal agents carried out a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raid in Manhattan’s Chinatown on Tuesday.

Eyewitnesses accounts and video footage captured the chaotic scenes in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon, where masked and armed federal agents were seen detaining several individuals near Canal Street, while crowds of New Yorkers gathered, protesting against the action. Military-style vehicles were also seen driving through the area.

The Department of Homeland Security described the operation as a “targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City, focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”.

The raid drew swift condemnation from local and state leaders.

The New York police department (NYPD) quickly distanced itself from the operation, stating that the department had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon”.

Eric Adams, the mayor, reposted the NYPD’s statement and added: “New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.”

The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, condemned the operation and hit out at Donald Trump.

Trump, she said, “claims he’s targeting the ‘worst of the worst’” but “today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street”.

“You don’t make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers,” she said.

Chuck Schumer, a New York senator, called the raid “indiscriminate, wrong, and destructive” and said that federal immigration agencies “should target criminals for arrest and deportation – not unleash reckless raids against vendors on the streets of the city”.

“This creates fear and chaos and does not make us safer,” he added.

Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, said that federal agents deprived “vendors of due process and ripping them from their families – all because they tried to earn a living”. The city comptroller, Brad Lander, said that “street vendors are not a national security threat” and thanked the “New Yorkers who mobilized quickly”.

Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, described the raid on Tuesday as a “horrifying display of federal overreach and authoritarian tactics”, adding that “our communities deserve safety, dignity and due process – not fear and violence that tear families apart”.

He also told reporters that a few people were taken into custody for protesting and blocking Ice’s efforts.

A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that people in the crowd “were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties” and said that at least one protester was arrested for allegedly assaulting a federal officer.

The three candidates for New York City mayor also reacted to the raid.

The Democratic candidate, Zohran Mamdani, condemned the operation as a “aggressive and reckless raid on immigrant street vendors”, adding: “Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop.”

Andrew Cuomo, the independent candidate and former New York governor, called the raid an “abuse of federal power by the Trump administration: more about fear than justice, more about politics than safety.

“This is not who we are, and it will never be NYC when I am mayor,” Cuomo said. “The Statue of Liberty stands in our harbor, not as a decoration, but as a declaration of our values and the promise of America.”

And in a statement to the Gothamist, a spokesperson for the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, said that the federal government should prioritize the deportation of “gang members, sex traffickers, and those involved in major crimes.

“[Sliwa] has also been clear that the backs of restaurants and other service industries should not be the focus of immigration enforcement, and that resources should target dangerous offenders, not working people,” the spokesperson added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39a4b9e75b9e3fd40331d8b4b1a3e942cf93102/383_0_3799_3039/master/3799.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbae09c57f8f7d769ead6cb4ccb444ee",N,,2025-10-22 12:57:43.059555

“Shutdown Democrats are already refusing to pay our law enforcement agents. Now, @RepRobertGarcia and @SenBlumenthal are trying to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs,” Bondi said in a post on the social platform X, referring to Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).

“@TheJusticeDept has ZERO tolerance for violence against law enforcement — we will prosecute any person who physically assaults our agents,” she added.

Bondi’s post also featured a clip of a Monday press conference with Garcia and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D).

“The Oversight Committee, I shared this with the mayor — over the course of the next couple of weeks, the Oversight Committee will be launching on their website a master ICE tracker where we can … essentially [track] every single instance that we can verify that the community will send, be able to send us information on.”

“It’ll be all available in one central place,” he added.

Garcia responded to Bondi with his own X post an hour after Bondi’s initial post.

“Hey @AGPamBondi, ICE detaining over 170 U.S. citizens is not them ‘just doing their jobs.’ But since you have the time to tweet at me—when are you going to stop covering for pedophiles and release the Epstein files?” the California Democrat said.

Since he returned to office in January, President Trump’s administration has heavily cracked down on immigration. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented a new $1,000 immigration fee for migrants paroled into the U.S.

The fee aims to “institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system,” DHS said. It would also bolster oversight of the immigration parole system “and deter its misuse.”

“The Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans,” DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a previous statement.

Blumenthal, in an emailed statement, said ICE was “using police state tactics to terrorize communities across the country — unlawfully arresting at least 170 U.S. citizens in the process.”

The Hill has reached out ICE for comment.
