President Donald Trump has also repeatedly threatened to deploy National Guard troops to curb violence in Chicago.

Tuesday morning, President Donald Trump posted on social media, ""I will solve the crime problem fast, just like I did in DC. Chicago will be safe again, and soon.""

Trump is scheduled on Tuesday afternoon at 1 p.m. to make an announcement from the Oval Office, according to the White House.

In a letter to the president, Illinois congressional leaders reiterated that there's no emergency that warrants military officials in Chicago.

The letter states in part, ""The deployment of the U.S. military into American cities is not about safety or security. It is about control...We demand you suspend any plans for the deployment of military personnel to Chicago and cease your unlawful power grabs and Executive Branch overreach.""

Over the weekend, Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order that reaffirms Chicago's sanctuary status and urges federal agents not to wear masks.

“It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”","McALLEN, Texas (AP) — President Donald Trump’s administration has started requiring parents looking to reunite with their children who crossed into the U.S. alone to show up for interviews where immigration officers may question them, according to a policy memo obtained by The Associated Press.

Legal advocacy groups say the shift has led to the arrest of some parents, while their children remain in U.S. custody. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not confirm that or answer questions about the July 9 directive, instead referring in a statement to the Biden administration’s struggles to properly vet and monitor homes where children were placed.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement, which is part of the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and which takes custody of children who cross the border without a parent or legal guardian, issued the directive. The agency said the goal is to ensure that sponsors — usually a parent or guardian — are properly vetted.

The memo said sponsors must now appear in person for identification verification. Previously, sponsors could submit identity documents online. The directive also says “federal law enforcement agencies may be present to meet their own mission objectives, which may include interviewing sponsors.”

Neha Desai, managing director of human rights at the National Center for Youth Law, said the change provides U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a “built-in opportunity” to arrest parents — something she said has already happened.

Mary Miller Flowers, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights, said she knew of a case in which immigration officers arrested the father of a child under the age of 12 who had shown up for an identification check. “As a result, mom is terrified of coming forward. And so, this child is stuck,” Miller Flowers said.

Desai also said the interviews are unlikely to produce information authorities don’t already have. Vetting already included home studies and background checks done by Office of Refugee Resettlement staff, not immigration enforcement.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement said it communicates “clearly and proactively” with parents, telling them they may be interviewed by ICE or other law enforcement officials. It said parents can decline to be interviewed by ICE and that refusal won’t influence decisions about whether their children will be released to them.

“The goal is to ensure that every child is released to a stable and safe environment and fully vetted sponsors by ensuring the potential sponsor is the same individual submitting supporting documentation, including valid ID,” it said in a statement.

However, Desai is aware of a situation in which a sponsor was not notified and only able to decline after pushing back.

“We know of sponsors who are deeply, deeply fearful because of this interview, but some are still willing to go forward given their determination to get their children out of custody,” she said.

Trump administration points to Biden

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokesperson, issued a statement that did not address any arrests or mention the specific changes. Instead, she said the department is looking to protect children who were released under President Joe Biden’s administration.

A federal watchdog report released last year addressed the Biden’s administration struggles during an increase in migrant children arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2021. The Trump administration has dispatched Homeland Security and FBI agents to visit the children.

Another recent change allows ICE to interview children while they are at government-run shelters. That took effect July 2, according to a separate directive that the Office of Refugee Resettlement sent to shelters, also obtained by the AP.

The agency said it provides legal counsel to children and that its staff does not participate in interviews with law enforcement. Child legal advocates say they get as little as one-hour notice of the interviews, and that the children often don’t understand the purpose of the interview or are misled by officers.

“If we don’t understand what the interview is for or where the information is going, are we really consenting to this process?” said Miller Flowers, with the Young Center.

Jennifer Podkul, chief of global policy at Kids in Need of Defense, said some officers lack language skills, trauma-informed interviewing techniques and knowledge of the reunification process.

“It seems like it’s designed just to cast the net wider on immigration enforcement against adults,” she said.

String of policy changes adding hurdles to reunification process

The July changes are among a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to ramp up vetting of parents seeking to reunite with children.

The administration has required fingerprinting from sponsors and any adults living in the home where children are released. It has also required identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire, as well as introducing DNA testing and home visits by immigration officers.

Children have been spending more time in government-run shelters under increased vetting. The average length of stay for those released was 171 days in July, down from a peak of 217 days in April but well above 37 days in January, when Trump took office.

About 2,000 unaccompanied children were in government custody in July.

Shaina Aber, an executive director of the Acacia Center for Justice analyzing child custody data, attributes the longer custody times to the policy changes.

“The agency’s mission has been conflated and entangled,” she added. “It seems ORR’s mission has been somewhat compromised in that they are now doing more on the immigration enforcement side, and they’re not an immigration enforcement entity.”",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/1930c44/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5475x3080+0+285/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fce%2Fc5%2F4c348f561da4e8cbed2f870dc241%2F11dcaf94d64d4eb4963f25a475c8832e,N,,2025-09-02 08:56:28.820289

The Fifth District considered and reversed the trial court based on an argument that the appellant had raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing.
The Sixth District's opinion notes, however, that its reasoning regarding preservation ""does not apply when a trial court grants a motion for rehearing and then rejects a new argument on its merits.""
""In such a case, the trial court has exercised its discretion to grant rehearing and consider the newly raised argument.""
There, the trial court had also denied the plaintiff's motion for continuance and request for an additional 90 days to complete discovery.","The short answer: It depends! Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.530 explicitly states that on a motion for rehearing of ""matters heard without a jury, including summary judgments, the court may open the judgement if one has been entered, take additional testimony, and enter a new judgment."" Though the rule does not prohibit the making of new arguments in a motion for rehearing, whether such arguments are considered preserved for purposes of appeal is another matter. For those not versed in appellate speak, ""unpreserved"" means the appellate court will not consider the argument on appeal.

Florida's Sixth District Court of Appeal recently weighed in on this issue and held that a new argument presented to the trial court for the first time in a motion for rehearing (under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.530) is unpreserved for purposes of the appeal, provided the trial court summarily denies the motion. Melrose Ventures, LLC v. Uptempo Mktg. Corp., No. 6D2023-3824, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 (Fla. 6th DCA 2025). In so holding, Florida's newest appellate court joined the Second, Third, and Fourth Districts ""who have already found that, as a general rule, new and different arguments untimely raised for the first time in motions for rehearing which were denied are unpreserved."" Id. at *4-5.

The Sixth District noted that the Third District had previously made the opposite holding in Bailey v. Treasure, 462 So. 2d 537, 539 (Fla. 3d DCA 1985) but because Bailey did not ""appear to be the currently prevailing law of the Third District,"" it did not certify conflict with Bailey. Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *5, n.4. But see Walden v. Chase Manhattan Bank, U.S.A., N.A., 872 So. 2d 432, 433 (Fla. 4th DCA 2004) (noting that a summary judgment ""is not final until a motion for rehearing is considered"" and reversing summary judgment based in part on ""supplement affidavits filed with the motion for rehearing"").

The Sixth District certified conflict with two opinions of the Fifth District which held that a party can preserve a new argument by raising it for the first time on rehearing. Id. at *7 (certifying conflict with Kawsar v. Alhamdi Grp., LLC, 369 So. 3d 1227, 1230 (Fla. 5th DCA 2023) and Elser v. Law Offs. Of James M. Russ, P.A., 679 So. 2d 309 (Fla. 5th DCA 1996)).

In Elser, the Fifth District reasoned that an ""order granting a motion for summary judgment is not final until the motion for rehearing is considered and disposed. 679 So. 2d at 312. ""Until then, a trial judge is free to consider any legal error or matter overlooked related to the entry of the summary judgment. Indeed, that is the very purpose of a motion for rehearing."" Id. The Fifth District considered and reversed the trial court based on an argument that the appellant had raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing.

The Sixth District, of course, is not bound by the decisions of its sister courts and made clear shortly after its creation that it intended to write on a clean slate. See CED Cap. Holdings 2000 EB, LLC v. CTCW-Berkshire Club, LLC, 363 So. 3d 192, 195 (Fla. 6th DCA 2023). As such, the Sixth District declined to follow Elser and was instead persuaded by the concurring opinion in the later Fifth District case of Kawsar. There, Judge Eisnaugle wrote that he agreed that the panel was bound by Elser, but that in his view Elser was wrongly decided. 369 So. 3d at 1229 (Eisnaugle, J., concurring). ""Agreeing with his well-reasoned analysis,"" the Sixth District expressly adopted the view that ""to preserve an argument, a party must make a timely, contemporaneous objection at the time of the alleged error."" Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *5-6 (cleaned up).

The Sixth District's opinion notes, however, that its reasoning regarding preservation ""does not apply when a trial court grants a motion for rehearing and then rejects a new argument on its merits."" Id. at *5 n.3. ""In such a case, the trial court has exercised its discretion to grant rehearing and consider the newly raised argument."" Id. (citing Crocker v. Crocker, 370 So. 3d 363, 365 (Fla. 5th DCA 2023)). It also does not apply to issues that could not have been raised before rehearing, such as when an error appears for the first time on the face of the order. Id. And, indeed, Rule 1.530 mandates that the failure of a trial court to make required findings of fact in the final judgment must be raised in a motion for rehearing for a party to preserve such a challenge on appeal.

Of course, a trial court has broad discretion to consider and address arguments that are raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing. A trial court may decide to do so, for example, to prevent what it would consider an injustice to a party resulting from an error or omission by one of the lawyers. And, indeed, appellate courts have held in some cases that a trial court abused its discretion by not considering an issue raised for the first time on rehearing. Those cases, however, typically involve ""extraordinary"" or ""exigent"" circumstances. See Dalrymple v. Franzese, 944 So. 2d 1240 (Fla. 4th DCA 2006). In Dalrymple, for example, the appellate court held that the trial court abused its discretion in not considering the affidavit of an expert witness that was attached to a motion for rehearing where, because of Hurricane Wilma and its aftermath, the expert was unable to meet with the investigating officer and complete his investigation and affidavit before the summary judgment hearing. Id. at 1242-43. There, the trial court had also denied the plaintiff's motion for continuance and request for an additional 90 days to complete discovery.

In sum, the district in which the trial court sits will determine whether an argument raised for the first time in a motion for rehearing will be considered preserved for purposes of the appeal. As the First District does not appear to have yet decided the issue, counsel are free to argue that whichever side best serves their client in a particular case. Counsel in the Sixth, Fourth, Third or Second District who think the trial court abused its discretion in not considering an ""untimely"" argument should make that argument to the appellate court, though the standard of review presents an uphill battle. See Melrose Ventures, 2025 Fla. App. LEXIS 5712 at *4 (noting that appellants ""made no attempt"" to show the Sixth District that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the motion for rehearing).

Of course, the Florida Supreme Court could take up the issue and settle the conflict. The Fifth District could also decide, en banc, to recede from Elser if a later case presents an appropriate opportunity to do so. See BAM Trading Servs., Inc. v. State, 395 So. 3d 687, 694 (Fla. 1st DCA 2024) (Bilbrey, J., concurring) (""When faced with erroneous precedent, barring a decision from a higher court or a legislative change, we are required to consider the matter en banc before we can recede from it.""). Meanwhile, the particular district in which appellate litigants find themselves will likely be determinative of whether the arguments of their trial counsel made for the first time in a motion for rehearing will be considered on appeal.

Remember that motions for rehearing directed to final orders must be filed within 15 days of the filing of the order. See Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.530(b). However, motions for reconsideration, which are directed to non-final orders, are based on the trial court's inherent authority to reconsider any of its rulings prior to entry of the final judgment and, thus, may be filed at any point prior to entry of final judgment. See Seigler v. Bell, 148 So. 3d 473, 478-79 (Fla. 5th DCA 2014).

Union officials have said the loss of bargaining rights for federal employees inevitably hurts the members of the public the agencies serve.
If the administration prevails, it could mark the beginning of a broader erosion of collective bargaining rights, some analysts said.
But what Mr. Reagan did in 1981 looks moderate compared to what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. McCartin added.
In 1979, for example, President Jimmy Carter ordered employees in the Treasury Department’s office of intelligence support to be excluded from union rights.","More than 445,000 federal employees saw their union protections disappear in August, as agencies moved to comply with an executive order President Trump signed earlier this year that called for ignoring collective bargaining contracts with nearly one million workers.

The termination of protections followed an Aug. 1 appeals court ruling on legal challenges to Mr. Trump’s directive. The order, signed in late March, directed 22 agencies to ignore contracts for employees in specific unions. Last Thursday, Mr. Trump signed a second executive order stripping union rights from thousands of other employees at six additional agencies.

Mr. Trump said that the affected workers had roles that touched on national security, and that provisions in their labor contracts could interfere with his policies being carried out. He cited, for example, the role that Department of Veterans Affairs employees play in providing care for wounded troops in wartime.

Federal labor unions targeted in the executive orders have repeatedly sued the Trump administration, and in some cases forced the administration to temporarily pause the president’s efforts to shrink the federal work force and reshape the government. The American Federation of Government Employees has filed more than a dozen lawsuits related to the federal work force. The White House has likened this to a declaration of “war.”

So far, nine agencies have terminated union contracts that covered more than 445,000 federal workers from the Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Coast Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency, General Services Administration, the Departments of Health and Human Services, Agriculture and Veterans Affairs, and parts of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services.

“This is literally the largest act of union busting in American history,” said Mike Podhorzer, a former political director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. “There’s not another time when that many people lost their union.”

The attack on public sector labor unions is part of a broader effort by Mr. Trump to assert more control of the federal work force and make it easier to fire civil servants. The president has also crippled several independent boards that adjudicate employment disputes, interfering with a critical resource employees have to challenge their terminations.

Mr. Podhorzer and some labor historians predicted that Mr. Trump would strip bargaining rights from even more of the federal work force, and that the trend would eventually reach private sector unions.

At the V.A., where 395,000 employees lost their union rights, people who planned to take 16 weeks of parental leave, as negotiated in their union contracts, will only have a guarantee of 12 weeks, the minimum required by law. About 1,500 food service workers across the country will no longer get meal allowances, like free lunches. And employees working long shifts are no longer guaranteed a rest period that was negotiated for safety reasons.

Union officials have said the loss of bargaining rights for federal employees inevitably hurts the members of the public the agencies serve.

Inspectors at the Agriculture Department’s food safety and inspection division no longer have a formal process to raise safety concerns about products without facing retaliation, said Paula Soldner, the chair of the National Joint Council of Food Inspection Locals, which is part of the American Federation of Government Employees.

“Inspectors are very reluctant to bring things to a supervisor’s attention in fear for their jobs,” she said. That could mean unsafe consumer products end up being sold to the public, she added.

At the V.A., employees regularly speak up about caregiving issues and appointment backlogs, said Naveed A. Shah, the political director at Common Defense, a veterans advocacy group.

“They could have addressed those challenges with management in the past and known that they have the support of the union to ensure that they aren’t going to be retaliated against or fired for bringing up those type of issues,” Mr. Shah said. “And now they don’t have that.”

That has already happened in the few weeks that nurses have been working without contracts, said Irma Westmoreland, a nurse at a veterans medical center in Atlanta and the chair of National Nurses United’s V.A. division.

This year, patient care problems related to staffing shortages have been on the rise because of the Trump administration’s efforts to shrink the federal work force, Ms. Westmoreland said. Nurses continue to document concerns, but agency managers have not been as responsive because they no longer have to be.

Union representatives can continue to help members with work-related disputes, Ms. Westmoreland said, but they have to take vacation time to do it.

The legal battle over Mr. Trump’s orders has continued, in some cases holding up the termination of more union contracts.

If the administration prevails, it could mark the beginning of a broader erosion of collective bargaining rights, some analysts said.

“What this does is signal to private sector employers that they can go to war with the unions” and not face legal consequences, said Erik Loomis, a labor historian at the University of Rhode Island.

Joseph A. McCartin, a labor history professor at Georgetown University, pointed to the impact of President Ronald Reagan’s firing of air traffic controllers in 1981.

“It demonstrated to private sector employers the leverage that could be had by taking an aggressive approach to unions, to collective bargaining,” he said. But what Mr. Reagan did in 1981 looks moderate compared to what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. McCartin added.

“It is an action that’s almost incomparable in terms of what a president can do to undermine unions,” Mr. McCartin said.

And a recent decision in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, if upheld, would further hurt private sector unions by allowing the president to fire board members of the National Labor Relations Board, which was created to oversee and enforce federal labor law.

During his first term, Mr. Trump had a more moderate position on labor unions, Mr. Loomis said, and his labor secretaries operated within the standards of collective bargaining.

This time is different.

To strip collective bargaining rights from nearly half of the federal work force, Mr. Trump leaned on a provision in a 1978 law that gives the president the authority to exclude certain agencies or divisions from collective bargaining rights if there is “primary function intelligence, counterintelligence, investigative or national security work.”

Mr. Loomis said that identifying national security as the primary function in some of the agencies targeted was spurious at best. But as a result, Mr. Trump’s directive applies far more broadly than previous orders.

In 1979, for example, President Jimmy Carter ordered employees in the Treasury Department’s office of intelligence support to be excluded from union rights. Mr. Trump’s order calls for the entire Treasury Department to be stripped of collective bargaining rights, with the exception of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

“We represent janitorial staff,” said Lee Blackmon, the director of the federal division of the National Association of Government Employees. “What is it that they do that impacts national security?”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/29/multimedia/00dc-unions-01-gzlp/00dc-unions-01-gzlp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 06:57:03.675997

Who should apply: If the plan is approved by the board, the county’s Department of Consumer and Business Affairs would have 60 days to set up a new Emergency Rent Relief Program. It would prioritize a few groups of people:

Renters who lost income because of the fires

Displaced families who have run out of rent support from insurance plans or FEMA

Small landlords struggling to pay for post-fire building repairs

Households that have lost income because of federal immigration raids

The context: Shortly after the fires, L.A. County leaders approved eviction protections that allowed tenants to delay paying rent if they qualified under the county’s rules and gave their landlords sufficient notice.

Those eviction protections ended on July 30. Meanwhile, local governments have so far offered little in the way of public assistance to immigrant families who have seen their breadwinners detained or avoiding going to work because of potential detention.

How to participate: Tuesday’s vote will take place during the board’s regular meeting, which starts at 11 a.m. It can be viewed in person or remotely at this link.

What’s next: If the board approves the plan, county officials would also be instructed to seek additional funding for the program, including through philanthropic donations or from the new L.A.

Voces Unidas President and CEO Alex Sanchez filed two complaints on Aug. 14 with Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office over incidents involving the Garfield County Sheriff’s Office and the 14th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which covers Routt, Moffat and Grand counties.

Voces Unidas shared both complaints with the Summit Daily News.

Sanchez said the incidents, which involved some communication between those offices and ICE, raised concern because of state laws that restrict information sharing and coordination with federal immigration enforcement officials.

“Our organization has been hearing from community members in the Western Slope, in particular, about some of the distrust that they have with our local governments,” Sanchez said in an interview.

Colorado lawmakers over the past several years have moved to limit ICE’s reach in local communities, starting with a major law in 2019 that prohibits law enforcement from complying with ICE “detainers,” which is a request by the federal agency to hold someone in jail past their release time so that they may be taken into federal custody.

That law also prevents law enforcement from sharing immigration-related information about an individual with ICE, and makes it illegal for local authorities to arrest someone just based on their immigration status.

Other laws passed in 2021 and 2025 block state agencies, judicial and legislative branches, as well as local governments, from sharing an individual’s personal information with ICE, unless it is for a federal criminal investigation where a judge has issued a warrant. The 2025 law, Senate Bill 276 , also carries a $50,000 fine per violation.

ICE activity has been top of mind for advocates as the federal government expands immigration enforcement operations across the country, including in Colorado’s mountain towns . ICE is also reportedly planning to double its detention spaces this year with new facilities, including three planned in Colorado, according to reporting by The Washington Post .

Sanchez said it’s important for state and local agencies not to be seen by the immigrant community as an extension of ICE, which he worries would have a chilling effect on people’s participation with law enforcement. He said his organization is not interested in what a person’s criminal charges are, just that state laws and due process are being upheld.

“What Voces Unidas is interested in is ensuring that we don’t erode the public trust between the community and our local municipalities and local police departments,” he said.

Both the Garfield County sheriff and the district attorney for the 14th Judicial District say they complied with state laws and deny any wrongdoing.

When reached for comment, Garfield County Sheriff Lou Vallario said he was unaware of the complaint filed against his office, while District Attorney Matt Karzen learned about the allegations against his office from a post Voces Unidas made on its website last week. The group also posted about the Garfield County incident .

Lawrence Pacheco, a spokesperson for Weiser’s office, did not comment on the complaints.

Man taken into ICE custody in Garfield jail’s sallyport

The complaint lodged against Vallario’s office centers around a man who was arrested and jailed in Garfield County on Aug. 8 and released later that day into ICE custody.

Sanchez said Voces Unidas spoke with the man’s family after he’d been detained by ICE, and the organization called the jail in Glenwood Springs to confirm what happened. According to the complaint, they were told by a sheriff’s deputy that the man had “bonded out” and was taken into ICE custody in the jail’s sallyport, which is used for secure entrances and exits.

Sanchez said the incident “felt like the transfer of an inmate,” which spurred suspicion from Voces Unidas that it could have violated restrictions on ICE collaboration. He said the man should have been allowed to leave the jail, after which point ICE could have detained him.

“He was not allowed to the freedom that he absolutely deserved because he was already bonded out,” Sanchez said. “It wasn’t like ICE was across the street and this was an encounter of chance.”

Vallario said the man was charged with resisting arrest, a protection order violation, driving without a license, fictitious license plates, open containers for alcohol and marijuana, and driving without taillights. He said he isn’t aware of any federal criminal charges against the man.

Vallario confirmed in a phone interview that the man was detained by ICE in the jail’s sallyport and said there’s “nothing that I’m aware of that prohibits us from making that transfer” in that area.

SB 276 does require public buildings like schools, libraries and child care centers to develop policies for giving ICE access to non-public spaces. But it does not prevent immigration officers from operating in private sections of government buildings, like jails, if given permission.

It is common practice for law enforcement to tell ICE when an inmate is going to be released from a jail, Vallario added. He said his office does not hold people for ICE or share information about their immigration status, which would be a violation of state law.

“Once they’re released from custody, it is up to (ICE), whether or not they want to come and pick them up and hold them or not,” Vallario said. “In this particular case, it appears they did.”

Violeta Chapin, an immigration law professor at the University of Colorado School of Law in Boulder, said law enforcement officials can communicate with ICE about an inmate’s release under state law.

She said ICE can also perform operations under “administrative warrants,” which are signed by immigration officials, not a judge.

“Immigration officials are allowed to execute administrative warrants in public places, or, if they’re given permission to enter (non-public spaces),” said Chapin, who has a background in assisting immigrants’ legal cases as head of the university’s pro bono immigration defense clinic.

Chapin added, however, that even if an agency like a sheriff’s office is following the law, its actions can lead to a perception in the community that it’s helping ICE with detainments.

“That will have consequences for how people in the community see local law enforcement,” Chapin said.

Vallario has expressed frustration with the state’s immigration laws, and earlier this year wrote a column explaining what his office is, and isn’t, allowed to do under state laws.

Garfield County has also pushed back on claims of being a “sanctuary” community. Commissioners last year passed a resolution rejecting the term , which was condemned by local immigration leaders who called the resolution’s language “divisive.”

The resolution said people who enter the country illegally can pose a “significant public health and safety risk,” tying them to increased crime, disease and demand on public infrastructure and services.

Prosecutor in Steamboat discussed ‘detainer’ on defendant in court

Sanchez’s other complaint is against the 14th Judicial District Attorney’s Office, which had received information from ICE about the potential detainment of a defendant in district court that was then discussed in a court hearing last month.

Court transcripts show that during a July 31 bond hearing in Steamboat Springs, Deputy District Attorney Joseph Bucci told Judge Erin Wilson he had “received information from the federal government that ICE has lodged a detainer against this defendant.”

The defendant in the Steamboat Springs case, a woman, was arrested for theft and felony identity theft . She had been arrested alongside a man, who faces the same charges and also has charges of felony identity theft in Adams County, according to the district attorney’s office.

All of those are state charges, and the district attorney’s office said it is not aware of any federal charges or warrants.

Sanchez said information sharing with federal immigration officials is only allowed during federal criminal investigations, and questioned why the district attorney’s office would be communicating with ICE to learn about a detainer and why it would be discussed during a bond hearing over state charges.

He added that a detainer — a request by ICE for local law enforcement to hold someone — shouldn’t be relevant since Colorado authorities aren’t allowed to comply with the request.

“Again, we need the public to trust local DAs. We need the public to be able to report crimes. We need the public to want to come to court,” Sanchez said. “We need the system to work and to work for everyone.”

Karzen, the district attorney, said asking ICE if a detainer has been lodged against a defendant is not the same as sharing immigration-related information with ICE. He said the practice is within state law and necessary for his office to do its job.

Karzen learned about the allegations made by Voces Unidas after a county commissioner reached out to his office to inquire about the post that was made on the advocacy group’s website.

When reached for comment over email, Karzen shared an Aug. 13 email he’d sent to Routt County Attorney Lynaia South in which he explained the process for reaching out to ICE about detainers.

Karzen said his office has periodically gotten cases where the accused person has a criminal history that indicates they have previously been removed from the country by ICE.

“With the increase in immigration enforcement, we began to see cases where ICE detained the person but we did not know about it,” meaning that person would not appear in court, Karzen wrote.

Karzen said his office has started to ask ICE when defendants are in their custody if they believe someone may have been detained and/or removed in the past, as noted in their criminal history. If someone is in ICE detention, Karzen said his office needs to know so they can adjust accordingly, such as obtaining a video court appearance from the defendant in an ICE facility.

In the Steamboat Springs case, Karzen said both defendants had identifications of prior detention and/or removals, and that the deputy district attorney needed to know if ICE was intending to detain and/or deport the defendants in the case so he could make decisions around bonds, a plea and sentencing agreement, or any victim interactions required under the Victims’ Rights Act. He also said it is important for court scheduling and case management.

Karzen said asking ICE about the status of a defendant as it relates to detention is the extent of his office’s interactions with the federal agency. He added that his office is requesting information, not providing it to ICE.

Chapin, the CU law professor, said she would argue that discussing someone’s detainer in state court is irrelevant to their criminal proceedings. But she said prosecutors aren’t prohibited from having or sharing that information in court.

In an emailed response to questions from the Summit Daily, Karzen called Voces Unidas’ complaint against his office “profoundly disappointing,” saying the group never reached out to his office “for comment, or to articulate their concerns or ask for an explanation.”

“Voces Unidas appears to be an important vehicle of advocacy on the Western Slope in an area where such advocacy has perhaps never been more important,” Karzen said, “and yet their lack of due diligence and apparent apathy as to the full truth regarding these matters is exactly the kind of thing that can destroy credibility.”

Legal battles arise

Sanchez said Voces Unidas sent both complaints to the attorney general’s office “so that they can actually review the facts, have conversations, and then make a determination whether in fact there was inappropriate behavior or not.”

Sanchez said the enactment of SB 276 earlier this year provides local groups with an important tool for accountability since it carries, for the first time, fines for violations.

Whether the attorney general’s office will act on the complaints is unclear. Pacheco, the spokesperson, declined to say how many complaints the office has received following the enactment of SB 276.

The law has, however, already sparked several legal battles, including a July 22 lawsuit filed by Weiser’s office against a Mesa County Sheriff’s Office deputy who allegedly shared information with federal immigration officials that led to the arrest of a Utah college student who had an expired visa.

Mesa County later countersued, claiming that the state law is too vague.

Another lawsuit was filed on June 4 against Gov. Jared Polis by Scott Moss, the head of the Colorado Division of Labor Standards and Statistics. Moss alleges that Polis sought to force his department to provide information to ICE regarding 35 state-vetted adult sponsors who were housing unaccompanied immigrant children.

Moss said the request from ICE was not backed by a court-issued warrant and that complying with it would violate the state’s laws on information sharing.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/9/2025/08/19174332/Sanchez-1-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-02 02:57:26.249126

Jamal’s attorney said that a judge previously granted Jamal protection against deportation.

“Years ago, a U.S. immigration judge found that Mr. Jamal would face persecution if returned to Somalia and granted him protection from removal under U.S. law,” said attorney Abdiqani A. Jabane. “We are aware that ICE may now be exploring alternate removal options. However, Mr. Jamal is not a citizen of any other country, including Canada.”

According to KARE-TV, court records from 2005 show Jamal was previously convicted of immigration fraud in Tennessee, resulting in one year of probation, which included being referred to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for deportation. In later filings, documents show his attempt to appeal the conviction was unsuccessful, but he was not deported.

Jabane said his office is “reviewing the basis for his detention and will pursue all appropriate legal avenues to protect his rights and ensure he is treated in accordance with the law.

Rome signed the Italy–Libya Memorandum in 2017, funding and equipping Libyan patrols.","The European Union’s efforts to secure its external borders have been questioned after a Libyan naval vessel opened fire on a French ship that was rescuing migrants.

Although no one was killed or injured, the incident has led to a major political row in Italy, which gave the Libyans the boat as part of an EU program.

On Aug. 24, the Ocean Viking, a ship belonging to the French NGO SOS Méditerranée, came under fire in international waters about 40 nautical miles off the coast of Libya.

The Ocean Viking had just rescued 87 people from a rubber dinghy when a Libyan coast guard patrol boat approached and opened fire at close range.

“Without any warning or ultimatum, two men aboard the patrol vessel opened fire on our humanitarian ship, unleashing at least 20 relentless minutes of assault gunfire directly at us,” the NGO said in a statement, denouncing what it called a “violent and deliberate attack.”

The vessel sustained serious damage: shattered windows, broken antennnae, bullet holes in the bridge and destroyed rescue equipment. Prosecutors in Siracusa, Sicily have opened a criminal investigation into the attack. Last week, police boarded the Ocean Viking in the town of Augusta in Sicily, where the 87 rescued migrants disembarked, to inspect the damage and gather testimony.

According to SOS Méditerranée, the boat that attacked them was a Corrubia-class patrol vessel built in Italy and given to Libya in 2023 under the EU Border Assistance Mission in Libya program, part of Europe’s strategy of outsourcing border control.

During the attack, the Ocean Viking crew issued a mayday call and alerted NATO, which referred them to the Italian navy. “However, the Italian Navy never answered the phone,” the NGO said in its statement.

Valeria Taurino, the director of SOS Méditerranée Italy, called for “a thorough investigation” into the incident and an end to European cooperation with Libya. “An entity that makes illegal claims in international waters, obstructs rescues, and attacks unarmed humanitarian operators cannot be considered a competent authority,” she said.

After the 87 rescued people left the ship, the Ocean Viking and its crew were held in isolation for several days on health grounds, as one of those rescued tested positive for tuberculosis. On Friday the NGO announced the Italian authorities had finally lifted the quarantine, allowing the crew to disembark.

The Italian government — led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni — has been clamping down on NGOs as part of its drive to reduce migration. On Monday another rescue ship — the Mediterranea — was placed under administrative detention after it let 10 migrants disembark in Trapani — the nearest safe port — instead of following Interior Ministry orders to sail to Genoa, some 770 kilometers away.

The move reflects stricter rules introduced in 2023 by Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi, which require that NGO ships notify authorities after a rescue and then sail immediately to a designated port, often hundreds of kilometers away. Critics say the measure cripples rescue operations by forcing vessels to make long detours.

“It’s like forcing a burn victim to remain in the flames,” said Laura Marmorale, president of Mediterranea Saving Humans, denouncing the policy as “inhumane” and “unacceptable.”

The incidents have led to sharp criticism of the Italian government. Opposition leader Elly Schlein of the Democratic Party urged the government to end its migration deal with Libya, while Green Europe lawmaker Angelo Bonelli condemned the use of Italian-built boats to launch attacks on NGOs. He denounced Meloni’s silence as a “political and moral surrender that humiliates our country before Europe and the world.”

However, Piantedosi pointed the finger at NGOs rather than at the Libyan shooters. “It is the State that fights human traffickers and manages and coordinates rescues at sea. Not the NGOs,” he wrote on social media.

EU institutions reacted more cautiously. During a press briefing on Tuesday, a Commission spokesperson described the Ocean Viking episode as “worrying,” saying Brussels had contacted Libyan authorities to “clarify the facts.” The EU’s border agency Frontex called the incident “deeply concerning” and called for a swift investigation, stressing: “No rescuer should ever be put in danger while carrying out life-saving work.”

Speaking at a conference in Rimini last week, Meloni said her policies had “drastically” reduced arrivals and cut “the number of deaths and missing persons at sea.” She framed her migration crackdown as a humanitarian success: “Nothing is more important than saving a human life, than tearing it away from the claws of human traffickers.”

Yet critics argue that Italy’s approach comes at the cost of partnering with abusive countries.

In January, the government faced backlash for releasing Osama Al-Masri Njeem, a Libyan general wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes. A 2021 video shared by the NGO Refugees in Libya shows Al-Masri allegedly executing a man in Tripoli.

EU’s migration gamble

The attack on the NGO vessel has highlighted Europe’s uneasy partnership with Libya.

Since the ousting of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has fractured and become a major transit hub for migrants from Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia.

Despite widespread reports of torture, sexual violence and forced labor in Libya’s detention system, the EU and Italy have continued to support the Libyan coast guard. Rome signed the Italy–Libya Memorandum in 2017, funding and equipping Libyan patrols. The deal, criticized by rights groups, was renewed in 2019 and again in 2023. Since taking office in 2022, Meloni has tightened those ties further, securing an $8 billion gas deal in 2023.

At the same time, the EU has spent more than €91 million on border and migration management in Libya since 2014 as part of a €338 million migration package, while Italy has spent nearly €300 million on containment measures since 2017.

But oversight of these funds remains weak. In a report released in September 2024, the European Court of Auditors warned that more than €5 billion from the EU Trust Fund for Africa had been disbursed with insufficient controls.

Europe’s reliance on Libya is complicated further by rivalries with other powers. Russia has expanded its presence through arms supplies and a planned naval base in Tobruk, while Turkey is accused of cutting maritime deals with Libyan authorities that Greece deems illegal under international law.

In July, EU Migration Commissioner Magnus Brunner defended the need for Brussels to activate talks with Libyan strongman Khalifa Haftar as a necessary step to prevent Russian President Vladimir Putin from further weaponizing migration.

“There is certainly a danger that Russia … [will] use migrants and the migration issue as a weapon against Europe,” he told POLITICO. “This weaponization is taking place, and of course we also fear that Russia intends to do the same with Libya.”

In July, Brunner was ejected from Benghazi as “persona non grata” over an apparent breakdown in diplomatic protocol. He had been leading a delegation of senior EU representatives — including ministers from Italy, Malta and Greece — in an attempt to discuss efforts to tackle the flow of migrants into Europe from the country.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/01/11916904-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-09-01 22:56:16.706524

Yvette Cooper announced a crackdown on refugees bringing family members into Britain, prompting backlash for restricting the last safe route for women and children.

Reforms will be made to the interpretation of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which protects the right to private and family life.

New applications under the existing refugee family reunion route will be temporarily suspended this week, the Home Secretary added.

A new framework will be introduced in spring, but until then, “refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else,” Ms Cooper said.

Care4Calais CEO Steve Smith said: “We are forever hearing cries that refugees seeking protection should do so through official channels, but here we have the government restricting the last available safe route for women and children.

“Shutting off the hope of family reunification will only force more women and children to take dangerous journeys to seek sanctuary, including risking their lives by crossing the Channel.

“This is an ill-conceived approach from a government that won’t stand up to the rhetoric of Reform, nor the far-right hate we are witnessing on our streets, but is instead mimicking it and making things substantially worse for refugees, communities and themselves.”

Stand Up To Racism also slammed the decision.

Co-convener Sabby Dhalu said: “The right to asylum and to a family life are basic human rights that the government should be protecting.

“Instead it is making concession after concession to an emboldened far right.”

Ms Cooper reiterated the government’s pledge to close refugee hotels “for good,” boasting that it had already cut costs by £1 billion in the last financial year.

It comes following a summer of demonstrations organised by the far right outside asylum accommodation up and down the country.

“ We are reconfiguring sites, increasing room sharing, tightening the test for accommodation, and working at pace to identify alternative, cheaper and more appropriate accommodation with other government departments and with local authorities”, she said.

Migrants Rights Network CEO Fizza Qureshi said: “Conditions in these hotels are not suitable for people awaiting asylum decisions, particularly when we know of people who have been waiting for six years or more for an outcome.

“However, the decision to end the use of asylum hotels should be made on the basis of welfare for those seeking asylum, not pandering to the far right.”

Ms Qureshi urged the Home Office to create sustainable solutions that allow asylum-seekers to be part of communities, rather than “basing policy decisions on the demands of racist demonstrations.”

The Home Secretary also gave an update on a pilot scheme with France, which will see some refugees arriving by small boats returned to the country, saying that the first returns will begin “later this month.”

She blasted the previous Tory government for leaving an asylum and immigration system in “chaos” with a soaring asylum backlog.

But Amnesty UK’s Steve Valdez-Symonds said the condemnation “rings hollow because she pursues largely the same ambitions.”

“She does so by applying the very misguided rules her predecessors introduced, and the dismal results are clear for all to see.

“The clear reason for the appeals backlog, of which she complains, is that she is refusing asylum to people who are refugees, but who cannot meet the flawed rules in the Nationality and Borders Act 2022.

“The Home Secretary may say she is standing against hate, division and chaos, but yet again she has reacted to precisely these evils by doing more harm to refugees — the very people most targeted by them.”

Freedom from Torture’s Sile Reynolds said: “For survivors of torture, reuniting with their wives and children enables them to move on from the horrors of their past in the knowledge that their loved ones are safe.

“The solution that the Home Secretary is failing to grasp is so simple: improve initial asylum decisions and stop punishing refugees so that they stand a chance of rebuilding their lives amongst friends and family in our communities.”",https://morningstaronline.co.uk/sites/default/files/styles/wide/public/2025-09/PA-81163036.jpg.webp?itok=zBuRWcYG,N,,2025-09-01 22:56:21.645392

For the Coalition, it was about stopping so-called “illegals”.

For Labor, it was framed as “saving lives at sea”.

For both, it was about keeping people seeking asylum out of contact with the Australian community, demonised and dehumanised, called by numbers, not names.

Against this backdrop, it’s perhaps unsurprising Australians turned out in the thousands to rally against immigration this weekend. It could be seen as the culmination of years of MPs using immigration issues for short-term political gain.

But just as government messaging has partly contributed to this situation, it could also help get us out of it.

Not always ‘sinister invaders’

Political language about immigration wasn’t always so negative.

At the end of the second world war, then-Prime Minister Ben Chifley welcomed 170,000 refugees and other displaced people from Europe.

In the 1970s, when the first boats of Vietnamese asylum seekers arrived in Australia’s north, Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser insisted they be treated humanely and processed fairly.

As writer Thomas Keneally recalled:

“there was no long-term mandatory detention involved. The newcomers were not depicted as sinister invaders […] language was not misused and neither were human souls.”

And as former Immigration Minister Andrew Giles said in 2023:

“Seventy years ago, of course, we embarked on a migration journey that has transformed our nation into a diverse and dynamic multicultural society […] in very large part […] shaped by the nearly one million refugees who have come to Australia since the end of WWII. We should take great pride in this.”

‘Real people, real families’

The threatening thuggery on display at the weekend’s anti-immigration marches has been rightly called out by Australian politicians on both sides.

In a change from her predecessor’s hardline approach, Federal Opposition Leader Sussan Ley said while “strong borders keep us safe, they also allow us to be generous and compassionate to those fleeing conflict”.

Meanwhile, Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke reiterated “there is no place in our country for people who seek to divide and undermine our social cohesion”.

At the same time, we can’t simply ignore concerns people have about the impact of immigration on housing, cost of living and infrastructure – much of which is based on misinformation which feeds a far-right agenda, according to Multicultural Affairs Minister Anne Aly.

When misinformation spreads, it impedes evidence-based decision-making and results in poor laws and policies.

The positive role of immigration is something the opposition’s new immigration spokesman, Senator Paul Scarr, wants to stress.

He seems to be setting a new tone based on empathy, not division, drawing on his deep “respect and admiration” for migrant and refugee communities who are making “an outstanding contribution”.

When “we talk about immigration”, he says, “we should never forget that we’re actually talking about real people, real families”.

When Prime Minister Anthony Albanese came to office in 2022, he stressed the importance of a vision for Australia that promotes “unity and optimism, not fear and division”.

The naval base will be providing Building 617 — the Great Lakes Library — as a command center for the immigration operations, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

Last week, Naval Station Great Lakes Commanding Officer Captain Stephen M. Yargosz said in an internal email that agents with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would be stationed at Naval Station Great Lakes from September 2-30.

“These operations are similar to what occurred in Los Angeles earlier this summer. Same DHS team,” Yargosz said in the email, according to a report from the Chicago Sun-Times.

A spokesperson for the base confirmed the Department of Homeland Security asked the Naval Station Great Lakes for “limited support” in regard to immigration operations.

That support was in the form of “facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations.”

Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said on Sunday that while ICE already had operations ongoing in Chicago and throughout Illinois, there will be additional resources added to the operations.

“I won’t disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority, but we will continue to go after the worst of the worst across the country, like President Trump has told us to do,” Noem said.

“Focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe,” she said.

“Operations are ramping up across the country. You’re going to see a ramp up of operations in Chicago, absolutely,” Trump border czar Tom Homan said last week.

“All of these sanctuary cities that refuse to work with ICE, where we know public safety threats are being released every day into this country, especially those cities, we’re going to address that,” Homan said.

Homan did not disclose how many additional ICE agents would be sent to Chicago but that it would be a “large contingent.”

Homan declined to say whether or not the National Guard would be sent to Chicago. “The National Guard will be in cities that have crime problems,” he said.

Illinois Lt. Governor Juliana Stratton, Lake County State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart, Illinois State Representative Rita Mayfield, U.S. Representative Brad Schneider, North Chicago Mayor Leon Rockingham, Jr. and others gathered at Veterans Memorial Park in North Chicago on Friday to oppose the Trump administration’s planned operation.

Stratton called the immigration blitz being staged at Great Lakes an “engineered crisis” not for safety but for “spectacle.”

“Trump does not want law and order. He wants unchecked power and unrelenting intimidation,” Stratton said.

U.S. Representative Brad Schneider said last week that the president’s threat to send National Guard troops to Chicago and “parade masked ICE agents” through Naval Station Great Lakes is an “unnecessary, unacceptable, and dangerous action.”

The Secretary of State for the Home Department

(Yvette Cooper)

With permission, I will update the House on the actions we are taking with France to strengthen our border security and the next steps in our reforms to the asylum system.

The House will be aware that when we came into government, we found an asylum and immigration system in chaos: for seven years, small boat gangs had been allowed to embed their criminal trade along the French coast; the asylum backlog was soaring; and illegal working was being ignored. The previous Government had lost control of the system and, as a result, opened many hundreds of asylum hotels across the country, while returns were a third lower than in 2010. Before leaving office, they deliberately cut asylum decision making by 70%, leaving behind a steeply rising backlog. It is little wonder that people across the country lost confidence in the system and demanded to know why they were paying the price of a system that was so out of control.

However, that does not mean that people rejected the long and proud history of Britain doing our bit to help those fleeing persecution or conflict—including, in the past decade, families from Ukraine, Syria and Hong Kong. It is the British way to do our bit alongside other countries to help those who need sanctuary. However, the system has to be controlled and managed, based on fair and properly enforced rules, not chaos and exploitation driven by criminal smuggler gangs. It is exactly because of our important tradition that substantial reforms are needed now.

In our first year in government, we have taken immediate action, laying the foundations for more fundamental reform. We restored asylum decision making and then rapidly increased the rate of decisions. Had we continued with the previous Government's freeze on asylum decisions, thousands more people would have been in hotels and asylum accommodation by now. Instead, we removed 35,000 people with no right to be here, which included a 28% increase in returns of failed asylum seekers and a 14% increase in removals of foreign criminals. We have increased raids and arrests on illegal working by 50%, and we cut the annual hotel bill by almost a billion pounds in the last financial year. We are rolling out digital ID and biometric kits so that immigration enforcement can check on the spot whether someone has a right to work or a right to be in the UK. On channel crossings and organised immigration crime, we are putting in place new powers, new structures and new international agreements to help to dismantle the criminal industry behind the boats.

I want to update the House on the further steps we are now taking. In August, I signed the new treaty with France allowing us, for the first time, to directly return those who arrive on small boats. The first detentions—of people immediately on arrival in Dover—took place the next day, and we expect the first returns to begin later this month. Applications have been opened for the reciprocal legal route, with the first cases under consideration, subject to strict security checks. We have made it clear that this is a pilot scheme, but the more that we prove the concept at the outset, the better we will be able to develop and grow it.

The principles the treaty embodies are crucial. No one should be making these dangerous or illegal journeys on small boats; if they do, we want to see them swiftly returned. In return, we believe in doing our bit alongside other countries to help those who have fled persecution through managed and controlled legal programmes.

This summer we have taken further action to strengthen enforcement against smuggling gangs. France has reviewed its maritime approach to allow for the interception of taxi boats in French waters, and we will continue to work with France to implement the change as soon as possible. In the past year, the National Crime Agency has led 347 disruptions of immigration crime networks—its highest level on record, and a 40% increase in a year.

Over the summer, we announced a £100 million uplift in funding for border security and up to 300 more personnel in the National Crime Agency focusing on targeting the smuggler gangs. The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill will give them stronger powers: counter-terrorism powers against smuggler gangs, powers to seize and download the mobile phones of small boat arrivals, and the power to ban sex offenders from the asylum system altogether. If Opposition parties work with us to speed the passage of the Bill through the other place, instead of opposing it, those powers could be in place within months, making our country safer and more secure.

Let me turn to the major reforms that are needed to fix the broken asylum system that we inherited. Although we have increased decision making and returns, the overall system remains sclerotic, outdated and unfair. As we committed to in the immigration White Paper, we will shortly set out more radical reforms to modernise the asylum system and boost our border security. We will be tackling the pull factors, strengthening enforcement, making sure that people are treated fairly and reforming the way that the European convention on human rights is interpreted here at home. We will be speeding up the system, cutting numbers and ending the use of hotels, and developing controlled and managed routes for genuine refugees.

At the heart of the reforms will be a complete overhaul of the appeals system—the biggest obstacle to reducing the size of the asylum system and ending hotel use. Tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently waiting for appeals, and under the current system that figure is to grow, with an average wait time already of 54 weeks. We have already funded thousands of additional sitting days this year, and the border security Bill will introduce a statutory timeframe of 24 weeks.

However, we need to go further. We will introduce a new independent body to deal with immigration and asylum appeals. It will be fully independent of Government and staffed by professionally trained adjudicators, with safeguards to ensure high standards. It will be able to surge capacity as needed and to accelerate and prioritise cases, alongside new procedures to tackle repeat applications and unnecessary delays. We are also increasing detention and returns capacity, including a 1,000-bed expansion at Campsfield and Haslar, with the first tranche of additional beds coming online within months to support many thousands more enforced removals each year.

Our reforms will also address the overly complex system for family migration, including changes to the way that article 8 of the ECHR is interpreted. We should be clear that international law is important. It is because other countries know that we abide by international law that we have been able to make new agreements with France, to return people who arrive on small boats, and with Germany, to stop the warehousing of small boats by criminal gangs, and it is why we have been able to explore return hubs partnerships with other European countries. However, we need the interpretation of international law to keep up with the realities and challenges of today's world.

There is one area where we need to make more immediate changes. The current rules for family reunion for refugees were designed many years ago to help families separated by war, conflict and persecution, but the way they are used has now changed. Even just before the pandemic, refugees who applied to bring family to the UK did so on average more than one or two years after they had been granted protection, which was long enough for them to get jobs, find housing and be able to provide their family with some support. In Denmark and Switzerland, those who are granted humanitarian protection are currently not able to apply to bring family for at least two years after protection has been granted.

However, in the UK those family applications now come in, on average, around a month after protection has been granted, often even before a newly granted refugee has left asylum accommodation. As a consequence, refugee families who arrive are far more likely to seek homelessness assistance. Some councils are finding that more than a quarter of their family homelessness applications are linked to refugee family reunion. That is not sustainable. Currently, there are also no conditions on family reunion for refugee sponsors, unlike those in place if the sponsor is a British citizen or long-term UK resident. That is not fair.

The proportion of migrants who have arrived on small boats and then applied to bring family has also increased sharply in recent years, with signs that smuggler gangs are now able to use the promise of family reunion to promote dangerous journeys to the UK. We continue to believe that families staying together is important, which is why we will seek to prioritise family groups among the applicants to come to Britain under our new deal with France, but reforms are needed. So in our asylum policy statement later this year, we will set out a new system for family migration, including looking at contribution requirements, longer periods before newly granted refugees can apply, and dedicated controlled arrangements for unaccompanied children and those fleeing persecution who have family in the UK.

We aim to have some of those changes in place for the spring, but in the meantime we do need to address the immediate pressures on local authorities and the risks from criminal gangs using family reunion as a pull factor to encourage more people on to dangerous boats. Therefore, this week we are bringing forward new immigration rules to temporarily suspend new applications under the existing dedicated refugee family reunion route. Until the new framework is introduced, refugees will be covered by the same family migration rules and conditions as everyone else.

Let me turn next to the action we are taking to ensure that every asylum hotel will be closed for good under this Government, not just by shifting individuals from hotels to other sites but by driving down the numbers in supported accommodation overall, and not in a chaotic way through piecemeal court judgments, but through a controlled, managed and orderly programme: driving down inflow into the asylum system, clearing the appeals backlog, which is crucial, and continuing to increase returns. Within the asylum estate, we are reconfiguring sites, increasing room sharing, tightening the test for accommodation and working at pace to identify alternative, cheaper and more appropriate accommodation with other Departments and with local authorities. We are increasing standards and security and joint public safety co-operation between the police, accommodation providers and the Home Office to ensure that laws and rules are enforced.

I understand and agree with local councils and communities who want the asylum hotels in their communities closed, because we need to close all asylum hotels—we need to do so for good—but that must be done in a controlled and orderly manner, not through a return to the previous Government's chaos that led to the opening of hotels in the first place.

Finally, let me update the House on the continued legal and controlled support that we will provide for those facing conflict and persecution. We will continue to do our bit to support Ukraine, extending the Ukraine permission extension scheme by a further 24 months, with further details to be set out in due course. We are also taking immediate action to rescue children who have been seriously injured in the horrendous onslaught on civilians in Gaza so that they can get the health treatment they need. The Foreign Secretary will update the House shortly on the progress to get those children out.

I confirm that the Home Office has put in place systems to issue expedited visas with biometric checks conducted prior to arrival for children and their immediate accompanying family members. We have done the same for all the Chevening scholars and are now in the process of doing so for the next group of students from Gaza who have been awarded fully funded scholarships and places at UK universities so that they can start their studies in autumn this year. Later this year, we will set out plans to establish a permanent framework for refugee students to come and study in the UK so that we can help more talented young people fleeing war and persecution to find a better future, alongside capped and managed ways for refugees to work here in the UK.

The Government are determined to fix every aspect of the broken system we inherited and to restore the confidence of the British people, solving problems, not exploiting them, with a serious and comprehensive plan, not fantasy claims based on sums that do not add up or gimmicks that failed in the past. What we will never do is seek to stir up chaos, division or hate, because that is not who we are as a country, and that is not what Britain stands for.

This is a practical plan to strengthen our border security, to fix the asylum chaos and to rebuild confidence in an asylum and immigration system that serves our national interests, protects our national security and reflects our national values. When we wave the Union flag, when we wave the St George's flag, when we sing ""God Save the King"" and when we celebrate everything that is great about Britain and about our country, we do so with pride because of the values that our flags, our King and our country represent: togetherness, fairness and decency, respect for each other and respect for the rule of law. That is what our country stands for. That is the British way to fix the problems we face. I commend this statement to the House.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Big_Ben_from_the_Westminster_Bridge.jpg/640px-Big_Ben_from_the_Westminster_Bridge.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 19:56:19.990980

Facing criticism for being on the back foot after a summer of protest outside asylum hotels, they were keen to defend their record and get back on track - but is it too late?

Politics latest: Cooper to suspend family reunion rules for asylum seekers

It's a clear nod to the political void Reform UK has seized on while the prime minister has been on holiday.

Last week, Nigel Farage unveiled his party's mass deportation policy - though the issue of women and children still seems to be worked out.

But perhaps none of that matters as voters overwhelmingly believe Reform cares about this issue - and as Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, pointed out on Monday, voters have lost confidence in the government somewhat to solve what many see as an immigration crisis on their doorstep.

So it's clear the strategy has changed from the government.

Johnson opened his Labor Day remarks with defiance, making it clear once again that a surge of ICE agents and the National Guard are not welcome in Chicago.

""We are going to protect the humanity of every single person in the city of Chicago,"" Johnson said.

Johnson spoke in front of a spirited crowd of several hundred who marched in support of union workers and against the Trump administration. It followed a much quieter event over the weekend at City Hall, where the mayor signed an executive order called ""Protecting Chicago."" It reaffirms the city's Sanctuary City status and urges federal agents not to wear masks.

In the meantime, Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago is preparing to be the base of operations for more ICE agents.

""We do intend to add more resources, to those operations, I won't disclose the details,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Appearing on CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, Noem confirmed that ramped-up immigration enforcement is coming to Illinois but stopped short of saying that the National Guard is coming, too.

""I think it goes hand in hand that first, agents would be sent here in hopes by the administration that an incident erupts to further justify Trump calling our National Guard,"" said Rep. Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia, D-Illinois' 4th District.

In a statement published to the social media platform X on the evening of Aug. 31, the same day as the judge's decision, the Guatemalan government indicated it wanted to prevent the children from staying in shelters and detention centers and that it supports coordinated action to reunify Guatemalan children with their families.

The Guatemalan government has plans to identify the needs of each of the Guatemalan children and intends to include them in social programs in their home country, the government stated. All actions that have been taken in regards to the unaccompanied minors have taken the children's human rights into account and have complied with due process, the government alleged.

NPR asked the Guatemalan government how many children it had requested be returned from the U.S., and whether all of their parents have asked that the children be returned to Guatemala, as a U.S. attorney indicated in a hearing on Aug. 31. The Guatemalan government did not immediately respond and did not directly address those questions in its statement.

The statement appears to contain a factual error. The Guatemalan government said it suggested the idea of sending back the unaccompanied minors to Noem while she was in the country in July. But Noem visited Guatemala on June 26, after making stops in Costa Rica, Honduras and Paraguay in a tour of Central America.

During that visit, Noem and Guatemalan Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez signed agreements, including one to potentially allow people not originally from Guatemala to seek asylum in Guatemala instead of the U.S., despite the fact that U.S. law permits asylum seekers to remain as they comply with court proceedings relevant to their case. Noem was also pictured on June 26 watching people being deported from the U.S. while at La Aurora International Airport in Guatemala City, with U.S. Ambassador to Guatemala Tobin Bradley.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from NPR regarding whether Guatemala had suggested that the unaccompanied minors be returned to Guatemala while Noem was visiting the country in June.

Some attorneys representing the Guatemalan children set to be deported disagree with Guatemala's statement that the process to remove the unaccompanied minors has not disregarded their rights. In the attempt to send children away without allowing them to first finish pursuing their asylum claims, lawyers for the National Immigration Law Center, the law firm representing some of the Guatemalan children in the U.S., believe the U.S. has violated both federal laws and the U.S. constitution.

The ""Workers Over Billionaires"" protest kicked off near the Haymarket Memorial in the West Loop.

The protest's original purpose was to stand united against President Trump's cuts to funding and programs, and attacks on immigrants and minority communities.

But the recent threats made by President Trump to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, and plans confirmed by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to escalate immigration enforcement in the city, made the message bigger.

""No federal troops in the city of Chicago!"" Mayor Brandon Johnson declared at the rally.

Johnson's message to the administration was loud and clear.

""No militarized forces. We're going to defend our democracy in the City of Chicago,"" he said.

""In times like this, coming together on Labor Day takes extra importance.

""I do not want a government takeover, a military takeover of Chicago,"" said North Sider Terry McCaskill. ""How do we come back from that? They've taken over the capital. We're the only ones standing in the way of dictatorship.""

Among those echoing the message that troops under the command of the Trump administration are not welcome in Chicago was U.S. Rep. Jesús ""Chuy"" García, who is concerned that the Trump administration will try to exploit the upcoming Mexican Independence Day Parade.

García said the parade is normally expression of Mexican pride.

""There is no doubt in my mind that there's great potential for provocateurs,"" García said, ""whether they be the federal agents sent here, or others who would want to create a clash and demonstrate imagery where there is a disturbance, a riot, fighting going on to justify a mobilization that otherwise would not be warranted.""

Friends from the South Side and north suburban Evanston shared similar views, saying Trump is ""trying to start martial law, and Chicago is not going to stand for that.""

That’s harmful to public safety because people may be afraid to reach out to law enforcement.","Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser paid a visit to Northwest Colorado last month, attending the 2025 Colorado Water Congress Summer Water Conference in Steamboat Springs.

During his visit, Weiser sat down with the Steamboat Pilot & Today to discuss his 2026 campaign for Colorado governor, as well as several pressing issues affecting Routt and Moffat County residents.

Specifically for Colorado’s Western Slope, Weiser said protecting water rights was top-of-mind.

With about 80% of the state’s water found on the Western Slope , Weiser said it’s imperative that water management “works for our whole state.”

“If we don’t protect water in communities in Colorado, they won’t have a future,” said Weiser.

Weiser noted that protecting forest health goes hand-in-hand with water management, with both issues having a “close climate connection.”

“Having a proactive commitment to how we protect our land, air and water is crucial to this part of the state,” he added.

In addition to protecting Northwest Colorado’s natural resources, Weiser said he is focused on improving youth mental health, not just in the region, but across the state.

While visiting the area, Weiser met with the Craig-Scheckman Family Foundation , a Steamboat-based youth advocacy organization, noting that the foundation’s work on youth mental health is a “model for the whole state.”

“Young people all across Colorado are really hurting,” he said. “There are a lot of indications of those challenges. This community — with incredible on-the-ground work — … It’s inspiring, and it’s pretty special.”

Weiser also noted the importance of providing support to those communities affected by the upcoming closures of the Routt and Moffat County coal plants.

“I care deeply about ensuring a just transition as those plants are closed …,” said Weiser. “We need to make sure that we are investing in these communities and that people here have a future in Northwest Colorado. I believe a core part of that has to be collaboration between Steamboat Springs, Hayden and Craig.”

Weiser also addressed the increase in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in Colorado, emphasizing the seriousness of enforcing state law as it pertains to local law enforcement jurisdictions.

“Colorado law is very clear,” said Weiser. “Colorado law enforcement does law enforcement, not immigration enforcement.”

“We have a shortage of law enforcement resources,” he added. “We cannot allow our law enforcement to be diverted or coerced by the federal government to do their job.”

As attorney general, Weiser filed a lawsuit against a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy who shared a 19-year-old student’s immigration status with ICE in June, according to reporting by the Colorado Sun.

Local law enforcement agencies are barred by state law from coordinating with ICE, something that Weiser plans on continuing to enforce as governor.

Weiser noted that everyone in Colorado should feel safe to contact law enforcement if they are the victim of a crime or a witness to a crime, regardless of immigration status.

“We should be aware of what’s causing this, which is we have a lawless, bullying administration in Washington that has embarked on campaigns designed to intimidate people,” Wesier said.

“What we are seeing at the federal level is not responsible immigration enforcement,” he continued. “What we’re seeing are intimidation campaigns designed to provide fear. That’s harmful to public safety because people may be afraid to reach out to law enforcement. It’s harmful to our future.”

During his time serving as Colorado’s attorney general, Weiser has filed 35 lawsuits against the Trump Administration, and noted that each lawsuit involves a “harmful” violation against the people of Colorado.

Weiser emphasized the weight of President Trump’s January attempt to repeal birthright citizenship, calling it “repulsive to the First Amendment,” as well as his March executive order suspending large U.S. law firms from security clearances and federal resources.

“I find both of those actions egregious and a front to our constitutional freedoms,” he said.

“This administration, time after time after time, has said about AmeriCorps funding, education funding, mental health funding, ‘We’re just not going to give out money that Congress mandated that we give out,'” Weiser continued. “It is a blatant violation of the law.”

Looking back on Gov. Jared Polis’ run in office, Weiser said he respected the governor’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, commending him for his respect of local control and “hard-headed, data-driven thinking.”

Moving forward, Weiser wants to continue to fight the “threat of social media,” something that he and Polis disagree on.

In 2023, Weiser, along with dozens of other states, sued Meta for the exploitation of young users for profit. Earlier this year, Weiser pushed for a bill that would establish social media requirements to protect users, particularly minors. Polis vetoed the bill in April.

“As governor, I’ll sign it,” said Wesier.

“We need governors who bring moral clarity on what our values are and what we’re fighting for,” he continued.

When asked about his confidence in the judicial branch remaining untouched by politics, Weiser said he held some worries, but continues to have faith that the federal court system will continue to be a place where law and order are kept.

“I’m concerned about the integrity and effectiveness of our judiciary given a range of factors,” Weiser said. “I’m also someone who’s hopeful … I see many of these cases as so clearly beyond the pale, but I do believe that the Supreme Court will uphold the rule of law.”",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/8/2025/08/19140954/AG-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 17:56:58.459847

All She Wrote

New Mexico has three ICE detention centers in Otero, Torrance and Cibola counties. The governor is considering a bill to ban immigration detention facilities during an upcoming special legislative session.

Understandably, local governments want to protect these sources of jobs and revenue, but detention centers aren’t your regular, accessible employer. They receive our tax dollars to warehouse human beings, but if you expect responsibility and transparency, you’d be disappointed.

And, of course, they’re politicized. Democrats see hellholes; Republicans see summer camps. What’s the public to make of this?

In recent reporting Patrick Lohmann of Source New Mexico dug beneath the rhetoric following a tour of the Otero County Processing Center by some members of the legislative Courts, Corrections and Criminal Justice Committee.

The August 25 tour was supposed to be a committee activity. Chairman Joseph Cervantes, D-Las Cruces, had worked for months with Otero County’s lobbyist, former Rep. Zach Cook, a Republican, to arrange a tour for the committee. Cook assured him a tour was in the works, but as the date approached Cook wasn’t hearing back from ICE. Cervantes canceled the tour.

Days later, Sen. Crystal Brantley, R-Elephant Butte, arranged a visit when U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was visiting the state. Brantley asked federal officials why the committee hadn’t received permission to visit the facility, and they said they had no request on record to visit the facility.

By this time, the committee schedule was finalized, and Brantley’s tour became “unofficial.”

Eight Republicans and one Democrat, Rep. Andrea Romero of Santa Fe, toured the state’s biggest immigration detention center. They weren’t allowed to speak to detainees. Republicans saw a clean, humane, safe facility with a law library, dental and mental health care, exercise equipment, and computers. They noted the potential loss of 300 jobs and gross receipts tax revenues.

In a news release Brantley said: “ICE will do their job no matter what. Our choice is simple: a clean, safe, and accountable facility here, or one where we have no say in how detained migrants are treated.”

Romero saw hundreds of inmates “who just look absolutely in despair,” sitting or lying on their beds. Recreation equipment was locked up. She was the only one asking about due process, legal representation, and how quickly detainees are deported.

Romero told Lohmann she hoped other elected officials “get an opportunity to really see these places, because it shouldn’t just be one person trying to decipher what’s actually happening. We need to have a lot of transparency around people’s rights, around who we detain, and for what reason.”

Both legislators make good points. Corrections facilities are often the best and sometimes the only job options in rural counties. And wouldn’t we rather have ICE facilities in a state that cares about conditions?

But the question of transparency looms over everything. Why should Cervantes and even Brantley have to go to such lengths for a tour? They are elected officials who want to lay eyes on a facility that receives massive amounts of taxpayer money. If the detention centers are as good as their supporters claim they should welcome the visits.

But it’s ICE we’re talking about here. Police wear uniforms but not masks, catch criminals, and are accountable for what they do. Masked ICE agents dressed in street clothes are supposed to be catching criminals, but instead they prey on moms and dads, restaurant and agricultural workers, students, Dreamers, U.S. citizens, green card holders, and pretty much anybody with brown skin. Arrests are often so violent that detainees are injured.

When U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez visited at the end of July, Otero’s average daily population was 843, and more than 80% had no criminal charges or convictions. This compares to 71% nationally, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

Vasquez was not allowed to speak to detainees, and jailers wouldn’t answer questions about their treatment. He said their phones were broken, and toilets wouldn’t flush. Staff members of U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich visited the Torrance County Detention Center, with 435 detainees, in late May and reported terrible conditions. Nobody has seen the Cibola County Detention Center, population 227, since January 2024.

New Mexico is not an outlier. The feds now have new guidelines that require advance notice for oversight visits and make some facilities off limits—even though the law says members of Congress are not required to provide advance notice.

UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced on Monday that she was “temporarily” suspending new applications to the refugee family reunion route as the government draws up new rules set to be introduced by spring next year.
“The system has to be controlled and managed based on fair and properly enforced rules, not chaos and exploitation driven by criminal smuggler gangs,” she said.

UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced on Monday that she was “temporarily” suspending new applications to the refugee family reunion route as the government draws up new rules set to be introduced by spring next year.

“The system has to be controlled and managed based on fair and properly enforced rules, not chaos and exploitation driven by criminal smuggler gangs,” she said.

Under the current system, an asylum seeker granted indefinite leave to remain in the country can bring in children under the age of 18, and their partner if they can prove they have been in a relationship for at least two years.

Cooper told Parliament that increasing numbers of family reunion applications had placed pressure on housing across the country, with many applying to bring relatives over within about a month. One of the planned reforms would mean longer waiting periods before applying.

Refugee charities blasted the move. Safe Passage, which supports child refugees, accused the government of “giving in to far-right pressure”, saying that it would leave children fleeing war and persecution in countries like Afghanistan, Sudan or Iran “trapped in danger”.

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: “Far from stopping people taking dangerous journeys to cross the Channel, these changes will only push more desperate people into the arms of smugglers in an effort to reunite with loved ones.”

Far right whipping up anger

Cooper announced the move as Labour faced a bumpy return to Parliament after a summer break that has seen anti-immigration protesters repeatedly targeting hotels housing asylum seekers in various parts of England – most recently in Epping, northeast of London, on Sunday.

Facing pressure from Nigel Farage’s hard-right Reform UK party, which has whipped up anger over people arriving in small boats over the English Channel from France, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday that he will accelerate plans to empty the asylum hotels.

Accused of moving too slowly, the government has been eager to demonstrate it is tackling a problem left by previous Conservative-led administrations by brokering return deals with other nations and speeding up the processing of asylum claims.

Cooper said that the UK and France will start implementing a “one in, one out” pilot scheme later this month, with the former sending refugees and asylum seekers to the latter in exchange for approved applicants.

“Applications have also been opened for the reciprocal legal route, with the first cases under consideration subject to strict security checks,” she said, adding that “family groups” would be prioritised under the deal with France.

The government will also establish a new independent body to deal with appeals as tens of thousands of people in asylum accommodation are currently awaiting a decision, Cooper said.

Mr Norton then appealed to the county court, but HHJ Saggerson dismissed his argument that a lawful assessment under section 189A and a lawful personal housing plan were pre-conditions of a valid suitability decision.
HHJ Saggerson said section 189A did not impose any obligations on a reviewing officer - although it could have done - and did not provide that an assessment of suitability is unlawful in the absence of a section 189A assessment.
The application for permission to appeal was lodged with the Supreme Court last month.","A claimant has applied to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal in a dispute over whether a local housing authority is precluded from determining the suitability of offered accommodation if it has not prepared a lawful section 189A(1) assessment, and the further documentation required by that section.

In June this year the Court of Appeal found that Parliament could not have intended that an otherwise lawful offer of accommodation by a local authority could be invalidated for lack of an assessment under section 189A(1) of the Housing Act 1996.

Lord Justice Lewison said section 189A provided that a local authority must make an assessment of the applicant's case if it is satisfied they are homeless or threatened with homelessness and eligible for assistance.

Applicant Thomas Norton complained the accommodation he was offered was unsuitable and asked for a review of Haringey's decision.

The reviewing officer rejected his complaints and Mr Norton's solicitors said no lawful decision on the suitability of the accommodation could be made in the absence of a lawful housing needs section 189A assessment.

HHJ Saggerson said section 189A did not impose any obligations on a reviewing officer - although it could have done - and did not provide that an assessment of suitability is unlawful in the absence of a section 189A assessment.

He said the acid test was whether the reviewing officer had sufficient comprehensive information on which to make a determination.

Mr Norton then appealed, but the Court of Appeal upheld HHJ Saggerson’s decision.

Lord Justice Lewison said Mr Norton “has lost nothing of value” having received the decision on suitability to which he was entitled and which contained no legal flaw.

“In my judgment the consequences of holding that compliance with the duty under section 189A is a condition precedent are stark; and unlikely to reflect Parliament's intention,” Lewison LJ said.

The administration resumed a policy of deporting immigrant detainees to so-called third countries in July, starting with the tiny African nation of Eswatini. Eswatini’s government at one point requested millions of dollars in exchange, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.

Those documents also show that Eswatini was open to detaining 150 people from other nations for more than $10 million from the United States, the newspaper reported.

Eswatini diplomats told The Independent in July that they were blindsided by the Trump administration’s plan to send a group of men with criminal convictions to their country; they had only learned about the flights from social media.

Eswatini officials said they plan to arrange for those detainees to be sent back to their countries of origin, while activists in the country are challenging what they say is an unconstitutional secret agreement with the Trump administration.

The Eswatini government said the men “will be repatriated” and the United Nations International Organization for Migration is working with the country to “facilitate the transit of these inmates to their countries of origin.”

Nearly two months later, those men remain imprisoned in Eswatini.

Officials there had also asked whether the United States expected the deportees to be put on trial and sentenced by local officials once they arrived, according to The Times.

The Independent has requested comment from Homeland Security, Eswatini officials and the UN’s International Organization for Migration for comment.

One of those deported men, Orville Etoria, had completed a prison sentence in 2021 after he was convicted of murder in New York in 1996. He was deported to Eswatini in July, and he is reportedly locked up in Matsapha Correctional Complex despite not facing any new criminal charges.

The Jamaican citizen arrived in the United States on a green card in 1976 at age 12, but an immigration judge revoked his permissions while he was incarcerated. After he was released, he was allowed to legally live and work in the country on the condition that he complete regular check-in appointments with immigration authorities.

The 62-year-old completed a bachelor’s degree while behind bars, then began working at a men’s shelter and pursued a master’s degree in divinity after his release, The Times reported.

Homeland Security officials labeled Etoria and the other men sent to Eswatini “depraved monsters” who are “so uniquely barbaric” that those countries won’t accept them.

Jamaican officials rejected the administration’s claim that the country is not cooperating.

“The Government has not refused the return of any of our nationals to Jamaica,” according to Jamaican foreign minister Kamina J Smith.

Jamaica will “continue its engagements” with the Trump administration to make arrangements “to facilitate the individual’s return to Jamaica,” she wrote in July.

Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, is a land-locked nation of roughly 1.2 million people, bordered by South Africa on virtually all sides and by the southern tip of Mozambique to the east. Its government is the last absolute monarchy on the continent.

The government has failed to investigate extrajudicial killings, journalists and dissidents face threats of arbitrary arrests and detentions, and detainees are “subjected to torture and other ill-treatment,” according to Amnesty International.

Trump’s own State Department tells travelers to “exercise increased caution in Eswatini due to crime and civil unrest.”

Critics and civil rights attorneys have argued that the administration is unnecessarily putting immigrants at severe risk of abuse and violence by sending them to so-called “third countries” where they do not have citizenship, family or any other connections.

A June decision from the Supreme Court opened the door for government officials to send deportees to those countries, including places with poor human rights records and no due process.

The Eswatini flight appeared to be the first successful third-country deportation after Immigration and Customs Enforcement told officials that migrants can be deported from the United States to countries other than their own with as little as six hours’ notice — or no notice at all.

Countries that provide “diplomatic assurances” that they won’t face torture and abuse could be deported without any advance notice, according to the memo. If the State Department believes those assurances are “credible,” then ICE may deport someone to that country “without the need for further procedures.”

Since taking office, the Trump administration has held hundreds of immigrants at the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and deported dozens of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a brutal maximum-security prison in El Salvador, which marked the administration’s first arrangement of third-country removals.

After a weeks-long legal battle, the administration deported eight men to war-torn South Sudan in July, though only one of them is from that country.

They remain incarcerated there while South Sudan officials negotiate efforts to send them to their home countries.

Rwanda and Uganda have also reached agreements with the Trump administration to receive deportees. At least seven deportees arrived in Rwanda last month, according of officials there.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/01/17/51/Eswatini-government-faces-court-challenge-for-accepting-U-S--deportees-f2y0j96y.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-09-01 16:56:25.062106

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, enacted in 1977, allows presidents to regulate commerce in response to extraordinary foreign threats.
The law is typically used to impose economic sanctions, freeze assets, or restrict financial transactions during crises such as terrorism or arms proliferation.
Legal Analysis: The Major Questions Doctrine The Federal Circuit’s reasoning mirrors the Supreme Court’s growing reliance on the major questions doctrine.
By applying this reasoning, the court aligned itself with a conservative legal trend that narrows executive discretion on matters of major economic importance.","A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump exceeded his authority when he invoked national emergency powers to impose sweeping tariffs on imports from nearly every country, dealing a major blow to one of his signature economic policies.

In a 7–4 decision issued on Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit largely upheld a May ruling by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York, which struck down the tariffs as unlawful. The appellate panel concluded that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the statute on which Trump relied, does not grant presidents unlimited authority to impose tariffs. Instead, the court said, the Constitution places the power to levy import duties squarely in Congress’s hands.

“The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President’s power to impose tariffs,” the court wrote, emphasizing that prior administrations had used IEEPA to impose sanctions, not broad trade restrictions.

While affirming that the tariffs exceeded Trump’s statutory authority, the appeals court declined to immediately freeze them. The panel sent the case back to the trade court to reconsider whether a nationwide injunction against the tariffs is appropriate, citing the U.S. Supreme Court’s recent guidance limiting the use of universal injunctions.

Trump, who has repeatedly defended tariffs as vital to restoring American manufacturing and creating leverage in international negotiations, blasted the ruling as “highly partisan” in a Truth Social post. He noted that the duties remain in effect while his administration considers an appeal to the Supreme Court.

The split decision revealed partisan divisions within the judiciary. Six of the seven judges in the majority were appointed by Democratic presidents, along with one appointee of George H.W. Bush. Of the four dissenters, two were appointed by Barack Obama and two by George W. Bush.

Trump has leaned heavily on tariffs since returning to office. In April, he rolled out what he called “reciprocal tariffs” against dozens of trading partners on “Liberation Day,” though many were later paused for negotiations. Earlier this month, he announced a new wave of duties on more than 60 countries, in some cases securing agreements that lowered the rates but still left them above pre-“Liberation Day” levels.

Supporters argue that tariffs are necessary to counter unfair trade practices, reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing, and generate billions in federal revenue. Trump has also tied tariff threats to non-economic issues, using them to pressure China over fentanyl, Mexico and Canada on immigration, and India over its trade ties with Russia.

Critics, however, contend that the tariffs harm U.S. consumers and businesses by raising prices and slowing growth. Many economists warn that steep duties could undermine the broader economy, while legal experts argue that Trump’s expansive use of emergency powers raises constitutional concerns. Some lawsuits against the tariffs cite the “major questions doctrine,” a legal principle often championed by conservative judges that limits executive action on issues of broad political or economic significance without explicit congressional approval.

What is IEEPA?

The International Emergency Economic Powers Act, enacted in 1977, allows presidents to regulate commerce in response to extraordinary foreign threats. The law is typically used to impose economic sanctions, freeze assets, or restrict financial transactions during crises such as terrorism or arms proliferation. It has rarely been used to alter tariff policy. Courts have now signaled that Congress did not intend IEEPA to serve as a blank check for presidents to rewrite trade policy, particularly given that the Constitution reserves taxing and tariff powers to the legislative branch.

Legal Analysis: The Major Questions Doctrine

The Federal Circuit’s reasoning mirrors the Supreme Court’s growing reliance on the major questions doctrine. That doctrine holds that when an agency, or in this case, the president, takes action with sweeping political and economic consequences, Congress must have clearly authorized it in statutory text. Without explicit language, courts presume the executive lacks such broad authority.

The Supreme Court has applied this doctrine in recent high-profile cases, such as West Virginia v. EPA (2022), where it struck down the Environmental Protection Agency’s attempt to impose wide-ranging climate regulations without clear congressional authorization. Similarly, in the tariff case, the appeals court emphasized that IEEPA does not mention tariffs at all, nor does it contain safeguards for imposing them. By applying this reasoning, the court aligned itself with a conservative legal trend that narrows executive discretion on matters of major economic importance.

Notably, the doctrine can cut both ways politically. While it has often been invoked by conservatives to block expansive regulatory action by Democratic administrations, here it was used to rein in a Republican president’s trade agenda. The case underscores that the doctrine is less about partisan politics than about separation of powers, raising fundamental questions about how far presidents of either party may stretch vague statutory language to reshape economic policy.",https://www.lawcommentary.com/img/articles/uFLDhyvVllor8bRvuzWG4tVFNETFCr5xLE0af2F1.png?fit=crop&h=630&w=1200&signature=7fd992435d72ae8d77ee7d08788ea383aa022635af13968ae3e01b8923390d55,N,,2025-09-01 18:57:06.506986

The phenomenon, known as ""reverse flow"" migration, is largely made up of Venezuelan migrants who fled their country's long-running economic, social and political crises only to encounter U.S. immigration policy no longer open to asylum-seekers.

Migration through the treacherous Darien Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama peaked in 2023 when more than half a million migrants crossed. That flow slowed somewhat in 2024, but dried up almost completely early this year.

Friday's report, published with support of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that northward migration had dropped 97 per cent this year. Migrants traveling south interviewed in Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia by those countries' ombudsmen offices were almost all Venezuelans (97%) and about half of them said they planned to return to Venezuela, according to the report. Nearly all said they were returning because they could no longer legally reach the U.S.

Since 2017, around 8 million people have fled the crisis in Venezuela. For years, those migrants flocked to other South American nations, including Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Chile and more. That changed in 2021, when hundreds of thousands of people set out for the U.S., braving the Darien Gap along the way.

A U.S. government smartphone app became the main way for asylum-seekers to enter the U.S. under the Biden administration. Then thousands of migrants became stranded in Mexico when Trump ended the use of the app on his first day in office.

In this country, a judge has blocked the United States from deporting as many as 600 Guatemalan children. Here's NPR's Chiara Eisner.

CHIARA EISNER, BYLINE: Minors who enter the U.S. unaccompanied are not allowed to be deported without first having the full opportunity to apply for legal status. But on Sunday, planes were loaded with Guatemalan children who had crossed the border alone.

EFREN OLIVARES: We know that there were two planes in Harlingen, Texas, and one plane in El Paso, Texas. And that is from reports of people on the ground, physically at the airport, who saw these planes and the children being loaded onto the planes.

EISNER: That's Efren Olivares with the National Immigration Law Center, the U.S. firm defending some of the Guatemalan children. The children's lawyers scrambled to petition the U.S. government to stop them from being removed, and on Sunday morning, a federal judge temporarily halted the planes. The U.S. government argued Guatemala had asked for the children's return and said their parents had also requested their removal from the country. Attorneys for the children said their clients hadn't completed asylum proceedings. Here's a lawyer who was involved with the case, Becky Wolozin. She's a senior attorney at the National Center for Youth Law.

BECKY WOLOZIN: They're clearly targeting children based exclusively on their national origin, which is also unlawful.

EISNER: Then Sunday evening, the Guatemalan government posted a statement to X. It was Guatemala that had suggested that the Guatemalan children should be sent to that country. No human rights had been violated, and all due process had been followed. Here's Kika Matos, president of the National Immigration Law Center.

KICA MATOS: This idea that on a long weekend in the dead of night, they would wake up these vulnerable children and put them on a plane is something that should shock the conscience of all Americans.

EISNER: NPR asked DHS and the Guatemalan government for comment. Neither responded.

Now a federal appeals court has thrown a roadblock in his path.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Friday that Mr. Trump went too far when he declared national emergencies to justify tariffs on nearly every country on Earth. The ruling largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York.

But Friday's 7-4 appeals court decision tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, giving his administration time to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. The ruling represents a major setback for Mr. Trump, who has said his trade policies will enrich the U.S. by bringing back manufacturing jobs and contributing billions in new revenue for the federal government.

""This ruling highlights a serious legal threat to one of the president's most high-profile economic policies,"" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory company deVere Group, in an emailed report.

On Friday, Mr. Trump lashed out against the 7-4 ruling in a Truth Social post, calling the appeals court ""Highly Partisan"" and noting that the tariffs are still in effect.

Six of the seven judges who ruled against the tariffs are appointees of Democratic presidents, while the seventh is an appointee of former President George H.W. Bush. Of the four judges who dissented, two were appointed by former President Obama and two by former President George W. Bush.

Here's what could happen next as the legal case proceeds.

How did the dispute arise?

Friday's ruling came as part of a months-long legal challenge over the tariffs brought by Democratic states and small businesses, which are arguing that the president has exceeded his authority in issuing the import duties.

The appeals court's decision is focused on the tariffs Mr. Trump imposed in April on most trading partners, along with earlier levies on China, Mexico and Canada.

Mr. Trump on April 2 — or Liberation Day, he called it — imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else.

The president later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to negotiate trade agreements with the U.S. — and reduce their barriers to American exports. Some of them did — including the U.K., Japan and the EU — and agreed to deals with Mr. Trump to avoid even bigger tariffs.

Countries that didn't comply faced higher tariffs earlier this month. Laos got rocked with a 40% tariff, for instance, and Algeria with a 30% levy. Mr. Trump also kept the baseline tariffs in place.

What is the IEEPA?

Mr. Trump justified the taxes under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, by declaring longstanding U.S. trade deficits ""a national emergency.""

In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that illegal immigration and drug trafficking amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs — and Mr. Trump has made the most of it.

Does the ruling apply to all tariffs?

No, the court's ruling doesn't cover all of Mr. Trump tariffs. For instance, his levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos were imposed under a different regulation after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.

Nor does it include tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on China in his first term — and President Biden kept — after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the U.S. and other Western countries.

The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in the economic chaos that followed his decision to end a policy that linked the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEEPA.

In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs ""exceed any authority granted to the President'' under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges — one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states — into a single case.

On Friday, the federal appeals court wrote in its 7-4 ruling that ""it seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs.""

What happens next?

The president vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court. ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" he wrote on his social media platform on Friday.

A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Mr. Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions ""is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,"" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.

The government has argued that if Mr. Trump's tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.

Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers, such as American manufacturers or retailers that rely on foreign-made products. While the U.S. companies typically swallow some of the cost, they pass on much of the added expenses to consumers in the form of higher prices.

The Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean ""financial ruin"" for the U.S.

It could also put Mr. Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.

""While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments or even seek to renegotiate terms,"" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.

Does the Trump administration have other options?

Mr. Trump does have alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.

For instance, in its decision in May, the trade court noted that Mr. Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits.

The administration could also invoke levies under a different legal authority — Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 — as it did with tariffs on foreign steel, aluminum and automobiles. But that requires a Commerce Department investigation and cannot be imposed at the president's sole discretion.

""Even if the tariffs are struck down, we believe the Trump administration will look for new ways to tax imports or otherwise raise revenue from companies selling into the U.S.,"" noted Green of the deVere Group.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/08/29/80766fac-bbf3-496c-9007-dc73f0ad5b7a/thumbnail/1200x630/4a2d4bfdf1d3d15d85e227538edb22dc/cbsn-fusion-most-trumps-tariffs-illegal-federal-appeals-court-rules-thumbnail.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 14:56:46.434576

An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.","It's tomato season and Lidia is harvesting on farms in California's Central Valley.

She is also anxious. Attention from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could upend her life more than 23 years after she illegally crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a teenager.

“The worry is they’ll pull you over when you’re driving and ask for your papers,” said Lidia, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition that only her first name be used because of her fears of deportation. “We need to work. We need to feed our families and pay our rent.”

As parades and other events celebrating the contributions of workers in the U.S. are held Monday for the Labor Day holiday, experts say President Donald Trump’s stepped-up immigration policies are impacting the nation's labor force.

More than 1.2 million immigrants disappeared from the labor force from January through the end of July, according to preliminary Census Bureau data analyzed by the Pew Research Center. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.

Immigrants make up almost 20% of the U.S. workforce and that data shows 45% of workers in farming, fishing and forestry are immigrants, according to Pew senior researcher Stephanie Kramer. About 30% of all construction workers are immigrants and 24% of service workers are immigrants, she added.

The loss in immigrant workers comes as the nation is seeing the first decline in the overall immigrant population after the number of people in the U.S. illegally reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023.

“It’s unclear how much of the decline we’ve seen since January is due to voluntary departures to pursue other opportunities or avoid deportation, removals, underreporting or other technical issues,” Kramer said. “However, we don’t believe that the preliminary numbers indicating net-negative migration are so far off that the decline isn’t real.”

Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally. He has said he is focusing deportation efforts on “dangerous criminals,” but most people detained by ICE have no criminal convictions. At the same time, the number of illegal border crossings has plunged under his policies.

Pia Orrenius, a labor economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said immigrants normally contribute at least 50% of job growth in the U.S.

“The influx across the border from what we can tell is essentially stopped, and that’s where we were getting millions and millions of migrants over the last four years,” she said. “That has had a huge impact on the ability to create jobs.”

'Crops did go to waste’

Just across the border from Mexico in McAllen, Texas, corn and cotton fields are about ready for harvesting. Elizabeth Rodriguez worries there won’t be enough workers available for the gins and other machinery once the fields are cleared.

Immigration enforcement actions at farms, businesses and construction sites brought everything to a standstill, said Rodriguez, director of farmworker advocacy for the National Farmworker Ministry.

“In May, during the peak of our watermelon and cantaloupe season, it delayed it. A lot of crops did go to waste,” she said.

In Ventura County, California, northwest of Los Angeles, Lisa Tate manages her family business that grows citrus fruits, avocados and coffee on eight ranches and 800 acres (323 hectares).

Most of the men and women who work their farms are contractor-provided day laborers. There were days earlier this year when crews would be smaller. Tate is hesitant to place that blame on immigration policies. But the fear of ICE raids spread quickly.

Dozens of area farmworkers were arrested late this spring.

“People were being taken out of laundromats, off the side of the road,” Tate said.

Lidia, the farmworker who spoke to the AP through an interpreter, said her biggest fear is being sent back to Mexico. Now 36, she is married with three school-age children who were born here.

“I don’t know if I’ll be able to bring my kids,"" said Lidia. ""I’m also very concerned I’d have to start from zero. My whole life has been in the United States.”

From construction to health care

Construction sites in and around McAllen also “are completely dead,” Rodriguez said.

“We have a large labor force that is undocumented,” she said. “We’ve seen ICE particularly targeting construction sites and attempting to target mechanic and repair shops.""

The number of construction jobs are down in about half of U.S. metropolitan areas, according to an Associated General Contractors of America analysis of government employment data. The largest loss of 7,200 jobs was in the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario, California, area. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Glendale area lost 6,200 jobs.

“Construction employment has stalled or retreated in many areas for a variety of reasons,” said Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist. “But contractors report they would hire more people if only they could find more qualified and willing workers and tougher immigration enforcement wasn’t disrupting labor supplies.”

Kramer, with Pew, also warns about the potential impact on health care. She says immigrants make up about 43% of home health care aides.

The Service Employees International Union represents about 2 million workers in health care, the public sector and property services. An estimated half of long-term care workers who are members of SEIU 2015 in California are immigrants, said Arnulfo De La Cruz, the local's president.

“What’s going to happen when millions of Americans can no longer find a home care provider?"" De La Cruz said. “What happens when immigrants aren’t in the field to pick our crops? Who’s going to staff our hospitals and nursing homes?” ___ An earlier version of this story incorrectly referred to the name of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

A few blocks away, the scene was louder and more charged: demonstrators with megaphones chanted outside the Holiday Inn near the Long Beach airport, while police officers stood guard near the front of the establishment.

Word had spread through social media that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents had reportedly checked into both hotels. Within the hour, a small contingent of local residents had arrived at both establishments. They were there to make sure ICE agents didn’t sleep.

This was one of several “No Sleep for ICE” events that popped up during the month of June. In a time when large-scale protests often dominate headlines, a different kind of resistance is taking root across Southern California. Small, decentralized networks of community members are using stealthy tactics and real-time coordination to monitor, disrupt, and expose the movements of federal immigration officers.

Across L.A. County, the strategy of monitoring ICE movements and responding in real time has become one of the most effective tools in rapid-response activism.

“They shouldn’t be kidnapping people off the street,” said Michael Gearin, a local Long Beach resident, who spoke to Truthout during the anti-ICE mobilization efforts in June.

​​“If [ICE] wants to come back after a day of kidnapping landscapers and want to kick back and have a beer at the Residence Inn, I say no,” Gearin said, emphasizing his commitment to protecting his neighbors from immigration enforcement. “Why should they have an easy night when everybody else is scared?”

No Sleep For ICE is just one of several pop-up actions that have proliferated over the last several months throughout Southern California. As the immigration raids intensified from the start of June, leading into the late summer months, locals sought out increasingly creative ways to protect vulnerable community members. Many of these micro-movements rarely make the evening news, but they have become the core of mobilization efforts.

In the months leading up to President Donald Trump’s inauguration, grassroots organizers quietly prepared for an expected surge in immigration raids. Guadalupe Carrasco Cardona, an educator and member of Unión del Barrio, partook in community patrols that monitor and track the movements of immigration enforcement agents, alerting local residents in real time.

“[ICE] uses the element of surprise to their benefit,” Cardona told Truthout, noting that many ICE-spotting patrols go early in the morning and search neighborhoods looking for staging of potential agents. “We patrol to spot them, and then let them know we see them — go live on socials, announce to the whole community that they’re there.”

The efforts of local activists patrolling their neighborhoods have uncovered useful information. In June, local groups of organizers monitoring ICE activity discovered that Terminal Island in San Pedro is being used by ICE for early-morning staging and dispatching throughout LA County. This piece of critical information made it easier to monitor ICE activity and warn communities before a raid even begins.

Cardona also noted that community defense patrols have uncovered tactics used by immigration enforcement agents to evade detection. “We’ve uncovered that ICE is switching license plates, using incorrect ones, and sometimes coming out with no plates at all.”

Community patrol work has deep roots in Southern California, stemming back to the early 90s, mostly along the U.S.-Mexico border in San Diego. Many activists there were inspired by the Black Panther Party’s model of community patrols, and Unión del Barrio adapted the concept to monitor and protect immigrant communities from immigration enforcement.

The recent iterations of patrol efforts in Los Angeles were revived in 2020 as a response to raids occurring under the Biden administration. By the time the second Trump administration took office, Unión del Barrio had already built critical experience. Recognizing the magnitude of the task at hand, the group launched the Community Self-Defense Coalition in 2025. The coalition now includes over 60 organizations spanning Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and even parts of Northern California.

Ron Gochez, another seasoned organizer with Unión del Barrio, said that in addition to conducting patrols, the coalition has developed a training program specifically for schools. The curriculum is designed to help educators protect their students, their students’ families, and themselves during potential encounters with immigration enforcement agents.

“We’ve really been focusing on educators, because we know schools are about to start again,” said Gochez. “Educators are on the frontlines of defending their students and families.”

Most recently, the coalition conducted a training with over 250 LAUSD educators at the United Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA) building in collaboration with the teachers’ union. “We did a training for 250 people … because we know what’s coming, and we’re preparing together,” Gochez stated.

Gochez says the effectiveness of localized organizing has forced immigration authorities to adapt. “The entire ICE apparatus had to change their tactics because of our work.”

Despite a wave of local support for grassroots mobilization, activists say federal authorities have responded with intimidation and threats aimed at curbing their ongoing efforts.

In June, Unión del Barrio received a letter addressed to Gochez from Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who identified himself as chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism. In the letter, Hawley accused the organization of providing “logistical support and financial resources to individuals engaged in these disruptive actions” during protests taking place in Los Angeles at the time. He further alleged that Unión del Barrio had bankrolled civil unrest and abetted criminal behavior, and demanded that the group cease all organized activity.

The letter also included a sweeping request for internal records, including communications, emails, chat logs, donor lists, travel and lodging documents, and any evidence of coordination with members of the media.

“We’re not going to let a neocolonial government like the United States intimidate us,” Gochez said in response to the letter. Both he and fellow member Cardona described the correspondence as a “veiled threat” and an effort to intimidate the collective. Still, they said the group remains undeterred, and that the letter has generated more interest and support for their work.

Other grassroots organizations have faced similar threats at the federal level, as was the case with Alejandro Orellana, a 29-year-old immigrant rights advocate with Centro CSO. Orellana was arrested by the FBI in June and charged with “conspiracy to commit civil disorder” after allegedly distributing face shields to protesters during a June 9 demonstration in downtown Los Angeles.

Although the Department of Justice later dismissed all charges, advocates view the arrest as part of a broader campaign to intimidate and suppress grassroots organizing, like the work being carried out by Centro CSO and Unión del Barrio.

Similarly, a member of Unión del Barrio was arrested recently at Terminal Island while monitoring the movement of federal vehicles alongside members of the Harbor Area Peace Patrol. Amanda Trebach, a U.S. citizen, was seized by several masked individuals who did not identify themselves as federal agents while on a morning peace patrol.

Video of the incident was shared widely online — Trebach was pinned face-down, with a knee on the back of her neck, before she was taken away in an unmarked van. She was held overnight in federal custody and released the following day without any charges filed.

While large protests still play a vital role in public awareness, these smaller, quieter efforts continue to shape what organizers see as a new front line. Whether it is the “disruptive work” of No Sleep for ICE, Know-Your-Rights Workshops, or patrolling neighborhoods, organizers are now two steps ahead. Rather than waiting to respond, locals are taking a proactive approach to defending their community.

“We don’t have the luxury to stop, because our people depend on our resistance,” said Gochez.

The shift reflects a broader recalibration in immigrant defense work, one that sends a clear message: we will not be intimidated.

Gochez describes the work of local organizing in Southern California as a sophisticated and efficient network of community members united by a deep commitment to defending one another.

“We’re not just a protest group … we’re not just a group that goes out and does marches,” he says. Rather, the group also engages in “organized resistance, coalitions, training people, tactics, and strategies that are proven to work.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/Long-Beach1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 12:57:05.687600

From citrus farms in the Central Valley to construction sites where homes and businesses are being rebuilt after devastating wildfires in Pacific Palisades, California relies heavily on immigrant workers and entrepreneurs.

As the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration enforcement, industries key to the state's $4 trillion economy like agriculture, construction and hospitality could be among those hardest hit by the loss of California's immigrant workforce, according to new research.

At stake are billions of dollars that fuel businesses large and small across the state, whose standalone economy is the fourth largest in the world after the United States, China and Germany.

Approximately one-fifth of the state's 10.6 million immigrants are undocumented, according to a June study from the nonpartisan Bay Area Economic Institute and the University of California, Merced.

If mass deportations were to be combined with the end of temporary protected status for thousands of immigrants and stricter border policies, the joint study estimated that California would be at risk of losing as much as $278 billion from its gross domestic product.

Immigrant workers have been essential in bolstering the state's economy given declining birthrates and an aging population, said Abby Raisz, research director at the Bay Area Economic Institute.

""These are the workers that are keeping our economy afloat. They're keeping businesses open,"" Raisz told CNBC.

One of the places that is most evident is in the fields where food is grown and harvested, researchers and advocates say.

Agriculture, a $49 billion industry for the state, has the highest concentration of immigrant and undocumented immigrant workers in California, with 63% of them immigrants and 24% of farm workers undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.

""Without them, we wouldn't have any food available,"" said Joe Garcia, president of the California Farmworker Association and CEO of Jaguar Labor Contracting, which connects farmworkers to growers.

""The lettuce, the strawberries, all the wine we drink on a daily basis, fruit juices– everything that a farmworker picks, packs, pre-harvest– they do the jobs all year round that put food on your table,"" he said.

Garcia added that automation isn't an option for many of these positions, and American-born workers are not interested in taking on these jobs, which are often strenuous, low-paid and outdoors.

The Trump administration insists that the domestic labor market can withstand a shortage of immigrant labor, and says its focus is on creating jobs for U.S. citizens.

""Over one in ten young adults in America are neither employed, in higher education, nor pursuing some sort of vocational training,"" said White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in response to an inquiry from CNBC about the potential impact of mass deportations on California and its key industries.

""There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump's agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration's commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws.""

ICE impacts

In downtown Los Angeles, businesses have felt waves of impact in June and beyond due to high-profile ICE raids, accompanying protests and National Guard Deployment, owners and advocates said, exacerbating a public perception issue that downtown Los Angeles is not safe.

The Independent Hospitality Coalition, which represents some 900 local businesses and workers in the Los Angeles Area, said the raids struck fear into the immigrant workforce and created a challenging atmosphere for businesses that were already faced with several years of uphill battles.

""COVID, it was an international emergency that we were all dealing with. Here in California, especially here in Los Angeles, with the recent Palisades and Altadena fires… now it's immigration situation that we're dealing with. It's more like a localized COVID all over again,"" said Eddie Navarette, executive director of the hospitality commission.

Courtney Kaplan owns three Los Angeles restaurants, including Camelia in the downtown Arts District. She saw a 70 percent drop in sales in June alone, she told CNBC, due to closures and curfews, even though she is not in close proximity to where protests or the National Guard deployments took place.

Her staff continue to come to work, but the uncertainty around both immigration and trade policy, as she relies on imported wines and sake, weigh on her. Data from OpenTable show a drop in dining reservations for all of Los Angeles were down from June 7th through the 21st by 3% year on year.

""The biggest challenge for us, aside from the lost revenue and the decrease in business, has been the uncertainty of every day. It's been so unpredictable. It's been chaotic,"" Kaplan told CNBC in July.

""We're still in the very early days of these changes to immigration policy, so it's hard to even predict what's coming. It just is a cause of concern that perhaps that down the line, the situation for us will change with our team members' comfort levels.""

Worker shortages

Sectors like construction and farming are staring down worker shortages that predate any change to immigration policy. In California, more than sixty percent of construction workers are immigrants and a quarter of them are undocumented, the Bay Area Council report found.

""There are profound skill shortages in these production industries, construction, manufacturing, because culturally, we have not created enough of these workers,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist at Associated Builders and Contractors, a trade group.

""The way we've dealt with this over time has been immigration. Other cultures, cultures associated with other countries have different characteristics. Many more people there have been willing and wanting to be in the skilled trades, and we import that talent to improve our built environment.""

Contractors largely fall into two camps, he told CNBC. Some of them express confidence and support for Trump, believing the president's strategy will spur domestic manufacturing, investment and hiring. Others are pessimistic, as costs and uncertainty have risen.

Regardless of contractors' outlooks, said Basu, the nature of California's economy and its longstanding housing shortage mean that the state is constantly in need of construction workers.

The anti-immigration rallies held across the country yesterday have dominated coverage overnight, with a number of publications still leading on the events this morning.

The Age says “Melbourne’s CBD roiled with protest on Sunday as anti-immigration and counter-demonstrators clashed repeatedly, and a large number of police were stretched to cope with a shifting struggle that ranged through the city’s streets for more than four hours”.

The newspaper says police arrested six people and confirmed the use of capsicum spray and bean-bag guns “to prevent violence between protesters, some of whom were intent on creating conflict and violence”.

The BBC says protesters in Melbourne clashed with attendees of a separate pro-Palestine rally, while the AAP states this morning that “racism and extremism at anti-immigration rallies across Australia have been condemned after a score of arrests following violent clashes”, adding: “prominent neo-Nazis also gave speeches in Sydney and Melbourne”.

NSW Police estimated some 15,000 people attended the Sydney rally, while Victoria Police estimated the Melbourne crowd size to be 5,000, and Queensland Police reported about 6,000 protesters attended the Brisbane rally.

The AAP reports speakers and attendees “were at pains to state they were not against immigrants but wanted less migration. However, rhetoric crossed into racism and xenophobia and became conspiratorial for some”.

Meanwhile, Guardian Australia says while “the protests were condemned as hateful by the federal government”, some politicians attended the different rallies. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson and Senator Malcolm Roberts attended the rally in Canberra, and federal MP Bob Katter was at the event in Townsville.

The site points out the marches on Sunday “were promoted by neo-Nazis, as well as anti-lockdown figures who gained prominence during the pandemic, and other fringe groups, but no group publicly claimed responsibility for organising the protests”.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said of the rallies: “There is no place in our country for people who seek to divide and undermine our social cohesion. We stand with modern Australia against these rallies — nothing could be less Australian.”

Anne Aly, the minister for multicultural affairs, also declared: “We stand with all Australians, no matter where they were born, against those who seek to divide us and who seek to intimidate migrant communities. We will not be intimidated. This brand of far-right activism, grounded in racism and ethnocentrism, has no place in modern Australia.”

SOCIAL MEDIA AGE VERIFICATION RISKS

The findings of the study into age assurance technology have been released by the federal government 100 days before its social media ban for under-16s comes into effect.

(Before we continue, I need to draw your attention to the latest episode of Crikey’s new Cut Through podcast, which involves associate editor Cam Wilson talking to host Crystal Andrew about where we’re at with the impending ban and the challenges to come.)

As the ABC reports, the study has found “it was technologically possible to assess a user’s age to a reasonable degree of confidence in a variety of ways, but that every way included risks and shortcomings”.

The study said letting social media platforms pick their own method of age verification could result in inconsistency. “Implementation depends on the willingness of a small number of dominant tech companies to enable or share control of [age assurance] processes,” the report says. “Coordination among dominant [tech] providers is essential if any truly ecosystem-wide age assurance model is to succeed.”

The broadcaster highlights Communications Minister Anika Wells and eSafety commissioner Julie Inman-Grant are set to reveal in the coming weeks the “reasonable steps” social media giants will need to take to comply with the ban.

Wells is quoted by The Conversation as saying of the trial’s results: “While there’s no one-size-fits-all solution to age assurance, this trial shows there are many effective options and importantly that user privacy can be safeguarded.”

The AAP points out more than 60 different age verification tools were assessed as part of the trial.

“Age assurance can be done in Australia,” the report states, adding: “However, the rapidly evolving threat environment means that these systems — while presently fairly robust — cannot be considered infallible.”

The newswire highlights the report also warned that some providers were currently collecting too much data on users. “We found some concerning evidence that in the absence of specific guidance, service providers were apparently over-anticipating the eventual needs of regulators about providing personal information for future investigations,” it said.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa last week lauded Australia’s plans to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, The Mandarin reports.

“The plasticity of their [young people’s] brains is being reshaped. If you’re always pumped full of dopamine, it’s like being permanently under drugs. Social media is awful for human rights,” she said. Ressa is addressing the National Press Club in Canberra today on the theme of “Facts. Truth. Trust”.

The federal politicians will also be in the capital for another sitting week of both houses of Parliament, with the social media ban likely to get attention. Net zero will also continue to feature (because, you know, the Coalition), with The Australian reporting this morning that Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce has “urged opposition frontbencher Andrew Hastie against voting for his bill to abolish a ­commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050”.

The paper says: “Joyce warned Mr Hastie it would be counter­productive for him to support a private member’s bill to abolish the net-zero target, as it would lead the prominent conservative Liberal to be dumped from the shadow ministry and limit his ­impact on policy development”.

Hastie didn’t comment when contacted by the newspaper, and Joyce declared: “I don’t know where Andrew’s mind is at, that is his business”.

Meanwhile, the AAP informs us in a headline this morning, “It’s not me, it’s you: millions abandon the Coalition”…

ON A LIGHTER NOTE…

A bright orange shark has been discovered by fishermen near Tortuguero National Park in Costa Rica.

Scientists, who published pictures of the unusual creature in the Marine Biology journal last month, said it was the first time a shark of that colour had ever been seen, the BBC reports.

The colouring is caused by a condition called xanthism, which is when creatures lose dark skin pigments, resulting in a visible yellow or orange colouring.

Sport fishing guide and hotel owner Garvin Watson told The New York Times: “We saw an orange glow below the water and I said, ‘My God, what is this?’ We were all screaming like crazy.”

Watson posted pictures of the shark on social media last year, and it drew the attention of researchers who subsequently wrote up a paper on the discovery.

“I saw the photos and I was impressed,” marine biologist and executive director of Costa Rica’s Rescue Center for Endangered Marine Species Daniel Arauz Naranjo said. “I was like, ‘Wow, this is something strange.’”

Watson said he let the usual creature go after catching it, and, for reasons only he knows, kissed the shark and told it: “Thank you. We love you.”

Say What?

The world today is swept by once-in-a-century transformations. The international situation is both fluid and chaotic.

CRIKEY RECAP

New analysis of the 48th Parliament’s interests register by Crikey and Open Politics reveals MPs and their families have declared 451 properties, from primary residences and second homes in Canberra through to rental investment properties, holiday homes and beach houses.

Of the 226 members, 135 declared that they or their families own two or more properties, 69 own three or more properties, and 29 own four or more. Only 16 MPs, 7%, have declared owning no property at all. (For those counting, we’re missing a declaration from One Nation’s Warwick Stacey, who resigned earlier this month, and independent MP Bob Katter, who… simply hasn’t filed.)

In the table below, search by politician or party to see how many properties have been declared. These numbers are an undercount, as senators are not required to publicly disclose their families’ interests.

Dezi Freeman obsessively posted fantasies about killing and torturing police officers across social media platforms in the years leading up to the alleged shooting of two officers and the injury of another at Porepunkah this week.

Crikey has exclusively obtained seven years of Freeman’s private Facebook posts, dozens of Telegram messages and other previously unreported Instagram comments.

In just four months, social media platforms will be forced to ban kids aged 16 and under. How will that work? Well, that’s the thing… no-one actually knows.

Crikey associate editor and tech journalist Cam Wilson has been closely following the progress of the teen social media ban — from the push for a ban by commercial radio host Michael “Wippa” Wipfli, to rushed legislation, aggressive lobbying by the tech giants, and, now, a trial of age-verification technology that’s not quite going to plan.

He joins Cut Through host Crystal Andrews to explain what the hell is going on, and what you can expect when the results from the tech trial are made public.

THE COMMENTARIAT

Albanese government resorts to whatever-it-takes to rid Australia of former detainees — Michelle Grattan (The Conversation): It is fortunate for the government that the opposition is backing the latest legislation. If the government had needed the Greens to pass the legislation, it would probably be facing defeat.

The Greens condemned the Nauru deal. Their immigration spokesman David Shoebridge said: “At a time when we should be building partnerships in the Pacific based on equality and respect, the government is instead forcing our smaller neighbours to become 21st-century prison colonies.”

Over many years, Labor in opposition was highly critical of the Coalition’s handling of issues dealing with illegal immigrants.

The Australian concept of a ‘fair go’ is a furphy — especially when it comes to tax, education and care — Julianne Schultz (Guardian Australia): Disappointment in the failure to realise the good ideals once promised in “the land of the fair go” have transferred from one generation to the next and are now informing the overwhelmingly progressive politics of those under 40. In raw political terms, Chalmers is right; younger voters will be the ones who will determine his future.

For years Australian policymakers and politicians thought they could square the circle: a market-driven economy with a robust social safety net. But that has become harder — the inexorable logic of the market is almost unstoppable, but so is the demand for public services.",https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/09/prot.jpg?quality=70&w=1024,N,,2025-09-01 12:56:46.899835

But as an immigrant from Mexico living in the community, she knows that ICE is not well-received in Charlotte generally, she said. She has defended controversial arrests and the use of face coverings by ICE agents, saying they fear being doxxed.

“Almost everyone has this impression or this mindset that ICE is bad,” she said. “You guys, we do a lot of good for the community.”

Specifically, she said, ICE is “arresting criminals” and “getting them off the street.”

It’s unclear how many people ICE has arrested in Charlotte or North Carolina. According to available public data, more than 28,000 people have been arrested by ICE so far this year in both the Carolinas and Georgia.

Churches and parent-teacher associations have been among those critical of ICE’s presence and tactics.

“The truth of the matter is we don’t know who that (arrestee) is,” Somers said. “But that person could be your next Laken Riley murderer, or whomever.”

Laken Riley was a 22-year-old nursing student in Georgia. Jose Ibarra, an undocumented immigrant, killed her. Prosecutors in the case said she “refused to be his rape victim.” The killing led Congress to pass a law requiring authorities to detain and deport undocumented immigrants accused — but not convicted — of certain crimes.

Somers said she has not heard much from local groups.

She is open to more of those conversations, she said.

Don’t buy Trump’s false “happy Labor Day” hype—it’s all lies with those fatty, greasy fries.","The man in the McDonald’s suit insists unceasingly that he’s for working people, and huge portions believe him—but what do the facts of President Trump’s actual policies show? What does it mean to be for workers?

You’d think being “pro-worker” would mean things like lowering consumer prices and boosting wages. But the facts show the man in the McDonald’s suit isn’t doing either of those things—in fact, despite the president’s false protestations, he is doing the opposite.

Despite Trump’s profoundly Orwellian lies, prices are, in fact, UP from last year for most categories of daily life, according to the Trump administration’s own Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices for food are up nearly 3 percent since this time last year. Workers’ grocery bills are spiking higher as supermarkets pass along Trump’s tariffs to consumers, as all critics predicted.

You’d think that being for workers would mean supporting higher wages, particularly for working-class and lower-income workers. But again, the man donning the McDonald’s outfit is in fact doing the opposite. As Economic Policy Institute reported, Trump “rescinded an executive order that raised the minimum wage for federal contractors,” effectively slashing these workers’ wages by 25% to 60%. This means that millions of federally contracted workers, some of whom make poverty wages, no longer get minimum wage protections because of Trump.

All of this pain and harm Trump is causing for workers is part of the plan, right out of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025—promoting the profit and wealth interests of the rich and corporations over working people’s needs and survival.

Compounding all this harm, on Labor Day the Trump administration “will advance plans to eliminate federal minimum wage protections for millions of child care and home care providers,” the Center for American Progress reports. Think about that. Millions of low-paid domestic care workers will now lose federal minimum wage protections because of the man masquerading as a McDonald’s worker and man of the people.

With the help of a Trump-appointed judge in Texas, Republicans rescinded a Biden rule aimed at expanding overtime pay for millions of working Americans. That rule would have given overtime pay protections to 4 million workers. Seriously, does that sound pro-worker to you?

You might expect a “pro-worker” president to support middle-class jobs—wrong again. Is it “pro-worker” to fire and lay off hundreds of thousands of government workers, all to pay for tax cuts that almost entirely benefit the rich? This is precisely what Trump is doing. New government projections show Trump will have eliminated about 300,000 federal workers by the end of this year. Think about that, 300,000 people made unemployed by Trump. That is an entire city of middle-class workers, fired and laid off, now desperately scrambling to pay bills, buy groceries, and survive. Many will lose their homes if they don’t quickly find another middle-class job. Doesn’t sound very “pro-worker,” now does it?

Would a “pro-worker” president eviscerate worker safety and health protections on the job? That’s exactly what Trump is doing. His horrendous, harmful bill gutted the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, slashing staff and workplace inspections, the lifeblood of maintaining worker safety and health. More than 140,000 U.S. workers died from hazardous job conditions in 2023, according to the AFL-CIO’s annual “Death on the Job” report. That’s 383 Americans dying every day from dangerous working conditions that can be prevented by stronger regulations and enforcement—but the guy in the McDonald’s outfit is doing the opposite, erasing a stunning 30 percent of inspections while radically reducing penalties for endangering workers.

Deepening this harm, Trump eliminated nearly all workers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a small but important agency that produces critical research on work hazards, including maintaining a firefighter cancer registry and a lab that certifies respirators for many industries. The cuts are “a very pointed attack on workers in this country,” Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the NIOSH workers union told the Associated Press.

This same alleged “champion” of working people is deploying heavily militarized battalions of ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) to round up suspected undocumented immigrants—engaging in racial profiling, violating Constitutional due process, tearing apart families, deporting legal residents and some U.S. citizens, raiding farms and warehouses and day labor sites, putting millions of hard-working immigrant (and non-immigrant) families in danger and terror.

This self-anointed man of the working people has waged an all-out attack on the unions that make workers’ lives better, thrashing away at workers’ rights and unions’ ability to organize. On the Thursday before Labor Day, Trump spat out yet another anti-worker executive order aimed at erasing collective-bargaining rights from workers at the National Weather Service, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other federal agencies, Huffington Post reported.

All of this pain and harm Trump is causing for workers is part of the plan, right out of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025—promoting the profit and wealth interests of the rich and corporations over working people’s needs and survival. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Trump’s tax plan enriches the rich while taking from the poor, while adding trillions to the national debt. Those tax cuts primarily going to the rich are paid for in part by Trump’s gutting and slashing of workers’ rights and protections on the job.

Writing for The Nation this week, Robert L. Borosage and Sara Steffens summarized Trump’s wholesale assault on workers compellingly:

Employers are being empowered to act lawlessly toward their workers. Unions are being stripped of the legal structure that protected their existence. Immigrant workers are abused, hunted, and deported. Women and minorities will suffer from discrimination at rates not seen since the civil rights revolution. Workers’ families are shouldering higher costs for food, healthcare, and energy.

On Labor Day and beyond, when the guy the goody grin in the McDonald’s suit says he’s helping working people and making their lives “great again,” remember—all the facts show the opposite. The facts show the Trump administration is undermining workers, making their lives harder, exposing them to more life-threatening hazards, robbing millions of overtime pay, eliminating minimum wage protections for millions more, and attacking the unions that improve workers’ pay and rights and safety on the job.

And for some workers, the turbulent first eight months of the Trump administration have meant doing more with less.
Some industries are especially vulnerable to the disruption caused by Trump’s policies.
The full impact of Trump’s policies may take time to emerge.
“We are seeing a lot of [Trump’s] policies come home to roost in the labor market in a bad way,” said Calemine with the AFL-CIO.","In California, crops have gone unharvested, as farmworkers stay home out of fear of immigration raids. Internal Revenue Service workers in Kansas City have found themselves jockeying over desks after remote workers were abruptly ordered back to the office. Tariffs are putting the brakes on hiring.

President Donald Trump won a second term with a promise to support the working-class voters who backed him. But many workers now feel less secure and find their jobs harder to do — squeezed by immigration crackdowns, federal layoffs and funding cuts, and weakened labor protections.

The uncertainty fueled by these policies, combined with Trump’s trade wars, is beginning to surface in economic data, economists say. The July jobs report, which showed the country had undergone the weakest three months of job growth since the pandemic, was so alarming to Trump that he took the unprecedented step of firing the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that compiled and released the data.

Harry Holzer, a Georgetown economist and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution think tank, said the difference between today’s uncertainty and past episodes — such as the COVID pandemic and the 2008 housing crash — is that this one is self-inflicted. “All of this uncertainty has been created by Donald Trump and his fairly erratic economic policies,” said Holzer.

Trump’s slash-and-burn tactics have fallen hardest on federal workers facing firings, hiring freezes and deferred-resignation programs and on immigrants threatened by the administration’s intensified arrest and deportation efforts. But economists, workers and labor advocates say the effects have rippled beyond those groups. From restaurants to factories to health care clinics, business owners and workers are operating in an environment of increasing uncertainty and fear.

The Trump administration, for its part, describes his approach to the economy as one that is “prioritizing American workers, who have been undermined by illegal labor and bad trade deals that shipped jobs overseas,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in an email, adding, “The President’s immigration enforcement efforts and trade deals have encouraged businesses to hire American workers at higher wages.”

Yet the number of jobs added in the manufacturing sector has fallen for three straight months. And for some workers, the turbulent first eight months of the Trump administration have meant doing more with less. Wildland firefighters are now staffing ranger stations to compensate for cuts in the U.S. Forest Service, even as fire season enters its peak. At a Kraft Heinz plant in Michigan that makes pickles, mustard and barbecue sauce, employees are working long hours after the Trump administration revoked the work visas of a half-dozen of their immigrant co-workers. And some workers are doing nothing at all. More than 150,000 federal employees, including large numbers at the Treasury, Agriculture and Defense departments, are currently being paid to stay home, a practice that will end in late September when their paychecks stop under a Trump administration plan to thin the government workforce.

Some industries are especially vulnerable to the disruption caused by Trump’s policies. Construction sites, which depend heavily on immigrant labor, are operating with fewer hands, said George Carrillo, who leads the Hispanic Construction Council, a Washington, D.C.-based policy and advocacy group. The shortage has nudged wages higher for those who remain, but it has also slowed projects and increased safety risks, he said. In construction, “You can’t afford to get hurt, and you have to work through the pain.”

The administration’s move to rescind the legal status of more than a million immigrants from countries that have experienced political turmoil or natural disasters is expected to cause further disruptions in construction, hospitality, food, transportation, health care and other industries reliant on immigrant labor.

After the release of the dismal July jobs report, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer tried to shift public attention toward the supposed job gains made by U.S.-born workers. “Wages continue to rise and native-born workers have accounted for all job gains since Inauguration Day,” she said in a statement. But her assertion about U.S.-born workers was a misreading of the jobs report, according to economists interviewed by The Washington Post.

It is not clear that U.S.-born workers have reason to celebrate.

“The research shows very clearly that when you deport immigrant workers, native-born workers lose jobs as well,” said David Cooper, director of state policy and research at the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute, a think tank affiliated with the labor movement. And the Economic Policy Institute report predicts that Trump’s mass deportation effort — if implemented — could eventually cost U.S.-born workers 2.6 million jobs, with the biggest disruptions expected in Florida, Texas and California, states heavily reliant on immigrant labor. That’s because the hiring of immigrant workers helps support job creation for native-born workers, Cooper said.

In the face of this uncertainty, workers also have fewer protections, as the administration moves to weaken the very agencies tasked with safeguarding them. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which enforces laws against workplace discrimination, has lost its quorum due to firings and has been repurposed to focus on the administration’s anti-DEI agenda.The Trump administration slashed more than 90% of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s budget, eliminating its team that tracked and sought to prevent heat-related deaths among farm and construction workers.

Another example: Trump’s removal of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees private-sector union organizing. The firing deprived the board of a quorum and marked the first time in the board’s history that a sitting member had been dismissed.

That move empowers employers seeking to quash unionization drives, said AFL-CIO advocacy director Jody Calemine. “If an employer wants to delay justice, all they have to do right now is appeal any of the decisions up to the full board, which cannot issue a decision. So even the most fruitless appeals can frustrate workers’ attempts to form a union,” said Calemine.

Through executive order, Trump has also moved to strip nearly a million federal workers of collective bargaining rights, and, earlier this month, a federal appeals court allowed the administration to proceed with the order as the litigation over it unfolds. In early August more than 400,000 Department of Veterans Affairs employees lost bargaining rights as part of what Calemine described as “the single biggest act of union busting in American history.”

Still, the Trump administration has painted a rosy picture of how workers are doing now — and how they will fare in the future. “Thanks to President Trump’s bold America First agenda, fair trade deals and the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are poised to further strengthen the American workforce,” Chavez-DeRemer said in her statement.

Economists and labor advocates worry about the cost of Trump’s tariff policies to workers’ pocketbooks. Even supporters of targeted tariffs — on industries like auto and steel manufacturing — question how much Trump’s chaotic approach to making trade deals will ultimately help workers, given the climate of uncertainty it fosters.

And that’s not the only problem, according to the AFL-CIO’s Calemine. Effective trade policy requires domestic investment in key industries and strong global labor standards, he said, but Trump has done the opposite: signing his “Big Beautiful Bill” that cuts tax incentives for domestic clean energy projects and defunding the agency fighting exploitative labor practices abroad.

That legislation also heavily favors the wealthy, with 65% of benefits going to the top 10% of earners, according to the Penn-Wharton budget model, a nonpartisan research initiative. The lowest-income households are expected to lose out due to cuts in benefits, including Medicaid and SNAP. “This bill is a transfer of money from the poorest households in America to the richest households in America, full stop,” Cooper with the Economic Policy Institute said.

The legislation will also temporarily eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay as a way to help workers. UC Berkeley Labor Center economist Enrique Lopezlira said the benefits of those narrowly targeted tax breaks will likely be outweighed by the costs of Trump’s other economic policies.

“If the full effect of tariffs comes into place, and if the labor market indicators continue to show weakness and eventually more significant downturn, then I don’t see how those future tax benefits will help workers right now or for the rest of the year,” Lopezlira said.

The full impact of Trump’s policies may take time to emerge. For example, the Medicaid cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed on July 4, while projected to lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of health care jobs, won’t go into effect until after the 2026 midterms.

That lingering uncertainty has labor experts and economists feeling pessimistic about what the future holds for American workers.

“We are seeing a lot of [Trump’s] policies come home to roost in the labor market in a bad way,” said Calemine with the AFL-CIO. Workers, he added, are “less free” than they were eight months ago and “increasingly concerned about where our country is headed when it comes to our rights and our freedoms.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2231864749-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 14:56:31.015643

Asylum requests

One of the most common ways illegal immigrants slow or avoid their deportations is by making asylum requests. As of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review reported 3,797,662 immigration cases pending adjudication, of which 2,372,282 had filed applications for asylum.

Under federal law, noncitizens in the U.S. may apply for asylum to seek protection if they have suffered or fear persecution due to their religion, race, nationality, social group, or political opinion. The application must be filed within a year of that person’s arrival in the U.S., and while federal statute outlines that the application be ruled upon within 180 days, the significant backlog means the process tends to go much longer.

Andrew Arthur, a former immigration judge and resident fellow in law and policy for the Center for Immigration Studies, told the Washington Examiner that asylum claims are the “biggest driver of the immigration court backlog.”

“There are about 690 immigration judges, they’re hearing 3.7 million plus cases,” Arthur said. “The reason that they can’t get those cases done in a timely manner is if you don’t have any other form of relief from removal, if you’re removable and you’re not eligible for a green card or anything like that, you’re going to apply for asylum.

“It’s going to stretch out the time you’re here, and after 180 days, you can get a work authorization. So that’s the reason why people file them, and even if you’re not eligible for asylum.”

Arthur said that while the process is supposed to take at most 180 days, the backlog generally takes between 800 days and five years.

Other protections that illegal immigrants frequently apply for as they aim to prolong their stay in the U.S. include statutory withholding of removal, which prevents the applicant from being removed only to a specific country based on a threat or fear of persecution of that country, and protection under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture, which prohibits the U.S. from sending someone to a country where they are more likely than not to be tortured. Both protections, however, still allow for deportation to a compliant third country.

Abrego Garcia was denied asylum in 2019, but he did receive a statutory withholding of removal from his native El Salvador, meaning the federal government is prohibited from deporting him to his home country presently. His lawyer told a federal judge earlier this week that they plan to ask an immigration judge to reopen his immigration case and apply for asylum again.

Habeas corpus petitions

Lawyers for illegal immigrants have also filed a flurry of habeas corpus petitions to keep their clients from being removed from the U.S. These petitions challenge a detention by law enforcement, requiring the government to justify a person’s confinement.

Arthur, who was an immigration judge from 2006 until 2015, said these petitions from detained illegal immigrants were rare when he was on the bench but have become more common in recent years. He also noted that Congress has intentionally removed immigration jurisdiction from district courts twice, moving it instead toward federal appeals courts. He said these new habeas petitions complicate that intention.

“District court judges aren’t supposed to have any jurisdiction at all over deportation matters,” Arthur said. “Those are all supposed to go to the circuit courts, and Congress did that deliberately, because they wanted to get district court judges out of immigration determinations entirely.

“[Congress] did this twice. They did it once in 1996, and then they had a problem with, you know, judges taking these things up on habeas. And then they did it again in 2005, in the REAL ID Act of 2005, to say you also don’t get habeas jurisdiction.”

The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland issued a standing order in May granting an automatic two-day pause on the deportation of an illegal immigrant who files a habeas corpus petition in that judicial district. The Justice Department sued the entire bench of judges, arguing, in part, that jurisdiction for nearly all of the petitions should, under federal law, go to the federal appeals court above the district court.

A U.S. district judge dismissed the lawsuit, but the judge did offer other venues for the Justice Department to challenge the standing order.

Efforts to restrict federal immigration enforcement

Illegal immigrant advocates have also succeeded in placing limits on cooperation between local police departments and federal officials, as well as in persuading a court to restrict how federal officials may conduct immigration operations.

A federal judge on the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California issued a ruling last month that significantly restricted how federal immigration officials may go about conducting immigration raids in the Los Angeles area. The sweeping injunction was upheld by a federal appeals court, and the DOJ asked the Supreme Court earlier this month to issue an order pausing the restrictions.

The lawsuit is another example of district courts inserting themselves into immigration matters and slowing deportations.

“Courts are imposing themselves in areas in which Congress never intended them to go in these cases,” Arthur told the Washington Examiner. “If there is an issue with an alien’s arrest, if there is an issue with due process in the case, the proper venue is with the circuit court, not with the district court judge.

“DOJ has been battling an expansive class action definition that district court judges are using to interpose themselves into these immigration matters.”

SUPREME COURT FRUSTRATED BY LOWER COURT OVERREACHES

While the administration has been slowed in courts from deporting many migrants quickly, it has continued its aggressive efforts to remove illegal immigrants from the U.S.

The Trump administration has also racked up multiple wins on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket, with the justices allowing for the removal of temporary legal status and protections for various groups of noncitizens, as dozens of lawsuits over immigration policies continue across the country.",https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25185732268065.jpg,N,,2025-09-01 10:57:02.865981

George Wallace, he federalized the Alabama National Guard to protect civil rights protestors on the Selma march to the capital.","Hopefully, when the cops come to Boston, Mayor Michelle Wu will put up a better fight than that Rhode Island assistant attorney general did.

Not that Wu will use the “Don’t you know who I am?” defense to ICE agents that Rhode Island Assistant Attorney General Devon Flanagan Hogan used when the Newport cops put her in the back seat of a patrol car the other day.

“Buddy, you’re going to regret this. I’m an AG,” Hogan told the cops. Yeah, right, the cops replied. Hogan has been suspended from her job.

That will not happen to Wu because, unlike the lady prosecutor with three names, everyone knows who Wu is. And, unlike Hogan, she has her own police force.

And everyone knows that she is the mayor of Boston who is standing up to President Donald Trump and his “tyrannical” plan to send National Guard troops and ICE agents into cities like Boston to combat growing crime and to arrest criminal illegal immigrants.

Over my dead body, Wu, in effect, said to Trump and to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Revolutionary Boston stood up to the British and Boston will stand up to you, Wu, in so many words, said.

To cheering Boston patriots (city workers and campaign supporters) Wu in a letter to Bondi and a City Hall Plaza rally, put it this way: “On behalf of the people of Boston, and in solidarity with the cities and communities targeted by this federal administration for our refusal to bow down to unconstitutional threats and unlawful coercion, we affirm our support for each other and our democracy.

“Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom and a home for everyone.”

“Boston,” she said, “will never back down from who we are and what we stand for.”

In Boston’s case, it is Wu’s insistence that Boston is so free of crime that it does not need help from the National Guard. Also, it has the Boston Trust Act that prohibits Boston police from helping ICE in the arrest of illegal immigrants without a criminal warrant.

While it all sounds bold and brave, Wu’s remarks are not original. Governors, let alone mayors, have been “standing up” to the federal government and the deployment of the National Guard for years. And losing,

While the federal Posse Comitatus Act restricts the use of the National Guard for domestic enforcement purposes, there are exceptions. They include insurrection, rebellion, a breakdown in law and order and “unlawful obstruction” of federal actions.

It has been used to maintain law and order more than thirty times in the last 50 years or so, whether invited by a governor or not. Trump needed no invitation in Washington, D.C., a federal city, or earlier in Los Angeles.

While Democrats and progressives vehemently oppose Trump sending the National Guard into states and cities to help deter crime and enforce the law, it was not always the case.

Liberals cheered Democrat President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 when, over the objections of segregationist Democrat Alabama Gov. George Wallace, he federalized the Alabama National Guard to protect civil rights protestors on the Selma march to the capital.

Johnson followed in the footsteps to President John F. Kennedy, who, in 1963, five months before he was assassinated, federalized the Alabama National Guard to remove Wallace from blocking two black students from attending the previously all white University of Alabama.

While it was the proper thing to do under the civil rights movement, Wallace, in his last-ditch “Stand in the Schoolhouse Door” speech, vilified the federal government.

Sounding a lot like Michelle Wu today, Wallace said, “I stand here today, as governor of this sovereign state, and refuse to willingly to submit to illegal usurpation of power by the central government.”

The government’s takeover and use of the National Guard was an “unwelcomed, unwanted and unwarranted intrusion” upon the state.

Which it probably was. But it was legal and the right thing to do.

So is sending in the Guard to do the job that Democrat mayors will not do.

After the long holiday weekend, President Donald Trump will begin contending with significant legal disputes unfolding on multiple fronts. From the Federal Reserve to trade policy to deportations of illegal immigrants, here's a look at the high-stakes legal showdowns shaping Trump’s week.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee, signaled on Friday she will seek to rule quickly on whether Trump acted unlawfully in moving to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations. She didn’t make a ruling during the two-hour hearing but told both sides to submit more filings by Sept 2. Only then will she decide whether to issue an order that temporarily protects Cook’s job while the case continues.

TRUMP SAYS HE’S ‘ALWAYS’ READY FOR LEGAL FIGHT AS OUSTED FED GOVERNOR PLANS LAWSUIT

Trump's unprecedented attempt to oust Cook sets the stage for a high-stakes legal battle likely bound for the Supreme Court.

Trump fired Cook on Aug. 25, which prompted her to sue him in federal court three days later. Her lawsuit names as defendants Trump, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

It is not clear if Cook has attempted to enter the Federal Reserve's main headquarters in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood in D.C. since Trump's letter terminating her. The Federal Reserve declined to say whether Cook has tried to work from her office, is working remotely, or retains access to the email and other resources she needs for her job.

Before Cook filed her suit, a Fed spokesperson acknowledged the potential legal feud and wrote in an Aug. 26 statement that the Fed will ""abide by any court decision.""

COOK’S POTENTIAL EXIT HANDS TRUMP GREATER SWAY OVER FED BOARD SHAPING US MONETARY POLICY

In a different legal case, Judge Cobb issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from carrying out expedited deportations of illegal immigrants. The policy would have allowed some to be deported without first going before an immigration judge.

In an Aug. 29 opinion, Cobb ruled that the Trump administration’s plan to quickly deport illegal immigrants who had lived in the U.S. less than two years violated their right to due process.

""In defending this skimpy process, the government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment,"" Cobb wrote, adding that the government could accuse ""not only noncitizens, but everyone.""

""The government could accuse you of entering unlawfully, relegate you to a bare-bones proceeding where it would ‘prove’ your unlawful entry, and then immediately remove you,"" Cobb added.

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S EXPANDED DEPORTATION PLAN OVER DUE PROCESS CONCERNS

Meanwhile, on the trade front, a federal appeals court said on Friday that Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose new tariffs on imported goods.

The court said that power lies squarely with Congress or within existing trade policy frameworks. Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the court allowed the tariffs to remain in effect until mid-October.

TRUMP CALLS TARIFF WINDFALL 'SO BEAUTIFUL TO SEE' AS CASH SAILS IN

The setback chips away at Trump’s trade policy, long a centerpiece of his economic agenda, which leans heavily on tariffs to raise revenue and exert pressure on foreign trading partners. Trump has previously said that tariff revenue could offset the cost of his ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" and add hundreds of billions to the U.S. economy.

Tariff revenues rose steadily from approximately $17.4 billion in April to $23.9 billion in May, before climbing to $28 billion in June and peaking at $29.6 billion in July. According to the Treasury Department’s latest ""Customs and Certain Excise Taxes"" data, released on Aug. 28, total tariff revenues have reached $183.1 billion for the fiscal year.

At the current pace, the U.S. could collect as much tariff revenue in just four to five months as it did over the entire previous year.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/trump-cabinet-meeting-1.png,N,,2025-09-01 10:57:06.449337

Challenges Faced by Immigrants in Exercising Their Rights Despite having rights under immigration laws, immigrants often face barriers in practice: Lack of awareness: Many immigrants are unaware of their rights.
Role of Courts in Protecting Immigrant Rights Courts play a crucial role in balancing state interests with immigrant rights.","Immigration laws around the world not only define the process by which foreign nationals can enter, reside, and work in another country but also outline the fundamental rights and protections available to immigrants. These rights ensure that immigrants—whether they are permanent residents, temporary visa holders, asylum seekers, or undocumented migrants—are treated with dignity and fairness under the law. Understanding the rights of immigrants is crucial for protecting their interests and for ensuring that they do not fall victim to exploitation, discrimination, or abuse.

In this article, we will discuss in detail the rights of immigrants under immigration laws, their legal protections, constitutional safeguards, human rights perspectives, and practical implications.

1. Understanding Immigrant Rights

Immigrant rights refer to the legal entitlements and protections guaranteed to foreign nationals residing in a country, either temporarily or permanently. These rights can stem from national constitutions, immigration statutes, international treaties, and conventions on human rights.

The rights of immigrants vary depending on their immigration status. For example, a permanent resident or lawful immigrant may enjoy broader rights compared to a temporary visitor, while undocumented migrants may have more limited rights but still remain protected under certain legal and human rights frameworks.

The central idea is that while immigration laws regulate entry and residence, basic human rights and legal protections are universal and cannot be denied solely based on nationality.

2. Key Rights of Immigrants Under Immigration Laws

(a) Right to Equality and Non-Discrimination

Immigrants are protected against discrimination based on race, religion, gender, nationality, or immigration status. Most democratic constitutions, including India’s Constitution (Article 14), guarantee equality before the law and equal protection of the laws to all persons, not just citizens.

This means immigrants cannot be arbitrarily treated differently in matters of justice, education, or healthcare simply because of their status.

(b) Right to Life and Personal Liberty

One of the most fundamental rights available to immigrants is the right to life and liberty. This includes protection against arbitrary arrest, detention, or deportation without due legal process.

For instance, the Supreme Court of India has recognized that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution applies to all persons, including non-citizens, thereby safeguarding their right to live with dignity.

(c) Right to Due Process of Law

Immigrants, even if undocumented, have the right to fair legal procedures before being detained or deported. This includes:

Right to be heard

Right to legal representation

Right to challenge orders of deportation in courts

Right to appeal adverse immigration decisions

This ensures that immigrants are not arbitrarily expelled from a country without following the proper legal framework.

(d) Right to Work (Subject to Authorization)

Immigrants with legal status such as work permits, employment visas, or permanent residency have the right to work and earn a livelihood.

Employers are generally prohibited from exploiting immigrant workers.

Even undocumented workers, in many countries, are entitled to certain protections under labor laws, such as minimum wages, workplace safety, and protection from forced labor.

(e) Right to Education

Children of immigrants, regardless of their legal status, often enjoy the right to free primary and secondary education.

For example, in India, the Right to Education Act ensures access to schooling for all children up to 14 years of age.

International conventions such as the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasize non-discrimination in access to education.

(f) Right to Access Healthcare

Many countries provide immigrants, at least legally residing ones, with access to public healthcare systems. Even undocumented immigrants may have rights to emergency medical care because healthcare is seen as an extension of the right to life.

Preventing denial of treatment ensures public health safety and respects humanitarian values.

(g) Right to Family Life and Protection of Family Unity

Immigrants have the right to marry, live with their families, and apply for family reunification in certain jurisdictions.

Immigration laws often provide pathways for spouses, children, and dependent parents to join lawful residents or citizens.

Arbitrary deportation that separates families is often restricted under human rights laws.

(h) Right to Seek Asylum and Refugee Protection

Immigrants fleeing persecution in their home countries are protected under international law, particularly the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol.

They have the right to seek asylum and cannot be forcibly returned to countries where their lives or freedom are at risk (principle of non-refoulement).

(i) Right Against Arbitrary Detention

Immigrants cannot be detained indefinitely without legal justification. Immigration detention must follow lawful procedures and must not violate basic human dignity.

They have the right to know the reasons for their detention and the right to challenge it before a judicial authority.

(j) Right to Property and Business (With Restrictions)

In some jurisdictions, immigrants are allowed to acquire property or start businesses, though often with restrictions compared to citizens. For example, in India, non-citizens can buy property subject to compliance with Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) regulations.

(k) Right to Freedom of Religion and Expression

Immigrants enjoy fundamental freedoms such as practicing their religion, expressing opinions, and participating in cultural activities. However, these rights are subject to reasonable restrictions similar to citizens.

(l) Protection from Exploitation and Human Trafficking

Immigrants, especially undocumented ones, are vulnerable to exploitation, forced labor, and trafficking. Immigration laws, combined with labor and criminal laws, ensure their protection from such abuses.

Employers exploiting immigrant labor may face penalties.

Victims of trafficking are entitled to rehabilitation and legal remedies.

(m) Right to Legal Remedies and Access to Courts

Immigrants can approach courts for enforcement of their legal and constitutional rights.

For example, they may file petitions against wrongful deportation or exploitation.

Courts play a key role in balancing state security interests with immigrant rights.

(n) Right to Cultural and Social Integration

Immigrants often have rights to participate in social, cultural, and even some political activities within the host country.

Permanent residents may be allowed to vote in local elections in some jurisdictions.

They are also entitled to protection against cultural marginalization.

3. Special Protections for Vulnerable Immigrant Groups

Immigration laws often recognize the special needs of vulnerable groups:

Children: Protected under international conventions, with special emphasis on education, healthcare, and family unity.

Women: Special protections against gender-based violence, trafficking, and workplace discrimination.

Refugees: Special legal status, non-refoulement protection, and humanitarian aid.

Undocumented Migrants: Even without legal status, they are entitled to basic human rights like emergency healthcare, protection against exploitation, and access to justice.

4. International Perspective on Immigrant Rights

Immigrant rights are not just shaped by domestic laws but also by international instruments:

Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) – Recognizes equality, dignity, and non-discrimination.

International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1966) – Ensures due process, liberty, and fair trial rights.

International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966) – Provides for education, health, and work-related rights.

1951 Refugee Convention & 1967 Protocol – Core framework for refugee rights and asylum.

These international standards influence domestic immigration laws worldwide.

5. Challenges Faced by Immigrants in Exercising Their Rights

Despite having rights under immigration laws, immigrants often face barriers in practice:

Lack of awareness: Many immigrants are unaware of their rights.

Language barriers: Difficulty in accessing legal remedies due to linguistic differences.

Fear of deportation: Undocumented migrants avoid reporting exploitation.

Discrimination and xenophobia: Prejudice restricts their ability to integrate.

Complex legal systems: Immigration laws are often highly technical and difficult to navigate without legal assistance.

6. Role of Courts in Protecting Immigrant Rights

Courts play a crucial role in balancing state interests with immigrant rights. Judicial pronouncements have time and again emphasized:

The application of constitutional rights to non-citizens.

Striking down arbitrary detentions and deportations.

Ensuring access to healthcare and education.

In India, for example, the Supreme Court in National Human Rights Commission v. State of Arunachal Pradesh (1996) held that even refugees are entitled to protection of life and liberty under Article 21.

Conclusion

Immigration laws across the globe serve a dual purpose—on one hand, they regulate the entry and residence of foreign nationals, and on the other, they guarantee a minimum standard of rights and protections for immigrants. While citizens may enjoy certain exclusive rights like voting or holding high public office, immigrants are still entitled to fundamental protections such as equality, liberty, education, healthcare, and access to justice.

The rights of immigrants under immigration laws act as a safeguard against exploitation, abuse, and arbitrary state action. However, the challenge lies in ensuring that these rights are effectively implemented in practice. Greater awareness, stronger enforcement mechanisms, and adherence to international human rights standards can ensure that immigrants live with dignity and security in their host countries.

Trump vs. Democrats and everyone else. Lawmakers return to Washington on Tuesday amid a deeply unsettled national political and economic landscape. President Donald Trump is at the center of a dozen controversies roiling the country, as he always seems to be. Congress has been on recess for the last month-plus, with members and senators back home and traveling around the world during August.

The federal government shuts down on Oct. 1, barring a bipartisan funding deal – even a short-term one – as the White House unilaterally slashes billions of dollars of previously approved spending.

Democrats are infuriated. They were skeptical about negotiating a funding deal with Republicans after Trump and GOP leaders jammed through a $9 billion rescissions package in mid-July. Now, Trump is slashing billions of dollars in funding without Congress via legally questionable “pocket rescissions.”

Yet the big question remains whether Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are prepared to vote to shut down the government over these disputes. Or can they even trust Trump if he tries to cut a deal now only to backtrack later once it’s signed?

Trump is also threatening to take his “crime emergency” and harsh immigration crackdown into more big cities, with Chicago and possibly Boston in his sights. Democrats are outraged here too.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and local officials continue to tread carefully with more than 2,000 National Guard troops in the city, as well as hundreds of federal law-enforcement personnel. Crime has dropped significantly during the federal surge. So Democrats are in a bit of a political bind here, not wanting to look weak on crime even as ICE conducts checkpoints across the city.

Trump’s tariff regime took a massive blow last Friday when a federal appeals court ruled that the president exceeded his authority by imposing unilateral tariffs on dozens of countries. The White House will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, with Trump’s tariffs remaining in place until mid-October.

Tariffs have come to define the president’s economic policies over the last eight months, so this could be a huge blow to his agenda. The Congressional Budget Office said that the tariffs will decrease the deficit by $4 trillion over a decade.

Trump has also been at war with the Federal Reserve, another flashpoint for Democrats. Trump is trying to oust Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve governor appointed by former President Joe Biden, over allegations of mortgage fraud. A federal judge heard a legal challenge to the firing on Friday but didn’t issue a ruling, meaning Cook remains in place for now.

The Federal Open Market Committee, which determines interest rates, will meet in two weeks. Fed Chair Jay Powell — who Trump has threatened to fire, too – has already signaled an interest rate cut is coming even as inflation worries grow.

The CDC – which is under HHS and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. – is in a state of absolute chaos. Trump fired Susan Monarez, the agency’s director, last week. Monarez is suing the administration, and four other top health officials resigned as a result. Schumer and other top Democrats are calling on Trump to fire RFK. That’s not going to happen, but it shows how bad things have gotten at the high-profile agency, already in turmoil following layoffs and a recent deadly shooting at its Atlanta headquarters.

Senate HELP Committee Chair Bill Cassidy (R-La.), up for reelection next year, vouched for RFK and other Trump health picks. Yet now Cassidy is vowing to use his panel to investigate the matter. RFK is slated to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday.

Trump also axed former Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.), who spent less than two months as IRS commissioner. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is serving in the role as of now. But we don’t expect Bessent to serve in the role in the long run, based on our conversations with Trump administration officials.

The Trump administration has a pile of key nominees that need to be confirmed. Stephen Miran has been nominated to take Adriana Kugler’s seat on the Federal Reserve board. Kugler announced last month she would leave the board early.

Speaking of nominations, Senate Republicans are expected to move quickly this month to change the chamber’s rules in order to fast-track the confirmation of Trump’s nominees. This is in response to Democrats’ historic slow-walking of Trump’s picks, which reached a boiling point as the Senate was about to leave for the August recess.

Trump still faces the fallout from the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, too. While the Justice Department has begun to turn over troves of Epstein-related documents to the House Oversight Committee, Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) are pushing to force a full public release of the files and will hold a Capitol Hill press conference with Epstein victims on Wednesday.

A federal court in Washington has blocked the Trump administration’s attempt to expand fast-track deportations, ruling that the policy likely violates constitutional protections while litigation moves forward.

The case, Make the Road New York v. Noem, was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of the District of Columbia, and the New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Make the Road New York. The lawsuit challenged the administration’s January 2025 policy that authorized Immigration and Customs Enforcement to place people into expedited removal proceedings if they could not prove two years of continuous presence in the United States, regardless of where they were encountered.

Previously, expedited removal had been limited to individuals at or near the border or those who had arrived by sea. The expanded designation allowed ICE to arrest individuals at courthouses, workplaces, and community spaces far from the border, stripping them of the chance to present their case before an immigration judge.

In a 48-page memorandum opinion, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb granted a stay of the policy, finding that the government’s expansion of expedited removal likely violated the due process rights of people living in the country’s interior. The judge wrote that while expedited removal had historically applied to individuals with negligible ties to the United States, the new policy swept in people who had lived here for months or years, many of whom had pending asylum claims or other legal avenues for relief.

The court emphasized that the Constitution guarantees no person can be removed from the country without an opportunity to be heard. It found that the truncated process of expedited removal, when applied to people long settled in the United States, created a significant risk of wrongful deportation. The opinion described cases in which people were arrested at their immigration court hearings, their regular proceedings dismissed without notice, and then placed into expedited removal where they could be deported within days, with no chance to contact counsel or gather evidence.

The ruling came after Make the Road presented evidence that ICE had conducted courthouse arrests in cities including New York, Chicago, Seattle, and San Antonio. The group also documented workplace raids that began in June as part of what the administration described as a new phase of immigration enforcement. In one instance, the White House “border czar” Thomas Homan warned, “You’re going to see more work site enforcement than you’ve ever seen in the history of this nation,” according to declarations submitted in court.

The court found that individuals targeted under the 2025 designation faced irreparable harm, including separation from their families and the loss of the chance to pursue asylum claims. It rejected the government’s argument that noncitizens who entered unlawfully had no constitutional protections, calling that a startling claim that would undermine due process for everyone.

The ruling was celebrated by immigrant rights advocates who brought the case.

“The Trump administration’s expansion of fast-track deportations has subjected thousands of people to an unfair, arbitrary, and error-prone system. The court’s decision reaffirms the fundamental principle that people receive due process when the government seeks to deport them or their families,” said Anand Balakrishnan, senior staff attorney with the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project and lead counsel.

“We are glad the judge recognized the immense due-process problems posed by this administration’s reckless expansion of expedited removal. This policy has inflicted enormous harms on MRNY’s members and community, and it has to stop. We will continue to defend our communities from unconstitutional attacks levied by this administration, because we are here to stay,” said Harold Solis, co-legal director of Make the Road New York.

“This ruling is a vital reminder that due process is not optional. Expanding expedited removal would have exposed thousands to wrongful deportation, without even the chance to make their case. We welcome the court’s decision to block this dangerous policy. If the government can sidestep people’s due process rights, it sets a dangerous precedent that puts everyone’s rights at risk,” said Aditi Shah, staff attorney with the ACLU of the District of Columbia.

“This decision rightly rejects the Trump administration’s extremist, unjust policy of fast-tracking mass deportations without due process,” said Donna Lieberman, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. “This cruel policy tried to deny hundreds of thousands of people — parents, workers, friends, and loved ones — their constitutional right to a fair hearing, putting them at risk of wrongful deportation. Everyone deserves a fair day in court when their future is on the line.”

Declarations submitted in the case included accounts from individuals at risk under the new designation. One woman, identified as Jane Doe 2, described fleeing government-aligned gangs in March 2024 with her partner and children. She was in regular immigration proceedings and had applied for asylum, but under the new rules faced the prospect of being detained and separated from her children. Another member, John Doe 4, said he had filed an asylum application after arriving in October 2023, but feared being placed into expedited removal before his case could be heard.

The court also highlighted cases in which people who had been in the country longer than two years were nonetheless placed into expedited removal because they lacked documentation to prove their presence on short notice. In one instance, a woman who had lived in the United States since 2015 was detained with her teenage son after a traffic stop and ordered removed the next morning without access to counsel.

The government argued that Congress had given the Department of Homeland Security discretion to apply expedited removal broadly and that noncitizens without lawful status were entitled only to the process Congress provided. The court rejected that reasoning, citing more than a century of precedent that even those who entered unlawfully must be afforded due process before removal.

The stay issued by the court halts the 2025 designation and related guidance while the case proceeds. The opinion stressed that it did not question the constitutionality of expedited removal at the border, but only its expansion deep into the interior of the country.

A judge, however, ruled that he specifically could not be deported to El Salvador because of credible threats he faced from gangs there.
After being returned to the U.S. from El Salvador on June 6, Abrego was immediately placed in federal custody in Tennessee.
Abrego’s conflicts with the Trump administration began on March 12, when he was pulled over by ICE officers while driving with his son on his way home from a worksite in Baltimore.
On March 15, three days after being pulled over, he was flown to El Salvador.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who has become an international symbol of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, was wrongfully deported to El Salvador in March, then brought back to the U.S. months later only to face charges and new deportation efforts.

The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that he is a member of the dangerous Salvadoran gang known as MS-13 and should not be allowed to stay here. In August, immigration officials said they intend to send him to Uganda. His family and attorneys deny that he has any gang connections and say he is being punished for fighting for his constitutional rights. They are seeking his release and to stop his deportation.

Abrego, 30, has found himself in the middle of Trump’s crackdown on immigration as his legal battles highlight the new deportation policies the administration has sought to use.

The Salvadoran father of three is currently enmeshed in several court cases.

Most recently, he applied for asylum in immigration court after he was returned to the U.S.

His lawyers have also filed a lawsuit to ensure his right to due process as his deportation case continues. That case is being heard by a federal judge in Maryland, Paula Xinis.

Finally, he has a federal criminal case in Tennessee, where prosecutors have charged him with human trafficking. He has pleaded not guilty.

Here are the latest updates on what could happen to Abrego and how this all unfolded.

A fight to remain in the U.S.

Most recently, on Aug. 25, Abrego’s attorneys asked an immigration judge for protection from deportation amid threats by the Trump administration to send him to the African nation of Uganda, a country to which he has no ties.

Abrego filed the case with Baltimore’s immigration court in the hopes of being granted asylum or a withholding of removal to Uganda, if an immigration judge determines there is a credible threat to his life if he is sent there.

He applied for asylum when he first arrived in the U.S. but that request was denied in 2019 because Abrego had missed the one-year deadline to file. A judge, however, ruled that he specifically could not be deported to El Salvador because of credible threats he faced from gangs there.

His attorneys argue that he’s now able to reapply for asylum because he exited the country — when he was deported — and re-entered, which started a new one-year clock.

Abrego cannot be deported to El Salvador, but that still leaves the door open to being deported to some other country, a policy pursued by Trump. In August, the administration suggested sending him to Uganda, which has agreed to take in deportees from the U.S. if they have no criminal record and aren’t an unaccompanied minor.

Abrego also has a case before Xinis, the federal judge in Maryland. In that case, his attorneys are seeking to ensure his due process rights are protected as they attempt to stop his deportation.

Last week, Xinis ordered that Abrego remain in the U.S., temporarily blocking his deportation to Uganda, and set an evidentiary hearing for mid-October. Her order also said that Abrego should remain in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement within 200 miles of the court in Greenbelt, Maryland, until she is able to rule on his petition by mid-October. That prevents Abrego from being sent to a state like Louisiana, where the courts tend to have a higher denial rate for immigrants seeking protections.

In the meantime, Abrego remains at a Virginia detention center — about 200 miles from the Maryland courthouse.

The Trump administration’s efforts to deport Abrego to Uganda could have larger implications for its policy of deportations to “third countries.” Rwanda, Costa Rica, El Salvador and others have agreements with the U.S. to accept deportees.

Federal prosecutors said that if he pleaded guilty to human trafficking charges in a federal criminal case brought against him in June in Tennessee, and served a maximum of 10 years in prison, he could instead be deported to Costa Rica, which said it would receive him as a refugee and allow him to live freely.

An attorney for Abrego said he would not accept the plea deal, as he “will not accept charges of which he’s not guilty.”

A turbulent return

Abrego’s detention in the U.S. and the Trump administration’s attempt to deport him to a “third country” follow months of political firestorm.

He was first deported to El Salvador in March because of what officials described as an “administrative error” that was in violation of the 2019 court order.

Abrego was sent along with hundreds of people, most of them from Venezuela, to a notorious Salvadoran megaprison. The fight for his return sparked a legal back-and-forth that involved the Supreme Court, which ruled in April that the federal government had to facilitate Abrego’s return. The decision was a high-profile blow to the administration.

After much resistance from the Trump administration, he was returned to the U.S. in June and immediately hit with human smuggling charges out of Tennessee. He has pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations.

The charges accuse him of transporting people who were not legally in the United States. Abrego was pulled over in Tennessee in 2022 while driving a van transporting several others, but was not charged with anything at the time. He has said he was helping transport workers and denied the charges.

After being returned to the U.S. from El Salvador on June 6, Abrego was immediately placed in federal custody in Tennessee. He was then released from federal custody on parole on Aug. 22 — leading to a tearful reunion with his family after more than 160 days apart.

He was only free for three days. Abrego was told on the Friday he was released that he needed to appear for an immigration check-in on the following Monday. As his attorneys expected, he was taken into ICE custody and hours later sent to a detention center in Virginia on Aug. 25.

Abrego’s conflicts with the Trump administration began on March 12, when he was pulled over by ICE officers while driving with his son on his way home from a worksite in Baltimore. He was on the phone with his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, and told her he had pulled into the parking lot of an Ikea when an officer “put his lights on.”

When an officer got to Abrego’s car, according to Vasquez Sura, they told him to roll down the windows and step out of the vehicle. Abrego told the officer his son was in the back seat and had special needs. In a sworn declaration, she said officers then hung up the call, and minutes later someone called back, identified themself as a person with the Department of Homeland Security, and told her she needed to get there in 10 minutes to pick up her son or they would “call child protective services.”

When she arrived, she said, Abrego was on the curb in handcuffs, and officers on the scene claimed his “immigration status had changed,” Vasquez Sura has said.

He was arrested by immigration authorities and transferred to facilities in Maryland, Louisiana and Texas, the sworn declaration said. On March 15, three days after being pulled over, he was flown to El Salvador.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-08/250828-kilmar-abrego-garcia-timeline-cs-46115e.jpg",N,,2025-09-01 08:56:43.847794

US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed on Sunday that the federal government plans to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in major cities.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem told CBS News.

She pointed to rising crime in urban areas as a factor driving the decision.

“There’s a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now, and so we haven’t taken anything off the table,” she said, adding later: “I’d encourage every single big city — San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are — if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom like the people of Washington, D.C., are now ... they should call us.”

Asked about what the expansion might look like in Chicago, and whether it could involve the deployment of National Guard troops to assist with immigration raids and arrests, Noem said: “That always is a prerogative of President [Donald] Trump and his decision. I won’t speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities.”

Her comments came a day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order outlining the city’s response to Trump’s planned enforcement operations, including the possible use of National Guard forces.

Johnson criticized the idea of militarized immigration enforcement and warned of potential scenarios involving armed vehicles and active-duty soldiers patrolling city streets — despite no one requesting such actions.

The haughty dismissal of protests as the work of far-right agitators “whipping up” anti-migrant sentiment was particularly tone deaf after the charging of one man for sexual offences. British people, rightly, do not take kindly to being branded bigots by their own leaders.

Everybody needs to take a breath.

The truth is that the question posed by hostility to asylum hotels is not a technical one, to be solved by speeding up a bureaucratic process, nor a patient, patronising exposition of operational hurdles to stemming the flow. It is a far simpler, emotional query: whose side are you on, really, prime minister?

That perhaps is why the two most compelling voices are not conventional politicians but men who deal not in facts but in what are fashionably called “vibes”. Neither the leader of Reform UK, Nigel Farage, nor the leader of the established church, Stephen Cottrell, the Archbishop of York, seems too worried by the sort of concerns that afflict Dickens’s “practical” man. Their debate is a matter of faith and belief, not of management and compromise.

Farage portrays himself as the ultimate patriot, putting the interests of the British people first, ready to break international treaties, redefine human rights and send lawbreakers to languish in the Tora Bora caves of Afghanistan if that’s what it takes. But as Charles de Gaulle said, it can be hard to distinguish between patriotism, when love of your own people comes first, and nationalism, when hate for people other than your own takes precedence.

• Zia Yusuf: Reform’s deportation plans will be like Trump 2.0

Cottrell, as befits the leader of a worldwide communion, puts the commonality of humanity ahead of purely native concerns. As he himself pointed out in our interview on Sky News yesterday, this may seem naive and virtue signalling.

In practice, Farage and Cottrell are not as far apart as they might seem. On some issues they may never agree. It seems evident to me that if there are legal obstacles to decisive action it must be time to rewrite or suspend compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, the Refugee Convention and the Convention on Torture, as several Tory and Labour grandees are suggesting. The bishops are unlikely to back that step.

However, what the two men would agree on is that the illegal migration crisis demands bold, large-scale policies rather than Whitehall tinkering. Bizarrely, a quiet continuity of policy between Joe Biden and Donald Trump offers some lessons about what can be done, even by those who differ on principles.

First, most potential refugees would prefer to stay close to home. During the past three years, some 4.5 million Latin American migrants who might otherwise have headed north have remained in the region, under agreements set up by Biden and boosted by Trump. Safe Mobility Offices in countries like Colombia, Costa Rica and Ecuador have administered programmes that found them homes and jobs. The White House hardly ever mentions SMOs, given that it would mean sharing the credit with Biden; but their effectiveness is undeniable.

Second, the French are right that the reason so many young men risk crossing the busiest sea lanes in the world is that the same gangs who put them in small boats and in the backs of vans will find them work in the black or grey economies.

Exploitation faced by women in beauty parlours and dangers to men on delivery bikes won’t be prevented by the odd immigration raid here and there. The prospect of digital ID cards has been floated in recent days by the influential Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden. The case for them being required as proof of legitimate employment is almost unassailable. The government should waste no time in legislating.

Finally, if the church and its liberal allies really mean it when they chant “refugees are welcome here”, they should be given the chance to show it. Over the past four years, both the Biden and Trump administrations have encouraged the growth of private sponsorship of asylum seekers. Under Trump, a new initiative, the Welcome Corps, aims to recruit thousands of families who will take in a refugee. Any group of five individuals who can raise about £1,800 can take responsibility for the settlement of potential refugees over their first 90 days with government support. It is claimed that over the past four years some 780,000 people have been helped to settle in the US on such programmes. Sports clubs, schools, even book clubs, and of course churches, have led the way.

Both the Reform leader and the archbishop are Christian believers. The Victorian believers knew how to bring politics and morality, parliament and church, together for the good of the nation. Private sponsorship of potential refugees could not be more British.

After all, the real reason so many people want to come here legitimately is they think we are still the kind, compassionate nation they can glimpse in English novels of the 19th century, the country of the Poor Laws and Factory Acts, of the kind of charity supported by the merchants of Coketown. Many would say that is our past and we have fallen from moral grace. But there’s nothing that says we can’t rise once again.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Feb02538f-3bac-4168-b9f2-169f687a1a1b.jpg?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-09-01 05:57:39.574283

Sharereh Moghadam was taken into custody after attending an in-person immigration meeting, which she thought was a step closer to citizenship, according to Aghdassi. Instead, she was transferred to a detention center in Phoenix, Arizona.

""She had green card and passed exam for citizenship and was waiting for the ceremony,"" said Aghdassi. “She is not a bank robber or thief or criminal.""

Aghdassi says Sharareh was born in Iran and entered the country legally with her documents in order. He believes a recent trip to Iran is the reason behind her detention.

Despite being granted the opportunity to remain in the country, between August 2015 and May 9, 2019, Moghaddam was convicted of two separate theft offenses, demonstrating a clear disregard for U.S. laws and rendering her subject to removal under U.S. immigration law,"" wrote an ICE spokesperson in a statement to NBC4.

The Iranian couple runs a balloon shop along Laurel Canyon, which has gained the community's support over the last few weeks. Customers have begun signing a petition requesting that lawmakers step in before Moghadam's next hearing.

ICE agents don't have the authority to decide who they're going to enforce immigration law on and who they are not.","As ICE ramps up their raids in Connecticut, we see protests in front of courthouses, lawmakers saying they're concerned about the suspects getting their day in court before they're deported.

The pressure, though, is also mounting on local police departments to cooperate with the feds. So how does that impact our local officers?

NBC Connecticut's Mike Hydeck spoke with Rep. Greg Howard (R-Stonington), who is the lead on the House party of Public Safety and Security Committee. He is also a full-time detectives with the Stonington Police Department.

Mike Hydeck: Good to have you back. Thanks for coming. So can you give us, we've seen all the anxiety in the streets and when these officers come up and they try to take undocumented workers off the streets, we've seen that side of the story. What's it like to be in a local police department? Can you give us kind of a behind the scenes look, or some idea of what it's like when the federal government comes in says, ""Look, we need your assistance. We're trying to do an operation here."" Does that prove to be stressful? How does it how does it all unfold?

Greg Howard: I think it's a big picture. First of all, yes, it's stressful on police officers. They have to navigate the nuances of these laws to know what they can say to ICE agents and what they can't. But we don't do that with any other federal agency. FBI is in town, DEA is in town, our local police officers work together. Law enforcement around the country works like that, state to state. Where I live and where I work is on a border into Rhode Island. We work Rhode Island police departments every single day. It's not uncommon. That's the first thing. I think the bigger picture, I think that folks need to understand this, is ICE agents would prefer to take the individuals into custody in a controlled environment, like a police department, like a correction facility, like a courthouse. But for most of these, the ICE agents are forbidden to do that because of Connecticut's Trust Act. That forces the federal agents to go into communities. And what's happening is they are, in their quest to get law violators, in other words, people are committing state crimes and that are here undocumented, in their quest to do that, they're picking up a lot of individuals who are undocumented and have not committed any other crimes, and that's been created. That situation got created because of the Trust Act. And I think that the Democrats in this state have decided through the Trust Act and revamping the Trust Act, they want to poke the Trump administration, ICE in the eye, and it's having real effects on hard working people who are here undocumented because of a failed immigration policy.

Mike Hydeck: So the you're saying that Connecticut's Trust Act is responsible for, maybe it's a it's a mother of two who gets swept up in a raid and doesn't have a human trafficking charge against her.

Greg Howard: That's exactly right. And Tom Holman has been clear about this for over a year. He said specifically, before Trump was even elected and before he became the border czar, he said, If states and cities want to act as sanctuary cities and sanctuary states, whether or not they use that term, and they want to prevent ICE agents from going into these state facilities to get these individuals that are the worst of the the worst under controlled environment, then the ICE agents will be forced to do that in the community. And when ICE agents are in the community, and they find individuals who are undocumented, they're going to take them into custody, too, because they're in violation of federal law. And that's the part that I think gets frustrating when you have U.S. Congressmen or U.S. Senators standing at a podium disparaging ICE agents on the street who don't have control over the law, but are simply enforcing laws that exist, and the individuals that make the laws are doing nothing to fix a broken system, but they're putting it on the backs of the ICE agents on the street who are only doing their job.

Face the Facts

Face the Facts with NBC Connecticut goes beyond the headlines, asking newsmakers the tough questions, giving an in-depth analysis of the big stories.

Mike Hydeck: So when mistakes are made, when a mother is pulled up off the street, or somebody who's just here trying to get a job, can that be rectified in the long run, and does local law enforcement have a role there and say, ""Look, this is somebody that's been in our community for 20 years. We know they've been a baseball coach, and yes, they're here illegally, but they're not human trafficking."" Like, can local people help in those situations?

Greg Howard: I don't think the local police have any role in that. I think that that's a question for our immigration police. And let's be clear, for two decades, both parties in Congress have failed to address a broken immigration system. What frustrates me in this whole thing is we have a U.S. senator standing at a podium blaming on the roe ICE agents for enforcing the laws that he controls. ICE agents don't have the authority to decide who they're going to enforce immigration law on and who they are not. And if that discretion exists, it exists well above their heads. And for a 14-year U.S. senator to go out there and disparage those agents like that really puts their lives at risk. Because, just like we have far right, crazy criminals that threaten Representative Paris or damaged the Capitol and hurt people on January 6, the left have their own far left, dangerous people that would take that rhetoric and use it to assault ICE agents doing their job. He's really putting their lives in danger. And this whole Trust Act is having an adverse effect on, as you say, individuals who are in this country, maybe undocumented, maybe they overstay their visa because our system is broken and they're getting swept up because they are technically in violation of federal law, but we're forcing ICE agents into their communities because the Trust Act will not allow them to come into places like corrections facilities and take people into custody who have violated these laws.

Mike Hydeck: So moving forward, that looks like we should kind of go back and say, ""Look, how do we fix this broken system? What do we do there?""

Greg Howard: That's step one. The United States Congress has again, Senator Blumenthal has been a senator for 14 years, half of that time he's been the majority party in the Senate. But it's not just on his back and the Democrats. Republicans have had equal opportunity as well. We've had Republican presidents. We've had Republican Congressmen. They have not fixed it. That system needs to be fixed. America should be and will always be, a place where individuals who are non-criminals, who don't come here to hurt, people who don't come here to steal, who come here to want a better life, to work hard.

Mike Hydeck: And right now, you could wait a decade for a visa.

Greg Howard: And that is the problem. The system needs to be fixed, but it should never include an opportunity for people who have violated laws to the jump the line. President Obama said this himself many years ago. We need to fix our system, get everybody into the queue, streamline it through. If you're not a convicted felon coming from another country to avoid incarceration in that country, and you're not a dangerous person, by all means, America is a place for everybody, and that's how it should be. It's unfortunate that the Connecticut laws that exist are causing what's happening.",https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/2019/09/ice-police.PNG?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-09-01 02:57:10.534319

The violence on Sunday took place as thousands of people rallied across major cities in Australia, including Sydney, Perth, Canberra and Brisbane, to demand an end to what they called “mass immigration”.

The Australian government has condemned the rallies, which took place under the banner of “March for Australia”, as racist, while Minister of Multicultural Affairs Anne Aly said the gatherings were “organised by Nazis”.

About 5,000 protesters, some draped in the Australian flag, and counter-protesters turned up in Melbourne, the SBS Network reported, citing the police.

The network said violent clashes between the two groups erupted “multiple times”, prompting the police to deploy the riot squad who used pepper spray and baton rounds to keep the groups apart.

At least six people were arrested in the city for charges including assault, according to SBS.

The Australian Associated Press news agency also reported on the violence in Melbourne.

The group behind “March for Australia” said on its website and social media that “mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together” and that its rallies aimed to do “what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration”.

Critics denounced the claim, expressing concern over a rise in right-wing extremism in Australia, where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas.

“Let’s not be coy about this. They weren’t protesting immigration from white Western countries,” said Aly, the multicultural affairs minister.

“I would say to those who marched, and who argued that they have those legitimate concerns, that they were organised by Nazis, the very purpose of them was anti-immigration,” Aly told ABC News.

There was no official comment from “March for Australia” about the Nazi allegations.

The speakers at the rally in Melbourne included prominent Australian neo-Nazi Thomas Sewell, The Age newspaper reported. He was among a group of men wearing black who later attacked an Indigenous protest camp in Melbourne, called Camp Sovereignty, the ABC reported.

Organisers of Camp Sovereignty said in a statement that four people were injured, including a woman who was taken to hospital. The organisers also said that police did not arrive until after the men had left and made no arrests.

In Sydney, police estimated that between 5,000 to 8,000 people joined the anti-immigration protest, while the Refugee Action Coalition, a community activist organisation, held a counter-rally.

March for Australia protester Glenn Allchin told the Reuters news agency that he wanted a “slowdown” in immigration.

“It’s about our country bursting at the seams and our government bringing more and more people in,” Allchin said. “Our kids struggling to get homes, our hospitals – we have to wait seven hours – our roads, the lack of roads.”

Counter-protesters in Sydney, meanwhile, held signs pointing out that outside of Indigenous people, the vast majority of Australia’s population are immigrants. “Our event shows the depth of disgust and anger about the far right agenda of March For Australia”, a spokesperson for the Refugee Action Coalition said in a statement.

Far-right Australian Senator Pauline Hanson joined a few hundred people protesting in the capital, Canberra, while Bob Katter, the leader of a small populist party, attended a “March for Australia” rally in Queensland, a party spokesperson said. In the lead-up to the rally, the veteran lawmaker had threatened a reporter for mentioning Katter’s Lebanese heritage at a news conference when the topic of his attendance at a “March for Australia” event was being discussed.

“Don’t say that, because that irritates me, and I punch blokes in the mouth for saying that,” Katter had shouted at the reporter, according to SBS.

Australia’s Greens deputy leader and spokesperson for antiracism, Senator Mehreen Faruqi, said in a statement that “these rallies must be called out for what they are: acts of racist fear mongering and hate”.

Faruqi also criticised the Labor government, saying it “must end its racist dog-whistling on migrants and refugees and its crack down on pro-Palestine protesters and instead focus on the urgent implementation of the National Anti-Racism Framework”.

Australia’s spy agency has previously warned that far-right groups are on the rise in Australia and that they had become more organised and visible.

When asked specifically about plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago, Noem told CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” “We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations.”

About 35 miles north of the city, the Department of Defense has secured Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago for office space and a command center. Earlier this week, multiple sources told NBC News federal agencies will “surge manpower” to Chicago next week to step up immigration enforcement and arrests.

While Noem said agents will focus on violent criminals, residents near the naval base are fearful ICE will detain immigrants who are working toward becoming citizens, and contribute to their community. A group walked to the base on Sunday to pray for peace and mercy.

""""The Juans, Marias and Joses that are walking with us today are not criminals,"" said Pastor Julie Contreras with United Giving Hope. ""They are individuals who have their homes and have worked here and contribute to this great nation.”

In anticipation of increased enforcement efforts, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order, declaring Chicago police will not collaborate with military on police patrols or civil immigration enforcement.

""We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government. It is unclear at this time what that will look like exactly.""

Natural justice is the right to fairness in government decisions, including the right to be told about and given the opportunity to respond to those decisions.","The Anti-Fairness Bill Explained

This blog is designed to provide a plain-language explainer to help community members understand the proposed new laws and what they could mean. It does not constitute legal advice. If you believe these changes may affect you, we strongly encourage you to seek guidance from your legal representative.

What is the Anti-Fairness Bill?

On 26 August 2025, the Government introduced the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (2025 Measures No. 1) Bill 2025 (1) in the lower house of Parliament – the House of Representatives.

The Bill would expand the powers the Government established with their three brutal Bills (2) that were rushed through Parliament in the last sitting week of 2024.

These laws gave the Government new powers to make paid arrangements with other countries to accept people Australia seeks to deport, forcing people to cooperate with their deportation, and to limit people’s rights in immigration detention.

The new Anti-Fairness Bill aims to make those powers stronger by removing people’s right to natural justice (or fair decision making) when the government uses their new powers to make arrangements with other countries to accept people, and to force people to cooperate with their own deportation. It also retrospectively validates some migration decisions that were made before the case of NZYQ.

What would the Anti-Fairness Bill do?

If it passes Parliament, the new Anti-Fairness Bill will mean that:

When making arrangements to deport someone to a third country, the Government doesn’t have to tell the person they are making the arrangement or give them an opportunity to respond – removing their legal protections against government errors.

When giving a person a direction to cooperate with their own deportation, the government doesn’t need to tell them ahead of time or ask them if there are reasons they can’t follow the direction.

Previous visa decisions made under now outdated laws are retrospectively validated, even though those decisions might have been legally challenged after the NZYQ case. Simply put, before NZYQ, most decision makers thought it was likely that the individual would be subject to indefinite detention if their visa was cancelled and made their decision on that basis.. However, as indefinite detention has been deemed unlawful, such people now likely face punitive bridging visas or removal to a third country, such as Nauru, bringing into question whether those decisions were made correctly. The Government can also continue to prosecute criminal charges that were brought as a result of incorrect decisions, validating retrospective criminality.

The Bill is clearly designed to shield the government from accountability, and to legislate its way out of cases that are already in the courts. It prevents people from taking potential legal actions that may have stopped them from being deported.

Why does this matter?

One of the basic legal protections that everyone in Australia has is the right to natural justice. Natural justice is the right to fairness in government decisions, including the right to be told about and given the opportunity to respond to those decisions. The powers involve the making of life-altering decisions that might result in removal to another country forever, serious harm, loss of medical treatment or permanent family separation.

The principle of natural justice is a cornerstone of Australia’s legal system. Removing the right to natural justice sets a dangerous precedent for the way the law treats not just people seeking asylum and refugees, but everyone in this country.

There are constant successful challenges to many migration decisions where natural justice has not been afforded to the visa applicant or holder in Australia’s current system and serves as a source of protection for many, which is another reason this is so concerning.

Who will this affect?

The Government is saying that this will only affect a very small number of people with criminal histories who they are planning to deport to a third country, like Nauru (known as the ‘NZYQ cohort’). However, that is not true. The Bill strips the right to natural justice in the use of the powers that were established by the brutal Bills that were passed late last year. We know that the power of these laws can be used against a broad range of people, including anyone on a bridging visa E that was granted on departure grounds. The government also has the freedom to designate any type of visa it wants to apply these powers to. We know from a Senate inquiry hearing into those Bills that they could affect over 80,000 people (3), and because this new Anti-Fairness Bill relates to those powers, it is reasonable to expect it could affect the same number of people.

What happens next?

The Bill has been tabled in the House of Representatives, which is the lower house of Parliament. The government has the numbers to pass it there, after which it will go to the Senate – the upper house of Parliament – for debate. To have enough votes for the Bill to pass the Senate, the government would need the support of the Coalition. It is not clear when the Government will seek to pass the Bill, but it is likely to be next week.

The bill doesn’t just remove procedural fairness.","This opinion piece by Human Rights Commissioner Lorraine Finlay appeared in The Canberra Times on 1 September 2025

Australia has every right – indeed, a responsibility – to manage its borders and make decisions about who can stay in the country.

That includes removing non-citizens who have gone through all the proper legal processes and no longer have a right to remain.

But how we do this matters, because even when someone has reached the end of the road legally, they’re still a person. And every person deserves to be treated fairly.

The Government’s newly announced $400 million agreement with Nauru – which will facilitate the deportation of potentially hundreds of detainees from the NZYQ cohort – brings these concerns into sharp focus. While the Government claims this agreement contains undertakings to ensure proper treatment, no specific details have been provided and proposed amendments to the Migration Act introduced into Parliament earlier this week are specifically designed to remove existing safeguards.

The Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (2025 Measures No. 1) Bill specifically excludes procedural fairness from applying when the Government is exercising specific powers to remove non-citizens (including refugees) to a third country.

Supporters of the amendments argue that these individuals have already had their day in court – that they’ve been through visa processes, appeals, and judicial review.

And this may be true in most cases. But procedural fairness isn’t just about ticking legal boxes. It’s about making sure that decisions are made carefully, transparently, and with respect for the individual. It’s a safeguard against error, and a check on power.

Without it, we risk getting things wrong. And when deportation is involved, getting it wrong can have devastating consequences.

Stripping away these safeguards means turning a blind eye to the real human cost, where lives, health, and families hang in the balance.

One of the biggest concerns here is chain refoulement: where someone is sent to a third country that then sends them on to a place where they could face serious harm.

Australia has international obligations that require the Government to prevent this. If passed, these amendments will make it harder to meet those obligations.

The Australian Government must be able to remove non-citizens who have gone through all the proper legal channels and no longer have a right to stay. That’s not in dispute.

However, these amendments are expressly designed to strip away one of the most basic protections we have in a fair society: the right to be heard.

Under these amendments, the government could deport someone to a third country – one that has agreed to accept them – without giving that person a meaningful opportunity to respond to that decision.

Stripping away procedural fairness with respect to this specific decision means there’s no chance to correct factual errors or share new information that could be critical to ensuring the decision is fair and safe.

Fairness isn’t something that can be selectively applied – it’s a principle that should guide every stage of decision-making, especially when the consequences involve a person’s safety and future.

The bill doesn’t just remove procedural fairness. It also includes measures that operate to retrospectively validate relevant visa decisions and any consequence flowing from them, which may give rise to retrospective criminal liability. This raises rule of law concerns, and needs to be given rigorous scrutiny.

Further, while these amendments are said to be ‘primarily directed to noncitizens who have exhausted all legitimate avenues to remain in Australia’, they appear to have a broader reach.

The Human Rights Law Centre has already confirmed that ‘two of the three people initially targeted by the Government for deportation to Nauru had not yet completed all appeal options relating to their visas’.

These proposed amendments also need to be seen in their broader context as they continue a worrying trend.

Over the past 18 months, we’ve seen a series of rushed, reactive laws in response to court decisions, like the High Court’s ruling in the NZYQ case, which found indefinite immigration detention unlawful.

Instead of using that moment to rethink and improve our migration system, we’ve seen a patchwork of attempted quick fixes: ankle bracelets, curfews, re-detention powers and now this.

Put together, these measures paint a picture of a system being built on the run.

Immigration and asylum policies need to be carefully thought through as there are lots of important factors to balance

These include: maintaining the integrity of Australia’s migration system; the need to protect people fleeing danger and ensure their human rights are respected; and protecting the human rights of the broader Australian community.

These are complex issues that require careful consideration – not quick fixes or rushed decisions.

We can do better. We can protect the integrity of our migration system without abandoning the values that underpin it. That means making sure decisions are fair, that people are treated with dignity, and that we don’t sacrifice human rights for the sake of convenience.

Australia has the tools to manage migration responsibly. What we need is the will to use them wisely, and to remember that even in the toughest cases, fairness should never be optional.",https://humanrights.gov.au/sites/default/files/opinionpiece/migration%20oped%20image.png,N,,2025-08-31 22:56:17.362159

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago… but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said during an appearance CBS News’ ”Face the Nation.”

Noem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Trump lashed out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago’s crime problems quickly “or we’re coming.” The Republican president has also been critical of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

Johnson and Pritzker have pushed back against the expected federal mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.

Johnson has already signed an order barring the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal government immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and the state at odds with Trump’s administration as it tries to carry out his mass deportation agenda.

Pritzker in an interview aired Sunday on “Face the Nation” charged that Trump’s expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.”

Noem said it was a Trump “prerogative” whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of immigration protests in the California city.

“I do know that LA wouldn’t be standing today if President Trump hadn’t taken action,” Noem said. “That city would have burned if left to devices of the mayor and governor of that state.”",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-08-01T041751Z_1084224806_RC2XXFAUL2WB_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-MIGRATION-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 20:56:32.296300

(WGN) — With signs in hand and chants echoing through the streets, immigrant rights groups and supporters rallied Sunday to shut down the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, which they claim functions in the shadows of injustice.

The facility has traditionally been used to process detainees before transfer, with most held for no more than a day.

However, protestors say this practice has changed under President Donald Trump, with people now being held for extended periods in inhumane conditions.

They are urging the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office and the Illinois Attorney General to investigate these allegations.

“People are going without beds, with cold food, no showers for three days on average and that’s completely unacceptable,” Omar Flores, the Immigrants’ Rights Working Committee chair, said.

The protest comes amid escalating fears following Trump’s recent threats to deploy federal forces to Chicago for immigration enforcement.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the Trump administration will soon expand immigration operations in Chicago, confirming plans for a stepped-up presence of federal agents in the city.

Last week, the DHS requested limited logistical support from officials at Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency’s anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.

Immigrant communities and advocates see the move as an intensification of tactics they call aggressive and unjust.

“They might be coming for people who have misdemeanors from 15 years ago now, but they will come after you next,” Louise Carhart, an immigration attorney, said.

Over in the Northshore, families traded protest signs for rosaries and crosses as they marched from Waukegan to the navy base, taking a peaceful stand against the militarization of immigration enforcement.

They say they are demanding an end to policies driven by fear, not compassion.

“It’s just a waste of taxpayer dollars, time, just everything. It’s just unlawful. You should not be taking the National Guard or our military against its own people,” Gigi Javack said.

On Saturday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order aimed at preventing the Chicago Police Department from being federalized for immigration enforcement purposes.

Advocates say that while the future may feel uncertain and frightening, they remain confident in Illinois as they believe the state has some of the strongest immigrant protection laws in the country.

Any military presence ultimately would be President Donald Trump’s call, Noem said, but Gov. JB Pritzker reiterated that such a move would be against federal law and warned it would be met in court “pretty quickly” by the state.

“I’m saying we don’t want troops on the streets of American cities,” Pritzker said. “That’s un-American and, frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better. This one doesn’t seem to. He doesn’t seem to understand the Constitution or the laws.”

Noem and Pritzker each appeared on CBS News’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, though in separate interviews. Their appearance came as Chicago prepared for more intensive ICE enforcement, which could begin as soon as Friday, with agents based at Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois, and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said.

Asked if a surge in ICE operations was planned for other cities, she said she would not discuss specifics but said the efforts were not aimed at Democrat-led urban areas and could include cities in Republican states.

“There’s a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now and so we haven’t taken anything off the table. We’ve been making sure that we have the resources and the equipment to go in,” Noem said.

“I’d encourage every single big city, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are, if they want to help make their cities safer … they should call us,” she said, citing declines in violent crime after Trump federalized law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and deployed National Guard troops.

“Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we’ve got operations that, again, I won’t talk about details on. But we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we’re doing with a political lens,” she said.

Noem, a former South Dakota governor, belittled Pritzker for not personally calling Trump and seeking federal intervention to address Chicago crime.

“This seems like it’s more about Gov. Pritzker’s ego now, rather than actually protecting his people. If he had one murder in Chicago, he should be calling President Trump and saying, ‘What’s your ideas? What can we do?’” she said.

“So he can talk about what a great job he’s doing as governor but he’s failing those families who will no longer have their child with them, their mother or their father or their cousin, aunt and uncle that are gone forever because of the violence that’s happening in Chicago,” she said.

Pritzker, in an unaired portion of his Friday interview with CBS White House correspondent Ed O’Keefe, said he has not called the Trump administration to tell them not to come to Chicago because “I think I’ve been pretty clear publicly” and that if the president wants to send in the Guard, “he should call.”

“Honestly, we’d be happy to receive a call,” the two-term Democratic governor said. “When we have an emergency and we need the federal government to send troops in, believe me, I will pick up the phone and call. That is not something going on in Chicago today.”

But Pritzker said the ICE surge is “inflaming passions and causing disruption that doesn’t need to be caused.”

“We have people that have lived in the state of Illinois and the city of Chicago for decades, working here, paying taxes. They’re law-abiding members of our communities, friends, neighbors, and why are we arresting them? Why are we making them disappear?” Pritzker asked, saying he would tell Noem “to maybe check herself for, what does she really believe.”

Discussing the issue of mid-decade redistricting, which Trump has pushed in Texas and other GOP-led states, Pritzker said “it is possible to have more Democratic districts in the state of Illinois and we could do it.”

Texas Republicans have signed into law redrawn congressional boundaries aimed at flipping five Democratic seats in the U.S. House for the 2026 midterm elections, as part of Trump’s effort to maintain a GOP House majority through the end of the decade. Democratic-led California recently responded to Texas’ move as Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking voters to approve a map aimed at giving his party five more U.S. House seats, but late last week, Missouri Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe said he is calling lawmakers into a special session to redraw that state’s House districts.

When asked whether Illinois would join in the redistricting fight, Pritzker said, “That’s not something that I want to do. It’s not something any of us want to do,” he said of Democratic-led states. “If he’s going to do that all over the country, I think all of us have to think about what it is that we can do to counter that.”

Illinois’ Democratic-led redistricting map approved after the 2020 federal census was politically gerrymandered to create a 14-3 Democratic majority in the 17-member House delegation. The Illinois map earned a grade of “F” from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project.

Pritzker, who is seeking a third term next year, did little to dispel his interest in a potential 2028 run for the Democratic presidential nomination, saying, “I don’t know what the future holds.”

“You know, I look around, we’ve got a bench among the Democratic Party that is really terrific. I could point to governors. I could point to senators. I think there are a lot of good choices,” he said, according to a transcript of an unaired portion of the interview. “We’ve got a terrific group of people who could be president of the United States on the Democratic side and I’m happy to stand with them as we stand against Donald Trump.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/CTC-L-Noem-press-conference-1_232338232.jpg?w=1024&h=711,N,,2025-08-31 20:56:47.291346

Taking their Sunday services from Waukegan's United Giving Hope sanctuary on the road on Sunday morning, a small group of parishioners, including young children, embarked on the 6- mile walk to North Chicago's Naval Station Great Lakes, where federal agents are expected to set up shop as soon as next week in anticipation of large-scale immigration enforcement operations.

""These detentions, these operatives, these raids have an impact on human beings,"" said United Giving Hope Pastor Julie Contreras.

While sources tell ABC News that operations could start as soon as Friday, on Face the Nation on Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem refused to go into specifics.

""I won't disclose the details because they are law enforcement and investigative folks that are on the ground there, and I want to make sure we keep their security our number one priority,"" said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

While on the same show, Pritzker spoke about a potential National Guard deployment to accompany federal immigration officials.

Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers — perhaps 50 — toward the plane in a part of the airport that's restricted to government planes, including deportation flights. The passengers were wearing colored clothing that is used in government-run shelters for migrant children.

The U.S. government insists it's reuniting the Guatemalan children with parents or guardians who sought their return. Lawyers for at least some of the minors say that's nonsense and argue that in any event, authorities still would have to follow a legal process that they did not.

While Sunday's court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in Washington, similar emergency requests were filed in other parts of the country as well. Attorneys in Arizona and Illinois asked federal judges there to block deportations of unaccompanied minors, underscoring how the fight over the government’s efforts has quickly spread.

Alarm bells raised among immigrant advocates

The episode has raised alarms among immigrant advocates, who say it may represent a violation of federal laws designed to protect children who arrive without their parents.

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that an official list had been drafted with the names of Guatemalan children whom the U.S. administration would attempt to send back to their home country. Advocates learned that the flights would leave from the Texas cities of Harlingen and El Paso, Aber said.

She said she'd heard that federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials “were still taking the children,” having not gotten any guidance about the court order.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.

Trump administration plans to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children

The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. unaccompanied, The Guatemalan government has said it is ready to take them in.

Lawyers for the Guatemalan children said the U.S. government doesn't have the authority to remove the youngsters and is depriving them of due process by preventing them from pursuing asylum claims or immigration relief. Many have active cases in immigration courts, according to the attorneys' court filing in Washington.

Although the children are supposed to be in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government is “illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture,” argues the filing by attorneys with the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights and the National Immigration Law Center.

An attorney with another advocacy group, the National Center for Youth Law, said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children — particularly from Guatemala — in Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities. HSI is ICE's investigative arm.

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin.

Then, on Friday, advocates across the country began getting word that their young clients' immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said.

Migrant children traveling without their parents or guardians are handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement when they are encountered by officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. Once in the U.S., the children often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a family member — living in the country.

The minors can request asylum, juvenile immigration status or visas for victims of sexual exploitation.

Due to their age and often traumatic experiences getting to the U.S., their treatment is one of the most sensitive issues in immigration. Advocacy groups already have sued to ask courts to halt new Trump administration saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.

Guatemala says it is willing to receive the unaccompanied minors

Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said Friday that the government has told the U.S. it is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. unaccompanied and are being held in government facilities.

Guatemala is particularly concerned about minors who could pass age limits for the children's facilities and be sent to adult detention centers, he said.

President Bernardo Arévalo has said that his government has a moral and legal obligation to advocate for the children. His comments came days after

In an appearance on CBS News' Face the Nation, Noem said Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be expanding operations in Chicago to ""go after the worst of the worst in the country, like President [Donald] Trump has told us to do.""

She said the agency would be ""focusing on those that are perpetuating murder and rape and trafficking of drugs and humans across our country, knowing that every single citizen deserves to be safe.""

Noem's comments come after weeks of Trump leveraging federal resources -- namely the National Guard -- to target crime in cities he deems unsafe. He deployed troops to Washington, D.C., in August to crack down on crime, which he described as ""out of control.""

Speaking Aug. 11 about the deployment, Trump called out other cities with high crime, including Chicago, Baltimore, Oakland, Calif., and New York City. He followed that up Saturday with a Truth Social post calling Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker ""weak and pathetic,"" saying he should straighten out crime or ""we're coming.""

In response to Trump's threats to send National Guard troops to Chicago, Mayor Brandon Johnson on Saturday signed an executive order seeking to avoid militarization in the city. The order demands that Trump end ""his threats to deploy the National Guard"" to Chicago.

""I do not take this executive action lightly,"" Johnson said during a signing ceremony. ""I would've preferred to work more collaboratively to pass legislation ... but unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of time. We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some kind of militarized activity by the federal government.""

In an appearance on Face the Nation, Pritzker said no one in the Trump administration has reach out to him or any other officials in Chicago about a possible deployment of National Guard troops to the city, which he described as ""an invasion."" He said federal agencies should coordinate with local law enforcement.

""But they don't want to do that either, and I must say, it's disruptive, it's dangerous,"" Pritzker said. ""It tends to inflame passions on the ground when they don't let us know what their plans are, and when we can't coordinate with them.""

He said if Trump does send National Guard troops to Chicago, he'll take it to the courts.

Noem’s comments came a day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson struck back against what he called the “out-of-control” plan to surge federal officers into the city. The Chicago Police Department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to an executive order Johnson signed Saturday.

The Homeland Security Department last week requested limited logistical support from officials at the Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency’s anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago ... but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said during a Sunday appearance CBS News’ ”Face the Nation.”

Noem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, saying they were needed to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Trump lashed out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago’s crime problems quickly “or we’re coming.” The Republican president has also been critical of Johnson.

Johnson and Pritzker, both Democrats, have denounced the expected federal mobilization, noting that crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.

In his order signed Saturday, Johnson directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.”

Asked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably “taking orders,” Johnson replied: “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”

Johnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal immigration officers have done since Trump launched his crackdown.

The federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Friday and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.

Pritzker, in an interview aired Sunday on “Face the Nation,” said that Trump’s expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.”

Noem said it was a Trump “prerogative” whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of protests there against immigration raids.

“I do know that L.A. wouldn’t be standing today if President Trump hadn’t taken action,” Noem said. “That city would have burned if left to devices of the mayor and governor of that state.”

Unlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, the Chicago operation is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration, rather than being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime, Trump administration officials have said.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda.

Johnson’s order builds on the city’s longtime stance, that neither Chicago nor Illinois officials have sought or been consulted on the federal presence and they stand against Trump’s mobilization plan.

During his news conference Saturday, Johnson accused the president of “behaving outside the bounds of the Constitution” and seeking a federal presence in Democratic cities as retribution against his political rivals.

“He is reckless and out of control,” Johnson said. “He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country.”

In response, the White House contended that the potential flood of federal agents was about “cracking down on crime.”

“If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in an email Saturday.

Noem said today that a National Guard presence is a “prerogative of President Trump” and praised his decision to send troops to LA earlier this year.","Earlier today, we covered President Donald Trump’s comments indicating he’ll pursue federal voter ID laws and restrictions on mail-in voting.

The president has a long history of falsely claiming mail-in ballots are fraudulent — despite many Republicans using the method to vote for Trump in the 2024 election.

These are some of his latest comments on the matter:

• Trump falsely claimed on Truth Social that the United States “is now the only country in the world” that uses mail-in voting, which CNN fact-checked. Several countries use mail-in ballots, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Switzerland.

• Later that day in the Oval Office, Trump claimed you could never have a “real democracy” with mail-in ballots, which he called “corrupt,” while acknowledging his claim about being the only country to use them could be wrong.

• Trump has previously called mail-in voting a “disaster” and the “greatest scam in the history of politics.”

But, during the campaign: Trump’s team publicly embraced mail-in ballots, at least to the degree it felt it had to.

Vice President JD Vance gave voice to that on the campaign trail in October of last year, urging Republicans to play the same “game” as Democrats.

“If you can vote early, vote early. If you get your friends to vote, early vote, early vote by mail, do everything that we can,” Vance said. “I don’t love election season. I like Election Day, but as Donald Trump has said, it is what it is, and so we’ve got to use every tool at our disposal to get out there and vote.”

President Donald Trump is paying attention to what his supporters are up to online, sharing several posts this weekend, including apparent AI-generated images depicting him as law enforcement, including an image of him as a SWAT team officer.

The images were originally posted on August 21, the same day Trump said in a radio interview he would be doing a ride-along with law enforcement in Washington, DC, amid his federal takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department. The president appeared to scrap those plans that afternoon, instead speaking at a US Park Police facility in Southeast DC and handing out pizza and burgers to law enforcement across several agencies.

Trump also reposted an apparent AI TikTok video showing him morphing from a baby to present day, showing various stages of his life in between.

Trump added in a follow-up post, “THIS IS RATHER INCREDIBLE. WHO DID IT??? PRESIDENT DJT.”

In another image Trump shared, the globe is behind him with both his hands raised and a cryptic message in the background: “The world will soon understand nothing can stop what is coming.”

“Q+” is written above his left hand, which some QAnon conspiracy theorists believe is an alias for Trump posts.

While some of the posts are more complex and appear AI-generated, Trump also reposted a good old-fashioned meme of himself smirking with the words: “I DRIVE STUPID PEOPLE COMPLETELY INSANE.”

Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan received a call around 2:30 a.m. ET notifying her that a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children in US custody were being processed for deportation.

Sooknanan, who has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting the kids at the urging of attorneys and advocates, appeared at an emergency hearing hours later.

At the hearing, Sooknanan reiterated the order she made this morning, saying the US government is not to remove any of the individual plaintiffs or other unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in US custody — who she ruled were also protected under the order — for two weeks.

During the hearing, Sooknanan asked the Department of Justice’s lawyer to clarify the children’s whereabouts. Some of the kids had already been placed on planes after being roused at their shelters in the middle of the night, but they are expected to be returned to US custody, according to the DOJ.

At least one plane in Texas carrying Guatemalan children was turned around, according to Neha Desai, managing director of Children’s Human Rights & Dignity at the National Center for Youth Law.

A federal judge has temporarily blocked the US government from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in federal custody, after attorneys and advocacy groups raised urgent concerns.

The Trump administration was expected to begin sending the kids back to their home country today, according to a notice sent to attorneys, prompting a scramble by lawyers.

Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the removal of 10 named plaintiffs — Guatemalan minors ranging in age from 10 to 17 — as well as all Guatemalan unaccompanied minors in federal custody as of early Sunday. The order lasts for 14 days.

What happened overnight: Attorneys say the children were “terrified and confused” after being woken up at their shelters in the middle of the night as the government set its repatriation plans in motion.

The US Office of Refugee Resettlement had notified the shelter providers that certain children had been identified for reunification with parents or legal guardians in Guatemala and had to be ready for discharge within hours, with documentation, medication, belongings and prepared meals.

The plaintiffs’ attorneys argue the Trump administration is violating US law, which provides special protections for unaccompanied minors and ensures they cannot be removed without due process or the opportunity to seek relief from deportation. Advocates say the kids could be at risk if they’re returned to the Central American country.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker says he has had no communication with the Trump administration about reported plans to send National Guard troops to Chicago.

Pritzker called such a move an “invasion” and framed the potential deployment as part of a broader authoritarian push by President Donald Trump.

Pritzker said the administration “ought to be coordinating with local law enforcement. They ought to let us know when they’re coming, where they’re coming — if it’s ICE, or if it’s ATF, or whoever it is.”

Pritzker warned that if the Trump administration were to deploy ICE and the Guard to Chicago, his administration would take swift legal action.

What the White House is saying: In response to a CNN request for comment, spokesperson Abigail Jackson accused Pritzker of trying to “deflect from the terrible crime crisis” in Chicago, saying the city would be safer if Pritzker focused on his job.

CNN’s Kit Maher, Priscilla Alvarez, Alayna Treene, Hannah Rabinowitz and Haley Britzky contributed to this report.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore dismissed the idea of deploying National Guard troops in Maryland, saying that while he would love greater federal support for fighting crime in the state, the Guard is ill-equipped to do so.

President Donald Trump has deployed the National Guard in both Los Angeles and Washington, DC, despite resistance from local Democrats, and he’s telegraphed plans to do the same in cities across the country, including Baltimore. Trump and Moore have sparred verbally over the issue in recent weeks.

When host Martha Raddatz pushed back, saying the Guard is trained in law enforcement, especially for major disasters, Moore said the troops are specifically not trained for municipal policing, in comparison with agencies like the FBI and ATF.

Moore said he wants federal help in Maryland, but would propose other solutions, if the president asked.

The Trump administration plans to send additional immigration enforcement resources to Chicago this week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said today.

CNN reported last week that a major enforcement operation will soon be underway in the city, and Chicago’s mayor laid out plans to resist the federal crackdown yesterday.

Noem declined to provide additional details, saying she was protecting law enforcement.

What we know about the plans: Preparations are underway to send armored vehicles and surge federal agents to Chicago, with the operation expected to kick off by Friday, multiple sources told CNN last week. Those sources cautioned that plans were still in flux.

The operation is expected to be similar to those held in Los Angeles earlier this summer, involving Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Customs and Border Protection, and potentially other agencies. And like in Los Angeles, the Trump administration is preparing the National Guard to respond to unrest.

Noem said today that a National Guard presence is a “prerogative of President Trump” and praised his decision to send troops to LA earlier this year.

Future targets: Asked about expanding beyond Chicago, Noem said the Trump administration has “not taken anything off the table,” and specifically named San Francisco, Boston and Chicago.

President Donald Trump says he will sign an executive order requiring Americans to show ID at the polls, and reiterated he will take action to curtail mail-in voting.

“Voter I.D. Must Be Part of Every Single Vote. NO EXCEPTIONS! I Will Be Doing An Executive Order To That End!!! Also, No Mail-In Voting, Except For Those That Are Very Ill, And The Far Away Military. USE PAPER BALLOTS ONLY!!!” Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social late last night.

Some background: States have varying requirements for voters, with 36 states already having laws in place requiring or requesting certain forms of ID, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Trump has long championed a baseless lie that the results of the 2020 election were tainted by widespread fraud.

Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota warned this morning that the Trump administration’s cuts to mass shooting prevention programs could hinder efforts to deter future violence.

Omar’s comments come days after two children were killed and more than a dozen others were wounded in a mass shooting at a Catholic school in her district.

The Trump administration cut funding in Minnesota for efforts to identify potential mass shooters and head off violence a month before the school shooting in Minneapolis.

Omar accused the Trump administration of wanting to “deflect from the reality” of mass shootings and of neglecting “actual solutions,” like an assault weapons ban and more mental health care.

What the Trump administration is saying: A DHS spokesperson defended the cuts, claiming the grant program was “nothing more than a slush fund for left-wing ideologies, and did next to nothing to combat actual threats in our communities.”

On CNN’s “State of the Union” this morning, White House counterterrorism official Sebastian Gorka also defended the administration’s approach, blaming local authorities in part for establishing so-called gun-free zones, which he said make a soft target for mass shooters. Pressed on the cut funding, Gorka said he doesn’t believe federal funding is the “answer for mental health issues.”

“I would look to the town, to the city, to the county or to the state because they know the threats in their communities better. Don’t wag your finger at DHS,” Gorka said.

Top Republican weighs in: The US needs to address the “root cause” of mass shootings, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said today in an interview on ABC’s “This Week.”

But Emmer brushed off questions about why he did not vote for the bipartisan federal gun safety bill that Congress passed in the wake of the Uvalde school shooting, saying it could not help identify the Minneapolis shooter as a danger.

This post has been updated with Gorka’s remarks.

An appeals court ruling that said President Donald Trump unlawfully leaned on emergency powers to impose many of his sweeping tariffs was only a “hiccup,” US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told Fox News today.

Though Friday’s ruling stuck down many of the historic tariffs, the import taxes will remain in effect until October 14, giving the Trump administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.

Greer said trade negotiations are continuing despite the court ruling. He added that US trading partners “know that tariffs are now part of the landscape” and noted that the ruling did not strike down section-specific tariffs, such as those on steel and aluminum.

But if the ruling is upheld, Greer claimed it would be “disastrous,” citing the US trade deficit.

“All these countries know that we have to rebalance … that’s why people are moving forward with their deals, regardless of what this court may say,” he said.

The Trump administration’s removal of Guatemalan children in US government custody is expected to begin today, according to a notice sent to attorneys.

The notice prompted a scramble among lawyers who say kids were woken up in the middle of the night and are at risk if they are returned to their home country.

CNN first reported that the Trump administration was moving to repatriate hundreds of Guatemalan children who arrived to the US unaccompanied, in coordination with the Guatemalan government.

A federal judge temporarily blocked the removals of unaccompanied Guatemalan minors in US custody early Sunday, though plans appeared to still be underway, according to an immigration attorney representing Guatemalan children who were transported out of their shelter after the judge’s ruling.

Who’s being targeted? The children, ranging in age, are believed to not have a parent in the US, though they may have a relative, and have a parent or legal guardian in Guatemala. The criteria also includes children who do not have a pending asylum case and won’t be trafficked upon their return, according to the notice.

But attorneys who represent some of the kids say those who have been identified are at risk if returned to Guatemala and are in ongoing immigration proceedings.

CNN reached out to the White House, as well as the departments of Health and Human Services and Homeland Security for comment.

President Donald Trump has cast some doubt on the likelihood of a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he expressed confidence that a trilateral meeting — in other words, a sitdown between all three men — would happen.

How we got here: Following a summit with Putin in Alaska and hosting Zelensky and European leaders at the White House earlier this month, Trump said he began arranging a bilateral between Putin and Zelensky as the next step toward reaching peace.

But Putin has not signaled he is willing to come to the table with Zelensky. Just days ago, Russia launched its second-largest air assault of the war on Ukraine, killing at least 25 people and damaging buildings belonging to the European Council and British Council, as well as several residential high-rises.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2231525759-20250829170443340.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-31 18:57:33.909737

She will return to Honduras — the country she left at age 8 — where she will live with her maternal grandparents and start over from scratch.","Allison Bustillo Chinchilla, a young nurse from Charlotte currently held at an immigration detention center in Georgia, has been granted relief by an immigration judge that allows her to leave the country voluntarily instead of being deported — a decision that will enable her to return to the United States without facing a 10-year reentry ban.

Allison, 20, has been detained for six months at the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. She had nearly given up her legal fight due to health issues and unsanitary conditions at the facility. Then, unexpectedly, she was informed on Tuesday, Aug. 26, that she would have a hearing that same day.

She was arrested on the morning of Feb. 20 at her home in Charlotte while caring for her three younger siblings — the youngest of whom has autism — while her mother was at work.

The chaotic arrest was carried out by ICE agents who forcibly entered the apartment heavily armed, looking for someone else.

Judge grants Allison’s request

Keily Chinchilla, her mother, watched the hearing on her phone via the Webex platform. She said it lasted about an hour.

“They moved up her hearing with almost no notice. She was desperate and couldn’t take it anymore. The government attorney said she would be removed from the country, but she asked the judge for voluntary departure — the least they could do for her,” Keily told Enlace Latino NC.

Allison said that “ICE shattered her dreams of continuing her education.” The young woman had graduated as a nursing assistant and had earned a $60,000 scholarship to attend Gardner-Webb University.

She will be able to return without punishment

Her case was handled by attorney Marty Rosenbluth, who had filed an asylum application as a last resort to prevent her deportation.

“Allison wanted to leave the country in a way that would allow her to come back because her mother is in the process of applying for a green card. Once her mother gets it, she’ll be able to apply for Allison’s return,” Rosembluth told Enlace Latino NC.

The attorney explained that Allison was technically not eligible for voluntary departure because she was classified as an undocumented immigrant. However, the relief granted by the judge is effectively the same: she can leave on a commercial flight without a removal order and won’t face the 10-year bar from reentering the country.

Lingering frustration

Still, Keily is not entirely satisfied with her daughter’s decision, as she didn’t want her to have to leave the country.

“My daughter could have been released, because the arrest was illegal — they forced their way into my home looking for someone else,” she said.

The Archbishop of York has urged Britain to resist what he called “kneejerk” proposals to deport hundreds of thousands of migrants, warning they would fail to provide a long-term solution to irregular migration.

Speaking to Sky News, Stephen Cottrell, who is currently acting as the spiritual head of the Church of England until a new Archbishop of Canterbury is appointed, criticized the far-right party’s proposal to remove around 600,000 people from the country.

The policy, unveiled by Reform leader Nigel Farage earlier this week, would involve negotiating deportation agreements with regimes such as the Taliban in Afghanistan and the authorities in Iran.

Cottrell said that he has “every sympathy” with people who are concerned about asylum seekers coming to the country illegally. But he argued that the measures would not “solve the problem.”

Asked by presenter Trevor Phillips to respond to those calling for an automatic policy of detention and deportation for anyone entering the UK unlawfully, Cottrell replied: “You haven’t solved the problem. You’ve just put it somewhere else and you’ve done nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country. And so if you think that’s the answer, you will discover in due course that all you have done is made the problem worse.”

He continued: “Don’t misunderstand me, I have every sympathy with those who find this difficult, every sympathy – as I do with those living in poverty. But… we should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short term kneejerk ‘send them home’.”

Reform’s hardline immigration proposals have become one of the central issues in the UK’s political debate, but they have drawn strong criticism from church leaders, human rights groups and opposition parties.

The ruling vacated District Judge Robert C. Naftz’s previous 2023 decision, in which he dismissed the case in favor of the city.

The Idaho Supreme Court decided that the case would be allowed a new review of the Rupp family’s claims that city officials and private business partners conspired to block their access to land and cheaper water prices.

RELATED | Local family files $21 million lawsuit against the city of Pocatello, others

According to the new ruling, the Supreme Court found that Naftz had failed to analyze the city of Pocatello’s motions and did not allow the family an opportunity to argue against multiple motions.

“The Court concluded that the district court failed to analyze Respondents’ motions for summary judgment, did not permit the Trusts the opportunity to argue in opposition to the summary judgment motions,” according to the ruling.

The Supreme Court also stated that Naftz’s failure to effectively analyze the evidence in the case could have been used to punish Nathan Olsen, the family’s attorney, for filing late.

“The district court never held a hearing on the merits of the motion for summary judgment,” states the Supreme Court. “Instead, at the scheduled hearing on the motions, the district court did not allow argument on the motions for summary judgment because it believed further proceedings on the summary judgment motions were contingent on its decision regarding the second motion to continue and the motions to strike.”

The court then reversed the dismissal, vacated the attorney fee award to defendants, and sent the case back to the district court.

“For these reasons, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment, vacate its judgment dismissing the amended complaint, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion,” writes the Supreme Court.

The lawsuit allegations

The newly reinstated lawsuit mainly alleges conspiracy by the city, Pocatello Mayor Brian Blad, real estate developers Ken Pape and Arvil Swaney, and their companies, Portneuf Development LLC and Millennial Development Partners LLC.

The Rupp Family Trust (also known as Trusts in court documents) manages a 930-acre parcel of agricultural land east of the Northgate Interchange off Interstate 15, primarily part of Bannock County, that the family has owned for nearly 100 years.

In 2017, the trust entered into a purchase and sales agreement with Millennial Development Partners LLC to sell a 150-foot-wide strip of land to construct the Northgate Parkway, which would connect the Northgate Interchange with Olympus Drive in Pocatello.

According to the lawsuit, the trust says that the agreement required Millennial to construct an intersection on Northgate Parkway to provide vehicle access to the trust’s property, water, sewer stubs, and sewer line.

Millennial also promised the trust that its property would have additional access points along the Northgate Parkway, including access to an intersection at Olympus Drive, according to the lawsuit.

Millennial and Portneuf Development LLC then reportedly entered into a partnership called Town Center to construct Northgate Parkway.

Millennial also entered into a construction cooperative agreement with the city of Pocatello and others to determine the design and construction of the Northgate Exchange and Northgate Parkway.

The agreement reportedly stated that when construction of Northgate Parkway was complete, the city would accept full control and jurisdiction over Northgate Parkway between the Northgate Exchange and Olympus Drive.

According to the trust, Town Center entered into a partnership with the city, called “the Northgate Partnership.”

The lawsuit says this partnership needed the water rights associated with the trust’s property to develop its property, and had “a unified purpose of devaluing the Rupp Trust property” so it could buy it for less than market value, and sell it to other developers for a profit, according to the lawsuit.

In December 2018, the trust signed an agreement with the city of Chubbuck to annex 300 acres of its property into Chubbuck after learning that Chubbuck could offer access to water at a lower price than Pocatello.

The trust says that following this annexation, the Northgate Partnership “executed their plan to achieve their respective aims.” The trust alleges that Millennial never constructed the promised access points and infrastructure, effectively land-locking the property.

The trust says the Northgate Partnership “interfered with their ability to access their property from Northgate Parkway, engaged in efforts to steer prospective purchasers away from the Trust’s property, and interfered with prospective purchase agreements and offers to purchase the property.”

In November 2019, after construction of Northgate Parkway was complete, Town Center reportedly filed an application with the city of Pocatello concerning the road.

The 97-page lawsuit states that Northgate Parkway was constructed as a boulevard-style road with 10-foot-wide strips on both sides. The application aimed to give the city ownership of the roadway, but did not address the 10-foot-wide strips on either side.

When the City Council considered the application in January 2020, Harold Lavelle Rupp Jr., the trust’s trustee, appeared at the meeting and reportedly indicated that he was “neutral.”

The city approved the application and accepted the dedication of Northgate Parkway. Town Center later conveyed the 10-foot strips on both sides of the road to Millennial and Portneuf Development.

The Trusts say that Millennial and Portneuf’s ownership of the strips blocked the Trust’s property from having direct access to Northgate Parkway.

On February 4, 2022, the trust filed an official complaint against Millennial and one of its members, Arvil Swaney, Portneuf Development and Portneuf Builders LLC, one of their members, Ken Pape, and the city, alleging a breach of contract, intentional interference with prospective economic advantage, and fraud.

Attorney comments

EastIdahoNews.com made multiple requests in 2022 for comment from Pocatello city attorney Jared Johnson about the suit, but never received a response.

We also reached out to the Rupp family’s attorney, who provided the following statement:

“All the Rupps were asking for in the appeal was to have their day in court, which the Idaho Supreme Court granted. The Court’s decision is therefore a total victory for the Rupp family and justice in general. This is a case that I believe can be resolved at no cost to the City and the other defendants fairly quickly and with great benefit to not only the Rupps, but the greater Pocatello area economically. The undisputed facts in this case ultimately support the Rupps, which is why great lengths have been made to prevent this case from being tried on the merits. This decision by the Supreme Court, however, has ensured that the case will. At the end of the day, the Rupps simply want full access to Northgate Parkway, which just seems reasonable and sensible. The Rupps are evaluating the steps moving forward. Rupps are prepared to aggressively proceed with civilly resolving their claims and protect their property rights.”

Mayor’s response

EastIdahoNews.com reached out to Blad for a comment, and he provided the following statement:

“The Idaho Supreme Court’s ruling returns the Rupp case to District Court for a hearing on the merits. This gives the city of Pocatello the opportunity to present the facts openly and demonstrate that the City acted appropriately. I remain confident in our position,” said the mayor.

The federal government entered into the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement under the Biden administration in December 2023 after two years of negotiations.
Those tribes entered into treaties with the U.S. government in the mid-1850s, ceding land but maintaining a perpetual right to their fishing grounds in the Columbia River Basin.
Four species of salmon in the Columbia River Basin have been listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act since 1991.
Litigation had been ongoing for decades before it was halted as part of the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement.","Time is running out for wild salmon in the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest. Their populations, as well as those of some other native fish, have been declining for decades. Now, President Donald Trump is attacking the progress that had been made to restore those once-abundant salmon runs.

In June 2025, Trump signed a memorandum signaling his administration’s unwillingness to consider dam removal on the lower Snake River, a tributary of the Columbia River, and reneging on a landmark agreement that would have provided more than a billion dollars over the next decade to Pacific Northwest tribes for renewable energy projects and salmon recovery.

The federal government entered into the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement under the Biden administration in December 2023 after two years of negotiations. Other parties to the agreement include environmental advocates; Oregon; Washington; and the Umatilla, Nez Perce, Warm Springs, and Yakama tribes. Those tribes entered into treaties with the U.S. government in the mid-1850s, ceding land but maintaining a perpetual right to their fishing grounds in the Columbia River Basin. The government has failed to ensure the tribal fishing rights it promised to protect in those treaties.

Yakama Nation Tribal Council Chair Gerald Lewis said in a statement that the Trump administration’s withdrawal “echoes the federal government’s historic pattern of broken promises to tribes.” Still, others who were involved in negotiations to secure that agreement have vowed to continue efforts to restore salmon populations and fulfill treaty obligations even as the federal government seeks to undermine them.

“The Trump administration’s decision to pull out of this agreement is short-sighted and regrettable,” Miles Johnson, legal director at Columbia Riverkeeper, told Truthout. “But folks in the Pacific Northwest who care about salmon, and salmon cultures and our rivers, we don’t get to stop working on this just because it becomes more challenging.”

Dozens of hydroelectric dams built beginning almost a century ago on the Columbia River and its largest tributary, the Snake River, eliminated spawning grounds, blocked fish passage between spawning and rearing habitats, and altered river ecology in ways that can impair a salmon’s immune system or undermine their natural migration instincts. More recently, climate change has placed additional stress on salmon populations.

The dams in the Columbia River Basin have been disastrous for fish populations: The number of wild Chinook salmon on the Snake River fell from about 90,000 in the mid-1950s, when there was just one dam on the waterway, to a mere 10,000 in 1980, seven additional dams later. Four species of salmon in the Columbia River Basin have been listed for protection under the Endangered Species Act since 1991.

Congress acknowledged that wild salmon populations in the Columbia River Basin were dwindling and committed to funding hatcheries meant to stop their decline more than 80 years ago. But the facilities have fallen short of that goal. Today, even the hatcheries are threatened, as salmon survival rates have dropped so low that some struggle to collect enough fish for breeding.

“The truth is that extinction of salmon populations is happening now,” Shannon Wheeler, chairman of the Nez Perce Tribe, said in a June 2025 statement in response to the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement.

Experts now agree that dam removal is essential to stop the decline of native fish populations. One proposal, in particular, which argues for the removal of four dams on the lower Snake River in southeastern Washington, has garnered widespread support from scientists and advocates, as well as other tribal leaders. “We’ve learned over the last 30 to 40 years of studying these fish intensely that those four dams on the lower Snake River are four dams too many,” Johnson told Truthout.

The Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement stopped short of calling for the removal of those dams, but it committed to meaningful steps in that direction. The agreement promised funding to study and develop solutions to mitigate the effects of dam breaching on transportation, recreation, irrigation and energy production in the region. It also committed funding to tribal-led alternative energy projects, which could have compensated for the eventual winddown of the hydroelectric dams.

“The concepts behind that agreement remain a really responsible, well-thought-out and careful path that sought to ensure a win-win scenario for all the different constituencies that depend on a healthy Columbia River,” Michael Garrity, special assistant at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW), told Truthout.

Even though the agreement takes what Garrity and other experts characterize as a measured approach, Trump called it “radical environmentalism” in an effort to slander it and labeled concerns about climate change “misplaced” in his memorandum.

Critical funding will be lost with the Trump administration’s decision to withdraw from the agreement. This includes $500 million to improve underfunded and aging hatcheries across the Pacific Northwest and $100 million for wild fish restoration efforts. Much of the promised federal funding would have been disbursed via the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA), a federal agency that operates like a business, marketing power from dams on the Columbia River.

Still, many aspects of the agreement will move forward in some form thanks to continued buy-in from state and tribal governments and the committed backing of environmental advocates. “The partnership between our four tribes and the states of Oregon and Washington endures,” said Jeremy Takala, chair of the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission and a tribal councilman of the Yakama Nation, in a statement. “We are still united in the cause of protecting salmon and rivers.”

Amanda Goodin, an attorney at Earthjustice representing the environmental advocates that signed the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement, echoed Takala. “The NGOs, states, and tribes are not going to quit on this issue,” she told Truthout. “We’re going to be looking for other avenues for the next few years and waiting for the moment that we have a federal administration that actually cares about our natural heritage, obligations to tribes, and following the law, and we’ll be ready when that time comes.”

Those other avenues are almost sure to include legal battles over the impact of hydroelectric dams on salmon in the Columbia River Basin. Litigation had been ongoing for decades before it was halted as part of the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement. Federal agencies have lost in court in previous cases. Even John Hairston, administrator and CEO of BPA, welcomed the agreement when it was signed, saying it would help provide “a reliable, affordable power supply to the Pacific Northwest” and put an end to “costly, unpredictable litigation.” Now, Goodin told Truthout, “It’s likely we’re going to see continued litigation.”

Earthjustice is also advocating for Columbia River Basin fish in Congress, where a series of bills have been introduced that could further undermine plans laid out in the Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement. “Those bills are not just salmon extinction bills, they’re also anti-solution bills,” Cameron Walkup, an associate legal representative working for Earthjustice in Washington, D.C., told Truthoutof the Northwest Energy Security Act, the Defending Our Dams Act, and the Protecting Our Water Energy Resources Act. “These bills would essentially double down on what the president did in June in terms of trying to turn back the clock on progress toward comprehensive solutions for salmon recovery, and also dealing with interconnected issues like making sure we have reliable and affordable energy.”

Columbia Riverkeeper, Earthjustice, and NGO partners are engaged in organizing sign-on campaigns to demonstrate support for dam removal and oppose the harmful bills introduced in Congress. Walkup also told Truthout that his organization is prepared to engage with members of Congress if it appears the bills could garner enough support to come to a hearing. “We’re certainly doing everything we can to uplift all the issues with these bills to make sure that if Republicans do choose to make this part of their agenda, that they’re fully opposed by the Democrats and don’t make it through Congress,” he told Truthout.

For their part, Washington’s state agencies responsible for studying the effects of dam breaching on the lower Snake River are continuing that work even as federal partners have withdrawn. “WDFW, working with the governor’s office, is committed to finding a path forward to restore healthy and abundant salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin in a way that respects and addresses the non-salmon benefits of the river,” Garrity told Truthout.

Johnson of Columbia Riverkeeper said his message to those who are concerned about the Trump administration’s decision to renege on the historic Resilient Columbia Basin Agreement is simple: “We absolutely need our representatives to understand how much people care about salmon and steelhead and having enough fish in our rivers that people can go fishing, we can meet our obligations to tribes and protect tribal cultures,” he told Truthout. “That starts with individuals, businesses, leaders and anyone else making their voices heard. It’s critical to build a groundswell of support.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2191227950-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 17:57:15.929233

Two people fighting the fire on the Olympic Peninsula were arrested by federal law enforcement Wednesday, as depicted in photos and videos. The two firefighters had entered the U.S. illegally, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Thursday in a news release.

The 9,200-acre wildfire is one of Washington’s largest. The crews, pictured wearing protective clothing and hard hats common on fire lines, were part of the 300-person effort to contain the fire, which started July 6 about 10 miles northwest of Hoodsport, Mason County.

The arrests received swift backlash from elected leaders across the Northwest and nationwide.

Fifty members of Congress questioned the action in a letter Friday to DHS, CBP and the Bureau of Land Management.

“The two arrests and dozens of firefighters temporarily sidelined during an active wildfire raise questions about the priorities and (judgment) exercised by federal agencies,” reads the letter, spearheaded by U.S. Rep. Emily Randall, D-Wash. Randall’s congressional district includes the Olympic Peninsula, where the fire is burning.

The lawmakers specifically seek clarification on Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies regarding arrests in disaster areas. The letter claims standard emergency protocols “shield first responders” who are working in hazardous conditions from ICE. The lawmakers say those protocols weren’t followed.

“The arrest of these hardworking crew members, who put their lives on the line to perform lifesaving duties, is not making our communities safer, no matter the rhetoric you use on TV,” the lawmakers said. “The Trump Administration’s thoughtless and cruel immigration enforcement at any cost undermines coordinated emergency response efforts.”

Federal agents checked the immigration status of firefighters on the active wildfire in a remote location. The agents identified two people who were in the U.S. illegally, a DHS release said, and took them to a detention facility.

Before the arrests, contract fire crews were sent to the northeast side of Lake Cushman. They had been assigned to a Community Hazard Reduction Project, cutting wood to reduce the fuel available for the fire.

The aftermath of the arrests and subsequent outrage saw the Department of Homeland Security claim Friday that the two arrested were not technically firefighters because they were cutting wood.

“The two contracted work crews questioned on the day of their arrests were not even assigned to actively fight the fire; they were there in a support role, cutting logs into firewood,” the Friday post to X reads.“The firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time.”

The U.S. Department of the Interior defines an entry-level wildland firefighter as someone who, among other tasks, chops brush. Forest Service spokesperson Jennifer Risdal did not respond directly to questions about the veracity of the DHS post.

“USDA Forest Service is aware of a Border Patrol operation on the Bear Gulch Fire,” Risdal said in an emailed statement Saturday. “There have been no impacts to firefighting efforts and progress continues to be made on containment.”

The fire was 13% contained as of Saturday afternoon, according to a federal interagency report.

The order, which was issued on Sunday in response to a complaint filed by a pro-immigrant advocacy group, came as some Guatemalan children were reportedly already put onto planes at a Texas airport and huddled inside.
After initially preventing the deportation of the group, Sooknanan, who is based in Washington, DC, widened the order to include all Guatemalan children who had reached the US without a parent or guardian.

The order, which was issued on Sunday in response to a complaint filed by a pro-immigrant advocacy group, came as some Guatemalan children were reportedly already put onto planes at a Texas airport and huddled inside.

District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan’s emergency decree followed a petition from the National Immigration Law Center in relation to 10 children aged between 10 and 17.

After initially preventing the deportation of the group, Sooknanan, who is based in Washington, DC, widened the order to include all Guatemalan children who had reached the US without a parent or guardian.

Sooknanan also brought forward a hearing about the issue on Sunday due to reports that some of the children were in the process of being removed from the US during the country’s Labor Day holiday weekend.

“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” the judge said on Sunday, noting that her decision applied broadly to unaccompanied Guatemalan minors.

The flurry of legal activity came days after reports in the US media that the Trump administration was preparing to start child deportations to Guatemala this weekend, following an agreement with the Central American country.

Such a move would constitute a “clear violation of the unambiguous protections that Congress has provided them as vulnerable children”, according to the National Immigration Law Center’s legal challenge.

Although the children should be under the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the US government was set on “illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture”, the complaint added.

On Friday, Guatemala’s Foreign Minister Carlos Martinez confirmed that his country was willing to receive hundreds of children who were in the US.

Since the start of his second presidential term in January, Trump has attempted to start deporting refugees and immigrants en masse.

The episode has raised alarms among immigrant advocates, who say it may represent a violation of federal laws designed to protect children who arrive without their parents.

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that an official list had been drafted with the names of Guatemalan children whom the U.S. administration would attempt to send back to their home country.

Trump administration plans to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children

The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. unaccompanied, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. The Guatemalan government has said it is ready to take them in.

It is another step in the Trump administration's sweeping immigration enforcement efforts, which include plans to send a surge of officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, ramping up deportations and ending protections for people who have had permission to live and work in the United States.

Lawyers for the Guatemalan children said the U.S. government doesn't have the authority to remove the youngsters and is depriving them of due process by preventing them from pursuing asylum claims or immigration relief. Many have active cases in immigration courts, according to the attorneys' court filing in Washington.

Although the children are supposed to be in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government is ""illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture,"" argues the filing by attorneys with the Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights and the National Immigration Law Center.

An attorney with another advocacy group, the National Center for Youth Law, said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children — particularly from Guatemala — in Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities. HSI is ICE's investigative arm.

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin.

Then, on Friday, advocates across the country began getting word that their young clients' immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said.

Migrant children traveling without their parents or guardians are handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement when they are encountered by officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. Once in the U.S., the children often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a family member — living in the country.

The minors can request asylum, juvenile immigration status or visas for victims of sexual exploitation.

Due to their age and often traumatic experiences getting to the U.S., their treatment is one of the most sensitive issues in immigration. Advocacy groups already have sued to ask courts to halt new Trump administration vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.

Guatemala says it is willing to receive the unaccompanied minors

Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said Friday that the government has told the U.S. it is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. unaccompanied and are being held in government facilities.

Guatemala is particularly concerned about minors who could pass age limits for the children's facilities and be sent to adult detention centers, he said.

President Bernardo Arévalo has said that his government has a moral and legal obligation to advocate for the children. His comments came days after U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala.

That surge of resources included thousands of National Guard troops who were deployed to the nation’s capital with the stated goal of lowering crime rates.
Following the movement of troops and law enforcement officers to Washington, Trump threatened to send federal officers and troops to other major American cities, including Baltimore.
Later in the Sunday interview, Noem was asked whether Boston would be one of the cities where the federal government would surge immigration enforcement agents.
JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said, “We don’t want troops on the streets of American cities.","Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed Sunday that the Trump administration plans to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in major cities, including Chicago.

Asked about plans to expand ICE operations in Chicago specifically, Noem told CBS News’ “Face the Nation,” “We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago and throughout Illinois and other states, making sure that we’re upholding our laws, but we do intend to add more resources to those operations.”

Asked about what an expansion of ICE operations would look like in Chicago and whether it would involve a mobilization of National Guard troops to assist with immigration raids and arrests, Noem demurred, saying, “That always is a prerogative of President [Donald] Trump and his decision. I won’t speak to the specifics of the operations that are planned in other cities.”

Her remarks come one day after Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order directing his city’s legal department to explore ways to counter a potential surge in federal law enforcement and National Guard troops to Illinois.

During a press conference Saturday, Johnson warned that Chicago officials had “received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our cities see some type of militarized activity by the federal government.”

Earlier this month, the Trump administration directed federal law enforcement officers, including those employed by ICE, to assist police in Washington, D.C., with crime-fighting operations. That surge of resources included thousands of National Guard troops who were deployed to the nation’s capital with the stated goal of lowering crime rates.

Following the movement of troops and law enforcement officers to Washington, Trump threatened to send federal officers and troops to other major American cities, including Baltimore.

Later in the Sunday interview, Noem was asked whether Boston would be one of the cities where the federal government would surge immigration enforcement agents.

“There’s a lot of cities that are dealing with crime and violence right now, and so we haven’t taken anything off the table,” she said, adding later: “I’d encourage every single big city — San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, whatever they are — if they want to help make their city safer, more prosperous, allow people the opportunity to walk in freedom like the people of Washington, D.C., are now ... they should call us.”

Other Democratic officials, including a group of over a dozen governors, have condemned plans to deploy troops to their states.

In a statement last week, they said, “Whether it’s Illinois, Maryland and New York or another state tomorrow, the President’s threats and efforts to deploy a state’s National Guard without the request and consent of that state’s governor is an alarming abuse of power, ineffective, and undermines the mission of our service members.”

And in an interview that aired Sunday on “Face the Nation,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, said, “We don’t want troops on the streets of American cities. That’s un-American. Frankly, the president of the United States ought to know better.”

Pritzker also accused the Trump administration of targeting states run by Democrats rather than those run by Republicans, telling CBS, “Notice he never talks about where the most violent crime is occurring, which is in red states. ... Their violent crime rates are much worse in other places, and we’re very proud of the work that we’ve done.”

Asked whether there are plans in place to deploy troops and federal law enforcement officials to states and cities run by Republicans, Noem said, “Absolutely.”

“Every single city is evaluated for what we need to do there to make it safer. So we’ve got operations that, again, I won’t talk about details on, but we absolutely are not looking through the viewpoint at anything we’re doing with a political lens,” she added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-07/250711-kristi-noem-se-1145a-0e97fd.jpg",N,,2025-08-31 16:57:04.171386

This action, described by legal experts as a ""sham lawsuit,"" bypassed the traditional democratic process, raising significant concerns about the integrity of the judicial system and its impact on immigrant rights.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

Ronald White: Trump’s Judicial Rubber Stamp

Instead of engaging in the difficult and public work of repealing a state law through the legislature, the Trump Justice Department and the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office—both aligned against the tuition benefit—collaborated on a pre-determined outcome. They filed a lawsuit not as adversaries, but as ""partners,"" agreeing from the outset to strike down the two-decade-old Oklahoma law.

This coordinated effort was evident when the complaint was filed, immediately followed by a ""Joint Motion for Entry of Consent Judgment."" This move telegraphed their intent: to use the court as a rubber stamp for their shared agenda rather than a forum for genuine legal dispute.

MIGRANT INSIDER is sponsored by

Public Outcry Ignored

The non-profit legal advocacy group Public Justice attempted to intervene, arguing that the court lacked the fundamental authority, or jurisdiction, to hear such a manufactured case. They highlighted that Article III of the U.S. Constitution limits federal courts to adjudicating ""actual controversies arising between adverse litigants""—a principle clearly absent in this ""friendly suit."" Public Justice warned that allowing such a proceeding was ""a threat to the democratic process.""

Despite these critical warnings, U.S. District Judge Ronald White, a George W. Bush appointee, rejected Public Justice's request to file an amicus curiae (""friend of the court"") brief, offering no explanation. Shortly thereafter, Judge White approved the ""consent judgment,"" permanently blocking the enforcement of the Oklahoma law. This decision was made without considering any adversarial arguments, effectively silencing those who sought to uphold the democratically enacted statute.

Targeting Migrant Student Tuition Access

At the heart of this legal sidestep was a state law that provided in-state tuition rates for certain undocumented individuals attending college in Oklahoma. For years, this law helped make higher education more accessible to a vulnerable population. The Trump administration and Oklahoma's Attorney General, both known for their stringent anti-immigrant policies, saw this law as a target. Their novel use of the court system allowed them to dismantle this provision without facing the public debate, legislative hurdles, or potential political backlash that a conventional repeal effort would entail.

MY TAKE: This case echoes a similar incident involving U.S. District Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas, indicating a disturbing trend where federal courts are being used as instruments for political agendas rather than impartial arbiters of justice.

As one Public Justice lawyer noted, even conservative judges traditionally champion strict adherence to jurisdictional rules, making these recent actions particularly alarming.

The concern is clear: without genuine adversarial arguments, courts risk making incorrect decisions and, more importantly, abusing their discretion by deciding issues without hearing both sides.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.","Congressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats — or around them — as a government shutdown looms.

The annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia’s trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.

In the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former President Joe Biden while Speaker Mike Johnson navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

A look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:

Keeping the Government Open

The most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it’s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that.

Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.

The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.

Democrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.

Senate Nominations Fight

Senators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August — fighting over Trump’s nominees.

Exasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration’s positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could “GO TO HELL!”

Republicans now say they’re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.

Russian Sanctions

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won’t move without him.

Graham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.

“If we don’t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,” Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.

Oversight of the CDC

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.

Kennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez’s lawyers said she refused “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.”

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.

Divisions over Epstein

The House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump’s administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.

Democrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier’s abuse.

Investigating Biden

The House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden’s mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president’s inner circle.

The Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden’s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.

Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.

Stock Trading Ban

Congress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there’s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.

That push is now gaining momentum. A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents — while notably exempting Trump. In the House, several members are putting forward proposals and even threatening to maneuver around GOP leadership to force a vote.

Still, there is plenty of resistance to the idea, including from many wealthy lawmakers who reap dividends from their portfolios.

It was the latest showdown over the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration — and the latest high-stakes clash between the administration’s enforcement efforts and legal safeguards that Congress created for vulnerable migrants.

“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” said Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, who said her ruling applies broadly to Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. without their parents or guardians.

Minutes after she wrapped up a hastily scheduled hearing Sunday afternoon, five charter buses pulled up to a plane parked at the border-area airport in Harlingen, Texas. Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers — perhaps 50 — toward the plane in a part of the airport that is restricted to government planes, including deportation flights. The passengers were wearing colored clothing used in government-run shelters for migrant children.

The U.S. government contends that it’s reuniting the Guatemalan children with parents or guardians who sought their return. Lawyers for at least some of the minors say that’s untrue and argue that, in any event, authorities still would have to follow a legal process that they did not.

While Sunday’s court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in the nation’s capital, similar emergency requests were filed in other parts of the country. Attorneys in Arizona and Illinois asked federal judges there to block deportations of unaccompanied minors, underscoring how the fight over the government’s efforts has quickly spread.

Immigrant advocates react

The episode has raised alarms among immigrant advocates, who say it may represent a violation of federal laws designed to protect children who arrive without their parents.

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that an official list had been drafted with the names of Guatemalan children whom the U.S. administration would attempt to send back to their home country. Advocates learned that the flights would leave from the Texas cities of Harlingen and El Paso, Aber said.

She said she’d heard that federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials “were still taking the children,” having not gotten any guidance about the court order.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Sunday.

Plans to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children

The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. unaccompanied, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. The Guatemalan government has said it is ready to take them in.

It is another step in the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration enforcement efforts, which include plans to send a surge of officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, ramping up deportations and ending protections for people who have had permission to live and work in the United States.

Lawyers for the Guatemalan children said the U.S. government doesn’t have the authority to remove the youngsters and is depriving them of due process by preventing them from pursuing asylum claims or immigration relief. Many have active cases in immigration courts, according to the attorneys’ court filing in Washington.

Although the children are supposed to be in the care and custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government is “illegally transferring them to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to put them on flights to Guatemala, where they may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or torture,” argues the filing by attorneys with the Young Center for Immigrant Children’s Rights and the National Immigration Law Center.

An attorney with another advocacy group, the National Center for Youth Law, said the organization started hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that agents from Homeland Security Investigations — ICE’s investigative arm — were interviewing children, particularly from Guatemala, in Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities.

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin.

Then on Friday, advocates across the country began getting word that their young clients’ immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said.

Migrant children traveling without their parents or guardians are handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement when they are encountered by officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. Once in the U.S., the children often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a family member — living in the country.

The minors can request asylum, juvenile immigration status or visas for victims of sexual exploitation.

Due to their age and often traumatic experiences getting to the U.S., their treatment is one of the most sensitive issues in immigration. Advocacy groups already have sued to ask courts to halt new Trump administration vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.

Guatemala willing to receive the unaccompanied minors

Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said Friday that the government has told the U.S. it is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. unaccompanied and are being held in government facilities.

Guatemala is particularly concerned about minors who could pass age limits for the children’s facilities and be sent to adult detention centers, he said.

President Bernardo Arévalo has said that his government has a moral and legal obligation to advocate for the children. His comments came days after U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bdc20c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1955x1026+0+126/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F25%2F6b%2F242919054c24b427ed7b7af34a95%2F0a67ac3f222c448e9f475e1cb48cf99e.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 15:56:55.377655

Trump administration plans to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who came to the U.S. unaccompanied, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat.","Harlingen, Texas – After the U.S. government loaded children onto planes overnight to be sent back to their native Guatemala, a federal judge temporarily blocked the flights – with the youngsters still inside – as their attorneys said authorities were violating U.S. laws and sending vulnerable kids into potential peril.

The extraordinary drama played out over predawn hours on a U.S. holiday weekend and vaulted from tarmacs in Texas to a courtroom in Washington. It was the latest showdown over the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration – and the latest high-stakes clash between the administration's enforcement efforts and legal safeguards that Congress created for vulnerable migrants.

For now, hundreds of Guatemalan children who arrived unaccompanied will stay while the legal fight plays out over coming weeks.

“I do not want there to be any ambiguity,” said Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, who noted her ruling applies broadly to Guatemalan minors who arrived in the U.S. without parents or guardians.

Minutes after she concluded a hastily scheduled hearing Sunday afternoon, five charter buses pulled up to a plane parked at the border-area airport in Harlingen, Texas. Hours earlier, authorities had walked dozens of passengers – perhaps 50 – toward the plane in a part of the airport restricted to government planes, including deportation flights. The passengers were wearing colored clothing that is used in government-run shelters for migrant children.

The U.S. government insists it's reuniting the Guatemalan children with parents or guardians who sought their return. Lawyers for at least some of the minors say that's nonsense and argue that in any event, authorities still would have to follow a legal process that they did not.

One girl said her parents, in Guatemala, got a strange phone call a few weeks ago saying the U.S. was deporting her, said one of the attorneys, Efrén C. Olivares of the National Immigration Law Center. Other children – identified only by their initials – said in court documents that they had been neglected, abandoned, physically threatened or abused in their home country.

Sunday's court hearing came in a case filed in federal court in Washington, but similar legal actions also were filed elsewhere.

In a lawsuit in Arizona, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project said one of its clients is a 12-year-old asylum-seeker who has chronic kidney disease, needs dialysis to stay alive and will need a kidney transplant. Two other plaintiffs, a 10-year-old boy and his 3-year-old sister, don't have family in Guatemala and don't want to return, according to the group.

Families scramble to Guatemalan air base

As the developments played out in the U.S., families gathered at an air base in Guatemala’s capital, Guatemala City, in anticipation of the flights. Gilberto López said he drove through the night from his remote town after his 17-year-old nephew called at midnight, saying that he was being deported from Texas.

The boy left Guatemala two years ago, at age 15, to work in the U.S. and was detained about a month ago, López said.

Alarm bells for immigrant advocates

Migrant children who arrive in the U.S. without their parents or guardians are routinely handed over to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. They often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor – usually a relative – living in the country.

Many of those from Guatemala request asylum or pursue other legal avenues to get permission to stay the U.S.

An attorney with the National Center for Youth Law said the organization starting hearing a few weeks ago from legal service providers that Homeland Security Investigations agents were interviewing children – particularly Guatemalans – in facilities of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

The agents asked the children about their relatives in Guatemala, said the attorney, Becky Wolozin.

Then, on Friday, advocates began getting word that their young clients’ immigration court hearings were being canceled, Wolozin said.

Shaina Aber of Acacia Center for Justice, an immigrant legal defense group, said it was notified Saturday evening that officials had drafted a list of children to return to Guatemala. Advocates learned that the flights would leave from the Texas cities of Harlingen and El Paso, Aber said.

It's unclear whether any planes actually departed. Government lawyer Drew Ensign told the Washington judge that one plane might have taken off but then returned.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and HHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment Sunday.

The judge said that after being awakened at 2:30 a.m. to address the emergency filing from the children's lawyers, she spent hours trying to reach federal attorneys and get answers.

“I have the government attempting to remove unaccompanied minors from the country in the wee hours of the morning on a holiday weekend, which is surprising,” Sooknanan said at the hearing, later adding: “Absent action by the courts, all of those children would have been returned to Guatemala, potentially to very dangerous situations.”

The rapid-fire developments resembled a March weekend showdown over the deportation of hundreds of Venezuelans to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador. Advocates implored a federal judge to halt deportations they believed were imminent, while the Trump administration was mum about its plans.

That judge appeared in civilian clothes for a Saturday night hearing and tried to block the flights, but they went ahead, with the government saying the order came too late.

On Saturday, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order barring the city's police department from collaborating with federal officers conducting civil immigration enforcement operations, and with U.S. military personnel on police patrols.

Johnson, a Democrat, said Trump was acting outside ""the bounds of the Constitution"" by threatening to send more federal law enforcement officers or even the National Guard to Chicago against the wishes of state and local leaders.

""We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart,"" Johnson said. ""We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don't want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents.""

President Trump, in a post on his social media site Truth Social on Saturday, criticized Illinois' Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker and suggested federal forces could be dispatched to the Midwest city to fight crime.

""Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn't need help in preventing CRIME,"" Trump wrote. ""He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we're coming!""

The Trump administration recently deployed National Guard members to the streets of Washington, D.C. in an effort to reduce crime in the nation's capital.

On Sunday, Pritzker said on CBS's Face the Nation that the possibility of sending the U.S. military to the streets of an American city amounts to an ""attack on the American people by the President of the United States.""

Pritzker also said Trump also had ""other aims"" besides simply fighting crime, such as disrupting the 2026 midterm elections. ""He'll just claim that there's some problem with an election, and then he's got troops on the ground that can take control, if in fact he's allowed to do this,"" the governor said.

Though Trump himself has tied crime to a possible increase of federal forces in Chicago, the administration is expected to characterize the surge of law enforcement resources as focused specifically on immigration enforcement, the Associated Press reported.

White House ""border czar"" Tom Homan said last week that there would be a ""ramp-up"" of immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and other cities, including New York and Los Angeles.

""All these sanctuary cities that refuse to work with [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] where we know public safety threats are being released every day into this country — especially in those cities — we're going to address that,"" Homan told reporters.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem said Sunday that the government intends to ""add more resources"" to ongoing ICE operations in Chicago but did not disclose any details.

Last week the Trump administration asked the Naval Station Great Lakes for support with immigration operations, including ""facilities, infrastructure, and other logistical needs to support DHS operations,"" according to the AP.

Under Mayor Johnson's order, Chicago Police Department officers will also have to wear official police uniforms and will be prohibited from wearing face masks so city residents can distinguish them from federal officers, he said. (A DHS spokesperson previously told NPR that some immigration agents wear masks to protect themselves from increasing threats.)

On Sunday, the White House criticized Johnson's executive order.

""If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement. ""Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue, but Democrats suffering from TDS are trying to make it one. They should listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser who recently celebrated the Trump Administration's success in driving down violent crime in Washington DC.""

Johnson said he believed the immigration crackdown could begin as early as Friday.

It’s where, Abrego Garcia alleges in a lawsuit, he suffered severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation and psychological torture.
His team says he is entitled to immigration court proceedings and appeals, including to the U.S. Court of Appeals.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia ’s request for asylum in the United States is a prudent legal strategy, experts say, because it gives his lawyers better options for fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to deport him.

But it’s also a gamble. Depending on how the courts rule, Abrego Garcia could end up back inside the notorious El Salvador prison where he says he was beaten and psychologically tortured.

“It’s a strategic move,” Memphis-based immigration attorney Andrew Rankin said of the asylum request. “And it can certainly backfire. But it’s something I would do as well if I were representing him.”

Abrego Garcia, 30, became a focus of President Trump’s immigration crackdown when he was wrongfully deported to his native country in March. The administration is trying to deport him again.

Here are some things to know about his case:

‘You can’t win every case’

The administration deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador because U.S. officials said he was an MS-13 gang member. It’s an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies and for which he wasn’t charged.

His removal to El Salvador violated a U.S. immigration judge’s ruling from 2019 that barred his deportation there. The judge found that Abrego Garcia faced credible threats from a local gang that had extorted from and terrorized his family.

Following a U.S. Supreme Court order, the administration returned him to the United States in June. But it was only to face human smuggling charges, which his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The administration has said it now intends to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and the main architect of Trump’s immigration policies, told reporters Friday that Garcia has “said he doesn’t want to go back to El Salvador.”

Miller said the administration is “honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.”

In an effort to fight back, Abrego Garcia has notified the U.S. government that he fears being sent to Uganda, which has documented human rights abuses. He said he believes he could be persecuted, tortured or sent from there to El Salvador.

But even if he thwarts deportation to Uganda in immigration court, he probably will face attempts to remove him to another country and then another until the administration succeeds, Rankin said.

“By the law of averages, you can’t win every case,” the lawyer said. “The government has sunk its teeth far into what they’re doing with Kilmar and immigration in general, that it wouldn’t make any sense for them to just give up the fight.”

Taking a risk

Asylum, however, could end the fight.

The request would place the focus solely back on his native El Salvador, where Abrego Garcia has previously shown that he has a credible fear of gang persecution.

But he’s taking a risk by reopening his 2019 immigration case, Rankin said. If he loses the bid for asylum, an immigration judge could remove his protection from being returned to his native country.

That could place him back in the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECO, in El Salvador. It’s where, Abrego Garcia alleges in a lawsuit, he suffered severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation and psychological torture. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has denied those allegations.

Abrego Garcia had applied for asylum in 2019. The immigration judge denied his request because it came more than a year after Abrego Garcia had arrived in the U.S. He had fled to Maryland without documentation around 2011.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers will probably argue that he has the right to request asylum now because he has been in the U.S. for less than a year after being wrongfully deported to El Salvador, Rankin said.

If approved, asylum could provide him with a green card and a path to citizenship.

‘Not going to let this go’

Abrego Garcia’s asylum petition would go through the U.S. immigration court system, which is not part of the judiciary but an arm of the Department of Justice and under the Trump administration’s authority.

That’s where the risk comes in.

Abrego Garcia has a team of lawyers fighting for him, unlike many people who are facing deportation. And a federal judge is monitoring his immigration case.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys filed a federal lawsuit in Maryland to ensure he can exercise his constitutional rights to fight against deportation in immigration court.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis cannot rule on whether he gets asylum or is deported, but she said she will ensure his right to due process. His team says he is entitled to immigration court proceedings and appeals, including to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

“Even if he does manage to win asylum, the government is going to appeal,” Rankin said. “They’re not going to let this go. Why would they after they’ve invested months and months into this one guy?”

Rankin noted that if Abrego Garcia remains within the jurisdiction of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, that court’s laws would govern his asylum claim. He said that court has been generally positive toward asylum claims and likely would give Abrego Garcia a “fair shake.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6eff3aa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4835x2538+0+343/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbc%2Ff6%2Fba2e658940cda551c99b3c4ea0d3%2F4a979dfbc97541e28aa6e89d7a56a40e.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 13:59:12.329177

March for Australia rallies against immigration were being held in Sydney and other state capitals and regional centers, according to the group’s website.

“Mass migration has torn at the bonds that held our communities together,” the website says. The group posted on X on Saturday that the rallies aimed to do “what the mainstream politicians never have the courage to do: demand an end to mass immigration.”

Australia – where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas – has been grappling with a rise in right-wing extremism, including protests by neo-Nazis.

“We absolutely condemn the March for Australia rally that’s going on today. It is not about increasing social harmony,” Murray Watt, a senior minister in the Labor government, told Sky News television, when asked about the rally in Sydney, the country’s most-populous city.

“We don’t support rallies like this that are about spreading hate and that are about dividing our community,” Watt said, asserting they were “organized and promoted” by neo-Nazi groups.

March for Australia organizers did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the neo-Nazi claims.

Counter-protesters express ‘disgust’

Some 5,000 to 8,000 people, many draped in Australian flags, had assembled for the Sydney rally, the Australian Broadcasting Corp reported. It was held near the course of the Sydney Marathon, where 35,000 runners pounded the streets on Sunday, finishing at the city’s Opera House.

Also nearby, a counter-rally by the Refugee Action Coalition, a community activist organization, took place.

“Our event shows the depth of disgust and anger about the far-right agenda of March For Australia,” a coalition spokesperson said in a statement. Organizers said hundreds attended that event.

A large March for Australia rally was held in central Melbourne, the capital of Victoria state, according to aerial footage from the ABC, which reported that riot officers used pepper spray on demonstrators. Victoria Police did not confirm the report but said it would provide details on the protest later on Sunday.

Bob Katter, the leader of a small populist party, was attending a March for Australia rally in Queensland, a party spokesperson said, three days after the veteran lawmaker threatened a reporter for mentioning Katter’s Lebanese heritage at a press conference when the topic of his attendance at a March for Australia was being discussed.

In Sydney, March for Australia protester Glenn Allchin said he wanted a “slowdown” in immigration.

“It’s about our country bursting at the seams and our government bringing more and more people in,” Allchin told Reuters. “Our kids struggling to get homes, our hospitals, we have to wait seven hours, our roads, the lack of roads.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2232950741.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-08-31 13:59:17.242864

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.","Congressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed President Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats — or around them — as a government shutdown looms.

The annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia’s trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.

In the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former President Joe Biden while Speaker Mike Johnson navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

A look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:

Keeping the Government Open

The most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it’s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that.

Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer’s vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.

The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.

Democrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.

Senate Nominations Fight

Senators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August — fighting over Trump’s nominees.

Exasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration’s positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could “GO TO HELL!”

Republicans now say they’re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.

Russian Sanctions

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump’s closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia’s invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won’t move without him.

Graham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.

“If we don’t have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,” Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.

Oversight of the CDC

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.

Kennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez’s lawyers said she refused “to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.”

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.

Divisions over Epstein

The House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump’s administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.

Democrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier’s abuse.

Investigating Biden

The House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden’s mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president’s inner circle.

The Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden’s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.

Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.

Stock Trading Ban

Congress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there’s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.

That push is now gaining momentum. A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents — while notably exempting Trump. In the House, several members are putting forward proposals and even threatening to maneuver around GOP leadership to force a vote.

Still, there is plenty of resistance to the idea, including from many wealthy lawmakers who reap dividends from their portfolios.

Noem's comments come after the DHS last week requested limited logistical support from officials at the Naval Station Great Lakes to support the agency's anticipated operations. The military installation is about 35 miles north of Chicago.

“We’ve already had ongoing operations with ICE in Chicago... but we do intend to add more resources to those operations,” Noem said during an appearance CBS News' ”Face the Nation.""

Noem declined to provide further details about the planned surge of federal officers. It comes after the Trump administration deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to target crime, immigration and homelessness, and two months after it sent troops to Los Angeles.

Trump lashed out against Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker in a social media posting Saturday, warning him that he must straighten out Chicago's crime problems quickly “or we're coming.” The Republican president has also been critical of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.

Johnson and Pritzker have pushed back against the expected federal mobilization, saying crime has fallen in Chicago. They are planning to sue if Trump moves forward with the plan.

Johnson has already signed an order barring the Chicago Police Department from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal government immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and the state at odds with Trump’s administration as it tries to carry out his mass deportation agenda.

Pritzker in an interview aired Sunday on “Face the Nation” charged that Trump's expected plans to mobilize federal forces in the city may be part of a plan to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections.”

Noem said it was a Trump “prerogative” whether to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago as he did in Los Angeles in June in the midst of immigration protests in the California city.

“Federal law prohibits the use of U.S. Military for domestic law enforcement except in extraordinary circumstances — which do not exist in Chicago,” the order said.

Crime in Chicago has fallen in nearly every major category over the past year, according to city figures, and murders are down 50 percent from their peak during the pandemic.

At a news conference last week alongside other city and state leaders, Mayor Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, who are both Democrats, denounced Mr. Trump’s threat to send troops. But Mr. Trump repeated his threat in a social media post on Saturday, saying the governor needed to take action to prevent crime “or we’re coming!”

Mr. Johnson’s executive order said that federal agents should comply with city policies that prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing masks to intentionally disguise or conceal their identities. It also calls for the city to take steps to ensure that residents know their rights when encountering federal agents.

“We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government,” Mr. Johnson told reporters on Saturday. “We have not called for this.”

Chicago has clashed with the Trump administration over the city’s sanctuary laws for immigrants. Illinois and Chicago limit how city agencies may interact with federal immigration authorities; the White House says that a lack of cooperation at the local and state levels impedes federal immigration enforcement efforts.

The court forbade the administration from deporting the children, who are as young as 10, for 14 days.

Even so, dozens of children were removed by immigration authorities from shelters overnight and were gathered in preparation to be placed on chartered planes to Guatemala, according to officials with knowledge of the situation.

The judge’s order could temporarily hamstring the federal government’s attempts to return to Guatemala hundreds of unaccompanied minors who have been in U.S. custody after crossing the southern border.

On Sunday morning, after the temporary restraining order was issued, shelters holding children received a letter from the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement stating that the agency was responsible for the care and custody of the children, and that the shelters must comply with the agency’s directives.

The officials with knowledge of the situation, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution from the government, said that dozens of children were removed from shelters in the early morning hours Sunday.

Though the judge’s order is temporary, it is the second recent setback for President Trump’s immigration policies. On Friday, another judge blocked the administration from carrying out rapid deportations far from the border, a cornerstone of the White House’s immigration policy.

The lawsuit over the Guatemalan children was filed after staff members at shelters that were holding the children were notified by email on Saturday that they should prepare some of them to be sent back to Guatemala. Lawyers representing some of the children received a similar email.

In its 25-page complaint, the National Immigration Law Center said that the children had active cases before immigration courts across the country, and that their repatriation would violate federal law and the Constitution. It called the government’s actions “unlawful and reckless.”

Ten children are identified by their initials in the lawsuit. All of them have cases pending in immigration courts and have told judges that they are afraid to return to Guatemala, the lawsuit says.

The number of unaccompanied minors entering the United States has plummeted since Mr. Trump began his second term. Migrant children have posed a particular challenge to the Trump administration because they are entitled to special protections.

Hundreds of thousands of children, mainly from Central America, have crossed the southern border into the United States in the last decade, often seeking to join friends or relatives. Many of the minors have won the right to remain in the United States permanently by proving that they were abandoned or persecuted in their home countries.

The move to repatriate the Guatemalan children has the backing of the Guatemalan government. Carlos Ramíro Martínez, Guatemala’s minister of foreign affairs, said on Friday that his country had been coordinating with the United States. and expected to receive more than 600 minors.

When unaccompanied children entering the United States are taken into custody, they typically remain in shelters until they are released to sponsors or guardians once those adults have been vetted. The children the Trump administration is seeking to deport have been awaiting release from the shelters.

Lawyers fighting the removal of unaccompanied minors have cited the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act, which provides special protections for unaccompanied minors who seek refuge in the United States, including the opportunity to have their cases adjudicated by a court.

“We are very concerned that our clients could be returned to unsafe situations,” said Ms. Sendukas, managing attorney with the Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project.

He also reiterated his intention to restrict mail-in voting except for those who are very ill or serving far away in the military, as well as his opposition to voting machines.

The announcement signals Mr. Trump’s latest effort to influence election laws using an executive order, something that he has dubious authority to do. The Constitution gives the president no explicit authority to regulate elections. Rather, it gives states the power to decide the rules of elections, oversee voting and try to prevent fraud. It gives Congress the ability to override state laws on voting. Any executive order from the president regarding elections is likely to see immediate legal challenges.

Mr. Trump and his allies have started a wide-ranging effort to gain any advance they can ahead of midterm elections, which are set for November 2026.

Earlier this month, Mr. Trump said that a team of lawyers were preparing an executive order to end all mail-in ballots and wrote on social media that the executive order would “help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.” He has long opposed mail-in voting and falsely claimed it was a source of fraud after he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joseph R. Biden Jr.

In March, Mr. Trump signed an executive order seeking to require people to show government-issued proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. The order was swiftly challenged in court, and a federal judge blocked the vast majority of the order in June.

The judge, Denise J. Casper of the Federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts, sided with states that had sued to stop the requirements, writing in her judgment that the states were likely to succeed in showing that the order exceeded Mr. Trump’s authority and risked disenfranchising some of the electorate. Judge Casper was appointed by President Obama.

“The Constitution does not grant the president any specific powers over elections,” she wrote.

After a call with White House officials and a logo change earlier this week, the company unwoked itself to President Trump’s liking.

“Congratulations Cracker Barrel!” read the statement from Mr. Trump, who celebrated the old barrel man’s return to the logo. “All of your fans very much appreciate it.”

It used to be that you could switch off the so-called culture wars, or at least find a place to mute them for a little while. Cracker Barrel was actually one of those places. But now, not even something as low stakes as a company’s logo can escape the gaze of a president bent on changing — or forcing — American life to reflect his own views and tastes, which often mirror the far-right ideological movement that fueled his rise.

The White House declined to comment on why this matter was worthy of the president’s time, and why officials had held the call with Cracker Barrel. But an official passed on a statement from Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, who praised the president’s “unmatched business instincts.”

The logo debacle seems like a small thing, but really, it shows how Mr. Trump is now using his power to reshape all aspects of American culture, not just American policy. He has not hesitated to retaliate against those who disagree.

He has effectively taken over the Kennedy Center, where he will decide what art is appropriate to receive national recognition, and where he will host the annual awards ceremony. (No “wokesters,” he said of the recipients.) He is reviewing Smithsonian museums and exhibits “to assess tone, historical framing and alignment with American ideals.” He issued an executive order requiring that all future federal buildings eschew modernist architecture. He called in the National Guard to control Washington’s crime, and now its members, some with little to do, are spreading mulch in parks downtown.

He has returned to earlier threats to investigate or exert control over television networks. After crowing over the cancellation of “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” whose host is an ardent critic, Mr. Trump vowed to investigate NBC over extending the contract of the late-night host Seth Meyers. (His contract was extended before Mr. Trump took office for the second time.)

Golf buddies have also been given the benefit of the presidential bullhorn. Mr. Trump has demanded that Roger Clemens, the former major-league pitcher whose career was overshadowed by steroid suspicions, be elected to the Hall of Fame, “NOW.” (Mr. Clemens played golf with the president recently.)

Turn off the television and he’ll turn up at your college football game talking about transgender people in sports. Try to do some doomscrolling on Instagram and there’s Sydney Sweeney, she of the “Good jeans” American Eagle ad. Mr. Trump proudly claimed recently that she is a registered Republican with the “HOTTEST” commercial going. Mute social media and he’ll be onstage at the Kennedy Center, praising the physique of Sylvester Stallone.

Steven Levitsky, a professor of government at Harvard who studies authoritarianism and threats to democracies, said that Mr. Trump’s impulses have led to unprecedented attacks on American institutions, and that the early months of his term appear to have emboldened him.

“We have a lot of muscle in American society,” Mr. Levitsky said. “It’s a very wealthy society and a lot of highly skilled lawyers, and it is well organized. The United States has the raw materials to push back. It’s just not doing it.”

Mr. Levitsky predicted that Americans might be finding the cultural overreach into their homes and televisions and social media accounts “annoying.” But he said there was little to stop the president from continuing his disruptive cultural campaign.

Mr. Trump’s criticisms and demands have evolved since he was a pop culture obsessive who lived on Twitter to comment on the news of the day. When he entered the White House, he used the presidential bully pulpit to attack a dizzying range of critics, from celebrities to former members of his first presidential administration.

In some cases, the line between his political opponents living under mere threat of retaliation and those actually facing it is growing thinner.

A number of former Trump administration officials whom Mr. Trump has considered insufficiently loyal have had their Secret Service details pulled, including Mike Pompeo, the former secretary of state, and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the former government scientist. They are part of a growing list of Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris, who’ve also had their details revoked.

A number of other perceived enemies of Mr. Trump are facing investigations, including Lisa Cook, a Fed governor the president has accused of mortgage fraud. (She has not been charged with a crime.)

Others have been threatened without evidence, including former President Barack Obama, whom Mr. Trump has accused of undermining his 2016 presidential campaign. Mr. Obama’s office called those claims a “weak attempt at distraction.”

Even his old pop-culture Twitter foils have faced increasingly dark threats. Rosie O’Donnell, a longtime and very vocal Trump critic, is now living in Ireland. Mr. Trump has mused about revoking her American citizenship, which is unconstitutional.

One former target who got off relatively easy was Taylor Swift, the pop star who recently announced her engagement to Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs. Ms. Swift did not endorse Mr. Trump, and he has attacked her before. This week, in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Mr. Trump magnanimously offered her good luck with her engagement. But not before pointedly wishing Mr. Kelce good luck.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/08/31/multimedia/31trump-1215-twgz/31trump-1215-twgz-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 12:56:41.032615

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.","Congressional Republicans scored a massive victory this summer when they passed President Donald Trump's ""big beautiful bill"" of tax and spending cuts without a single Democratic vote. But as they return to Washington this fall after a monthlong August recess, they will have to find a way to work with Democrats — or around them — as a government shutdown looms.

The annual spending battle will dominate the September agenda, along with a possible effort by Senate Republicans to change their chamber's rules to thwart Democratic stalling tactics on nominations. The Senate is also debating whether to move forward on legislation that would slap steep tariffs on some of Russia’s trading partners as the U.S. pressures Russian President Vladimir Putin on Ukraine.

In the House, Republicans will continue their investigations of former President Joe Biden while Speaker Mike Johnson navigates a split in his conference over whether the Trump administration should release more files in the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.

A look at what Congress will be doing as lawmakers return from the August break:

The most urgent task for Congress is to avoid a government shutdown on Sept. 30, when federal funding runs out. And it’s so far unclear if Republicans and Democrats will be able to agree on how to do that.

Congress will have to pass a short-term spending measure to keep the government funded for a few weeks or months while they try to finish the full-year package. But Republicans will need Democratic votes to pass an extension, and Democrats will want significant concessions. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer's vote with Republicans to avoid a shutdown in March prompted furious backlash within his party.

The Trump administration's efforts to claw back previously approved spending could also complicate the negotiations. Republicans passed legislation this summer that rescinded about $9 billion in foreign aid and public broadcasting funds and Trump notified Congress again on Friday that he will block $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid.

Democrats have warned that such efforts could tank the broader negotiations. “Trump is rooting for a shutdown,” Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., posted on social media Friday.

Senators are expected to return to Washington right where they left off in early August — fighting over Trump's nominees.

Exasperated Republicans fled Washington for the month after making little headway with Senate Democrats over their nominations blockade, which has forced delays in confirmations and angered Trump as many of his administration's positions remain unfilled. Republican leaders called it quits after a rare Saturday session that ended with a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations and Trump posting on social media that Chuck Schumer could ""GO TO HELL!""

Republicans now say they’re ready to try and change Senate rules to get around the Democratic delays, and they are expected to spend the next several weeks discussing how that might work.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Trump's closest congressional allies, has pushed the president for months to support his sweeping bipartisan sanctions bill that would impose steep tariffs on countries that are fueling Russia's invasion of Ukraine by buying its oil, gas, uranium, and other exports. The legislation has the backing of 85 senators, but Trump has yet to endorse it, and Republican leaders have so far said they won't move without him.

Graham has stepped up his calls after Trump met with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy last month in hopes of a peace deal. Since then, Russia has continued to step up attacks on Ukraine.

""If we don't have this thing moving in the right direction by the time we get back, then I think that plan B needs to kick in,"" Graham said of his bill in an interview with The Associated Press last month.

Health and Human Service Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will appear before the Senate Finance Committee to discuss his health care agenda on Thursday, less than a week after he ousted Susan Monarez as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Several other top officials also resigned in protest.

Kennedy has tried to advance anti-vaccine policies that are contradicted by decades of scientific research. Monarez's lawyers said she refused ""to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.""

Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, the Republican chairman of the HELP panel that oversees the CDC and a member of the Finance Committee, has called on the CDC to delay a meeting of outside experts who make recommendations on the use of vaccines until Congress can look into the issue.

The House left Washington in July amid disagreements among Republicans about whether they should force President Donald Trump's administration to release more information on the sex trafficking investigation into the late Jeffrey Epstein. The pressure for more disclosure could only get more intense when lawmakers return.

Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are pushing the House to take up their bill to force the Department of Justice to publicly release its investigation. They are planning a news conference this week joined by Epstein victims. The House Oversight Committee is also investigating the issue.

Democrats are eager to keep pressing on the Epstein files, especially after the Trump administration reneged on pledges for transparency. The case for years has been the subject of online conspiracy theories and speculation about who may have been involved or aware of the wealthy financier’s abuse.

The House Oversight Committee will return from August recess with a slate of interviews lined up as part of its investigation into former President Joe Biden's mental state while in office. The committee has already conducted interviews and depositions with nearly a dozen former top Biden aides and members of the president's inner circle.

The Republican-led committee will hear from former top Biden staffers in September like Jeff Zients, Biden’s final White House chief of staff, Karine Jean-Pierre, the former White House press secretary, and Andrew Bates, a top press aide.

Oversight Chair James Comer, R-Ky., has said public hearings and a full report can be expected sometime in the fall.

Congress has discussed proposals for years to keep lawmakers from engaging in trading individual stocks, nodding to the idea that there’s a potential conflict of interest when they are often privy to information and decisions that can dramatically move markets.

That push is now gaining momentum. A Senate committee has approved legislation from GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri that would also extend the prohibition on stock trading to future presidents and vice presidents — while notably exempting Trump. In the House, several members are putting forward proposals and even threatening to maneuver around GOP leadership to force a vote.

Still, there is plenty of resistance to the idea, including from many wealthy lawmakers who reap dividends from their portfolios.

Asked which of Cottrell’s criticisms were wrong, Tice replied: “All of it’s wrong.” He said: “I enjoy the church, I believe in God.
But the role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies.” Farage’s new asylum policy involves deporting asylum seekers who cross the Channel, even to countries such as Afghanistan and Eritrea.
The party has struggled to answer detailed questions about how the policy would work and how much it would cost.
Asked on Sunday whether its role would be simply to act as observers while small boats continued to cross, Tice replied: “Yes.","Reform UK has engaged in a war of words with the Church of England over the party’s plans to deport all asylum seekers who arrive in small boats, after the church’s most senior bishop called the proposal “isolationist, short-term [and] kneejerk”.

Richard Tice, the party’s deputy leader, hit back against the archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, on Sunday, accusing him of interfering in domestic politics.

This week Nigel Farage, Reform’s leader, announced the party’s migration policy, under which Britain would leave the European convention on human rights (ECHR) and deport people who arrive or have recently arrived by small boat from France.

Cottrell told Sky News’s Trevor Phillips: “We should actively resist the kind of isolationist, short-term, kneejerk – in this case, ‘send them home’. Mr Farage is saying the things he’s saying but he is not offering any long-term solution to the big issues which are convulsing our world, which lead to this.”

Responding on the same show, Tice rejected the criticism and urged the bishop, who is the acting head of the church while it searches for a new archbishop of Canterbury, to stay out of migration policy.

Asked which of Cottrell’s criticisms were wrong, Tice replied: “All of it’s wrong.”

He said: “I enjoy the church, I believe in God. But the role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies.”

Farage’s new asylum policy involves deporting asylum seekers who cross the Channel, even to countries such as Afghanistan and Eritrea. To do so, Reform is promising to take Britain out of the ECHR, the 1951 refugee convention, the UN convention against torture and the Council of Europe anti-trafficking convention.

A Reform government would then send teams of immigration officials into communities across the country to find people who have settled here after arriving as irregular migrants and deport them as well.

The party has struggled to answer detailed questions about how the policy would work and how much it would cost. Farage initially said women and children would be detained and deported as well as men, but a day later he appeared to row back on that, suggesting doing so was not “part of our plan”.

Asked by the Guardian why he had costed the proposals at £10bn when a thinktank had priced a similar plan by his former colleague Rupert Lowe at £47.5bn, Farage responded: “Zia [Yusuf, the senior Reform official] is very good at maths.”

Reform has also talked about deploying the navy to help it enforce its migration plans. Asked on Sunday whether its role would be simply to act as observers while small boats continued to cross, Tice replied: “Yes. In a sense, that’s what the Border Force are currently.”

Reform is looking to keep the pressure on the government to close asylum hotels even after a court ruled that ministers could continue to use the Bell hotel in Epping to house people whose claims had not yet been processed.

Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, said on Sunday that the government would look to close hotels in an “orderly” way by the end of the parliament. “We can’t end up with hundreds of people just out on the street because a hotel has closed,” she said.

Separately, she appeared to put pressure on the prime minister and the chancellor to end the two-child benefit cap, which Cottrell warned was driving up child poverty.

“I’m ashamed of the very high numbers of children growing up in poverty that we see in our country,” she said, adding that bringing that level down was “what I came into politics to do”.

Asked specifically about the benefit cap, she said: “It’s not the only way we can lift children out of poverty, and of course, it does come with a big price tag. But we know that not acting also comes with serious consequences and impact too.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da5d3f4b8946d88d37ce3c9d06de08c75429d982/344_0_3440_2752/master/3440.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=448b1eac92128287a4b09f7d37a802b3",N,,2025-08-31 11:56:32.406509

It comes after party leader Nigel Farage announced Reform's flagship immigration plan during a flashy news conference held at an aircraft hangar in Oxford on Tuesday.

The party pledged to deport anybody who comes to the UK illegally, regardless of whether they might come to harm, and said it would pay countries with questionable human rights records - such as Afghanistan - to take people back.

It also said it would leave numerous international agreements, and revoke the Human Rights Act, in order to do this.

The policy was criticised by the Conservatives, who said Mr Farage was ""copying our homework"", while parties such as the Liberal Democrats and the Greens condemned it.

But the plan came under fire from an altogether different angle on Saturday, when the Archbishop of York accused it of being an ""isolationist, short-term kneejerk"" approach, with no ""long-term solutions"".

Mr Cottrell told the same Sky News programme he had ""every sympathy"" with those who find the issue of immigration tricky. But he said Reform UK's plan did ""nothing to address the issue of what brings people to this country"", and would in fact, make ""the problem worse"".

On Sunday, Mr Tice responded to the archbishop's criticisms, saying that ""all of it is wrong"".

The MP for Boston and Skegness said he was a Christian who ""enjoys"" the church - but that the ""role of the archbishop is not actually to interfere with international migration policies"".

Mr Tice then turned his fire on the government, accusing ministers of being ""more interested in protecting the rights of people who've come here illegally... than looking after the rights of British citizens"".

He accused ministers of having ""abandoned"" their duty of ""looking after the interests of British citizens"".

Mr Tice reaffirmed his party's policy that the UK should leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), calling it a ""70-year-old, out-of-date, unfit-for-purpose agreement"".

The Reform UK deputy leader also:

• Defended plans to pay the Taliban to take migrants back, comparing it to doing business deals with ""people you don't like""

• Said the Royal Navy should be deployed in the English Channel as a ""deterrent"", but added: ""We're not saying sink the boats""

• Urged the government to call an early general election

Meanwhile, Bridget Phillipson, the education secretary, told Sky News that Reform ""want to provoke anger, but they don't actually want to solve the problems that we face in front of us"".

She told Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips the UK had a ""proud tradition [of] supporting those facing persecution"".

But she added: ""We will make sure that people who have no right to be in this country are removed from this country. That's right. It's what people expect. It's what this government will deliver.""

Ms Phillipson also insisted there ""needs to be reform of the ECHR"" and said the home secretary is ""looking at the article eight provisions"", which cover the right to a private and family life, to see ""whether they need updating and reforming for the modern age"".

However, she refused to say what the government would do if it is found that the ECHR is unreformable. Instead, she defended Labour's position of staying in the governance of the convention, saying that honouring the ""rule of law"" is important.

She added: ""Our standing in the world matters if we want to strike trade deals with countries. We need to be a country that's taken seriously. We need to be a country that honours our obligations and honours the rule of law.""

Ms Phillipson was also drawn on the recent court ruling in favour of the Home Office, which overturned an injunction banning The Bell Hotel in Epping from housing asylum seekers.

Challenged on whether the government is prioritising the rights of asylum seekers over British citizens, she said it ""is about a balance of rights"".

The cabinet minister also repeated the government's plans to end the use of hotels to house asylum seekers by 2029.

Shadow Cabinet Office minister Alex Burghart said the Conservatives would be willing to leave the ECHR - if this route is recommended to them.

The Tories have asked a senior judge to look into the ""legal intricacies"" of leaving the convention, which he said is ""not straightforward"". He said when the party receives that report, it will then make a decision.

Sundance, Inc., 596 U.S. 411 (2022) Eliminated the extra arbitration-specific requirement that a party opposing arbitration must show prejudice; arbitration contracts must be treated like other contracts.
Filing a merits motion to dismiss with prejudice before invoking arbitration presumptively constitutes FAA “default.” No prejudice requirement: After Morgan, a plaintiff need not show prejudice.
State–federal division of labor: Even where contracts choose state law, the FAA’s procedural “default” rule controls federal court enforcement.
State arbitration law vs. FAA: State law can set substantive contract rules (e.g., what counts as a waiver under state contract law).
Key Takeaways Merits motions before arbitration = FAA “default.” No prejudice showing required post–Morgan.","Introduction

This published decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit clarifies and sharpens the law governing when a litigant loses the ability to enforce an arbitration agreement by litigating in court. In Valerie Kloosterman v. Metropolitan Hospital, No. 24-1398 (6th Cir. Aug. 27, 2025), the court held that a defendant who first seeks “an immediate and total victory” on the merits—via a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal with prejudice—and only later moves to compel arbitration is in “default in proceeding with such arbitration” within the meaning of Section 3 of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA). That default bars both a stay under Section 3 and an order compelling arbitration under Section 4.

The parties are a long-serving physician assistant, Valerie Kloosterman, and Metropolitan Hospital (University of Michigan Health-West) and several of its officials. After the district court partially denied defendants’ motions to dismiss Kloosterman’s First Amendment and Title VII claims, defendants—for the first time, after a year of litigation—moved to compel arbitration based on an employment agreement. The district court granted the motion. The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that defendants’ litigation tactics extinguished their FAA right to arbitrate.

Beyond deciding this case, the court set a clear, administrable rule: a merits-based motion to dismiss with prejudice, pursued before raising arbitration, is conduct “completely inconsistent” with reliance on an arbitration agreement and places the movant in FAA “default.” The opinion also harmonizes post–Morgan v. Sundance doctrine in the Sixth Circuit, connects Section 3’s “default” to Section 4, and addresses the relationship between federal procedural rules under the FAA and state arbitration law.

Summary of the Judgment

The Sixth Circuit reversed the district court’s order compelling arbitration and dismissing the case.

Holding: Defendants lost their right to arbitrate under the FAA because they litigated on the merits for a year—twice moving to dismiss all claims with prejudice and opposing an amendment as “futile”—before invoking arbitration. That conduct put them in “default in proceeding with such arbitration” under 9 U.S.C. § 3.

The court clarified that the same “default” limitation applies whether a party seeks a stay under Section 3 or an order compelling arbitration under Section 4; litigants cannot avoid Section 3’s default by styling the request under Section 4.

Prejudice is not required (post–Morgan v. Sundance), and the defendants’ conduct here was “entirely inconsistent” with arbitration.

The court rejected the argument that Michigan’s arbitration statute displaced the FAA’s procedural “default” rule in federal court; state law may govern substantive contract waiver, but the FAA governs procedural enforcement in federal court.

The case is remanded for litigation to proceed in district court.

Analysis

Precedents Cited and Their Influence

9 U.S.C. §§ 3–4 (Federal Arbitration Act)

Section 3 directs courts to stay cases pending arbitration, “providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.” The panel grounds its rule in the statutory word “default” and its ordinary legal meaning.

Section 4 permits courts to compel arbitration. Drawing on longstanding doctrine, the court holds the same procedural limits—including “default”—apply to both §§ 3 and 4, preventing an end-run by labeling.

Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., 596 U.S. 411 (2022)

Eliminated the extra arbitration-specific requirement that a party opposing arbitration must show prejudice; arbitration contracts must be treated like other contracts. The Sixth Circuit accordingly jettisons the prejudice prong and focuses on inconsistency with an intent to arbitrate.

Schwebke v. United Wholesale Mortg. LLC, 96 F.4th 971 (6th Cir. 2024)

Recognized Morgan’s removal of the prejudice requirement; left open labels (waiver/forfeiture). The panel here again avoids labels but applies the inconsistency/default standard.

Solo v. UPS, 947 F.3d 968 (6th Cir. 2020)

Anchors the “entirely inconsistent” conduct test. Moving to dismiss on the merits before invoking arbitration is paradigmatically inconsistent—defendants cannot “play heads I win, tails you lose.” The panel relies heavily on this logic.

American Locomotive Co. v. Chemical Research Corp., 171 F.2d 115 (6th Cir. 1948) and American Locomotive Co. v. Gyro Process Co., 185 F.2d 316 (6th Cir. 1950)

Early Sixth Circuit authority finding parties in § 3 “default” by litigating for years; also applying the same default analysis to deny relief under § 4. The panel uses these cases to reinforce that Sections 3 and 4 rise and fall together on “default.”

Smith v. Spizzirri, 601 U.S. 472 (2024)

Held that if a party requests a stay under § 3, the district court must stay (not dismiss). The panel notes neither party requested a stay here and underscores correct procedural posture for future cases.

Other circuits aligning with the “no wait-and-see” rule:

Third Circuit: White v. Samsung Elecs. Am., Inc., 61 F.4th 334 (3d Cir. 2023) – losing on early motions then pivoting to arbitration forfeits the right.

Seventh Circuit: Smith v. GC Servs. Ltd. P’ship, 907 F.3d 495 (7th Cir. 2018) – similar “erase the loss” concerns; merits motions then arbitration barred.

Eighth Circuit: Parker v. Kearney Sch. Dist., 130 F.4th 649 (8th Cir. 2025) – unsuccessful merits motions followed by belated arbitration request triggers loss of the right.

Distinguishing contrary authorities:

Rush v. Oppenheimer (2d Cir. 1985): Mixed arbitrable/nonarbitrable claims can justify limited merits motions. Not applicable where all claims are said to be arbitrable, as here.

ABF Freight Sys., Inc. v. IBT (8th Cir. 2013): Jurisdictional (non-merits) dismissal without prejudice is not inconsistent with arbitration.

Williams v. Cigna Fin. Advisors (5th Cir. 1995): Claimed late discovery of the clause. Sixth Circuit notes its own cases do not excuse untimeliness based on a bare mistake, and a party cannot be ignorant of its own contract.

Erie/choice-of-law scaffolding:

Arthur Andersen LLP v. Carlisle, 556 U.S. 624 (2009): State contract law governs who can enforce an arbitration clause; supports the opinion’s division between state substantive contract principles and federal procedural enforcement under the FAA.

Gasperini, 518 U.S. 415 (1996) and Shady Grove, 559 U.S. 393 (2010): Federal courts apply state substantive law and federal procedural law; the FAA’s procedural default rule applies in federal court even when a contract adopts state substantive law.

Legal Reasoning

The panel places the analysis squarely within the text of the FAA: a court may stay litigation “providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration” (9 U.S.C. § 3). “Default” is given its ordinary legal meaning—failing to live up to a duty or promise through neglect or otherwise. A party that affirmatively seeks a merits judgment in court—particularly a dismissal with prejudice—is not “proceeding with such arbitration.” It is renouncing it. That conduct is “completely inconsistent” with any intent to arbitrate.

The court reasons further that the same “default” limitation governs motions to compel under § 4, relying on historic practice and Supreme Court guidance that §§ 3 and 4 share procedural guardrails. Otherwise, litigants could circumvent § 3’s limitation simply by avoiding the word “stay.”

The Sixth Circuit applies its pre-Morgan “inconsistency” prong, stripped of the now-defunct prejudice requirement. Two features made the inconsistency unmistakable here:

Defendants twice moved to dismiss all claims “with prejudice,” which would foreclose arbitration entirely.

Defendants only sought arbitration after the district court ruled against them in part—i.e., after a “sneak peek” at the case’s prospects in court.

Other conduct—participating in discovery planning and choosing a discovery plan—reinforced the conclusion that the hospital elected a judicial forum. By contrast, the court emphasized that purely jurisdictional motions (e.g., lack of subject-matter jurisdiction) do not necessarily conflict with arbitration because they do not seek a merits resolution “that resolves the dispute.”

On choice-of-law, the court rejects the argument that Michigan’s arbitration statute displaces the FAA’s “default” rule in federal court. Even if state law defines substantive waiver of contract rights, the FAA governs the procedural entitlement to federal relief (stay or compel) and imposes the “default” limit. The hospital had, moreover, invoked § 4 of the FAA in the district court, confirming the applicability of federal procedures.

The court also corrects the procedural vehicle: a “motion for summary judgment to compel arbitration” is a misnomer. Although summary-judgment standards can govern factual disputes about formation or scope of an arbitration agreement, the correct mechanism is a § 3 motion to stay or a § 4 motion to compel, not a merits judgment.

Impact

This decision has immediate and practical consequences for arbitration practice in the Sixth Circuit and persuasive force beyond:

Bright-line guidance on timing: Parties who wish to arbitrate must say so early and unequivocally. Filing a merits motion to dismiss with prejudice before invoking arbitration presumptively constitutes FAA “default.”

No prejudice requirement: After Morgan, a plaintiff need not show prejudice. The focus is on the defendant’s inconsistency with arbitration.

One rule for §§ 3 and 4: Litigants cannot avoid § 3’s default limit by moving to compel under § 4. If you are in default, you cannot compel either.

Procedural posture matters:

Do: Move to stay under § 3, expressly requesting a stay (post–Spizzirri, courts must stay if requested).

Do: Limit early motions to threshold jurisdictional issues if necessary; avoid merits determinations.

Don’t: Seek a merits dismissal with prejudice and then pivot to arbitration after an adverse ruling.

State–federal division of labor: Even where contracts choose state law, the FAA’s procedural “default” rule controls federal court enforcement. State law may still supply independent grounds for a substantive contract waiver, but it cannot dilute § 3’s default standard.

Employee–employer disputes: Plaintiffs gain protection against “wait-and-see” arbitration tactics; employers must audit and assert arbitration rights at the outset or risk losing them.

Circuit alignment: The Sixth Circuit’s approach aligns with other circuits rejecting strategic “heads I win, tails you arbitrate” behavior, enhancing national uniformity.

Complex Concepts Simplified

Default (FAA § 3): A statutory limit. If a party behaves inconsistently with arbitration—e.g., tries to win a merits dismissal in court before invoking arbitration—it is in “default” and cannot obtain a stay or an order compelling arbitration.

Waiver vs. forfeiture:

Waiver typically means an intentional giving up of a known right (often governed by the substantive law creating the right, like state contract law for arbitration clauses).

Forfeiture is a failure to assert a right in a timely way (often governed by procedural rules). The majority avoids choosing labels; the concurrences explore the taxonomy.

Practical point: Labels aside, under the FAA’s “default,” intent is not required; inconsistent litigation conduct can be enough.

With prejudice vs. without prejudice:

A dismissal with prejudice is a merits judgment that ends the dispute and forecloses arbitration.

A dismissal without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction is not a merits decision and may be compatible with preserving arbitration rights.

Sections 3 and 4 work together:

§ 3: Stay of litigation pending arbitration—available only if the movant is not in “default.”

§ 4: Order compelling arbitration—subject to the same “default” limitation.

Morgan v. Sundance effect: Courts cannot add arbitration-specific hurdles (like prejudice). Arbitration agreements are treated like any other contract in assessing abandonment of rights.

State arbitration law vs. FAA:

State law can set substantive contract rules (e.g., what counts as a waiver under state contract law).

The FAA supplies the federal procedural conditions for federal relief (stay/compel), including the “default” bar.

Additional Observations and Practice Pointers

Preserve arbitration early: Assert the arbitration clause in the first responsive filing and move promptly under § 3 (and/or § 4). Request a stay explicitly to trigger Spizzirri’s mandatory-stay rule.

Avoid merits-first strategy: Do not file Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss with prejudice while holding arbitration in reserve. That is the conduct this opinion condemns as “default.”

Jurisdictional motions are different: Motions that do not seek a merits resolution (e.g., lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction) are less likely to be inconsistent with arbitration.

Mixed claims? Proceed carefully: Where some claims are concededly non-arbitrable, limited merits motions may be compatible with preserving arbitration on others; clarity and early invocation remain critical.

Don’t rely on “we didn’t know”: The Sixth Circuit is skeptical that ignorance excuses delay—especially where the movant drafted the agreement.

Procedural form matters: File the right motion. A “summary judgment to compel arbitration” is a category error. Use § 3 (stay) and/or § 4 (compel). Apply summary-judgment standards only to resolve formation/scope fact disputes, not to obtain a merits judgment.

What the Decision Does Not Decide

The underlying merits of Kloosterman’s First Amendment and Title VII claims were not before the court; the appeal solely concerned arbitrability and timing.

Whether, as a matter of state contract law, defendants also waived arbitration was unnecessary to resolve; the court found federal FAA “default” sufficient to reverse.

Whether a genuine lack of knowledge of an arbitration clause might ever excuse delay (the court noted no such claim here and has been skeptical of “mistake” arguments).

Concurrences: Refining the Waiver–Forfeiture Landscape

Judge Murphy (concurring):

Proposes a clarifying framework: parties may both waive their substantive right to arbitrate under state contract law and forfeit that right under the FAA’s federal procedural “default” rule.

Suggests our past “waiver” cases are better read as applying a federal forfeiture rule grounded in § 3’s “default.”

Judge Bloomekatz (concurring):

Warns that waiver/forfeiture distinctions are context-dependent and not always cleanly separable; procedural rules sometimes define waiver, and some doctrines resist forfeiture.

Endorses resolving FAA cases by focusing on the statute’s text—“default”—rather than choosing between waiver or forfeiture labels.

Conclusion

The Sixth Circuit’s opinion establishes a crisp, predictable rule: a defendant who first pursues a merits win in court and only then invokes arbitration has defaulted under the FAA and cannot compel or stay litigation in favor of arbitration. The decision integrates Morgan v. Sundance by excising any prejudice requirement, aligns Sections 3 and 4 under a single “default” standard, and respects Erie principles by reserving substantive contract waiver to state law while enforcing federal procedural “default” in federal court.

Practically, the case will force parties to put their arbitration cards on the table at the outset. It inhibits strategic, “wait-and-see” tactics and promotes the FAA’s core policy of enforcing arbitration agreements as written—without elevating arbitration above other contracts. For counsel, the message is straightforward: if you truly want arbitration, act like it from day one.

Key Takeaways

Merits motions before arbitration = FAA “default.”

No prejudice showing required post–Morgan.

“Default” bars relief under both FAA §§ 3 and 4.

Request a stay explicitly; do not move for “summary judgment to compel.”

Jurisdictional motions may be compatible; merits dismissals with prejudice are not.

CNN reports that the U.S. administration plans to return hundreds of unaccompanied minors from Guatemala who arrived in the United States, in coordination with the government of Guatemala.

Early Sunday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the removal of Guatemalan minors who are in the United States under guardianship, but according to an immigration attorney representing the children removed from custody after the court ruling, the plans remained in effect.

The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) said that Guatemala “requested the return of certain unaccompanied foreign minors who are in federal custody for the purpose of reunification with their respective family members,” according to CNN.

Children of various ages are told that in the United States there may not be one of their parents, though there may be a relative, and they have a father or legal guardian in Guatemala. The criteria also include children who have no asylum cases and should not be victims of trafficking after return, according to the report.

But lawyers representing some of the children say that those identified are at risk if they are returned to Guatemala, and are in prolonged immigration proceedings.

In a lawsuit filed earlier on Sunday in the District Court for the District of Columbia, ten Guatemalan minors aged 10 to 17 were identified for removal; the majority of them are in immigration proceedings.

One of the children, a 10-year-old indigenous girl, suffered abuse and neglect at the hands of other guardians in Guatemala. Her mother died.

Judge Sparkle L. Sukkananan ordered the U.S. government not to remove any of the plaintiffs for two weeks and scheduled a hearing for Sunday afternoon.

An immigration attorney representing several Guatemalan children told CNN that the children were “scared and bewildered” by what is happening.

Reaction to the explanation of what is happening is disbelief. They are very frightened. All say they fear returning to Guatemala for various reasons. They were literally woken from their beds in the middle of the night, on holiday weekends.

Additional Details of the Process and Readiness to Travel

On Saturday night, ORR also informed shelters caring for unaccompanied migrant minors that the children had been identified “for reunification with their parents and/or legal guardians” in their country of origin, and they should be ready for discharge within two hours, or four hours if the child is in a family‑care program, after receiving the notice.

Children must be ready for the trip, including having the proper documents, medications, personal belongings, and two pre-packed lunch packs.

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit filed in the District of Columbia are ten Guatemalan minors aged 10 to 17 who were identified for removal; most of them are in immigration proceedings.

The two men, who were government contractors working at the fire, were detained after federal agents flagged them while verifying the identities of the members of the wildland firefighter crew. DHS alleges that both men were in the country illegally and that one had a prior order of removal.

U.S Representative Emily Randall, of Washington's Sixth District, stated that on Saturday, during an unannounced visit to the Northwest ICE Processing Center (NWIPC) in Tacoma, she was denied entry, despite having legal protections to do so.

“I cited the statute multiple times to make sure that they understood they were breaking the law, and they said, 'Well, your previous visits have not been on a weekend.'”

Randall says she had been to the NWIPC three times in 2025, with two of those visits being pre-planned and one of them being unannounced. Each of those times, she was allowed entry.

The statute she is referencing is . It reads in part:

""SEC. 527. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of Homeland Security by this Act may be used to prevent any of the following persons from entering, for the purpose of conducting oversight, any facility operated by or for the Department of Homeland Security used to detain or otherwise house aliens...""

In addition to:

""(b) Nothing in this section may be construed to require a Member of Congress to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility described in subsection (a) for the purpose of conducting oversight.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin responded with the following statement, in regards to our questions about why Rep. Randall was not allowed entry on Saturday:

“Here are the facts. As ICE law enforcement have seen a surge in assaults, disruptions, and obstructions to enforcement — including by Members of Congress themselves — any requests to tour processing centers and field offices must be approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security. These requests must be part of legitimate congressional oversight activities. ICE officers have seen an 830% surge in assaults.

“As for visits to detention facilities, requests should be made with sufficient time to prevent interference with the President’s Article II authority to oversee executive department functions—a week is sufficient to ensure no intrusion on the President’s constitutional authority. To protect the President’s Article II authority, any request to shorten that time must be approved by the Secretary.”

Despite not gaining entry, Randall still wanted to make her position known about what she believed was wrongful detention.

""To arrest individuals and waylay folks for 3 hours or more, who are involved in fuel management, involved in the great machine of fighting this wildland fire, is disgusting.”

In an on Friday, DHS claimed that the two men ""were not even assigned to actively fight the fire; [but rather] they were there in a support role, cutting logs into firewood.""

Randall pushed back on this notion, saying that having been to the wildfire zone herself, she knows how important the mitigation of fuels is towards the containment effort.

""It's a lot of fuel management, a lot of trying to keep the wood from becoming fire fuel, and it takes a lot of bodies to do that work,"" said Randall.

In the meantime, Randall says many questions remain from her and her congressional colleagues about DHS, U.S Customs and Border Protection, as well as the Bureau of Land Management, about their operation, particularly due to a 2021 DHS policy, which restricted immigration enforcement within disaster response zones.

“We have asked Secretary Noem if they have made any policy changes related to that.""

It's one of numerous answers that Randall and others are looking for from those three agencies, prompting her and dozens more to draft a congressional letter to the heads of those three agencies on Friday.

SA premier says state 'celebrates' multiculturalism

When asked about the march at an unrelated press conference earlier this morning, South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas said he believed it represented a “minority view .. that don’t represent what the overall majority of South Australians believe and know”:

“2.4 per cent of the South Australian population is Indigenous.

Kimberley Benjamin said the March for Australia rallies did not represent the town's values:

""Regardless of what was happening on the other side of the road, we were always going to turn up to make a stand for our community and what was happening in the big cities,"" she said.

""We've had lots of toots, lots of encouragement from the cars going past. Had a few people shout some things at us but that doesn't deter from what we're here to stand up for.""

Cheryl Mascall said despite the cancelled March for Australia event, she turned out to ""support love for the country and the flag"".

""Smaller turn out which is sad because I thought there'd be a lot more patriots.

""We're not racists or anything like that.

Police say 15,000 people protested in Adelaide

S

By Stacey Pestrin

Police estimate that 15,000 people took part in today’s demonstrations in Adelaide, which included the March for Australia rally and a counter-rally.

SA Police said in a statement that the crowds were “generally well-behaved”, but three people were arrested including a 23-year-old man for assaulting police and two 32-year-old men for “wearing articles of disguise” and failing to state personal details.

The Adelaide “March for Australia” rally included a march from Rundle Park to Parliament House then onto Peace Park in North Adelaide, where it ended following an altercation between protestors.

The altercation broke out after a member of the National Socialist Network took to the stage to call for an end to immigration.

Organisers attempted to take the megaphone, claiming the comments were racist, and a scuffle broke out before police stepped in.

Organisers told the ABC the National Socialist Network had not been invited to speak at the event.

Australia's peak community services body, the Australian Council of Social Service, has released a statement condemning racism, hate and discrimination, in light of the anti-immigration rallies that took place across Australia today.

""ACOSS respects the right to peaceful assembly but we reject in strongest terms all forms of racism, fascism, hate speech and bigotry,"" CEO Cassandra Goldie said.

""Australia's diversity is a great strength, not a threat, and today's rallies should not be a platform to divide communities or spread misinformation about migration and its impacts.

""There is no place in Australia for ideology that targets people because of who they are, where they come from or what they believe.

""Our priority is the safety and wellbeing of all people who feel intimidated, harmed or targeted by today's events. ACOSS extends our love and solidarity to all affected.""

Speaking in Canberra to March for Australia group, Senator Hanson said:

“I just want to say how proud I am to see so many Australians that are standing here today

""It takes me back to 30 years ago – 1996 – when I wore this flag.

“They tried to denigrate and have a go at me for being a proud Australian…to stand up for our Australian values and morals and who we are as a nation of people.”

A woman who attended Canberra’s march told the ABC:

""I'm in my 70s, and I cannot believe the way that laws are being passed in Australia .”

""I love Australia, and I just think Albanese has sold us out.

""We are no longer a free country, we’re becoming a socialist, communist country

""We’re pleading with the people of Australia to rise up…peacefully.""

By Natasha Harradine

A rally in Geraldton, WA's second-largest regional city, drew a crowd of around 100 people.

In addition to chants of ""Aussie Aussie Aussie, Oi Oi Oi"", speakers repeatedly referenced local police-officer-turned-sovereign-citizen Wayne Glew, who has had repeated run-ins with the City of Greater Geraldton and the WA government.

Other topics canvassed included the region's ongoing lack of housing, with speakers highlighting how supply was failing to meet increasing demand.

RCSO adopted the ""Warrant Service Officer"" model, which allows ICE-trained deputies to serve immigration-related warrants to inmates already in county custody. The agreement was signed Aug. 28, according to the ICE website. It also allows deputies access to ICE's database.

The move has caused some backlash with residents, who voiced concerns at a county public safety committee meeting, Monday.

“I'm concerned about the direction that all of this takes us, financially and as a community, towards a police state,” said resident Ann Rogers, during the meeting.

“The fact that I even have to be standing up here to remind you that it’s inhumane to tear families apart is insane,” said Rio Martinez, another resident. “That is not a Christian value.”

Sheriff Mike Fitzhugh responded to the criticism, saying the county has worked with ICE since 1996.

“We’ve been doing something with ICE since 1996,” Fitzhugh said. “We’re continuing with that today. We’re not changing anything. The only thing we’re changing is we’ll have access to a federal database.”

However, ICE’s public description of the 287(g) warrant service program states that certified local officers can serve administrative arrest warrants or detainers for immigration violations. ICE is expected to pick up the individual within 48 hours of their release, whether after posting bond or serving their sentence.

“If the detainer is served, then it’s up to ICE what they want to do with it,” Fitzhugh said.

But Fox 17 News is still working to confirm whether Rutherford County deputies will simply access ICE’s database under the agreement, or have deputies train to actively serve the warrants in jail. FOX 17 News has reached out to the sheriff’s office for clarification, but has not yet received a direct response.

Fitzhugh emphasized that deputies will not conduct immigration enforcement operations in the broader community.

“I don’t have deputies going out and enforcing immigration laws,” he said. “I vowed we’re not going to do that. I’m not going to sign a contract to do that.”

Still, under the agreement, Rutherford County deputies who complete the required ICE training and get certified, will be authorized to serve immigration violation warrants on individuals already in jail.

A sample memorandum of agreement for the Warrant Service Officer program on ICE's website also outlines additional steps particiapting local law enforcement agencies can take, like transporting the detainee into the custody of ICE, or holding people for longer periods of time, if needed. However, the final agreement between the RCSO and ICE has not yet been posted.

By AAMER MADHANI Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from carrying out speedy deportations of undocumented migrants detained in the interior of the United States.

The move is a setback for the President Donald Trump’s efforts to expand the use of the federal expedited removal statute to quickly remove some migrants in the country illegally without appearing before a judge first.

Trump promised to engineer a massive deportation operation during his 2024 campaign if voters returned him to the White House. And he set a goal of carrying out 1 million deportations a year in his second term.

But U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb suggested the administration’s expanded use of the expedited removal of migrants is trampling on individuals’ due process rights.

“In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them,” Cobb wrote in a 48-page opinion issued Friday night. “Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk.”

The Department of Homeland Security announced shortly after Trump came to office in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, the fast-track deportation of undocumented migrants who have been in the U.S. less than two years.

The effort has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups.

DHS in a statement said Cobb’s “ruling ignores the President’s clear authorities under both Article II of the Constitution and the plain language of federal law.” It said Trump “has a mandate to arrest and deport the worst of the worst” and that ”we have the law, facts, and common sense on our side.”

Before the administration’s push to expand such speedy deportations, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

Cobb, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, didn’t question the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute, or its application at the border.

“It merely holds that in applying the statute to a huge group of people living in the interior of the country who have not previously been subject to expedited removal, the Government must afford them due process,” she wrote.

She added that “prioritizing speed over all else will inevitably lead the Government to erroneously remove people via this truncated process.”

Cobb earlier this month agreed to temporarily block the administration’s efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under a process known as humanitarian parole. The ruling could benefit hundreds of thousands of people.

In that case the judge said Homeland Security exceeded its statutory authority in its effort to expand expedited removal for many immigrants. The judge said those immigrants are facing perils that outweigh any harm from “pressing pause” on the administration’s plans.

Since May, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have positioned themselves in hallways to arrest people after judges accept government requests to dismiss deportation cases. After the arrests, the government renews deportation proceedings but under fast-track authority.

Although fast-track deportations can be put on hold by filing an asylum claim, people may be unaware of that right and, even if they are, can be swiftly removed if they fail an initial screening.",https://vernonreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/cecot-el-salvador-prison-deportation.jpg,N,,2025-08-31 12:57:01.279668

The officials described the immigration crackdown as part of a larger effort to expand the federal law enforcement presence in major Democratic-run cities, as it did this summer in Los Angeles.
On Saturday, President Donald Trump commented about Chicago crime and Illinois Gov.

The mayor directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.”

When asked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably “taking orders,” Johnson replied: “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”

Johnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have adopted since the Trump administration took charge this year.

The federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Sept. 5 and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.

The officials described the immigration crackdown as part of a larger effort to expand the federal law enforcement presence in major Democratic-run cities, as it did this summer in Los Angeles.

On Saturday, President Donald Trump commented about Chicago crime and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on his Truth Social site: “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming! MAGA. President DJT”

Unlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, D.C., the Chicago operation is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration instead of being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime, the officials said.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with Trump ‘s mass deportation agenda.

Johnson’s order builds on the city’s longtime stance, saying neither Chicago nor Illinois officials have sought or been consulted on the federal presence and demanding Trump stand down on those plans.

Johnson had harsh words for Trump during his news conference, accusing the president of “behaving outside the bounds of the Constitution” and seeking a federal presence in blue cities as retribution against his political rivals.

“He is reckless and out of control,” Johnson said. “He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country.”

In response, the White House insisted the potential flood of federal agents was about “cracking down on crime.”

“If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in an email Saturday.

Just before signing the order, Johnson told journalists that he would have preferred to work with City Council to pass legislation, ""but unfortunately we do not have the luxury of time,"" given ""credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government.""

Asked about which specific reports he was referring to, the mayor just said that the deployment could occur as soon as Friday, so he had to take ""immediate, drastic action to protect our people from federal overreach.""

""We will protect our Constitution, we will protect our city, and we will protect our people,"" he declared. ""We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don't want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents. We don't want to see Chicagoans arrested for sitting on their porch. That's not who we are as a city, and that's not who we are as a nation.""

A spokesperson for the suburban Naval Station Great Lakes confirmed to Military Times earlier this week that the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has contacted the base about possibly using it for immigration enforcement activities.

The Chicago Sun-Times obtained an email in which the station's commanding officer, Navy Cpt. Stephen Yargosz, told his leadership team: ""These operations are similar to what occurred in Los Angeles earlier this summer. Same DHS team.""

According to the newspaper, Yargosz added in his Monday email that ""this morning I received a call that there is the potential also to support National Guard units. Not many details on this right now. Mainly a lot of concerns and questions.""

In addition to targeting California's largest city, Trump has recently federalized Washington, DC's police force and deployed the National Guard there—and he has threatened to similarly target other Democrat-led cities, despite their falling crime rates.

As the Sun-Times reported Saturday:

White House officials have distinctly said the operation in Chicago would mirror Los Angeles more than DC, which saw thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of active-duty Marines—some of whom are stationed there through November—activated to quell protests against immigration raids.

""If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the president, their communities would be much safer,"" wrote White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. ""[Democrats] should listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser who recently celebrated the Trump administration's success in driving down violent crime in Washington, DC.""

Johnson's order against Trump's ""tyranny"" states that the mayor demands the president ""and any agents acting under his authority stand down from any attempts to deploy the US armed forces—including the National Guard—in Chicago.""

""The city will pursue all available legal and legislative avenues to counter coordinated efforts from the federal government that violate the rights of the city and its residents, including the constitutional rights to peacefully assemble and protest, and the right to due process,"" the document warns.

The order also establishes the Protecting Chicago Initiative, which will include making information regarding residents' rights and federal government action available; coordinating efforts to identify and address community needs; and regularly submitting public records requests to DHS, including Immigration and Customs Enforcement as well as Customs and Border Protection.

The document states that the Chicago Police Department ""shall remain a locally controlled law enforcement agency"" under the authority of the city and the mayor, no CPD personnel shall participate in civil immigration enforcement, and all officers, ""when engaged in any law enforcement, crowd management, or public safety operations, will wear department-authorized uniforms.""

It further says that ""CPD officers are prohibited from intentionally disguising or concealing their identities from the public by wearing any mask, covering, or disguise while performing their official duties,"" and ""all other law enforcement officers, including federal agents, as well as members of the military operating in Chicago, are urged to adhere to these requirements to protect public safety and promote accountability.""

Under Trump, federal immigration officials have often donned masks—which has led to people targeted for arrest questioning whether they are encountering real agents, as well as criminals impersonating agents.

During Saturday's signing event, Johnson said that his office has communicated with Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, and the state's congressional delegation, and ""we are in complete alignment.""

The mayor's move won praise from the Chicago Teachers Union, which said in a statement that CTU ""stands in firm opposition to the president's threat to occupy our city with federal forces and terrorize our communities. As educators working and living in every one of Chicago's 77 neighborhoods, we know that safety does not come from federal forces invading our city. Real safety comes from the types of community investments that Mayor Johnson has made into public health, public education, summer youth jobs, affordable housing, small business development, and mental health care.""

Noting Trump's recent attacks on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the union said that ""if Trump wants to spend a million dollars a day in Chicago, he can send it for crossing guards to help our children move safely across this city, for Safe Passage to make sure that our children have a friendly face to see on their journey back and forth to home, for SNAP benefits to make sure our children have the nutrition they need to thrive and flourish, for special education and dual language supports for our students, and for healthcare so their families can afford the medicine and care they need.""

""The CTU applauds Mayor Johnson for taking steps to protect the rights of Chicagoans, and to not be conscripted into Trump's threatened occupation of our city,"" the union continued. ""We stand in solidarity with all of our fellow Chicagoans, as we say no to occupation and demand that our federal tax dollars be used to provide the services our communities actually need: healthcare, SNAP, and fully funded schools to our communities, not to send federal troops to terrorize them.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.png?id=61538502&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C79%2C0%2C79,N,,2025-08-31 09:57:02.662496

Since Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has grown into the largest police force in the country and it’s clear that future movements against policing will have to place organizing against ICE, borders, and citizenship at their core.

California officials sued Trump alleging he illegally federalized the state’s National Guard without the consent of Democratic Gov.","Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order Saturday designed to protect Chicagoans if President Donald Trump makes good on his threats to send the National Guard and a strike team of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to Chicago.

During a hastily scheduled event at City Hall, Johnson told reporters that the city had received credible reports that the federal government is planning to send hundreds of agents and perhaps National Guard troops or active-duty military forces to Chicago as early as this coming Friday.

“We do not want to see tanks in our streets,” Johnson said. “We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans. We don’t want to see homeless Chicagoans harassed or disappeared by federal agents. We don’t want to see Chicagoans arrested for sitting on their porch.”

Federal leaders have not informed Chicago officials that the president has authorized a deployment, Johnson said, calling the Trump administration “erratic,” impulsive” and “out of control.”

“We have not called for this,” Johnson said, flanked by members of his senior leadership team and members of the Chicago City Council. “Our people have not asked for this. But nevertheless, we find ourselves having to respond to this.”

Read the full executive order here.

A spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to Johnson’s action or statements.

The city will launch the “Protecting Chicago Initiative” in an effort to ensure that all Chicagoans know their rights and directs the Chicago Law Department to pursue all possible legal challenges to the president’s actions and respond to the violation of Chicagoans’ civil rights.

“We will use every single tool at our disposal, including the courts,” Johnson said, promising every part of Chicago government is ready to “stand up to tyranny.”

Johnson said the executive order he signed had two goals. The first is to make it clear that members of the Chicago Police Department will not assist the federal agents or National Guard troops sent to Chicago by the president.

The order also reaffirms the city’s Welcoming City ordinance, which prohibits all city employees from assisting federal immigration agents in nearly all cases, Johnson said.

“We will not have our officers who are working hard every single day to drive down crime deputized to do traffic stops and checkpoints for the president,” Johnson said.

The order also directs all Chicago police officers to wear their uniforms and refrain from wearing masks “so that residents can clearly distinguish them from federal agents,” Johnson said.

Federal immigration agents have frequently worn masks and refused to identify themselves during operations across the country.

Johnson and Gov. JB Pritzker have repeatedly said there is no need for Trump to deploy the National Guard to Chicago, dismissing the president’s pledges to combat crime as cover for an unconstitutional federal overreach.

Pritzker has also vowed to challenge any deployment in court.

If Trump makes good on the latest in a long series of threats against Chicago and its leaders, Chicago would join Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., and become the third American city to be occupied by federal troops deployed over the objections of local leaders.

All three cities are led by Democratic mayors who are Black and have refused to help carry out Trump’s goal of implementing the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”

Chicago and Los Angeles are also self-proclaimed sanctuary cities and have refused demands from federal officials that local law enforcement help federal agents deport undocumented immigrants. Trump ordered the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C., to cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers when the federal government took control of the department.

Attempts by the Trump administration to force cities like Chicago and Los Angeles to stop protecting undocumented immigrants by yanking federal funding have been blocked by several federal judges indefinitely.

California officials sued Trump alleging he illegally federalized the state’s National Guard without the consent of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in June after protests sparked by immigration raids swept Southern California.

The Trump Administration has argued Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13 and is therefore attempting to deport him again.
Abrego Garcia has denied the administration’s allegations.
The administration has now declared their intention to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, something U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ruled they cannot do.
On August 28, Virginia Senator Mark Warner visited Abrego Garcia at the facility to deliver letters from his family.","On Tuesday, August 26, ABC 8 News first reported Kilmar Abrego Garcia — whose wrongful deportation to El Salvador led to a national debate over the Trump Administration’s immigration policy — is being held at the Farmville Detention Center. In response, local activists have planned a vigil for 4 p.m. Sunday, August 31 at pHunkadelic, a local gathering space near the facility.

Abrego Garcia was originally deported from the United States to El Salvador in March 2025, which the Trump Administration initially called an “administrative error.” He was kept in a Salvadorean prison until June 6, when he was returned to the United States and kept in a Tennessee jail.

After being released and being reunited with his family in Maryland on August 22, he was detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on August 25 during a routine check-in. Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said there was “no reason” to take him into custody. “The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights,” he said.

The Trump Administration has argued Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13 and is therefore attempting to deport him again. That said, critics and advocates have argued the claim lacks evidence. Abrego Garcia has denied the administration’s allegations.

The administration has now declared their intention to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, something U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ruled they cannot do. On August 25, she ruled the Trump Administration is “absolutely forbidden to remove Abrego Garcia from the continental United States.”

As reported by The Rotunda in March 2024, the Farmville Detention Center has faced numerous accusations of human rights abuses from activists, immigration law centers and other advocacy groups. These include allegations of excessive force, medical negligence and the serving of spoiled and moldy food.

The facility has transferred ownership several times within the last several years. Initially owned by Immigration Centers of America, ownership of the facility was transferred to an affiliate organization, Abyon, LLC, with the same owners, according to FOIA documents obtained by the National Immigrant Justice Center.

While owned by Abyon, LCC, an inspection from ICE’s Office of Detention Oversight (OCO) found 19 violations of ICE detention standards. According to the compliance inspection report, 15 deficiencies/violations were found with the facility’s medical care.

In July, Tennessee-based company CoreCivic bought the facility from Abyon, LLC, for $67 million. Representative Don Beyer, a congressman from Northern Virginia who toured the facility in August, expressed hope in an exclusive interview with ABC 8 News that the ownership transfer could help improve conditions.

“I think CoreCivic taking over was one of the big steps in terms of bringing in a big company with many, many more resources to invest in the things because we want it to be safe for everyone,” Beyer said.

On August 28, Virginia Senator Mark Warner visited Abrego Garcia at the facility to deliver letters from his family. In a video statement posted to social media after the visit, Warner said, “I got a commitment from the private company that runs the facility that they’ll work with us on improving both some of the food and some of the health care [at the facility].”

Abrego Garcia’s detention has raised significant concerns over his constitutional right to due process, as well as treatment of him and other detainees in the Farmville Detention Facility. Activists, including local business owner Allison Crews, have planned a vigil for Sunday, August 31 at pHunkadelic — a local gathering space within walking distance of the Detention Center. The space is owned and operated by Crews.

Crews initially discovered Abrego Garcia had been transferred to the facility based on a tip from an acquaintance, whose name she did not disclose, before the ABC 8 News report at 9:22 a.m. “An acquaintance locally gave me a tip… and I had researched to see that it was true when they said his number was tracked to the facility,” Crews said.

Crews has been involved with protests and demonstrations over the summer against the Trump Administration. Asked about the administration’s shifting policy on immigration, Crews said, “They’re dismantling the foundational elements of our country and our freedoms that should be protected.”

She added, “I’ve been aware of it all along, but even more so in the past few months, just that there’s been more traffic going down the street [to the facility]… I would see a lot more out of state [license] plates, and that’s what got my attention to start asking questions at the county level.”

Ahead of the interview, The Rotunda contacted County Administrator Doug Stanley for his comment on the renewed attention to the Farmville Detention Center and asked if he had visited the facility since the transfer of the contract to Prince Edward County and the sale of the facility to CoreCivic.

In response, Stanley wrote, “We recognize the renewed attention and concern this situation has drawn to our community. The County is committed to transparency and will share any updates we are legally able to provide. While local officials have toured the facility multiple times, our ability to discuss those visits is limited under federal regulations and the Intergovernmental Service Agreement. We encourage anyone with questions about facility operations or conditions to contact the appropriate federal authorities.”

According to Crews and the flyer for the vigil, the “vibe” of the event will be “Love Thy Neighbor.” Crews said she considers herself a neighbor to those at the facility. “I go on the premise of wanting to be a good neighbor, and as a neighbor here, I just want to do what I can to help draw attention to it,” she said.

She also spoke on the support she has received from the community, which she said has been a “mixed bag.” However, Crews stressed the detention facility and Abrego Garcia’s detention impacts all parts of the community.

“I feel like if people are happy people are getting locked up… then they should be concerned with the county and how much money is being paid [to Prince Edward County]. And then there's the other folks like me who want to be compassionate and do what we can to cultivate wellness just in our community, and [the detainees] are a large part of our community, not having chosen to be here. That's why they need extra help to be supported and have their rights,” she said.

She continued, “Due process affects all of us. If they don't get due process, we don't get due process.”

The vigil is planned for Sunday, August 31 at 4 p.m. It will take place at pHunkadelic, located at 2790 West Third Street Farmville, VA, United States, Virginia 23901, around three miles from campus. According to Crews, concerned citizens from Lynchburg and Charlottesville will also be in attendance.

The mayor said Chicago is going to be ""prepared for anything and everything.""","Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson signed an executive order on Saturday, unleashing a plan to counter a looming federal immigration crackdown and a possible National Guard deployment threatened by President Donald Trump.

The legislation signed by Johnson establishes the Protecting Chicago Initiative, a directive to protect the constitutional rights of residents, according to the mayor's office.

""We do not have the luxury of time,"" the mayor stated. ""We have received credible reports that we have days, not weeks, before our city sees some type of militarized activity by the federal government. It is unclear at this time what that will look like exactly.""

The order, which Johnson said is the most drastic executive action taken in any U.S. city in response to immigration enforcement, establishes campaigns to inform people of their rights and utilizes legal action and legislation to prevent attempts to violate citizens' rights.

The initiative, according to the mayor's office, affirms the Chicago Police Department will remain a locally controlled agency under the authority of the city and the mayor. Federal law enforcement and U.S. military personnel who operate in Chicago are directed to adhere to the following policies, which CPD officers must also comply with:

Law enforcement cannot wear any mask, covering or disguise intended to conceal their identities from the public while performing their official duties.

Personnel must legally wear body cameras and activate those cameras during all law enforcement-related activities during which the officer is interacting with a member of the public.

·Personnel must legally display identifying information in a clearly visible fashion. This should include the name of the federal agency, last name, and badge number of the federal law enforcement officer, or the armed forces member's last name and rank, respectively.

Read details on the Protecting Chicago executive order here.

The executive order also launches a Family Preparedness Campaign in multiple languages to ""educate families on how to prepare in the event of a detention by federal agents,"" according to the mayor's office.

NBC News previously reported multiple federal agencies will “surge manpower” to Chicago next week to step up immigration enforcement and arrests.

President Trump posted to Truth Social Saturday afternoon saying in part that Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker ""better straighten"" Chicago out ""FAST, or we're coming!"" though it is not clear if the tweet was related to the executive order.

Two federal law enforcement officials told NBC News that ICE, Border Patrol and other agencies will send numerous agents and equipment to the city in an effort to increase arrests of undocumented immigrants in the city.

The operating base for the enforcement actions is expected to be Naval Station Great Lakes, with the New York Times reporting that more than 200 federal agents and more than 100 vehicles will be part of the operation.

Trump previously said he plans to send the National Guard to Chicago as part of efforts to curb violence, but Democratic leaders voiced strong opposition, with Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker saying there is ""no emergency"" that requires Trump to deploy troops to the city. Johnson has said such a move would be a “flagrant violation” of the Constitution.

""We will protect our Constitution, we will protect our city, and we will protect our people,"" he said. ""We do not want to see tanks in our streets. We do not want to see families ripped apart. We do not want grandmothers thrown into the back of unmarked vans.""

The mayor said Chicago is going to be ""prepared for anything and everything.""

""What his ultimate desire is... is to come into our city, to break the Constitution and to break our democracy and to break our city, and Chicago is going to remain firm in our position,"" Johnson said, referring to Trump.

If Trump follows through with a deployment, Johnson has directed city officials to ""pursue all available legal and legislative avenues"" to resist efforts that violate ""the sovereignty of the city and the rights of residents.""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/08/johnson-executive-order.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-08-31 05:56:41.184601

The move is being slammed by refugee advocates, some of whom say the deal could open the door to mass deportations without notice. Human rights organizations have protested deportations to Nauru since a report by the United Nations found “systematic violations” of the International Convention Against Torture.

Tony Burke, Australia's home affairs minister, said in a statement that the memorandum “contains undertakings for the proper treatment and long-term residence of people who have no legal right to stay in Australia, to be received in Nauru.""

The two countries struck a deal in February to allow Australia to deport three violent criminals to Nauru. They were granted 30-year visas.

An Australian High Court decision in 2023 overturned the government’s policy of indefinite detention for immigrants who could neither get a visa, in some cases because of criminal conduct, nor be deported because they would face persecution or harm in their home countries. More than 200 immigrants have been released from detention as a result of the case. Some were charged with further offenses after their release.

Burke said the Nauru deal would target this group.

""Anyone who doesn’t have a valid visa should leave the country,” he said. “This is a fundamental element of a functioning visa system.”

In a statement posted online, Jana Favero, deputy CEO of the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, criticized the agreement.

The deal impacts several hundred people known as the NZYQ cohort, who were released from custody following a landmark High Court ruling on indefinite detention.

Shadow attorney-general Julian Leeser said it was a ""legitimate arrangement"".

""This cohort of people have had ample opportunities to put their case,"" he told the ABC on Sunday.

""They have exhausted all appeal avenues and the question now is whether they can be removed to another country.""

Greens immigration spokesman David Shoebridge condemned the agreement.

""This is another secret deal,"" he said.

""This time a $400 million secret deal, that Labor signed with Nauru to literally turn Nauru into a 21st century prison colony.""

The federal government must pass legislation to allow for the removals.

Cabinet minister Murray Watt wants to make progress as soon as possible.

""It's not the intention to send the entire cohort in one group,"" he told Sky News.

""The plan is to scale the number up and allow Nauru to put in place the systems that allow for the number to increase over time.""

Senator Watt rejected suggestions Australia was dumping unwanted people including criminals on Nauru.

""Nauru is an independent sovereign nation,"" he said.

""It can make its own decisions about what it wants to do, and the fact that they have reached that agreement with Australia does solve this issue.""

The home affairs minister visited Nauru to meet its president and members of parliament before signing the memorandum of understanding.

The agreement ""contains undertakings for the proper treatment and long-term residence of people who have no legal right to stay in Australia, to be received in Nauru"".

The price tag attached to the resettlement deal is significant in the context of the Nauru economy, which has a GDP of $160 million USD.

Dehivis David Olivo Hernández, Gregory José Sanabria Tarazona, Teobaldo Antonio León and Wilmer Alexander García Vallenilla face deportation to Venezuela based on unsubstantiated allegations that they pose national security risks to the United States, the experts said.
“We are sounding the alarm that these individuals face serious human rights violations if returned to Venezuela,” the experts said.
“The US Government must immediately halt the deportations of these four individuals and conduct proper individualised assessments in line with international law,” the experts said.
“All allegations of human rights violations by any national authorities must be independently investigated and effective remedies provided to the victims,” the experts said.","GENEVA (29 August 2025) – The arbitrary detention and imminent deportation of three Venezuelan political dissidents and a human rights defender living in exile in the United States would breach international human rights law and refugee law, UN experts* warned today.

Dehivis David Olivo Hernández, Gregory José Sanabria Tarazona, Teobaldo Antonio León and Wilmer Alexander García Vallenilla face deportation to Venezuela based on unsubstantiated allegations that they pose national security risks to the United States, the experts said.

“We are alarmed that their deportation would violate the principle of non-refoulment, which prohibits the transfer of individuals to any country where they face a real and foreseeable risk of arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, enforced disappearance, arbitrary detention, persecution, unfair trial, or other serious human rights violations,” they said. This protection applies regardless of migration status or nationality.

The US Government claims, without evidence, that the four Venezuelans are affiliated with the criminal organisation Tren de Aragua, which has been wrongfully designated by the United States as a terrorist organisation. This, in turn, has exposed them to summary deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, since the United States unlawfully asserts that Tren de Aragua is committing an “invasion or predatory incursion” into the US at the direction of Venezuela.

“We are sounding the alarm that these individuals face serious human rights violations if returned to Venezuela,” the experts said. “At least two have suffered documented acts of torture in Venezuela. All are at risk of further persecution, abuse or enforced disappearance.”

The US has an obligation to uphold these protections as a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and under customary international law.

“We are particularly concerned that deportations are imminent despite the lack of individual assessment of the risks to them in Venezuela, especially due to their prior political activities or human rights work,” the experts said.

They also raised concerns about their detention, noting that the individuals were reportedly apprehended during routine immigration or court appointments, without adequate notice or reason and reportedly denied opportunities to access legal assistance and to effectively challenge their deportations and claim non-refoulement.

“The US Government must immediately halt the deportations of these four individuals and conduct proper individualised assessments in line with international law,” the experts said. “Authorities must guarantee access to effective remedies, and refrain from further actions that may place them or any other deportees at risk of serious human rights violations.”

“Venezuela must also guarantee the safety, dignity, and rights of the four individuals should they be returned,” the experts said.

In line with international human rights law, the experts called on the Venezuelan authorities to ensure that none of the individuals or their family members are subjected to reprisals, including detention, or prosecution for peacefully exercising their freedom of expression, association and assembly and their right to participate in public affairs.

“All allegations of human rights violations by any national authorities must be independently investigated and effective remedies provided to the victims,” the experts said.

They have been in contact with both Governments on these issues.

Migrants trying to leave from the west African country of Mauritania say they are suffering brutal and inhumane treatment at the hands of security forces funded by the European Union. The migrants are trying to make the perilous 700-mile voyage to Europe, and every year, thousands die on the way as they crowd into flimsy and overcrowded wooden boats.

The EU is paying Mauritania's border forces to stop the migrants from going to Europe in the first place. NPR's Ruth Sherlock spoke to one young man who says he witnessed the abuses firsthand.

RUTH SHERLOCK, BYLINE: Abdramane Barry (ph) left Sierra Leone in 2023 with a dream of making it to Europe. Instead, he's now penniless, stripped of his passport and possessions, stranded in north Africa and traumatized by what he's been through.

ABDRAMANE BARRY: The place where they take us to, there is no, you know, good food, no water, no medication. A lot of pregnant women are in there. No. Oh, God.

SHERLOCK: He's telling me about his experience in Mauritania after he and about 80 other people were caught trying to board a smuggler's boat. The police put them into a center so crowded there wasn't space to move.

BARRY: That one, I would say, is more than a prison because the prisoner, you would give him food three times a day. The water, he will take a shower. But that place? No, no, no. Nothing good there.

SHERLOCK: He says they survived only on scraps of rice thrown to them in the morning. A liter of water had to be shared between 15 people. Even the pregnant women in the group, he says, weren't given any extra food. The guards targeted young girls.

BARRY: Call them, take them out. Nobody knows where they take them to, alone (ph).

SHERLOCK: Barry's account tallies with the testimonies of hundreds of migrants collected in a yearslong research by Human Rights Watch and published in a report last week.

LAUREN SEIBERT: We documented, unfortunately, a whole slew of abuses that migrants have faced there.

SHERLOCK: Lauren Seibert is a researcher in the Refugee and Migrant Rights Division at Human Rights Watch.

SEIBERT: These abuses included arbitrary arrest, arbitrary detention, extortion and even some cases of rape and torture. Over the course of several years, while these abuses were ongoing, the EU and Spain bilaterally just continued to outsource their migration management.

SHERLOCK: It's a similar situation, she says, to the deals the EU has cut with Libya and Tunisia, where the terrible abuse of migrants at the hands of security forces are well documented. The European Commission turned down our request for interview but shared a statement saying it takes allegations of mistreatment seriously. It said ensuring respect for the human rights of migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers are fundamental principles of its work.

Mauritania and the EU have made efforts this year to improve the treatment of migrants. But Abdramane Barry, the 24-year-old from Sierra Leone, says he saw no sign of this.

BARRY: These people treating us like we are animals. No.

SHERLOCK: Barry and the other migrants were expelled from Mauritania with no legal process. They were pushed into Mali, a country at war. Now he's there in Timbuktu, with only the clothes on his back. For NPR, Malian journalist Baba Toure (ph) meets Barry at a local market where he was begging for food and help. He connects me to him by phone.

How does it make you feel about Europe that the European Union is paying those police to stop people coming to Europe?

BARRY: It make me feel like I think those people, they are not well trained 'cause if they are well trained, they will not treat a human being like this. I'm not a criminal. I'm not deserve that type of treatment. If not me, all the kids and the pregnant women in there, they are not deserve that.

SHERLOCK: Barry says all he wants now is to go home. But stripped of his money, phone and passport in Mauritania, he has no idea how he'll make the more than 1,000-mile-long journey back to Sierra Leone.

The order directs city agencies on how to respond to possible immigration enforcement actions.
There are also reports the administration is planning a surge of federal immigration agents into the city.
It demands that Trump and federal agents ""stand down from any attempts to deploy the US Armed Forces"" in the city.
White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Chicago officials were making fighting crime a partisan issue.","The mayor of Chicago has signed an order detailing how the city will resist a potential immigration crackdown threatened by the Trump administration.

""We do not need nor want an unconstitutional and illegal military occupation of our city,"" said Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat. The order directs city agencies on how to respond to possible immigration enforcement actions.

Trump has already deployed about 2,000 troops to Washington DC, and has threatened to extend the order to Chicago, which he says is a ""mess"". There are also reports the administration is planning a surge of federal immigration agents into the city.

A White House spokesperson described Johnson's order as ""a publicity stunt.""

The order is the latest chapter in an escalating feud between the White House and Illinois state and local officials over violent crime and immigration.

It demands that Trump and federal agents ""stand down from any attempts to deploy the US Armed Forces"" in the city.

The order also restates a number of existing city policies, including requirements that law enforcement officers wear body cameras and identifying information, and a ban on wearing masks.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers have been sharply criticised in other cities for concealing their identities.

Johnson said city officials would help residents understand their rights if they encounter immigration enforcement, while ruling out allowing local officers to participate in joint patrols with federal agents.

Local officials say more than one in five residents is an immigrant, with more than half coming from Latin American countries. It is unclear how many are living in Chicago without official documentation.

Trump, a Republican, has said America's third largest city as ""a killing field"", arguing crime in the city constitutes an emergency.

His threats to deploy the National Guard have been described as an abuse of power by Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.

""Donald Trump is attempting to manufacture a crisis, politicise Americans who serve in uniform, and continue abusing his power to distract from the pain he is causing working families,"" said Pritzker, a Democrat.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Chicago officials were making fighting crime a partisan issue.

""If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticise the President, their communities would be much safer.""",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/e03d/live/84c17ff0-85f9-11f0-9cf6-cbf3e73ce2b9.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 22:56:21.190469

The Chicago police department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to the executive order Johnson signed.
The mayor directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or national guard deployment by the federal government”.
Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts.
He told CBS News that, should Trump send in the national guard, voters “should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime”.","The mayor of Chicago has signed an executive order outlining how the city will attempt to resist Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Brandon Johnson pushed back on Saturday against what he called the “out-of-control” Trump administration’s plan to deploy large numbers of federal officers into the country’s third-largest city, which could take place within days.

The Chicago police department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to the executive order Johnson signed.

The mayor directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or national guard deployment by the federal government”.

When asked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably “taking orders”, Johnson replied: “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”

Johnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers have adopted since the Trump administration took charge this year.

Last week, the White House requested that a US military base on the outskirts of Chicago be made available to assist with immigration operations, as the Trump administration plans a broader takeover of Democratic-run “sanctuary cities”.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

On Thursday, Tom Homan, the administration’s “border czar”, said Chicago, along with a number of other cities, would soon be targeted in a planned immigration crackdown.

“Operations are ramping up across the country. But you can see a ramp-up across the operations in Chicago, absolutely,” Homan said.

In an interview with Fox News, Homan was asked whether he wanted to give a message to Johnson. Homan responded: “Get out of the way, because we’re going to do it.”

Johnson had harsh words for Trump during his news conference, accusing the president of “behaving outside the bounds of the constitution” and seeking a federal presence in blue cities as retribution against his political rivals.

“He is reckless and out of control,” Johnson said. “He’s the biggest threat to our democracy that we’ve experienced in the history of our country.”

In response, the White House insisted the potential flood of federal agents was about “cracking down on crime”.

NBC News reported that Ice, the border patrol and other agencies will send numerous agents and equipment to Chicago as soon as next week, in an attempt to increase arrests of undocumented immigrants.

The planned move comes weeks after the president deployed armed soldiers and military vehicles to patrol the streets of Washington DC, claiming, despite all available evidence, that the use of the national guard was necessary to control crime.

The Trump administration has been working on plans to send the national guard to Chicago, something Johnson and JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, have said would be an abuse of power.

On Friday, Pritzker said such a move would amount to an “invasion”. He told CBS News that, should Trump send in the national guard, voters “should understand that he has other aims, other than fighting crime”.

Pritzker said those aims may be to “stop the elections in 2026 or, frankly, take control of those elections”.

Johnson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

“If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the president, their communities would be much safer,” said White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson. “Cracking down on crime should not be a partisan issue, but Democrats suffering from TDS are trying to make it one. They should listen to fellow Democrat Mayor Muriel Bowser who recently celebrated the Trump Administration’s success in driving down violent crime in Washington DC.”

“Unlike the Trump administration, Boston follows the law—city, state and federal. We are the safest major city in the country because all of our community members know that they are part of how we keep the entire community safe,"" Wu said in a statement released Saturday morning. ""Boston will never back down from being a beacon of freedom and a home for everyone. Stop attacking cities to hide your administration’s failures.”

Wu's response comes in the wake of a Politico report on Friday citing unnamed current and former administration sources saying the Trump administration is preparing ""an immigration enforcement blitz"" in Boston in the coming weeks.

NBC has not independently confirmed this report, but Todd Lyons, the acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, has previously vowed to “flood the zone in Boston” with federal immigration enforcement.

Tensions between Wu and the Trump administration came to a head earlier this month when the Justice Department sent letters to Boston and other sanctuary jurisdictions demanding they end the immigration protections. They threatened to cut off federal funding and prosecute officials if the cities didn’t comply.

In response, Wu held a press conference with local leaders where she called on Trump to ""stop attacking our cities.""

""We will not back down,"" she said. ""This is not the first time I've made it clear that our residents expect us to take care of our city. We know how to take care of our neighbors here in Boston without the interference, coersion, intimidation, bullying or threats from the federal government.""

On August 28, Virginia Senator Mark Warner visited Abrego Garcia at the facility to deliver letters from his family.","On Tuesday, August 26, ABC 8 News first reported Kilmar Abrego Garcia — whose wrongful deportation to El Salvador led to a national debate over the Trump Administration’s immigration policy — is being held at the Farmville Detention Center. In response, local activists have planned a vigil for 4 p.m. Sunday, August 31 at pHunkadelic, a local gathering space near the facility.

Abrego Garcia was originally deported from the United States to El Salvador in March 2025, which the Trump Administration initially called an “administrative error.” He was kept in a Salvadorean prison until June 6, when he was returned to the United States and kept in a Tennessee jail.

After being released and being reunited with his family in Maryland on August 22, he was detained by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on August 25 during a routine check-in. Abrego Garcia’s attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said there was “no reason” to take him into custody. “The only reason that they've chosen to take him into detention is to punish him. To punish him for exercising his constitutional rights,” he said.

The Trump Administration has argued Abrego Garcia is a member of the gang MS-13 and is therefore attempting to deport him again. That said, critics and advocates have argued the claim lacks evidence. Abrego Garcia has denied the administration’s allegations.

The administration has now declared their intention to deport Abrego Garcia to Uganda, something U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis has ruled they cannot do. On August 25, she ruled the Trump Administration is “absolutely forbidden to remove Abrego Garcia from the continental United States.”

As reported by The Rotunda in March 2024, the Farmville Detention Center has faced numerous accusations of human rights abuses from activists, immigration law centers and other advocacy groups. These include allegations of excessive force, medical negligence and the serving of spoiled and moldy food.

The facility has transferred ownership several times within the last several years. Initially owned by Immigration Centers of America, ownership of the facility was transferred to an affiliate organization, Abyon, LLC, with the same owners, according to FOIA documents obtained by the National Immigrant Justice Center.

While owned by Abyon, LCC, an inspection from ICE’s Office of Detention Oversight (OCO) found 19 violations of ICE detention standards. According to the compliance inspection report, 15 deficiencies/violations were found with the facility’s medical care.

In July, Tennessee-based company CoreCivic bought the facility from Abyon, LLC, for $67 million. Representative Don Beyer, a congressman from Northern Virginia who toured the facility in August, expressed hope in an exclusive interview with ABC 8 News that the ownership transfer could help improve conditions.

“I think CoreCivic taking over was one of the big steps in terms of bringing in a big company with many, many more resources to invest in the things because we want it to be safe for everyone,” Beyer said.

On August 28, Virginia Senator Mark Warner visited Abrego Garcia at the facility to deliver letters from his family. In a video statement posted to social media after the visit, Warner said, “I got a commitment from the private company that runs the facility that they’ll work with us on improving both some of the food and some of the health care [at the facility].”

Abrego Garcia’s detention has raised significant concerns over his constitutional right to due process, as well as treatment of him and other detainees in the Farmville Detention Facility. Activists, including local business owner Allison Crews, have planned a vigil for Sunday, August 31 at pHunkadelic — a local gathering space within walking distance of the Detention Center. The space is owned and operated by Crews.

Crews initially discovered Abrego Garcia had been transferred to the facility based on a tip from an acquaintance, whose name she did not disclose, before the ABC 8 News report at 9:22 a.m. “An acquaintance locally gave me a tip… and I had researched to see that it was true when they said his number was tracked to the facility,” Crews said.

Crews has been involved with protests and demonstrations over the summer against the Trump Administration. Asked about the administration’s shifting policy on immigration, Crews said, “They’re dismantling the foundational elements of our country and our freedoms that should be protected.”

She added, “I’ve been aware of it all along, but even more so in the past few months, just that there’s been more traffic going down the street [to the facility]… I would see a lot more out of state [license] plates, and that’s what got my attention to start asking questions at the county level.”

Ahead of the interview, The Rotunda contacted County Administrator Doug Stanley for his comment on the renewed attention to the Farmville Detention Center and asked if he had visited the facility since the transfer of the contract to Prince Edward County and the sale of the facility to CoreCivic.

In response, Stanley wrote, “We recognize the renewed attention and concern this situation has drawn to our community. The County is committed to transparency and will share any updates we are legally able to provide. While local officials have toured the facility multiple times, our ability to discuss those visits is limited under federal regulations and the Intergovernmental Service Agreement. We encourage anyone with questions about facility operations or conditions to contact the appropriate federal authorities.”

According to Crews and the flyer for the vigil, the “vibe” of the event will be “Love Thy Neighbor.” Crews said she considers herself a neighbor to those at the facility. “I go on the premise of wanting to be a good neighbor, and as a neighbor here, I just want to do what I can to help draw attention to it,” she said.

She also spoke on the support she has received from the community, which she said has been a “mixed bag.” However, Crews stressed the detention facility and Abrego Garcia’s detention impacts all parts of the community.

“I feel like if people are happy people are getting locked up… then they should be concerned with the county and how much money is being paid [to Prince Edward County]. And then there's the other folks like me who want to be compassionate and do what we can to cultivate wellness just in our community, and [the detainees] are a large part of our community, not having chosen to be here. That's why they need extra help to be supported and have their rights,” she said.

She continued, “Due process affects all of us. If they don't get due process, we don't get due process.”

The vigil is planned for Sunday, August 31 at 4 p.m. It will take place at pHunkadelic, located at 2790 West Third Street Farmville, VA, United States, Virginia 23901, around three miles from campus. According to Crews, concerned citizens from Lynchburg and Charlottesville will also be in attendance.

The Chicago Police Department will be barred from helping federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement or any related patrols, traffic stops and checkpoints during the surge, according to an executive order signed by Mayor Brandon Johnson.

The mayor directed all city departments to guard the constitutional rights of Chicago residents “amidst the possibility of imminent militarized immigration or National Guard deployment by the federal government.”

When asked during a news conference about federal agents who are presumably “taking orders,” Johnson replied: “Yeah, and I don’t take orders from the federal government.”

Johnson also blocked Chicago police from wearing face coverings to hide their identities, as most federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have adopted since the Trump administration took charge this year.

The federal surge into Chicago could start as early as Sept. 5 and last about 30 days, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss plans that had not been made public.

The officials described the immigration crackdown as part of a larger effort to expand the federal law enforcement presence in major Democratic-run cities, as it did this summer in Los Angeles.

On Saturday, President Donald Trump commented about Chicago crime and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on his Truth Social site: “Six people were killed, and 24 people were shot, in Chicago last weekend, and JB Pritzker, the weak and pathetic Governor of Illinois, just said that he doesn’t need help in preventing CRIME. He is CRAZY!!! He better straighten it out, FAST, or we’re coming! MAGA. President DJT”

Unlike the recent federal takeover of policing in Washington, D.C., the Chicago operation is not expected to rely on the National Guard or military and is focused exclusively on immigration instead of being cast as part of a broad campaign against crime, the officials said.

Chicago is home to a large immigrant population, and both the city and the state of Illinois have some of the country’s strongest rules against cooperating with federal immigration enforcement efforts. That has often put the city and state at odds with President Donald Trump 's mass deportation agenda.

Johnson's order builds on the city's longtime stance, saying neither Chicago nor Illinois officials have sought or been consulted on the federal presence and demanding Trump stand down on those plans.

Johnson had harsh words for Trump during his news conference, accusing the president of “behaving outside the bounds of the Constitution” and seeking a federal presence in blue cities as retribution against his political rivals.

“He is reckless and out of control,” Johnson said. “He's the biggest threat to our democracy that we've experienced in the history of our country.”

In response, the White House insisted the potential flood of federal agents was about “cracking down on crime.”

“If these Democrats focused on fixing crime in their own cities instead of doing publicity stunts to criticize the President, their communities would be much safer,"" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in an email Saturday.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9ZJWwcxeH4uHGZo9iOOqHA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/eb34da5882529936b639dbd308ee6bd7,N,,2025-08-31 00:56:30.623821

The move is a setback for the President Donald Trump’s efforts to expand the use of the federal expedited removal statute to quickly remove some migrants in the country illegally without appearing before a judge first.

Trump promised to engineer a massive deportation operation during his 2024 campaign if voters returned him to the White House. And he set a goal of carrying out 1 million deportations a year in his second term.

But U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb suggested the administration’s expanded use of the expedited removal of migrants is trampling on individuals’ due process rights.

“In defending this skimpy process, the Government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment, but instead must accept whatever grace Congress affords them,” Cobb wrote in a 48-page opinion issued Friday night. “Were that right, not only noncitizens, but everyone would be at risk.”

The Department of Homeland Security announced shortly after Trump came to office in January that it was expanding the use of expedited removal, the fast-track deportation of undocumented migrants who have been in the U.S. less than two years.

The effort has triggered lawsuits by the American Civil Liberties Union and immigrant rights groups.

DHS in a statement said Cobb’s “ruling ignores the President’s clear authorities under both Article II of the Constitution and the plain language of federal law.” It said Trump “has a mandate to arrest and deport the worst of the worst” and that ”we have the law, facts, and common sense on our side.”

Before the administration’s push to expand such speedy deportations, expedited removal was only used for migrants who were stopped within 100 miles of the border and who had been in the U.S. for less than 14 days.

Cobb, who was nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden, didn’t question the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute, or its application at the border.

“It merely holds that in applying the statute to a huge group of people living in the interior of the country who have not previously been subject to expedited removal, the Government must afford them due process,” she wrote.

She added that “prioritizing speed over all else will inevitably lead the Government to erroneously remove people via this truncated process.”

Cobb earlier this month agreed to temporarily block the administration’s efforts to expand fast-track deportations of immigrants who legally entered the U.S. under a process known as humanitarian parole. The ruling could benefit hundreds of thousands of people.

In that case the judge said Homeland Security exceeded its statutory authority in its effort to expand expedited removal for many immigrants. The judge said those immigrants are facing perils that outweigh any harm from “pressing pause” on the administration’s plans.

Since May, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have positioned themselves in hallways to arrest people after judges accept government requests to dismiss deportation cases. After the arrests, the government renews deportation proceedings but under fast-track authority.

Although fast-track deportations can be put on hold by filing an asylum claim, people may be unaware of that right and, even if they are, can be swiftly removed if they fail an initial screening.",https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2025/08/2025-06-06T225430Z_391847135_RC2AXEAXNU4W_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-DEPORTATION-EL-SALVADOR-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 18:57:01.861553

In seven months, Democratic attorneys general have filed dozens of lawsuits, and California is moving fast.

""Our position is we hold the line on the law. The law is broken, we sue. We've done that 39 times in 31 weeks,"" said California Attorney General Rob Bonta.

Bonta said his office has protected constitutional rights like birthright citizenship, Medicaid data the Department of Homeland Security intended to use for immigration enforcement, and federal funding for the state.

""We've protected $168 billion that California was owed, that Trump was trying to withhold,"" Bonta said. ""That money continues to flow to critical services here in California to support Californians.""

The attorney general said that overwhelmingly, the lawsuits his office has brought forward, have been effective through emergency relief, temporary restraining orders, preliminary injunctions or by getting the administration to change its policies.

""That happened when the Trump administration was trying to condition -- put unlawful in our view -- immigration conditions on funding from the Department of Homeland Security. They changed their policies and took away those conditions after we sued,"" he said. ""The courts remain a place where justice is done,"" Bonta told Eyewitness News.

Many legal challenges not filed by Bonta's office are still unfolding. For example, immigrants' rights groups who sued the Department of Homeland Security point to ongoing sweeps as evidence the agency is possibly violating a federal court order. Bonta's office supported the lawsuit through an amicus brief.

""We're not naïve about the fact that he's pushing the limits, potentially defying some of the court orders or at least not following them precisely or promptly or in good faith as the court has required,"" said Bonta.

The California attorney general's Office has led or co-led most of the 39 lawsuits its brought forward and filed more than 40 amicus briefs supporting other litigation against the Trump administration. The lawsuits nearly double the pace of those filed during the first Trump administration.

Recent incidents involving ICE agents at hospitals have led to conflicts, protests, and even criminal charges against healthcare workers.

Healthcare workers are seeking additional training and guidance on how to navigate these complex situations and protect patient rights while complying with the law.

This story was originally published by CalMatters. Sign up for their newsletters.

Federal immigration agents are more routinely showing up at California medical facilities as the Trump administration ramps up deportations.

They may come to the emergency room, bringing in someone who’s suffering a medical crisis while being detained. They may wait in the lobby, as agents did for two weeks at an L.A.-area hospital waiting for a woman to be discharged. Or they may even chase people inside, as federal agents did at a Southern California surgical center.

The sight of these agents — often armed and with covered faces — makes many wary and may keep people from seeking care.

Existing hospital policies guide operations when law enforcement brings in a person under arrest, hospital officials say.

“This is nothing new to hospitals,” said Lois Richardson, vice president and counsel at the California Hospital Association. “We get inmates, detainees, arrestees all the time, whether it’s police, sheriff, highway patrol, ICE, whatever it is.” The job for hospital workers remains to provide care, she added, and not to get involved in disputes over why a person is in custody.

Yet immigration attorneys, advocates and health workers have expressed concerns over the handling of some of these cases, both by immigration officers and by some administrators at medical facilities.

Specifically, they’reworried about the application of protocols like visitation rules, about threats to patients’ legal and privacy rights, and about risks to hospital workers themselves.

“We have a level of privacy that we owe to patients and their families, and that has just been completely demolished with all of the involvement of ICE coming into hospitals,” said Kate Mobeen, an ICU nurse at John Muir Medical Center in Concord. “It creates just a huge sense of fear, not only in our patient population, but in our employee population and our nurses.”

Patients’ rights, policies face new tests

Sometimes when ICE has shown up at medical facilities with a detained patient, the result has been conflicting messaging about the rules.

On July 29, ICE agents took a man to John Muir Medical Center in Concord because he suffered an unspecified medical emergency while being detained outside the Concord immigration court, according to Ali Saidi, an attorney and the director of Stand Together Contra Costa, a local rapid response and legal services organization.

When Saidi arrived at the hospital as part of the response network, he said hospital staff told him that he was not allowed to see the detained patient, but that the man’s family would be allowed. Then, when the man’s wife arrived, “The rules had somehow changed, and they said no family visit,” Saidi said.

In a statement shared by the Contra Costa Immigrants Rights Alliance, the detained man’s wife, who asked to be identified only by her middle name, Maria, said that when she later talked to her husband, he told her that he was so terrified that he passed out.

“My family and I went to the emergency room and we asked to see him and talk to him to make sure he was okay,” Maria said, in the statement. “The hospital staff would not let us see him and they would not give us any information about what was happening to him. They wouldn’t even answer my questions.”

John Muir officials would not comment on the incident, citing privacy laws. But in an email, Ben Drew, a spokesperson for the hospital, said general policy is that “If a law enforcement agency indicates that visitation presents a safety or security concern, [the hospital] may limit or deny visitation to protect our patients, staff, and visitors.”

Saidi said that when the wife insisted on getting information about the man’s condition, hospital security called the police.

“We understand that emotions are high whenever a family member or friend is in the emergency department or hospital,” said Drew. “The hospital only involves local police in circumstances when a patient or visitor’s behavior becomes abusive, disruptive, or threatening, and cannot be resolved through our own security team.”

Saidi denied that the family was being disruptive, saying that conversations with hospital staff and administration were respectful and no voices were raised.

“The atmosphere in that emergency bay was something like I’ve never seen before in my career,” Saidi said. “There was a chilling effect. Everyone was averting their eyes. You could tell the staff felt bad.”

Multiple emergency department nurses told Mobeen, a local California Nurses Association leader at John Muir, that ICE officers were “very aggressive with staff” and staff were afterwards “emotionally and physically upset” by what happened, she said.

“It’s horrifying to not be able to tell patients’ family members how they are, what their status is,” Mobeen said.

Part of the issue, Mobeen added, is training. Staff were not given adequate training on how to respond to any kind of immigration enforcement action that may occur at the hospital, she said.

Drew, the spokesman for John Muir, countered that the hospital has given guidance on its longstanding law enforcement policy and answered multiple questions since January about what to do if ICE agents show up at their facilities.

Limits for ICE access, sometimes murky

Last month, immigration agents occupied the lobby of Dignity Health’s Glendale Memorial Hospital, even standing behind reception desks, as photos that circulated online showed. Protestors gathered outside the hospital hosting rallies and press conferences.

They were all there because agents had previously brought in Milagro Solis-Portillo, an immigrant from El Salvador, for medical care following her detention. They spent 15 days in the hospital waiting for Solis-Portillo’s discharge before transferring her to another hospital and then taking her into custody, according to local news reports.

In a statement, officials from Dignity Memorial Hospital said they could not legally prohibit law enforcement from being in public areas.

That’s true, say legal experts: Waiting rooms and lobbies are considered public spaces in hospitals. But agents cannot move through hospitals without limits. Law enforcement officials are not allowed to search for people in exam rooms or other private spaces without a federal court warrant.

When agents bring in someone who is in their custody and needs medical care, the application of the law can be more murky.

According to Richardson at the hospital association, how far an agent can go into treatment areas with a detained patient may be decided on a case by case basis. In cases where a detained patient is struggling or resisting, that patient may need guarding, she explained.

And if law enforcement officers do go inside exam rooms, they may hear medical information while on guard. But that isn’t necessarily a privacy violation, according to federal rules. The HIPPA Privacy Rule, the law that sets privacy standards for medical information, has a provision that allows for “incidental disclosures” of information as long as “reasonable safeguards” are applied.

“The hospital will, and the doctor will make reasonable attempts to protect the patient’s privacy.” “What is reasonable is going to depend, again, on what’s wrong with the patient, how the patient is behaving, the nature of the circumstances,” Richardson said.

HIPAA protects the disclosure of medical records, which include names, addresses and social security numbers along with health conditions. State law also requires health facilities to protect this information. According to guidance from the attorney general’s office, health facilities should consider a patient’s immigration status confidential.

At the same time, some disclosures are required if law enforcement can prove lawful custody or show an appropriate warrant. A federal court warrant signed by a judge grants law enforcement immediate access to information or to search a particular area, while an ICE administrative warrant does not require immediate compliance.

Health workers in ‘precarious’ situations

Health facilities generally direct frontline workers not to engage with immigration agents, but rather to immediately contact security or management.

One particular incident at a Southern California surgery center stands out, in conversation with health workers.

On July 8, federal agents targeted three landscapers who had parked outside of the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center. They chased one of the men inside on foot, according to a felony criminal complaint filed against two health care workers in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

In videos of the incident posted online, a masked agent wearing a vest labeled “POLICE ICE” on the back holds a weeping man by the shoulder inside the center while several workers in scrubs stand by. At multiple points in the video workers ask the officer for identification; one worker says, “this is a private business.”

Two workers, Danielle Davila and Jose Ortega, tell the officer to leave. Davila moves between the officer and the man, saying “Get your hands off of him. You don’t even have a warrant.”

Ortega puts an arm between Davila and the officer and says “You have no proper identification.”

The officer says to both workers “You touched a federal agent.” Then Davila responds, “I’m not touching you.”

Davila and Ortega were later charged with two felony counts of assaulting a federal officer and conspiring to prevent a federal officer from performing their duties.

After dropping the felony charges last week in favor of a misdemeanor assault charge, the U.S. Attorney’s Office reversed course. On Wednesday, a grand jury indicted Davila and Ortega on one count of assaulting a federal officer. In a statement, the attorney’s office said Davila and Ortega had “impeded and interfered with the arrest.”

A trial is scheduled for Oct. 6.

Davila’s defense attorney Oliver Cleary said his client believed she was doing the right thing by asking for credentials and a warrant.

“You can’t just come in where people are getting medical care and whisk them away,” Cleary said. “She didn’t know who these people were. They didn’t tell her who they were, and as far as she knew this was a patient of the clinic.”

Carlos Juárez, Ortega’s defense attorney, said arresting and charging health workers with crimes for asking to see a warrant and identification puts them in a “precarious” and “dangerous situation.”

“They did what they needed to do and what they had a right to do,” Juárez said. “What I hope is it doesn’t have a chilling effect on other health care workers.”

Workers say additional training can help

Around the state, health workers say they’d like to see management provide additional guidance on how to respond to such scenarios if they were to play out in their workplace. Some workers are providing training themselves.

Adriana Rugeles-Ortiz, a licensed vocational nurse at Kaiser Permanente Modesto Medical Center, has been leading “Know Your Rights” sessions at her hospital and in her community as part of her union, SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. She said some of her coworkers have expressed anxiety over some of the situations they’ve seen play out in other hospitals.

“Because of my involvement with all the training that we have done to the workers and to the community, personally, I do feel prepared. I am not that confident that we have been able to reach the entire workforce within Kaiser to get them to the level of confidence to deal with it,” Rugeles-Ortiz said.

Dr. Douglas Yoshida, an emergency room physician at Stanford Health Tri-Valley in Alameda County, said additional guidance and training for workers at medical facilities could be of great value.

“I think as health care providers, we need to deliver good health care to these patients, just like any other patient, and we need to protect their rights,” Yoshida said. “I mean, personally, if someone comes in in ICE custody, within the limits of the law, I want to do everything I can to help [patients.]”

The hospital in Pleasanton that Yoshida works in is located near the county’s Santa Rita Jail; staff, he said, have been used to a law enforcement presence. But the recent incident at John Muir Medical Center, about 30 miles north, as well as the criminal charges filed against the southern California surgery center workers have set people on edge, Yoshida said.

Here was the Press Gallery conundrum in a nutshell: The government gives us money and story ideas, the opposition doesn’t even recognize our genius.

His account puts heavy emphasis on Conservative Party media relations. This is thin ice, but Ling skates on.

The campaign was the first in which a majority of the Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery faced unemployment if the Liberal Party lost re-election. Millions in media subsidies were at stake. Pierre Poilievre “vowed to defund the CBC and criticized the entire Parliamentary Press Gallery for being bought and paid for as ‘Trudeau’s media allies,’” says The 51st State Votes. Ling could apply for a grant, but complains he couldn’t get an interview with the Conservative Party leader.

Here was the Press Gallery conundrum in a nutshell: The government gives us money and story ideas, the opposition doesn’t even recognize our genius. How can we settle that score? Ling could not know everything that occurred in the campaign. There are many anecdotes. Here’s one.

Collin Lafrance, a House of Commons manager, on April 7 emailed Press Gallery bureau chiefs for a confidential mid-campaign talk. “It was suggested we might have a follow-up meeting during the campaign,” he said. Five bureau chiefs enthusiastically agreed. I replied to all:

“Hello. This is a bad idea. You are in an election campaign. Subsidized media are a campaign issue. The Prime Minister has said as much. To recap: A government employee, Mr. Lafrance, proposed a secret meeting of subsidized media to discuss coverage of a campaign in which subsidized media are a live issue. Ask yourself, how will I explain this when the electors find out? If anybody has grievances about access to politicians, join the club, then save it for your memoirs. If group therapy is required I suggest you pick it up after April 28.”

Nobody replied. No meeting was held. It is unknown if Lafrance was acting at the direction of then-Commons Speaker Greg Fergus, twice censured for partisan hackery.

Press Gallery members are coated in conflict. Ling’s Toronto Star client is heavily reliant on government concessions – the publisher once put his losses at a million a week – and Ling himself received funding from the Michener Awards Foundation to help cover campaign expenses. The Foundation offered $35,000 grants to “qualified journalists.”

Ottawa is a small town. Awards Foundation president Margo Goodhand, a former Winnipeg Free Press editor, once wrote of Justin Trudeau: “I wish him well. I need him to stand up to the bullies.” Trudeau was “emotional and empathetic,” she wrote, “earnest and forthright enough, an open book compared to Prime Minister Stephen Harper.” Other Foundation directors and executives include the chief lobbyist for the subsidized press, ex-managing editor of the CBC, ex-Toronto Star editor and a former iPolitics editor named in 2024 as a Senate publicist.

“The 45th Canadian election was nothing short of an existential exercise,” writes Ling. The choice was clear.

Pro-subsidy Mark Carney was “authentic,” “cerebral,” “comforting,” “folksy” though “folksy charm isn’t something easily learned,” “personable” and “self-effacing,” a campaign dynamo “mobbed at each stop,” writes Ling. “The more Canadians saw him, the more they liked him.” Ling recalls at one rally, “I saw young men brandishing copies of his book Values keen for an autograph.”

Anti-subsidy Pierre Poilievre was “condescending” with a “tough guy routine” and “rhetorical shimmy-shake” who campaigned with “press heavies,” writes Ling. It was all wrong: “He severely limited reporters who did show up from asking questions. He declined the vast majority of sit-down interviews with real journalists.”

The 51st State Votes is preoccupied with journalists’ feelings. There are 23 references in 78 pages of text.

Ling concludes Poilievre was “dour,” “inauthentic,” “inflexible,” a “master of slogans,” “paranoid” and “tightly managed” by “little Napoleons,” a caricature who “opted to emulate Musk” and resorted to policies that were “morally repugnant and practically stupid.” Press relations? They were the worst.

“He turned up his nose at journalists and the media, eschewing them in favour of online influencers and conspiracists,” writes Ling. The Opposition Leader “began making time for a bizarre litany of streamers, podcasters and people with popular Facebook pages.”

Postscript: Liberals won re-election, subsidized media got another season and the minority Parliament slogs on. Of course this show has to end sometime. It may not be the curtain-crasher they have in mind.

“Its agents may think they can slip in unnoticed, but we’re here to say: ICE is not welcome in our community,” a Facebook event posting by organizers Indivisible Northeast Indiana said.

‘Operation: ICE Breaker’ participants stood lining the Coliseum sidewalk on Parnell Avenue. They brought signs which read sayings like “Hands off our neighbors”, “Seeking refuge isn’t a crime” and “ICE is not welcome in Fort Wayne, stay out!”

The hiring event is linked to 2025 Midwest DEKA FIT, a strength competition happening this weekend in the Coliseum. Race Director Tyler Spencer clarified in an email to WANE 15 that the hiring event is for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, or CBP, not Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.

Jim Carpenter, Co-Founder of Indivisible Northeast Indiana, helped organize this protest. He said while ICE may not be directly involved with the hiring event, he and protesters have reason to believe both CBP and ICE have coordinated ICE raids.

Carpenter describes this and other activities that ICE performs as “lawless” and that they “ignore due process”.

“There’s a lot of coordination between [ICE and CBP] and they may not be directly hiring for ICE, but there’s a likelihood that they’ll be part of the raids,” Carpenter said. “…If they’re looking to recruit new agents, [DEKA Fit] is a smart place to do it. We object to them doing it in Fort Wayne.”

WANE 15 has reached out to Spencer and other DEKA Fit organizers for more information on the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol hiring event. Both have not replied.

(KABC) -- The husband of the chief medical officer at Pasadena's Huntington Hospital spoke out Friday after being detained and held in immigration detention for more than two weeks.

""I was worried that I'm going to die,"" Rami Othmane, who was back home after being released, said in an interview with ABC7.

On July 13, Othmane was stopped while driving to a grocery store in Pasadena. He quickly pulled out his paperwork to show federal immigration agents.

His wife, Dr. Wafaa Alrashid, heard the officers say ""Please step out of the car"" as she watched her husband's arrest in horror over FaceTime.

Alrashid immediately jumped in her car and followed her phone to his location. She arrived just in time to see the outline of his head in the back of a vehicle driving away.

""You don't know who are these people following you. They are unmarked cars, so you don't really understand who are these people,"" Othmane said.

""They take him from you, your entire world stops,"" Alrashid said.

After his arrest, he was taken to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown Los Angeles, where he was held for 13 days.

""No sleep, snacks only, no toothbrush,"" Othmane said. ""I didn't brush my teeth for 13 days. These are inhumane conditions.""

The Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration has ensnared not only immigrants without legal status but legal permanent residents like Othmane who has green cards. Some U.S. citizens have even been arrested. Meanwhile, many asylum-seekers who have regular check-in appointments are being arrested in the hallways outside courtrooms as the White House works toward its promise of mass deportations.

Alrashid said her husband has been in the U.S. since 2015 and overstayed his visa, but his deportation order was dismissed in 2020. They wed in March 2025 and immediately filed for a green card.

In a statement earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security noted the expiration of his tourist visa but did not address the dismissal of the deportation order in 2020 nor his pending green card application.

Alrashid on Friday said she was just happy that her husband was released and was back home.

""He's nice to people. While he was there he was kind to everybody,"" Alrashid said. ""Even the officers in the detention center and in the Federal Building liked him because he was so kind to them.""

Othmane is out of custody but is now wearing an ankle monitor and has to stay within a 70-mile radius of Los Angeles.

""I'm handling things well,"" he said. ""I'm just happy I'm back to my family. I'm happy I'm safe.""

He said that despite his ordeal, he's not angry with the government.

""No, I love this country,"" Othmane said. ""I never blame a country for mistakes that can happen. I just want these mistake to not happen to anyone.""

Alrashid said for years her husband has performed classical Arabic music across Southern California. They first met when he was singing at a restaurant.

""The ankle monitor is definitely weighing us down,"" she said. ""He couldn't do his production, his taping the other day at a studio he loves in Temecula because it's over 70 miles away.""

Although Othmane is back home, he still doesn't know how long the process of legalization will take. There is still uncertainty and the couple says it will involve more court hearings and could take months.

Commuting to East L.A. from her home in Orange County would have put her at risk due to her immigration status.
But to him, it’s a part of the culture in East L.A.","This story was originally published by Boyle Heights Beat on Aug. 27, 2025.

Sonia Landeros, co-owner of Party Planet Supplies in East L.A., said fewer people are buying decorations like balloons and streamers. She said sales at her store have dropped nearly 70%.

“We have to adapt to this new economy,” she said.

Even those who still rent party equipment are planning for smaller gatherings, reserving fewer tables and chairs.

“They celebrate but they celebrate with fear,” Landeros said as she masterfully sliced pieces of cardboard for a piñata she was assembling.

Even sales of piñatas at her store have been impacted. The family business would normally sell around 30 piñatas a week before the raids began. Now, they struggle to sell more than 10, leaving colorful piñatas shaped as mermaids, estrellas and even tequila bottles hanging from the ceiling.

When Mariana Ramirez earned her PhD this summer, she planned to celebrate with friends and family in City Terrace. But just weeks before the party, ICE raids swept across Los Angeles, sparking fear throughout communities.

“I just didn’t feel it was the right moment to celebrate,” she said. “There was so much violence going on outside and attacks against my community.”

Ramirez canceled the event, joining a number of families who have had to do the same.

Across Boyle Heights and East L.A. families have scaled back or scrapped celebrations altogether out of fear that masked immigration agents will descend on their homes. Local party supply businesses, from jumper rentals to piñata makers, say they’re losing thousands as a result.

Changes in partygoer behavior

For brick-and-mortar party supply and gear rental stores, even ones that have been around for decades, business has dramatically dropped.

The economic toll of the ICE raids has also gripped downtown L.A.’s Piñata District, where a lack of customers has forced business owners to adapt. One business reported a 90% drop in sales.

To Melissa Arreola, Landeros’ adult niece, who has helped out at the shop since she was 12, the area around Party Planet Supplies has resembled a ghost town for more than two months.

“Nobody wants to go out right now because they don’t know if they’re gonna be profiled and taken because it’s unpredictable,” the now 35-year-old said, referring to the tactics seen used by immigration enforcement agents despite a court order banning detention stops without “reasonable suspicion.”

ICE raids rain on summer profits

Just a few blocks north past El Pino, Carlos Martinez, owner of CM Event Rentals, said his summer profits vanished after the raids began. His company rents out jumpers, tables, chairs, tents, and other party equipment, mostly to clients Boyle Heights, East L.A., Montebello and surrounding Eastside neighborhoods.

“After May, our sales just went down dramatically. We were used to having like at least 10 to 20 rentals every weekend, and now we’re just having like one or two… They just didn’t want to have parties,” Martinez said.

Martinez estimates he’s lost upwards of $22,000 due to event cancellations.

Nearly all of his clients who cancelled their celebrations for birthdays or quinceñeras said their decisions were based on fear brought on by the ICE raids in Southern California, Martinez said.

But instead of keeping deposits and totally cancelling bookings, Martinez has been giving his clients up to one year to reschedule, because he, too, understands the fear of immigration enforcement.

“We live in a Hispanic community… It’s scary to be out there. We’re going through a scary moment,” he said.

Even the caterer Ramirez booked for her party was relieved she canceled. Commuting to East L.A. from her home in Orange County would have put her at risk due to her immigration status.

Instead, she celebrated quietly with her parents and siblings.

“I got so much love and support from my community and so much understanding,” Ramirez said. “I felt celebrated even without a party.”

Celebrations as “an act of rebellion”

Still, not everyone is canceling. Carlos Tinoco, 36, says his East L.A.neighbors continue to hold their usual weekend celebrations with loud banda horns and reggaeton beats pouring from speakers hours into the night.

He admits the gatherings made him nervous at first. “I remember one weekend I was thinking to myself, ‘Maybe they really should [take a break],’” he said.

By the numbers: 51% of Republicans and GOP-leaning voters view the Justice Department favorably — up 18 points from last year.

Only 28% of Democrats or Democratic-leaning voters hold that view, down 27 points from last year.

The ruling voided all those tariffs, with the judges finding the president’s measures “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”.
The court largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York that ruled Trump’s tariffs were illegal.
But Friday’s ruling tossed out a part of that ruling that would have struck down the tariffs immediately.
The ruling could also put Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward.","Donald Trump suffered the biggest defeat yet to his tariff policies on Friday, as a federal appeals court ruled he had overstepped his presidential powers when he enacted punitive financial measures against almost every country in the world.

In a 7-4 ruling, the Washington DC court said that while US law “bestows significant authority on the president to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency”, none of those actions allow for the imposition of tariffs or taxes.

It means the ultimate ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs, which were famously based on spurious economic science and rocked the global economy when he announced them in April, will probably be made by the US supreme court.

Here’s what to know.

Which tariffs did the court knock down?

The decision centers on the tariffs Trump introduced on 2 April, on what he called “liberation day”. The tariffs set a 10% baseline on virtually all of the US’s trading partners and so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on countries he argued have unfairly treated the US. Lesotho, a country of 2.3 million people in southern Africa, was hit with a 50% tariff, while Trump also announced a tariff of 10% on a group of uninhabited islands populated by penguins.

The ruling voided all those tariffs, with the judges finding the president’s measures “unbounded in scope, amount and duration”. They said the tariffs “assert an expansive authority that is beyond the express limitations” of the law his administration used to pass them.

Tariffs typically need to be approved by Congress, but Trump claimed he has the right to impose tariffs on trading partners under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which in some circumstances grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit international transactions during a national emergency.

The court ruled: “It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs.”

Trump invoked the same law in February to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, claiming that the flow of undocumented immigrants and drugs across the US border amounted to a national emergency, and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.

Are the tariffs gone now?

No. The court largely upheld a May decision by a federal trade court in New York that ruled Trump’s tariffs were illegal. But Friday’s ruling tossed out a part of that ruling that would have struck down the tariffs immediately.

The court said the ruling would not take effect until 14 October. That allows the Trump administration time to appeal to the majority-conservative US supreme court, which will have the ultimate say on whether Trump has the legal right, as president, to upend US trade policy.

What does this mean for Trump’s trade agenda?

The government has argued that if Trump’s tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it has collected, which would deliver a financial blow to the US treasury.

Revenue from tariffs totaled $159bn by July, more than double what it was at the same point last year. The justice department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean “financial ruin” for the United States.

The ruling could also put Trump on shaky ground in trying to impose tariffs going forward. The president does have alternative laws for imposing import tariffs, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.

In its decision in May, the trade court said that Trump has more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and to just 150 days on countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.

How has Trump responded

He’s not happy. Trump spent Friday evening reposting dozens of social media posts that were critical of the court’s decision. In a post on his own social media site, Trump claimed, as he tends to do when judges rule against him, that the decision was made by a “highly partisan appeals court”.

“If these Tariffs ever went away, it would be a total disaster for the Country,” Trump wrote. He added: “If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America.”

Trump claimed “tariffs are the best tool to help our workers”, despite their costs being typically borne by everyday Americans. The tariffs have triggered economic and political uncertainty across the world and stoked fears of rising inflation.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/434565e9da3de5e094224afb0f173eadbf4f8a97/408_0_4076_3261/master/4076.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=03b3ed56ee0dc8fee49095a7566e599b",N,,2025-08-30 18:56:46.958696

This was the concern during the first administration, too, but career foreign affairs professionals continued much of the day-to-day work that has supported human rights for decades.

This time around, however, Trump’s team ousted or undermined anyone who might try to stay the course and has taken an even more nefarious approach. Rather than ignore human rights, the administration is twisting the concept in support of a political agenda that undermines equality, justice and human security in the world by reinforcing only the rights of the strong at the expense of the weak.

Two recent examples are particularly alarming: the rewriting of the U.S. State Department’s annual human rights reports and the proposed plan for refugee admissions.

Since 1977, Congress has mandated that the State Department report on the human rights record of countries around the world to inform U.S. policy decisions on everything from foreign economic and military assistance, to sanctions, immigration and asylum. We didn’t want our assistance to prop up bad actors, so we needed to know how our partners acted. As a career diplomat, I updated the annual report in each country where I served.

Political realities occasionally influenced some reports, but for the most part, they were widely recognized as accurate and fair, assessing internationally recognized categories of rights and researched and written by professionals on the ground. Lawyers, rights groups and foreign governments anticipated their release each year and used them to support court cases, asylum claims and advocacy. Congressional staff relied on them heavily. I was proud to be part of this effort.

This year’s reports, just released this month, will not carry that credibility. Several key sections were deleted wholesale, including those addressing the world’s most vulnerable: women, LGBTQ+ communities and minority groups in general. The only area of discrimination retained is on antisemitism, and the reports equate any critique of Israel’s government as such. References to government corruption were dropped entirely. Most reporting on political rights and inclusion, including free and fair elections, was also deleted. The rights of the most vulnerable, and their tools for fighting back, were all left on the cutting room floor.

The sections that remain are manipulated to reflect a world of fiction in which Germany and the United Kingdom pose greater threats to human rights than El Salvador, which was reported to have literally “no credible reports of significant human rights abuses.” Only last year, the State Department reported a laundry list of El Salvador’s offenses, including lethal prison conditions – a convenient about-face for an administration using these same prisons as gulags for its deported immigrants. The grave offenses of our European allies included prohibiting hate speech and Nazi propaganda and preserving safe perimeters around abortion clinics.

In this imaginary world, the gravest human rights offense in South Africa is land reform to address historic inequities that persist from the apartheid era, which the report lists under its section on “Torture and Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.” The law in question is complicated but measured– nothing akin to the land grab Trump has claimed it to be, and his allegations of a ” white genocide” are not only false but offensive.

Which leads me to my second example: refugee admissions. Each year, the president determines how many refugees we will admit and designates allotments per region. This is typically based on humanitarian need, national interest considerations, and the ability to process and integrate them.

This administration is reportedly planning to set the limit to 40,000 (less than one-third of last year’s allotment), with 30,000 of those slots reserved for Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended white minority in South Africa. But white South Africans as a category do not meet the basic legal requirements for refugee status, since they are not, in fact, victims of targeted violence or political persecution. This means only 10,000 actual refugees could qualify for admission to the United States in the coming year – a historically low figure when refugee numbers are at a historic high.

Countries are not mandated by law or treaty to take in refugees, so the low numbers are disappointing but not legally questionable. What is both legally and morally objectionable, however, is the blatant racism in the administration’s refugee admissions. South Africa is a country of violent crime, but white South Africans face far less of it statistically than Black South Africans do. The idea they are politically and economically targeted is false. White South Africans make up about 8% of the population but hold about 75% of privately owned land, and they earn on average five times as much as Black South Africans. Apparently, Trump believes they are entitled to maintain this superiority.

The through line here isn’t pretty, but it’s clear. This administration is manipulating human rights platforms, not to promote rights and justice for all but in furtherance of a world where those who have historically held the most power can continue to wield it against everyone else.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/8ePGqvcrfEyDWarPun2it4U7_Mo=/1200x630/smart/media.spokesman.com/photos/2025/08/29/68add08ae0301.hires.jpg,N,,2025-08-30 19:56:49.747050

Two people fighting the fire on the Olympic Peninsula were arrested by federal law enforcement Wednesday, as depicted in photos and videos. The two firefighters had entered the U.S. illegally, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Thursday in a news release.

The 9,200-acre wildfire is one of Washington’s largest. The crews, pictured wearing protective clothing and hard hats common on fire lines, were part of the 300-person effort to contain the fire, which started July 6 about 10 miles northwest of Hoodsport, Mason County.

The arrests received swift backlash from elected leaders across the Northwest and nationwide.

Fifty members of Congress questioned the action in a letter Friday to DHS, CBP and the Bureau of Land Management.

“The two arrests and dozens of firefighters temporarily sidelined during an active wildfire raise questions about the priorities and (judgment) exercised by federal agencies,” reads the letter, spearheaded by U.S. Rep. Emily Randall. Randall’s congressional district includes the Olympic Peninsula, where the fire is burning.

The lawmakers specifically seek clarification on Immigration and Customs Enforcement policies regarding arrests in disaster areas. The letter claims standard emergency protocols “shield first responders” who are working in hazardous conditions from ICE. The lawmakers say those protocols weren’t followed.

“The arrest of these hardworking crew members, who put their lives on the line to perform lifesaving duties, is not making our communities safer, no matter the rhetoric you use on TV,” the lawmakers said. “The Trump Administration’s thoughtless and cruel immigration enforcement at any cost undermines coordinated emergency response efforts.”

Federal agents checked the immigration status of firefighters on the active wildfire in a remote location. The agents identified two people who were in the U.S. illegally, a DHS release said, and took them to a detention facility in Bellingham.

Before the arrests, contract fire crews were sent to the northeast side of Lake Cushman. They had been assigned to a Community Hazard Reduction Project, cutting wood to reduce the fuel available for the fire.

The aftermath of the arrests and subsequent outrage saw the Department of Homeland Security claim Friday that the two arrested were not technically firefighters because they were cutting wood.

“The two contracted work crews questioned on the day of their arrests were not even assigned to actively fight the fire; they were there in a support role, cutting logs into firewood,” the Friday post to X reads. “The firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time.”

The U.S. Department of the Interior defines an entry-level wildland firefighter as someone who, among other tasks, chops brush. Forest Service spokesperson Jennifer Risdal did not respond directly to questions about the veracity of the DHS post.

“USDA Forest Service is aware of a Border Patrol operation on the Bear Gulch Fire,” Risdal said in an emailed statement Saturday. “There have been no impacts to firefighting efforts and progress continues to be made on containment.”

The fire was 13% contained as of Saturday afternoon, according to a federal interagency report.

What was essentially the last pocket rescission occurred in 1977 by Democratic then-President Jimmy Carter, and the Trump administration argues it's a legally permissible tool despite some murkiness as Carter had initially proposed the clawback well ahead of the 45-day deadline.

Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) voted against his $9 billion rescission package earlier this year.
Trump's 'pocket recissions' are lawless and absurd.","Democracy defenders and members of Congress are condemning US President Donald Trump's effort to use a ""pocket rescission"" process to block $4.9 billion in foreign aid as authoritarian and illegal.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on Friday shared on social media Trump's letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) about the move. According to a White House fact sheet linked in a subsequent post, much of the money was headed for the US Department of State and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which Trump has gutted.

As The Associated Press explained:

The 1974 Impoundment Control Act gives the president the authority to propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Congress can within 45 days vote on pulling back the funds or sustaining them, but by proposing the rescission so close to September 30 the White House argues that the money won’t be spent and the funding lapses.

What was essentially the last pocket rescission occurred in 1977 by Democratic then-President Jimmy Carter, and the Trump administration argues it's a legally permissible tool despite some murkiness as Carter had initially proposed the clawback well ahead of the 45-day deadline.

Shortly after the OMB social media posts, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that OMB Director Russ Vought was helping shutter USAID, writing on the platform X: ""Since January, we've saved the taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. And with a small set of core programs moved over to the State Department, USAID is officially in closeout mode. Russ is now at the helm to oversee the closeout of an agency that long ago went off the rails. Congrats, Russ.""

Meanwhile, Rubio's former congressional colleagues and others are sounding the alarm over the administration's effort.

""America is staring down next month's government funding deadline on September 30,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). ""It's clear neither Trump nor congressional Republicans have any plan to avoid a painful and entirely unnecessary shutdown. With Trump's illegal 'pocket rescission': They seem eager to inflict further pain on the American people, raising their healthcare costs, compromising essential services, and further damaging our national security.""

Congressman Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) also put pressure on GOP lawmakers, saying that ""this is wrong—and illegal. Not only is Trump gutting $5 billion in foreign aid that saves lives and advances America's interests, but he's doing so using an unlawful 'pocket recission' method that undermines Congress' power of the purse. I urge my Republican colleagues to say hell no.""

While most Republicans on Capitol Hill have backed Trump's endeavors to claw back funding previously appropriated by Congress, GOP Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) voted against his $9 billion rescission package earlier this year.

Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, also spoke out against Trump's new move, noting in a Friday statement that under the US Constitution, Congress has ""the power of the purse,"" and the Government Accountability Office ""has concluded that this type of rescission is unlawful and not permitted by the Impoundment Control Act.""

Congressman Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a constitutional scholar, similarly stressed that ""Congress—and only Congress—passes budgets. Because the president's job is to take care the laws are faithfully executed, he must spend the money as directed. Trump's 'pocket recissions' are lawless and absurd. If a president opposes legislative spending decisions, he can veto them, subject to override, but once passed, he must execute on them.""

Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the watchdog group Public Citizen, declared in a Friday statement that with the pocket rescission move, the Trump administration ""demonstrated yet again its contempt for Congress' power of the purse and the Constitution's separation of powers.""

""With this Constitution-mocking action, the administration is bringing us closer to a shutdown on September 30, and it doesn't seem to care,"" Gilbert said. ""We call on Congress to push back, pass and abide by appropriations packages, and fight the administration’s illegal impoundments that harm regular Americans.""

""This is not just a constitutional crisis, it's a matter of global justice,"" she added. ""The congressionally appropriated funds that the Trump administration illegally aims to cancel support economic development programs to empower the world's most vulnerable and impoverished, and address some of the ravage of catastrophic climate change in developing nations.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61230871&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-08-30 16:56:43.595290

It would only say it cooperates with other federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security.
Manning said in a letter to Oregon senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, that the arrest violated homeland security policy.
Firefighters put their lives on the line, Wyden emphasized, including the Oregon firefighter who died on Sunday while battling a wildfire in south-western Montana.","Lawyers are demanding the release of a longtime Oregon resident arrested by US border patrol while fighting a Washington state wildfire, saying Friday that the firefighter was already on track for legal status after helping federal investigators solve a crime against his family.

His arrest was illegal, the lawyers said, and violated Department of Homeland Security polices that say immigration enforcement must not be conducted at locations where emergency responses are happening.

He is one of two firefighters arrested this week while working the Bear Gulch fire in the Olympic national forest, which as of Friday had burned about 14 sq miles (36 sq km) and was only 13% contained, forcing evacuations.

US Customs and Border Protection said in a statement on Thursday that it had been helping the Bureau of Land Management with a criminal investigation into two contractors working at the fire when it discovered two firefighters who they said were in the country without permanent legal status.

The firefighter, whose name has not been made public, has lived in the US for 19 years after arriving with his family at the age of four. He received a U-visa certification from the US attorney’s office in Oregon in 2017 and submitted his U-visa application with US Citizenship and Immigration Services the following year.

The U-visa program was established by Congress to protect victims of serious crimes who assist federal investigators, and the man has been waiting since 2018 for the immigration agency to decide on his application, according to Stephen Manning, a lawyer with Innovation Law Lab, a Portland-based non-profit representing the firefighter.

Another homeland security policy says agents cannot detain people who are receiving or have applied for victim-based immigration benefits, his lawyer said. Charging the man with an immigration violation was “an illegal after-the-fact justification” given his U-visa status.

His lawyers said Friday that they located him in the immigration detention system and were able to make contact. They were still processing information and are demanding his immediate release, they told the AP in an email.

A senior DHS official said in a statement to the AP on Friday that the two men apprehended were not firefighters and were not actively fighting the fire. Officials said they were providing a supporting role by cutting logs into firewood.

“The firefighting response remained uninterrupted the entire time,” the statement said. “No active firefighters were even questioned, and US Border Patrol’s actions did not prevent or interfere with any personnel actively engaged in firefighting efforts.”

When the Bureau of Land Management was asked to provide information about why its contracts with two companies were terminated and 42 firefighters were escorted away from the state’s largest wildfire, it declined. It would only say it cooperates with other federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security.

“These law enforcement professionals contribute to broader federal enforcement efforts by maintaining public safety, protecting natural resources, and collaborating with the agencies, such as the Border Patrol,” interior department spokesperson Alyse Sharpe told the Associated Press in an email.

Manning said in a letter to Oregon senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat, that the arrest violated homeland security policy.

Wyden was critical of the border patrol’s operation, saying the Trump administration was more concerned about conducting raids on fire crews than protecting communities from catastrophic fires. Firefighters put their lives on the line, Wyden emphasized, including the Oregon firefighter who died on Sunday while battling a wildfire in south-western Montana.

“The last thing that wildland firefighter crews need is to be worried about masked individuals trampling their due process rights,” Wyden said in an email to the AP.

Meanwhile, wildfire officials were still trying to get control of the Bear Gulch fire. The number of personnel working on the blaze was listed at 303 on Friday, down from 349 on Thursday.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab469b7fdb99aac84bef57c641c8cc488a3f2f6a/206_0_1402_1122/master/1402.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=84489fe55a8f506fbeb1567e7168cda0",N,,2025-08-30 18:57:54.990775

But the main problem is that ditching the ECHR would do almost nothing to solve the asylum crisis.
The ECHR says nothing about asylum, nothing about the right to enter or remain in a country.
This is the real legal problem, and easier to reform.
We’re talking about saving our domestic political system.” Once, calls for a new asylum system came from the fringes of politics.","It’s a classic story of mission creep. Remedying this by temporarily or permanently pulling out of the ECHR — in respect of asylum or anything else — has obvious appeal. It’s radical. It can be seen as a re-enactment of Brexit: a story of good people and bad law, taking back control of justice. It would not turn Britain into a legal pariah or make us the new Belarus, as some ludicrously claim. But the main problem is that ditching the ECHR would do almost nothing to solve the asylum crisis.

The law, as it stands, has certainly forced the prime minister into a terrible position. In order to keep Ethiopians, Eritreans and others at the Bell Hotel in Epping, the Home Office lodged a legal appeal saying, among other things, that the human rights of these asylum seekers outweigh the concerns and protests of local citizens. So: prime minister v the people. Lord Justice Bean has handed the Home Office an emphatic victory but on terms that could hardly be more politically damaging (or helpful to Reform UK).

It’s just hopeless, says Rifkind: because as long as we are signatories to the ECHR then there’s no point in changing British law. If we do, asylum seekers will simply appeal to Strasbourg and win. There’s no need to heed the “inconsistent or incoherent interpretations” of the Strasbourg judges, says Straw: Britain has its own human rights laws. They offer enough security. It won’t be long until the Conservative Party ends up advocating ECHR withdrawal and Starmer faces huge pressure from his party to follow suit.

It is difficult but doable. Legally, Strasbourg only has as much power over our law as parliament wishes to give it. This is a point that judges frequently make to angry ministers: they’re your laws. The idea of rule-by-lawyers is a myth. If the Supreme Court itself ever reaches a conclusion that does not command the support of parliament — on asylum or anything else — then parliament can settle the matter by re-legislating; passing a new law. It is the supreme lawmaking body, beyond challenge by judges or monarchs.

Yet this, the sheer power of British democracy, often seems to terrify politicians. That’s why, over the years, they parcelled off laws to the courts: to dodge accountability, blame the courts. The irony of Brexit was that it removed a fig leaf for the Tories: when they lost control of immigration there was no one else to blame. Nor can Starmer blame anyone else for unjust laws: he has a huge majority. The entire legal system is his to change.

The ECHR says nothing about asylum, nothing about the right to enter or remain in a country. It could be abolished tomorrow and small-boat arrivals would still come to claim the same rights. Rifkind says the ECHR explains why ministers find it impossible to expel foreign criminals but a recent study of such cases showed that it was used by 2.5 per cent of successful cases over the past five years. Since 1980, just 13 deportation or extradition cases have been overturned by Strasbourg. A problem? Certainly. But a small part of a far bigger mess.

When Rishi Sunak’s Rwanda deportation plan was quashed by the Supreme Court, it pointed to a whole architecture of other laws, treaties and so-called non-refoulement rules that need to be overcome beyond the ECHR. And yes, it does mention torture: but any new system would keep this basic safeguard. The main problem, which most critics seem to miss, is the Refugee Convention obliging Britain to settle everyone with a “well-founded fear of persecution”. A definition that covers much of the world’s population who, now, have the money to travel.

This is the real legal problem, and easier to reform. It’s perhaps not as politically juicy a target, as it doesn’t include the word “European”, but the small-boat arrivals who stake their right to stay are citing this law. Ken Macdonald, Starmer’s predecessor as director of public prosecutions, has argued for new refugee laws in the House of Lords, saying the crisis needs to be tackled at the proper legal source. And those who worry about trashing international law, he tells me, need to bear something else in mind. “We’re staring authoritarianism in the face. We’re talking about saving our domestic political system.”

Once, calls for a new asylum system came from the fringes of politics. Now, the case for reform is being made not by populists but by political and legal heavyweights who know the limits of the current system. They see it imploding, crushed by a weight it was never designed to carry. What’s persuading them to go public is that they can also see what might come next.

The real question is whether the prime minister will have the courage to follow where the distinguished judges, former lord chancellors and ex-home secretaries are now pointing. Britain does not need to break international law to regain control of its borders. But it does need new laws, made in Westminster, to replace treaties designed for another age.

This is not the time to worry about trivial reshuffles: it’s a moment for a political leader who knows the law, its complexities and the methods of legal combat. If Starmer knows someone who fits that description, it might be a good time to give him a call.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2Fmethode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2Fcd2f359c-7f75-4f23-8a16-bfb680b5bac3.jpg?crop=1322%2C744%2C139%2C74&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-30 15:56:59.972080

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court ruling that maintained temporary protected status designations for Venezuelans while they challenge actions by Trump’s administration in court.

The 9th Circuit judges found that plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had no authority to vacate or set aside a prior extension of temporary protected status because the governing statute written by Congress does not permit it. Then-President Joe Biden’s Democratic administration had extended temporary protected status, commonly known as TPS, for people from Venezuela.

“In enacting the TPS statute, Congress designed a system of temporary status that was predictable, dependable, and insulated from electoral politics,” U.S. Circuit Judge Kim Wardlaw, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton, wrote for the panel in a decision joined by two other judges also nominated by Democratic presidents.

But it is unclear what effect Friday’s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans in the group of 600,000 whose protections expired in April. Their lawyers say some have already been fired from jobs, detained in immigration jails, separated from their U.S. citizen children and even deported.

Protections for the remaining 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire Sept. 10.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration had overstepped its authority in terminating the protections. Chen postponed the terminations, but the Supreme Court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.

In an email, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security blasted Friday’s decision as more obstruction from “unelected activist” judges.

“For decades the TPS program has been abused, exploited, and politicized as a de facto amnesty program,” the email read. “While this injunction delays justice and undermines the integrity of our immigration system, Secretary Noem will use every legal option at the Department’s disposal to end this chaos and prioritize the safety of Americans.”

Congress authorized temporary protected status, or TPS, as part of the Immigration Act of 1990. It allows the secretary of DHS to grant legal immigration status to people fleeing countries experiencing civil strife, environmental disaster or other “extraordinary and temporary conditions” that prevent a safe return to that home country. The terms are for six, 12 and 18 months.

The appellate judges said the guaranteed time limitations were critical so people could gain employment, find long-term housing and build stability without fear of shifting political winds.

In ending the protections soon after Trump took office, Noem said conditions in Venezuela had improved and it was not in the U.S. national interest to allow migrants from there to stay on for what is a temporary program. It’s part of a broader move by Trump’s administration to reduce the number of immigrants who are in the country either without legal documentation or through legal temporary programs.

“What is really significant now is that the second court unanimously recognized that the trial court got it right,” said Emi MacLean, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Foundation of Northern California representing plaintiffs.

She added that while the decision might not benefit immediately those people who have already lost their status or are about to lose their status, Friday’s ruling “should provide a path for the administration’s illegal actions related to Venezuela and TPS to finally be undone.”

A court declaration provided by plaintiffs showed the turmoil caused by the Trump administration and Supreme Court decision.

A Washington woman who worked in restaurants was deported in June along with her daughters, 10 years and 15 months old, after ICE officers told her to bring her children to an immigration check-in. The father of the baby, who is a U.S. citizen, remains in the U.S. while the woman tries to figure out what to do.

Also in June, a FedEx employee appeared in uniform at his required immigration check-in only to be detained, the court declaration states. He slept for about two weeks on a floor, terrified he would be sent to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison. His wife cannot maintain the household on her earnings.

“I am not a criminal,” he said in the declaration, adding that “immigrants like myself come to the United States to work hard and contribute, and instead our families and lives are being torn apart.”

Millions of Venezuelans have fled political unrest, mass unemployment and hunger. Their country is mired in a prolonged crisis brought on by years of hyperinflation, political corruption, economic mismanagement and an ineffectual government.

Attorneys for the U.S. government argued the Homeland Security secretary’s clear and broad authority to make determinations related to the TPS program were not subject to judicial review. They also denied that Noem’s actions were motivated by racial animus.

But the appellate judges said courts clearly had jurisdiction in cases where the actions were unlawful. They declined to address whether Noem was motivated by racial animus.",https://www.binghamtonhomepage.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/79/2025/08/68b23f1d96c0b6.40047609.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-08-30 17:56:58.211830

Every Oregon sheriff except two supports a recent Marion County lawsuit which is asking a federal court to decide if the county can release information about people on parole in response to administrative subpoenas from immigration authorities.

Thirty four of Oregon’s 36 county sheriffs — including Lincoln County Sheriff Adam Shanks — signed a letter supporting the lawsuit against federal agencies and Gov. Tina Kotek, which asks a judge to weigh in on what the county described as conflicts between the state’s sanctuary law, public records law and federal law.

“We agree that there is a good deal of uncertainty in how these state and federal laws apply to local governments and sheriff’s offices in the state of Oregon, including those situations where a sheriff’s office or local government is served with an administrative subpoena,” the Oregon State Sheriffs Association letter said.

Sheriffs from Multnomah and Washington counties were the only Oregon sheriffs who did not sign the letter.

The county filed the lawsuit in Eugene U.S. District Court Aug. 18 regarding federal requests for information about people on county parole supervision.

The suit followed four administrative subpoenas U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office Aug. 1 for information about people on parole for offenses including rape, sexual abuse and kidnapping, according to the lawsuit.

The four people are alleged to be undocumented immigrants, a county statement said last week.

ICE requested each person’s home address, phone number, driver’s license number, country of origin, employer and information about the crimes they were convicted of.

Oregon’s sanctuary law prevents agencies from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement or sharing information about someone in their custody unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Government agencies can only cooperate with court-ordered subpoenas, and not administrative ones, like the subpoenas Marion County received.

Sanctuary law allows agencies to share public information with immigration authorities, but it bars sharing a person’s address, workplace, school or contact information unless other laws require it.

The county’s lawsuit claims that while state law restricts responding to subpoenas, federal law requires cooperation with federal subpoenas.

The association asked Marion County to request a detailed ruling from a federal judge that addresses all local agencies to help “ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

“Uncertainty from conflicting laws is bad for everyone,” Steve Elzinga, legal counsel for Marion County, said in a statement Thursday. “Marion County seeks legal clarity that will benefit all Oregonians, especially the dedicated law enforcement officers across our state who work hard to keep us safe and are currently stuck in the middle of conflicting state and federal laws.”

Since the county filed its lawsuit, local Democrats have denounced it.

“Despite four decades of legal precedent, through seven presidential administrations, Marion County taxpayers foot the bill for this disingenuous legal dispute in an attempt to reshape Oregon’s laws,” the Democratic Party of Marion County said on Facebook.

The group launched an effort to send letters to the Marion County Commission opposing the lawsuit. So far, over 600 letters have been sent online.

A consulting agency founded by former state Rep. Teresa Alonso Leon, a Woodburn Democrat, also posted a statement opposing the lawsuit.

The lawsuit could make a “loophole” allowing ICE administrative subpoenas to be treated like court-ordered ones, the agency said, and would “pretty much kill the sanctuary law.”",https://lincolnchronicle.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cropped-LC-favi-32x32.png,N,,2025-08-30 13:57:20.092993

The letter was posted Friday morning on the X account of the White House Office of Management and Budget.

Trump’s move rests on a tool not used in nearly 50 years, known as a pocket rescission: A president submits a request to Congress to not spend approved funds toward the end of the fiscal year so that Congress can’t act on the request in the 45-day time frame, and the money goes unspent as a result. The fiscal year draws to a close at the end of September.

Such a move, if standardized by the White House, could effectively bypass Congress on key spending choices and potentially wrest some control over spending from the House and the Senate.

Here's the latest:

The Environmental Protection Agency on Friday fired at least eight employees who signed a letter criticizing the agency's leadership under Administrator Lee Zeldin and Trump.

The declaration of dissent, signed by more than 170 employees in late June, “contains inaccurate information designed to mislead the public about agency business,’′ an EPA spokesperson said.

“Thankfully, this represents a small fraction of the thousands of hard-working, dedicated EPA employees who are not trying to mislead and scare the American public,” the spokesperson said.

EPA declined to say how many employees were disciplined, but the agency’s largest union said at least six probationary employees who signed the letter were fired, along with at least two career employees.

The union, part of the American Federation of Government Employees, condemned the firings as “an assault on labor and free-speech rights.”

Since sending the National Guard to Los Angeles and Washington, the president has openly mused about sending troops to some of the nation's most Democratic cities — including Chicago and Baltimore — claiming they are needed to crack down on crime.

Though most violent crime has fallen in recent years in the cities he has called out, Trump said Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker ""should be calling me, and he should be saying, 'Can you send over the troops please?' It's out of control.""

Whether Trump can repeat what he’s done in LA and the nation’s capital — call up the National Guard and have it assist a surge of federal law enforcement and immigration officers — is an open question and likely to become a point of contention should he press forward.

Jim O’Neill, a former investor, critic of health regulations and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s deputy, is taking control of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention following a tumultuous week in which its director was forced out.

O'Neill was picked to be interim director, supplanting Susan Monarez, a longtime government scientist who been director for less than a month. Her lawyers said she refused ""to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated health experts.""

A former associate of billionaire tech entrepreneur Peter Thiel, O'Neill previously helped run one of Thiel's investment funds and later managed several other projects. He has no training in medicine or health care and holds bachelor's and master's degrees in humanities.

O’Neill said Friday on social media that he looks forward to working with CDC staff and “announcing additions to the senior leadership in the weeks ahead.” He is to remain as HHS deputy.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys’ concerns are related to his human smuggling case in Tennessee.

They say administration officials keep attacking him with prejudicial and false statements and are asking a federal judge to order officials involved with his case to hold back on their comments. Those would include Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

Abrego Garcia became a flashpoint over Trump’s immigration polices when he was wrongfully deported to El Salvador.

The Republican administration is trying to deport him again, this time to Uganda.

The Justice Department and the acting U.S. attorney who is prosecuting the human smuggling case declined to comment.

DHS said in a statement: “If Kilmar Abrego Garcia did not want to be mentioned by the Secretary of Homeland Security, then he should have not entered our country illegally and committed heinous crimes.”

Charles Borges, chief data officer, said in a letter to Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano that he is resigning due to the agency’s actions against him since he filed his whistleblower complaint this week.

“I have suffered exclusion, isolation, internal strife, and a culture of fear, creating a hostile work environment and making work conditions intolerable,” Borges wrote.

The Project Government Accountability Office, which is representing him in his whistleblower case, posted the letter on its website.

Borges’ attorney said he “no longer felt that he could continue to work for the Social Security Administration in good conscience, given what he had witnessed.” It added that he would continue to work with the proper oversight bodies.

Borges alleged that more than 300 million Americans' Social Security data was put at risk by Department of Government Efficiency officials who uploaded sensitive information to a cloud account not subject to oversight.

The SSA declined to comment.

The administration has approved $329 million in arms sales to Ukraine for equipment and services to keep up its Patriot air defense systems and Starlink satellite internet platform.

The State Department said Friday that it notified Congress of the sales, including $179.1 million in equipment and other support for the air defense systems, which are crucial to knocking down stepped-up Russian airstrikes.

Another $150 million sale is for satellite communications services for Starlink terminals, which were provided by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company and help facilitate battlefield communications and power drones.

The previous day the U.S. announced an additional $825 million sale to Ukraine, including extended-range missiles and related equipment to boost defensive capabilities.

Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in a statement: “Federal Courts have repeatedly done what Republican senators won’t do — say in black-and-white that Donald Trump’s tariff spree is illegal and cannot continue.”

Wyden said the sweeping tariffs are causing prices to rise for all manner of essential goods and Democrats intend to force votes on repealing them whenever possible.

“Ultimately Congress must seize back power over trade,” he added, “and make clear that Trump can’t pay for billionaire tax cuts on the backs of working families.”

Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said his government is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived unaccompanied and are being held in U.S. facilities.

The Central American nation is particularly concerned about minors who could age out of facilities for children and be sent to adult detention centers, he said. The exact number of children to be returned remains in flux, but the figure officials are currently discussing is a little over 600.

That would be almost double what Guatemala previously agreed to. The head of the country’s immigration service said last month that the government was looking to repatriate 341 unaccompanied minors who were being held in U.S. facilities.

Martínez said no date has been set yet for the return of the children.

“If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,” the president said on his social media platform.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the president had no legal right to impose the sweeping tariffs but left in place for now his effort to build a protectionist wall around the economy.

The court found that Trump was not legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on almost every country, largely upholding a decision by a specialized federal trade court.

But the court tossed out a part of that ruling striking down the tariffs immediately, allowing the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.

The decision complicates Trump’s ambitions to upend decades of trade policy unilaterally. Trump has alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act.

His tariffs — and their erratic rollout — have shaken global markets, alienated trading partners and allies and raised fears of inflation and slower economic growth.

Gov. Mike Kehoe is calling Missouri lawmakers into a special session to redraw the state’s districts as part of a growing national battle between Republicans and Democrats seeking an edge in next year’s congressional elections.

Kehoe's announcement Friday came just hours after Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a new congressional voting map designed to help Republicans gain five more seats in the midterm elections.

It marked a win for President Donald Trump, who has been urging Republican-led states to reshape districts to give the party a better shot at retaining control of the House.

Republican-led Texas took up the task first and was quickly countered by Democratic-led California. Missouri would become the third state to pursue an unusual mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage.

Missouri is represented in the House by six Republicans and two Democrats. Republicans hope to gain one more seat.

The special session is to begin Sept. 3.

Abbas and 80 other Palestinian Authority officials had their visas revoked by Secretary of State Marco Rubio ahead of next month’s annual high-level meeting of the U.N. General Assembly.

That’s according to a State Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity Friday to discuss visa issues that are normally confidential.

The State Department said earlier in a statement that the move was in “our national security interests” and accused the officials of “undermining the prospects for peace.”

The Palestinian Authority said it “expressed its deep regret and astonishment” at the visa decision, which “contravenes international law and the Headquarters Agreement, especially since the State of Palestine is an observer member of the United Nations.”

A U.S. Senator says the Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who had come to the U.S. without their parents.

Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon said in a letter to the Office of Refugee Resettlement that according to reports from unidentified whistleblowers the office has finalized a plan to deport the children in their custody back to Guatemala.

Wyden said the removals would violate the office’s “child welfare mandate and this country’s long-established obligation to these children.”

The office within the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for migrant children who arrive in the U.S. alone.

The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the latest move, which was first reported by CNN. The Guatemalan government declined to comment.

A senior U.S. diplomat at the United Nations delivered the warning at a U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine saying Russia’s latest drone and missile attacks resulting in numerous civilian casualties “cast doubt on the seriousness of Russia’s desire for peace.”

“These strikes must stop immediately,” Minister-Counselor John Kelley said. “Russia must decide now to move toward peace. The leaders of Russia and Ukraine must agree to meet bilaterally.”

Kelley noted President Donald Trump’s warning that the U.S. could take “further economic measures … if Russia instead chooses to continue this war, measures which could have far-reaching impact on Russia’s future economic prosperity.”

“The United States calls on the Russian Federation to avoid these consequences by stopping the violence and engaging constructively to end the war,” said Kelley, who is the U.S. Mission’s political coordinator.

The Department of Health and Human Services this week told 40 states to change parts of sex ed lessons that focus on LGBTQ+ issues.

If they don’t comply in 60 days, they’ll lose federal money for the lessons.

The money comes through the Personal Responsibility Education Program and is aimed at teaching homeless students, those in foster programs, minorities and those in rural areas and places with high rates of teen pregnancy.

The push to change the lessons is part of a broader effort to eliminate what Trump calls ""gender ideology.""

But some states have laws that require teaching about LGBTQ+ issues.

The Transportation Department on Friday canceled $679 million in federal funding for a dozen offshore wind projects.

The move was the latest attack by the Trump administration on the reeling U.S. offshore wind industry and comes days after the administration abruptly halted construction last week of a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut.

Funding for projects in 11 states was rescinded, including $435 million for a floating wind farm in Northern California and $47 million to boost an offshore wind project in Maryland that the Interior Department has pledged to cancel.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said that under Trump, “we are prioritizing real infrastructure improvements over fantasy wind projects that cost much and offer little.”

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the United Nations will follow up with U.S. authorities to get more details on Friday’s White House announcement.

Trump said in a letter he would not be spending $4.9 billion in foreign aid approved by Congress including $520 million for the U.N. regular budget and other U.N. agencies and $838 million for international peacekeeping.

“What can I tell you?,” Dujarric said. “This is going to make our budget situation, our liquidity situation that much more challenging.”

A federal appeals court on Friday blocked the Trump administration’s plans to end protections for 600,000 people from Venezuela who have had permission to live and work in the United States.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling that maintained temporary protected status for Venezuelans while the case proceeded through court.

U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of San Francisco found in March that plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim that the administration overstepped its authority in terminating the protections and were motivated by racial animus in doing so. Chen ordered a freeze on the terminations, but the Supreme Court reversed him without explanation, which is common in emergency appeals.

It is unclear what effect Friday’s ruling will have on the estimated 350,000 Venezuelans whose protections expired in April. Protections for another group of 250,000 Venezuelans are set to expire Sept. 10.

For those readers lucky enough to have had Crosby, Stills, and Nash as part of the musical landscape of their youth, you may recall this particular song. As a lifelong fan of the trio, I contend that it is among their best—and considering their impressive catalogue of original music, that is saying something. If you are too young to have ridden aboard the SS CSN, I urge you to give it a listen. Here it is on Spotify:

If you have a Spotify account, click the miniplayer above to hear the full song in Spotify. If you would like to listen to the full song and do not have access to Spotify, search the name of the song in your browser to listen on YouTube or another platform of your choosing. If you live in my senior retirement community in Milwaukee and have difficulty navigating such things online, just ask me and I will play it for you. If you live in the Berkshires and your name happens to be Bobbie Hallig, just ask Oskar. If you are anyone else, ask the nearest 10-year-old. They know everything.

There are few songs more timely or significant in this American moment than “Immigration Man,” as ICE agents and the unconstitutionally deployed United States military flood the streets of every village, hamlet, town, and metropolis of our country, kicking in doors, breaking car windows with axes, dragging immigrants into the streets in warrantless arrests, pummeling them to the ground, shackling them, throwing them into unmarked vehicles, and disappearing them to rot, without due process, in foreign and domestic concentration camps.

The sheer brutality is documented almost daily as concerned citizens bear witness to the reign of abject terror. The good and courageous citizens of Great Barrington have attempted to defend the innocent, to no avail; the citizens of Milwaukee have attempted to defend the innocent, to no avail. Those seeking to physically intervene to prevent the egregious violations of human rights have found themselves in handcuffs as well.

Yesterday, one of the residents of my Milwaukee retirement community observed from the window of her apartment what she believed to be an ICE operation, about a half mile from our campus. Her description of the event was as follows:

At 6 AM on August 26, as I was opening my windows, I saw a lot of flashing lights… I saw two large black, SUV type vehicles with darkened windows, with their lights flashing… Across the street was a black jeep type car with something mounted on it, I could not see it clearly to tell you what it was. Behind that was a large passenger van, again all black with blackened windows, and no markings. Anyone getting out of these cars were [dressed] in all black. Behind it was about 20 cars with people in them.

As all this was happening I… witnessed one or two people getting out of the cars and gathering in small groups. Most wore masks, some had on hats, and some wore a yellow type jacket like a crossing guard might wear. At one point [I saw] one person dressed all in black with the back of the jacket saying “ICE”, [who]walked from one of the dark SUV cars and talked with some of the people standing around.

After the hour plus of doing this routine they left.

Based on the description above, my best guess is that the collection of cars, masked thugs, and blacked-out vans were probably an indication that ICE agents were congregating at a predetermined staging area, preparatory to conducting some sort of raid. The description alone frightened me so much that I shelved the column I had almost completed and wrote this column, instead.

The fact that the people doing the confronting, pummeling, and seizing are not immediately identifiable as government agents; that they feel no need to properly identify themselves; that they are masked; and that they drive unmarked cars and vans with blacked-out windows makes it particularly unnerving, since they are now indistinguishable from the random self-appointed, mask-wearing, AR-15-wielding, zip tie-carrying, Nazified vigilantes who live down the lane.

Because we have no idea of who, really, is doing the seizing, kidnapping, and terrorizing of law-abiding United States residents, regardless of citizenship or documentation, it may be best to assume that none of the alleged “agents” are government employees and that they are all self-deputized, white nationalist, paramilitary wing nuts. If you cannot tell the two groups apart, then there are no longer two groups—just one big throng of masked goons who are more than happy to roll up their sleeves and work tirelessly to cause irreparable harm to other human beings.

In consideration of the above, I will now repost, at my wonderful wife’s suggestion, a list of caveats and strategies for individuals facing an ICE interaction, courtesy of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. The list applies to all of us: citizens, foreign nationals with legitimate visas, immigrants with green cards, legitimate asylum seekers, and the undocumented. Every individual currently residing in the United States of America—every man, woman, and child—is at risk of arrest and deportation as we rapidly transition from the United States of America to the Totalitarian States of America:

1. You have the right to remain silent.

Your right to remain silent is a powerful right under the U.S. Constitution. Exercising this right when approached by ICE can protect you from saying something that they may use to deport you. If ICE approaches you clearly state that you are choosing to remain silent. ICE will likely continue to ask you questions. Remain silent and answer none of their questions until you speak with a lawyer if you’re detained, especially about your birthplace, immigration status, or how you entered the United States. ICE may use intimidation tactics to get you to speak or incriminate yourself through actions (e.g., line up according to immigration status). Continue to remain silent and do not fall for their tricks. If you are arrested, your decision to remain silent may change depending on the facts of your case (e.g., your length of time in the United States, if you have a fear of returning to your country, etc.). Speak with an attorney and make a plan to prepare for this situation [emphasis added].

2. Remain calm and do not run away.

If ICE approaches you on the street, do not run away, as this could be a reason for ICE to arrest you. Do not consent for them to search your person or property. Do not provide any foreign or false documents. If ICE questions you on the street, ask if you are free to leave. If they say you are free to leave, calmly and silently walk away. Make a plan with an attorney on how to prepare for this situation [emphasis added].

3. You have the right to demand a judicial warrant before letting ICE into your home.

You have the right under the U.S. Constitution to be protected from unreasonable searches and seizures. This means ICE cannot enter your home without a valid judicial warrant. An ICE warrant is NOT a judicial warrant. An ICE warrant does NOT give ICE the authority to enter your home and conduct a search. If ICE claims they have a warrant, do not open the door (even a little) for them to show it to you. Ask them to slip it under the door or show it through a window.

4. You have the right to speak with a lawyer if you are arrested [emphasis added].

If you are in ICE custody, do not sign anything without speaking with an attorney first as it could eliminate your right to speak with a lawyer or have a hearing in front of an immigration judge.

5. U.S. citizens can play a vital role [emphasis added].

You have a right under the First Amendment of the Constitution to record or take photos in public view of law enforcement and ICE so long as you don’t interfere with an arrest. Obtain important information about what you witnessed (names, phone numbers of any witnesses, badge numbers, etc.).

And this last: To anyone lucky enough to be born white in America, I urge you to bear witness. If you see an arrest, stand your ground and document, document, document. We are living in a propagandic, post-truth, post-fact police state. In the very near future, the only way of ascertaining what is actually happening to our country, and all of its residents, will be for us to make note, and shout it from the rooftops, ourselves.

If the ruling had gone the other way, the government would have been forced to rehouse 138 asylum seekers in a matter of days, opening the floodgates to similar legal challenges from other councils.
Government insiders say that by the end of the year they expect at least five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close, with more to follow in the new year.

Yet he persistently confuses irregular migrants with asylum seekers who are fleeing harm.","Protesters were already gathering outside the Bell hotel by Friday evening with union flags and St George’s flags waving. This court ruling was never going to end as a quiet legal moment.

For the Home Office, the court of appeal’s decision was a practical win. If the ruling had gone the other way, the government would have been forced to rehouse 138 asylum seekers in a matter of days, opening the floodgates to similar legal challenges from other councils. Since there is scant alternative accommodation available, this ruling buys the government time.

Government insiders say that by the end of the year they expect at least five more hotels housing asylum seekers to close, with more to follow in the new year. If the closures proceed, the ruling means they still have time to deliver their promise of shutting all the hotels down “in a controlled and orderly way” by 2029.

But political tensions have, of course, been reignited. Nigel Farage immediately jumped on the moment, accusing the government of “using the law against the people of Epping”. He said “illegal migrants now have more rights than the people of Essex” and promised Reform UK would “put an end to this”. This is the kind of high-emotion, high-visibility moment Farage thrives on and is a story that plays into his hands.

Richard Tice, the deputy leader of Reform UK, also piled in, telling supporters on X: “Judges side with illegal migrants against British people. ECHR used by judges to overrule planning law, democratic protests and the safety of Epping residents.”

The government remains stuck in the same political fight: trying to stave off challenges from the right while at the same time getting on with the job of ensuring there is a functioning political project that can communicate its wins.

Kemi Badenoch, the opposition leader, has told Tory councils to “keep going” with their legal challenges, despite the court ruling making it clear that protest and local pressure will not count in planning law.

Views in her party slant right on the issue, but not exclusively. One senior Conservative MP said: “They’re human beings – they have to live somewhere. For me the issue is: where’s the deterrent?” But another backbencher said: “We have to make it impossible for them to stay open.”

Farage had described the mood in the country on Tuesday around the issue of immigration as being “a mix between total despair and rising anger”. Yet he persistently confuses irregular migrants with asylum seekers who are fleeing harm.

Recent polling shows the issue is one of voters’ biggest concerns, with a YouGov poll revealing 71% of voters think Keir Starmer is handling the asylum crisis poorly, including a majority of his own supporters. Nearly seven in 10 said immigration levels were too high, which indicates why Farage was able to seize another moment this week to claim a “genuine threat to public order” unless this issue is solved.

The government says its plan is working: the backlog is falling and deportations are increasing, and a deal with France has been signed. But as of Friday evening, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, had not commented publicly. The last post on X from the official Labour party account is a photo of Farage with the caption: “No plan. No idea.”

There is still a long way to go before Labour can look back on what it has achieved in its first parliament. But public mood is shifting faster than policy.

This Labour government did inherit a broken system, and a large number of hotels opened by the Conservatives. But it has not stopped the Tories washing their hands of it, or Farage from circling. On the streets outside the Bell hotel, the noise is getting louder, along with fears there could be more protests across the country to come.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c228196fe65879f31418788b87ad7ac829b4bf0f/500_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=40ecacde06fe0dab9adb7aea3ef66163",N,,2025-08-30 13:57:11.100373

What You Need To Know

A group of Manhattan prosecutors has been going after employers for cheating their workers out of their wages

Rachana Pathak, head of the Worker Protection Unit, says immigration enforcement fears may be keeping victims from coming forward

Many cases investigated by the unit begin with a phone call to their hotline, but Pathak says, recently, the phone just hasn’t been ringing

Since its creation in 2023, the unit has brought 11 prosecutions and recovered $1.3 million in stolen wages for more than 50 workers

Pathak runs the Worker Protection Unit in the Manhattan District Attorney’s office. The lawyers investigate allegations of wage theft and employee exploitation.

In the midst of the current immigration crackdown, the unit has found connecting with those in need has become increasingly difficult.

“There are inherent power imbalances in the type of work we do. The fear is real, and the employers prey on that fear. They don’t imagine that a lot of these workers are going to have the courage to come into a DA’s office and meet with prosecutors and be in court, so they take advantage of that,” Pathak said.

Many cases investigated by the unit begin with a phone call to their hotline, but Pathak says, recently, the phone just hasn’t been ringing.

“The numbers have dropped tremendously, steeply,” she said. “We used to get several complaints every week. Now we get a couple of complaints a month.”

Pathak says the level of fear over immigration enforcement hasn’t just kept exploited workers from reporting wage theft. It has also kept some from collecting the money they’re owed.

“I have two checks that are in our safe. We’ve called the witnesses to say, ‘Hi, we have money for you’, and they have not called us back for the past month, so I think they’re gone. And that’s just a really sad, sort of tragic part of this, of what’s going on right now,” Pathak said.

Since its creation in 2023, the Worker Protection Unit has pursued cases against Manhattan companies accused of failing to pay employees, including a talent agency, construction companies and even the famed Grimaldi’s Pizzeria.

The unit has brought 11 prosecutions and recovered $1.3 million in stolen wages for more than 50 workers. But so much of what they investigate relies on people being willing to speak up about workplace abuse.

The unit is now focused on building cases with the help of community groups as they work to make sure the public knows they do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Wage_Theft_Immigration_ny1,N,,2025-08-30 15:57:02.834494

Experts say it's a smart but risky legal move,"BEN FINLEY Associated Press, ABC News",,,,,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/kilmar-abrego-garcias-asylum-claim-experts-smart-risky-125120247,"Kilmar Abrego Garcia ’s request for asylum in the United States is a prudent legal strategy, experts say, because it gives his lawyers better options for fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to deport him.

The administration has said it now intends to deport Abrego Garcia to the African country of Uganda.
It’s where, Abrego Garcia alleges in a lawsuit, he suffered severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation and psychological torture.
His team says say he is entitled to immigration court proceedings and appeals, including to the U.S. Court of Appeals.","Kilmar Abrego Garcia ’s request for asylum in the United States is a prudent legal strategy, experts say, because it gives his lawyers better options for fighting the Trump administration’s efforts to deport him.

But it’s also a gamble. Depending on how the courts rule, Abrego Garcia could end up back inside the notorious El Salvador prison where he claims he was beaten and psychologically tortured.

“It’s a strategic move,” Memphis-based immigration attorney Andrew Rankin said of the asylum request. “And it can certainly backfire. But it’s something I would do as well if I were representing him.”

Abrego Garcia, 30, became a flashpoint over President Donald Trump’s immigration policies when he was wrongfully deported to his native country in March. The Republican administration is trying to deport him again.

Here are some things to know about his case:

The administration deported Abrego Garcia to El Salvador because U.S. officials said he was an MS-13 gang member. It’s an allegation that Abrego Garcia denies and for which he wasn’t charged.

His removal to El Salvador violated a U.S. immigration judge’s ruling from 2019 that barred his deportation there. The judge found that Abrego Garcia faced credible threats from a local gang that had extorted and terrorized his family.

Following a U.S. Supreme Court order, the administration returned him to the United States in June. But it was only to face human smuggling charges, which his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.

The administration has said it now intends to deport Abrego Garcia to the African country of Uganda. Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and the main architect of Trump’s immigration policies, told reporters Friday that Garcia has “said he doesn’t want to go back to El Salvador.”

Miller said the administration is “honoring that request by providing him with an alternate place to live.”

In an effort to fight back, Abrego Garcia has notified the U.S. government that he fears being sent to Uganda, which has documented human rights abuses. He said he believes he could be persecuted, tortured or sent from there to El Salvador.

But even if he thwarts deportation to Uganda in immigration court, he likely will face attempts to remove him to another country and then another until the administration succeeds, Rankin said.

“By the law of averages, you can’t win every case,” the lawyer said. “The government has sunk its teeth far into what they’re doing with Kilmar and immigration in general, that it wouldn’t make any sense for them to just give up the fight.”

Asylum, however, could end the fight.

The request would place the focus solely back on his native El Salvador, where Abrego Garcia has previously shown that he has a credible fear of gang persecution.

But he’s taking a risk by reopening his 2019 immigration case, Rankin said. If he loses the bid for asylum, an immigration judge could remove his protection from being returned to his native country.

That could place him back in the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT. It’s where, Abrego Garcia alleges in a lawsuit, he suffered severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation and psychological torture. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, has denied those allegations.

Abrego Garcia had applied for asylum in 2019. The immigration judge denied his request because it came more than a year after Abrego Garcia had arrived in the U.S. He had fled to Maryland without documentation around 2011.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers will likely argue that he has the right to request asylum now because he has been in the U.S. for less than a year after being wrongfully deported to El Salvador, Rankin said.

If approved, asylum could provide him with a green card and a path to citizenship.

Abrego Garcia’s asylum petition would go through the U.S. immigration court system, which is not part of the judiciary but an arm of the Department of Justice and under the Trump administration’s authority.

That’s where the risk comes in.

Abrego Garcia has a team of lawyers fighting for him, unlike many people who are facing deportation. And a federal judge is monitoring his immigration case.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys filed a federal lawsuit in Maryland to ensure he can exercise his constitutional rights to fight against deportation in immigration court.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis cannot rule on whether he gets asylum or is deported, but she said she will ensure his right to due process. His team says say he is entitled to immigration court proceedings and appeals, including to the U.S. Court of Appeals.

“Even if he does manage to win asylum, the government is going to appeal,” Rankin said. “They’re not going to let this go. Why would they after they’ve invested months and months into this one guy.”

Rankin noted that if Abrego Garcia remains within the jurisdiction of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, that court’s laws would govern his asylum claim. He said that court has been generally positive toward asylum claims and likely would give Abrego Garcia a “fair shake.”

Advocacy groups already have sued to ask courts to halt new Trump administration vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is planning to remove nearly 700 Guatemalan children who had come to the U.S. without their parents, according to a letter sent Friday by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, and the Central American country said it was ready to take them in.

The removals would violate the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s “child welfare mandate and this country’s long-established obligation to these children,” Wyden told Angie Salazar, acting director of the office within the Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for migrant children who arrive in the U.S. alone.

“This move threatens to separate children from their families, lawyers, and support systems, to thrust them back into the very conditions they are seeking refuge from, and to disappear vulnerable children beyond the reach of American law and oversight,” the Democratic senator wrote, asking for the deportation plans to be terminated.

It is another step in the Trump administration’s sweeping immigration enforcement efforts, which include plans to surge officers to Chicago for an immigration crackdown, ramping up deportations and ending protections for people who have had permission to live and work in the United States.

Guatemala says it’s ready to take in the children

Guatemalan Foreign Affairs Minister Carlos Martínez said Friday that the government has told the U.S. it is willing to receive hundreds of Guatemalan minors who arrived unaccompanied to the United States and are being held in U.S. facilities.

Guatemala is particularly concerned about minors who could age out of the facilities for children and be sent to adult detention centers, he said. The exact number of children to be returned remains in flux, but they are currently discussing a little over 600. He said no date has been set yet for their return.

That would be almost double what Guatemala previously agreed to. The head of the country’s immigration service said last month that the government was looking to repatriate 341 unaccompanied minors who were being held in U.S. facilities.

“The idea is to bring them back before they reach 18 years old so that they are not taken to an adult detention center,” Guatemala Immigration Institute Director Danilo Rivera said at the time. He said it would be done at Guatemala’s expense and would be a form of voluntary return.

The plan was announced by President Bernardo Arévalo, who said then that the government had a moral and legal obligation to advocate for the children. His comments came days after U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Guatemala.

Wyden’s letter says the children ‘will be forcibly removed’

The White House and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the latest move, which was first reported by CNN.

Quoting unidentified whistleblowers, Wyden’s letter said children who do not have a parent or legal guardian as a sponsor or who don’t have an asylum case already underway, “will be forcibly removed from the country.”

“Unaccompanied children are some of the most vulnerable children entrusted to the government’s care,” Wyden wrote. “In many cases, these children and their families have had to make the unthinkable choice to face danger and separation in search of safety.”

The idea of repatriating such a large number of children to their home country also raised concerns with activists who work with children navigating the immigration process.

“We are outraged by the Trump administration’s renewed assault on the rights of immigrant children,” said Lindsay Toczylowski, president and CEO of Immigrant Defenders Law Center. “We are not fooled by their attempt to mask these efforts as mere ‘repatriations.’ This is yet another calculated attempt to sever what little due process remains in the immigration system.”

Due to their age and the trauma unaccompanied immigrant children have often experienced getting to the U.S., their treatment is one of the most sensitive issues in immigration. Advocacy groups already have sued to ask courts to halt new Trump administration vetting procedures for unaccompanied children, saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.

Migrant children traveling without their parents or guardians are handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement when they are encountered by officials along the U.S.-Mexico border. Once in the U.S., they often live in government-supervised shelters or with foster care families until they can be released to a sponsor — usually a family member — living in the country.

They can request asylum, juvenile immigration status or visas for victims of sexual exploitation.

An attorney for small businesses affected by the tariffs, on the other hand, said the ruling shows Trump doesn't have unlimited power to impose tariffs on his own.
The national emergency underlying the tariffs, Trump said, was the long-running gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from the rest of the world.
In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges -- one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states -- into a single case.","WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court ruled Friday that President Donald Trump had no legal right to impose sweeping tariffs on almost every country on earth but left in place for now his effort to build a protectionist wall around the American economy.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled Trump wasn't legally allowed to declare national emergencies and impose import taxes on almost every country on earth, a ruling that largely upheld a May decision by a specialized federal trade court in New York.

""It seems unlikely that Congress intended to ... grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,"" the judges wrote in a 7-4 ruling.

But they did not strike down the tariffs immediately, allowing his administration until mid-October to appeal to the Supreme Court.

The president vowed to do just that. ""If allowed to stand, this Decision would literally destroy the United States of America,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.

White House spokesman Kush Desai said Trump had acted lawfully, and ""we look forward to ultimate victory on this matter.""

An attorney for small businesses affected by the tariffs, on the other hand, said the ruling shows Trump doesn't have unlimited power to impose tariffs on his own. ""This decision protects American businesses and consumers from the uncertainty and harm caused by these unlawful tariffs,"" said Jeffrey Schwab, director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.

The ruling complicates Trump's ambitions to upend decades of American trade policy completely on his own. Trump has alternative laws for imposing import taxes, but they would limit the speed and severity with which he could act. His tariffs -- and the erratic way he's rolled them out -- have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.

But he's also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting one-sided trade deals and to bring tens of billions of dollars into the federal Treasury to help pay for the massive tax cuts he signed into law July 4.

""While existing trade deals may not automatically unravel, the administration could lose a pillar of its negotiating strategy, which may embolden foreign governments to resist future demands, delay implementation of prior commitments, or even seek to renegotiate terms,"" Ashley Akers, senior counsel at the Holland & Knight law firm and a former Justice Department trial lawyer, said before the appeals court decision.

The government has argued that if the tariffs are struck down, it might have to refund some of the import taxes that it's collected, delivering a financial blow to the U.S. Treasury.

""It would be 1929 all over again, a GREAT DEPRESSION!"" Trump said in a previous post on Truth Social.

A dissent from the judges who disagreed with Friday's ruling clears a possible legal path for Trump, concluding that the 1977 law allowing for emergency actions ""is not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority under the Supreme Court's decisions,"" which have allowed the legislature to grant some tariffing authorities to the president.

Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by July, more than double what it was at the same point the year before. Indeed, the Justice Department warned in a legal filing this month that revoking the tariffs could mean ""financial ruin"" for the United States.

The ruling involves two sets of import taxes, both of which Trump justified by declaring a national emergency under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA):

The sweeping tariffs he announced April 2 -- ""Liberation Day,"" he called it -- when he imposed ""reciprocal"" tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs trade deficits and a ""baseline"" 10% tariff on just about everyone else. The national emergency underlying the tariffs, Trump said, was the long-running gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from the rest of the world. The president started to levy modified the tariff rates in August, but goods from countries with which the U.S. runs a surplus also face the taxes.

The ""trafficking tariffs"" he announced Feb. 1 on imports from Canada, China and Mexico. These were designed to get those countries to do more to stop what he declared a national emergency: the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants across their borders into the United States.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose taxes, including tariffs. But over decades, lawmakers have ceded authorities to the president, and Trump has made the most of the power vacuum.

But Trump's assertion that IEEPA essentially gives him unlimited power to tax imports quickly drew legal challenges -- at least seven cases. No president had ever used the law to justify tariffs, though IEEPA had been used frequently to impose export restrictions and other sanctions on U.S. adversaries such as Iran and North Korea.

The plaintiffs argued that the emergency power law does not authorize the use of tariffs.

They also noted that the trade deficit hardly meets the definition of an ""unusual and extraordinary"" threat that would justify declaring an emergency under the law. The United States, after all, has run trade deficits -- in which it buys more from foreign countries than it sells them -- for 49 straight years and in good times and bad.

The Trump administration argued that courts approved President Richard Nixon's emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic crisis that arose from the chaos that followed his decision to end a policy linking the U.S. dollar to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language used in IEEPA.

In May, the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York rejected the argument, ruling that Trump's Liberation Day tariffs ""exceed any authority granted to the President"" under the emergency powers law. In reaching its decision, the trade court combined two challenges -- one by five businesses and one by 12 U.S. states -- into a single case.

In the case of the drug trafficking and immigration tariffs on Canada, China and Mexico, the trade court ruled that the levies did not meet IEEPA's requirement that they ""deal with"" the problem they were supposed to address.

The court challenge does not cover other Trump tariffs, including levies on foreign steel, aluminum and autos that the president imposed after Commerce Department investigations concluded that those imports were threats to U.S. national security.

Nor does it include tariffs that Trump imposed on China in his first term -- and former President Joe Biden kept -- after a government investigation concluded that the Chinese used unfair practices to give their own technology firms an edge over rivals from the United States and other Western countries.

Trump could potentially cite alternative authorities to impose import taxes, though they are more limited. Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, for instance, allows the president to tax imports from countries with which the U.S. runs big trade deficits at 15% for 150 days.

Likewise, Section 301 of the same 1974 law allows the president to tax imports from countries found to have engaged in unfair trade practices after an investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Trump used Section 301 authority to launch his first-term trade war with China.

The DeSantis administration opened the facility in support of Trump's deportation efforts.

Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity sued, citing environmental concerns.

The state is appealing the closure order and considering alternative detention sites.

TALLAHASSEE — Federal officials are complying with a judge’s order and have stopped sending immigrants to a detention center in the Everglades, less than two months after Gov. Ron DeSantis’ administration launched the facility dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz” in support of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation efforts.

U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams last week issued a preliminary injunction ordering state and federal officials to begin winding down operations at the detention center, which the Florida Division of Emergency Management spent about $218 million to construct, according to court documents.

A U.S. Department of Homeland Security official confirmed in an email Friday that the agency is “complying with this order and moving detainees to other facilities."" The email defended the mass deportation program as well as the Everglades facility, which is at an airport used for flight training.

“We are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens. This activist judge’s order is yet another attempt to prevent the president from fulfilling the American people’s mandate to remove the worst of the worst — including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, terrorists, and rapists from our country. Not to mention this ruling ignores the fact that this land has already been developed for a decade,” the email said.

The first immigrants were sent to the facility, which had a capacity for 2,000 detainees, in early July, and about 1,000 people were housed there in mid-August. The population at the detention center dwindled to about 330 last week, court records showed.

A lawsuit filed by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity accused the Trump and DeSantis administrations of failing to comply with a federal law requiring an environmental-impact study before the facility could be built. The Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida also joined the plaintiffs in the case.

Williams’ Aug. 21 ruling ordered the Trump and DeSantis administrations to stop bringing additional detainees to the complex and gave officials 60 days to wind down operations and remove temporary fencing, lighting fixtures and generators, gas, sewage and other waste receptacles.

Both administrations quickly asked the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to put the preliminary injunction on hold while appeals play out. Williams this week refused to block her order but the appeals at the Atlanta-based court remain pending.

Friends of the Everglades Executive Director Eve Samples said it was a “relief to see the state and federal government complying” with Williams’ preliminary injunction.

“When the last detainee leaves, the state should turn off the lights and shut the door behind them. The court’s ruling is a powerful reminder that people at the highest levels of government must comply with the law — in this case environmental law — and there are consequences when they don’t,” Samples said in an email.

Dismantling the lights, temporary fencing and other equipment could cost the state between $15 million and $20 million, according to State Emergency Response Team Chief Ian Gadea-Guidicelli, who oversees day-to-day operations at the facility.

The state would have to spend another $15 million to $20 million to reinstall the structures if the detention center is allowed to reopen, Gadea-Guidicelli said in a declaration filed Saturday in the lawsuit.

Williams’ preliminary injunction did not require the state to permanently shutter the facility, but her order “will eventually cause all detention operations at the site to cease,” the emergency-response chief added.

“In that event, FDEM (the Florida Division of Emergency Management) will lose most of the value of the $218 million it invested to make (the Collier-Dade Training and Transition Airport) suitable for detention operations,” the declaration said.

Florida is in line to receive $605 million for immigration detention from the Trump administration.The state could receive a partial reimbursement for the Everglades complex, which was projected to cost $450 million a year to operate, according to court documents.

The DeSantis administration is in the process of launching a second immigrant-detention facility at a mothballed state prison. The governor recently announced plans to convert Baker Correctional Institution in North Florida into a detention center that can house up to 1,600 detainees. The facility could come online as early as next week.

The Everglades facility has sparked at least two other lawsuits and has been a flashpoint in the debate about DeSantis’ and Trump’s hard-line approach to immigration enforcement.

In one challenge, immigration lawyers allege that detainees were unable to access legal representation or have private meetings with their attorneys. State officials attributed the problems to the hurried pace with which the facility was erected.

In a separate case, attorneys representing detainees argued the DeSantis administration lacks the authority to operate the site.

Both lawsuits also include allegations of inadequate water and medical care at the site.

Attorney General James Uthmeier, a former chief of staff for DeSantis whom the governor appointed as attorney general in February, was instrumental in selecting the Everglades site to temporarily house immigrants who have been arrested. The use of the airport, which can accommodate large planes, to deport people was a key factor.

During an episode of The News Service of Florida’s “Deeper Dive with Dara Kam” podcast that will be released Sunday, Uthmeier said he “felt good” about the state’s appeal of Williams’ decision.

If the courts don’t agree, Uthmeier said, the state could turn to other sites, such as the Baker County facility and a potential South Florida detention center outside Homestead.

Uthmeier credited the launch of the Everglades facility for a “huge uptick” in the number of undocumented immigrants who have signed up for a Trump administration program that steers $1,000 to people who register for voluntary self-deportation. The attorney general said about 2 million people have taken advantage of the program.

“It was a way to get attention where people that are here illegally would see, ‘I’ve got options. I may end up at a facility like that if I stay. But the federal government has advertised very clearly that I can get $1,000 and they'll provide the transportation to get me back home,’” Uthmeier said.","https://www.naplesnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/08/13/PNDN/85642456007-dsc-00399.jpg?crop=5485,3086,x0,y285&width=3200&height=1801&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-08-30 11:57:20.373905
