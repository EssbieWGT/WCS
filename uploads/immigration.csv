Then Friday afternoon brought him another defeat—this one in the election arena. And both were thanks to you Contrarians.

Let’s start with the breaking news from late Friday. You will recall from prior editions of this column that Trump issued an executive order trying to seize power over American elections. I went to court with wonderful colleagues on behalf of clients such as LULAC to stop it. Under the Constitution, states run elections, with some role for Congress, not the president.

Previously, we had won preliminary relief, temporarily stopping this misconduct while the judge considered a permanent injunction. On Friday, we won summary judgment in the case—that is a permanent bar to this wrongdoing. Of course, Trump can appeal, but the decision is strong, and he will fail.

Because at the Contrarian we are owned by no one, all profits from your paid subscriptions go to support my democracy litigation, like this case—and over 200 other legal matters.

Of course, Trump also had another major legal collapse this week. That was the courts’ rebuke of Trump’s effort to use hunger as a political tool in the form of cutting off SNAP benefits in a misguided attempt to pressure Democrats to end the government shutdown. The pushback came courtesy of state attorneys general, governors, nonprofits, and private plaintiffs—and the federal judges to whom they turned for help. Here, too, you Contrarians made your voices heard.

To back up a bit, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food aid to almost 42 million Americans every month. About 1 in 8 Americans would not be able to eat if this program were halted. The Department of Agriculture has the money to pay for SNAP—and the legal obligation to spend it. The Trump administration claims it is not allowed to disperse the funds because of the shutdown. In fact, it is flouting the law by refusing to do so.

That was the subject of an administrative complaint that my litigation colleagues and I filed this week. As we explained, “USDA is not only authorized to use the SNAP contingency fund in the event of a lapse in normal appropriations, it is legally obligated to do so. Congress has directed USDA to reserve SNAP funding for use ‘as may become necessary to carry out program operations.’ By law, individuals who are eligible for SNAP are entitled to receive those benefits.”

If the money and statutory command are there, why are Trump, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins, and others in the administration withholding it, with backing from congressional enablers? They are transparently doing so for political reasons to try to exact pain over the government shutdown and pressure Democratic senators who are unwilling to provide their votes for another heartless initiative: tearing health care away from millions of Americans.

You’re probably asking yourself how they are getting away with this flagrant illegality. That’s why an armada of support—including 23 state AGs and three governors in one lawsuit and a coalition of individual plaintiffs and nonprofit organizations in another—came in to make sure that they couldn’t. The AGs and governors filed their lawsuit in Massachusetts federal court explaining that the failure to disperse the funds was a violation of the law. Then, plaintiffs—including individuals from red states, such as a grocery store owner in South Carolina, who are bravely speaking out while their state governments do nothing to fight back—sued in Rhode Island.

By Friday, the plaintiffs scored significant victories against Trump, securing this vital assistance for Americans across the country. In a hearing on Thursday, federal Judge Indira Talwani in Massachusetts said, “Congress has put money in an emergency fund, and it is hard for me to understand how this is not an emergency.” On Friday, Chief Judge John McConnell in Rhode Island issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the federal government from cutting off SNAP benefits nationwide; and Judge Talwani in Massachusetts, in a scathing opinion, stated that the federal government was wrong on the relevant law and required it to inform the court as to whether it will authorize paying out benefits by Monday.

The fact that the private plaintiffs, AGs, and governors went to court—and that the courts responded strongly—is magnificent. (To be clear, these were separate from my administrative complaint. Credit where credit is due!) It’s another example of how the legal resistance is working as the front line of defending the Constitution and human decency. YOU Contrarians have supported over 200 of these legal cases and matters through your paid subscriptions, including our legal work on SNAP.

Polling shows that Americans dislike these kinds of autocratic shenanigans by Trump. We see that in polls, with Trump at historic lows of under 40% in poll after poll. And we’ve also seen it at the polls. In 46 out of 47 special elections this year, Democrats have won or outperformed by an average of 16 points.

Now we are about to get the biggest referendum yet on Trumpism when voters go to the polls Tuesday in California, New Jersey, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. California’s Prop 50 is, of course, a direct response to Trump’s effort to steal congressional seats through redistricting in Texas by triggering reciprocal redistricting in the Golden State. And the other elections also are a reflection on Trump: GOP candidates Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia and Jack Ciattarelli in New Jersey have enthusiastically embraced the president and his agenda.

Contrarians, that brings us to you once more. If you are a voter in one of these states or if you have friends or family who are, you have the opportunity to make your voice heard— whatever your views might be. It’s perhaps the most fundamental right in our democracy—and that’s why our authoritarian in chief fears it so much—evinced, for example, by his shameless efforts to encourage gerrymandering nationwide to deprive voters of their choice. On Tuesday, voters in multiple states will get to say what they think, and I believe they will repudiate Trumpism.

Of course, another element of a strong democracy is the free press, and we like to think we exemplify that here at The Contrarian. I hope you’ll agree when you look at the extraordinary lineup of content we offered this week—like my democracy litigation, also made possible by our paid subscribers. See for yourself….

Trying to break SNAP

The MAGA GOP Doesn’t Care If You Starve: Sen. Rosen on SNAP, Shutdown, and Senate.

Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) joined Jen from her D.C. office to expose Republican hypocrisy, as the “family first” party withholds funds that enable millions of Americans to feed their families. “Many of my Republican colleagues are like, ‘well, if they want to eat, they should get a job and work hard’.… Will you tell that to the disabled veteran or to the senior, or to the children, or to the people who work really hard but just don’t make enough?”

Dispatch from Chicago: Countdown to SNAP cuts

Lorraine Forte reported from Chicago, where SNAP cuts would deal another blow to a city already reeling from the abuses of ICE and Customs and Border Patrol. “November threatens to be just the start of a downward spiral.”

The ICE Invasion

The Border Isn’t Where You Think It Is

In his first piece for The Contrarian, Tim Dickinson reported on how and why the infamously brutal Border Patrol is taking a central role in Trump’s immigration crackdowns—far from any international border crossing. “Is the Border Patrol now in Chicago as part of its routine authority? Or is there something darker going on?”

The Forgotten Status in the Immigration Narrative: Dreamers

A 13-year DACA recipient, anonymized for fear of personal retribution from ICE, gave us an incisive, courageous essay on what it takes to live under the ever-less-stable contingencies of a government that has always treated her like a pawn and increasingly like a pariah.

ICE Escalation in Chicago: Looped In with Lynn Sweet

Lynn Sweet spoke with Jen Rubin about the latest on ICE in Chicago: Children teargassed during Halloween celebrations. Women thrown to the ground and arrested. Journalists targeted and obstructed from doing their jobs. “This is happening in a time where everyone has a camera.”

Checks and Imbalances

Calling This Court “Supreme” Is Obeying in Advance

Michael Podhorzer gave us a searing condemnation of how the Roberts Court is passing off tyranny in robes as the rule of law. “When legal and media elites don’t name the partisan stakes, and when even progressive critics keep referring to the Roberts Court’s legal Calvinball as ‘Supreme Court’ rulings, they are conditioning all of us to accept what we never would otherwise.”

Sen. Schmitt’s hearing on political violence was a sham

Tom Joscelyn, Susan Corke, and I wrote on Republican Sen. Eric Schmitt’s baseless belief that only the left commits political violence—an absurd exercise in projection that he and his fellow Republicans have given a veneer of congressional due process.

Flying blind economically, thanks to the shutdown

Dan Koh looked ahead to Nov. 7, when America will likely wake up to yet another month without a jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, because “the federal shutdown has silenced the agency responsible for the most basic economic truth-telling we have.” When the data mirror is shattered even temporarily, he argued, the public loses one of its few checks on narrative and power.

The Latest in Hate

The Young Republicans chat echoes the Citizens Councils of the 1950s and 60s

Michael Franklin linked the Young Republicans’ debased, revealing group chat—“the casual cruelty, the smirking slurs, the need to dress violence as irony”—to an older tradition, alive and all too well. “The Young Republicans have become what the Citizens’ Councils once were: the finishing school for a politics that calls prejudice principle and cruelty conviction.”

The Cost of Silence: The Erasure of Black Progress Threatens Our Democracy

Onyx Impact CEO Esosa Osa and Kam Middlebrooks reported the findings of their organization’s new analysis detailing exactly how Black history—and Black futures—are being threatened under the Trump administration’s coordinated attack.

Kamala Harris was right about everything

Shalise Manza Young reflected on just how much Kamala Harris foresaw, spelled out in her forceful campaign trail warnings of Project 2025’s racist, xenophobic, misogynistic, un-American goals. “As we approach the one-year mark of the presidential election that gave us whatever all of this madness is, it is even clearer that Vice President Kamala Harris was right about pretty much everything.”

A minimalist documentary with maximum impact

Meredith Blake wrote on The Perfect Neighbor, a harrowing true-crime documentary now on Netflix that uses body-cam footage to reconstruct a horrific 2023 Florida shooting in which a mother was killed for protecting her kids while Black. “A devastating indictment of Stand Your Ground laws.”

Essential Elections Ahead

Trump is too much of a narcissist to call off elections

Austin Sarat explains that Trump would rather rig than suspend elections to ensure he gets the adulation he craves. That includes Trump already making plays to influence the 2026 midterms. Voting has never been more critical.

Firewall for Freedom: ACLU PA Executive Director Mike Lee on Pennsylvania Elections and State Protection

As Pennsylvania’s State Supreme Court elections approach, Mike Lee, executive director of the ACLU’s Pennsylvania branch, joined Jen to explain how Republicans are trying to flip the Democratic majority. “Federal law is the floor, not the ceiling.”

Equal Voting Rights are under attack in the courts and in North Carolina [podcast]

“North Carolina really is emblematic of what we’ve been deeply concerned about, and that is, this rush to try to seize control on a partisan basis.”

Republicans are Rigging Maps for More Congressional Seats. Ari Berman explained Republicans’ redistricting strategy. “Even in red states, all the polling shows that voters don’t like this effort.” Republicans are in a race to see how many states they can strip representation from—and they’re targeting Black lawmakers to do it.

Seeing Clearly & Fighting Back

Don’t Lose Hope: Steve Vladeck On Why the Trump Administration Is Always In Court

Legal expert Steve Vladeck joined Jen to break down how Portland and Chicago are fighting back against Trump’s National Guard deployment. “The lower courts are still doing a heck of a lot to at least try to constrain what the government’s doing.”

Authoritarians don’t get the last word

Democracy Defenders Action Executive Director Susan Corke explained how Americans are fighting back on every front against Trump’s autocratic aspirations. “When authoritarian leaders destroy the symbols of democracy, they are preparing to destroy its substance. Their goal is to raise doubts about who this country belongs to, and make us believe that it doesn’t belong to us.”

This week, we saw continued ICE protests nationwide, from Portland, Ore., and D.C. to Chicago and Durango, Colo. Get help organizing from Indivisible, find protests in your area at mobilize.us, and send us your protest photos at submit@contrariannews.org.

Culture, Cartoons & Fun Stuff

This week our cartoonists covered some of the many ways Trump is haunting our highest office, from bulldozing the White House (Tom the Dancing Bug, Ruben Bolling), to rewriting history (As Reagan would have it, Michael de Adder), to elevating the soulless (Don’t call us fascists, Nick Anderson), to zombifying the federal workforce (Spooky season, RJ Matson), to bringing in new goons to scare adults and kids alike (Only the best people, Nick Anderson).

Culture recs: Frankenstein (and Mary Shelley) Through the Ages

Meredith Blake recommended Guillermo del Toro’s new spin on the Gothic classic and other interpretations of its timeless themes. “Never underestimate the cruelty that can be waged by neglected, vengeful monsters. Stay spooky, Contrarians.”

Last but not least, Jamie Schler offered cocoa molasses chews for helping us figure out how we go on, and your pets were the treat this Halloween.

Fernando Jaramillo-Solano and his children, ages 12 and 15, were then transferred together to a unit in Dilley, Texas, where they are still being held, according to Compañeros: Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center, which connected with the family.

The family, who were detained while on their way to school Monday, have an active asylum case, which means they have the legal right to remain in the country while the case proceeds, and they have complied with every requirement of the process, according to immigration advocates who have been assisting the family with the legal process.

Masked federal agents pulled them over after mistaking Jaramillo-Solano for someone else, but arrested him and his two children anyway, advocates said.

Gregory Davies, Denver’s third-ranking official with ICE corroborated that account in federal court Friday, testifying that the agents did not know Jaramillo-Solano was the person driving the car before they stopped him, the Denver Post reported. Davies took the stand during a hearing in a lawsuit challenging the agency’s arrest practices in Colorado.

There was no active warrant for Jaramillo-Solano, according to Compañeros, who has been assisting the Colombian family.

The family’s arrest sparked demonstrations in the southwestern Colorado town. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the facility in Durango and blocked the entrance in an attempt to prevent the family from being separated. The protest erupted as federal agents dragged demonstrators and fired rubber bullets and used pepper spray at close range.

Meanwhile, the family said they were not allowed to leave the small cell, where the lights remained on at all times. The only available toilet was in the room, offering no privacy, advocates said.

No female agent was available to help the 12-year-old girl, the family told advocates. Jaramillo-Solano likened their detention to torture, and alleged that both he and his son were physically assaulted.

“Every time I asked what would happen to my children, or if they could have something to eat, they hit us. They told me I did not matter. They told me my children did not matter,” Jaramillo-Solano told the resource center.

An ICE spokesperson did not immediately return a request for comment Friday.

The 15-year-old son said his hands were bruised and swollen from the handcuffs agents placed on him, advocates said.

The family was never separated, Compañeros said.

The family told immigration advocates that in Texas they received food and water and agents loosened their handcuffs.

A bipartisan group of congressional lawmakers is working together to free the family from ICE custody. During a meeting in Durango Thursday evening, representatives for Democratic Sens. John Hickenlooper and Michael Bennet and Republican Rep. Jeff Hurd said they are working to get Jaramillo-Solano and his children released from the center in Texas and returned to Durango, where they have lived for 18 months.

President Donald Trump vowed during his presidential campaign to deport “vicious and bloodthirsty criminals,” but also promised to execute “the largest deportation program in American history.” The roundups of immigrants working in fields, attending court hearings or walking in their neighborhoods have included those with permanent residency cards, work permits and even U.S. citizenship.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-1-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 14:56:39.042310

This story was written by Beth Hundsdorfer with Capitol News Illinois and Janelle O'Dea with Illinois Answers Project.","CARLYLE, Ill. -- When Jose Jeronimo Guardian showed up at a Spanish language traffic court this week, he didn't expect to be detained and face expulsion from a country he'd lived in for more than two decades.

Guardian, 48, was scheduled to appear Monday in a courtroom where a county-provided translator would aid communication with about a dozen Spanish-speaking defendants who face charges from traffic infractions like his - two charges of driving under the influence of alcohol - to serious felony charges.

Guardian never made it into the courtroom.

Instead, an agent who said he was from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement questioned him in a lobby of the Clinton County Courthouse, handcuffed him, then loaded him into the back of an unmarked car and drove him to a Missouri detention center where he would await deportation.

Detentions at state and county courthouses would be banned under legislation passed early Friday morning. The state legislature approved a bill barring immigration arrests in and around county courthouses, and nearby parking lots and sidewalks. House Bill 1312, which would also allow Illinois residents to sue for civil rights violations, still must be signed by Gov. JB Pritzker.

Though instances of ICE detentions in Illinois have been centered on Chicago since President Donald Trump began ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in September, Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday there has been an uptick recently in ICE activity in central and southern Illinois.

""They are literally targeting people who are brown and Black, whether you are undocumented or not, and they are tackling people, detaining people for hours, zip-tying people who are U.S. citizens. So, they're indiscriminately grabbing people who don't look like the ICE agents, typically, and holding them or mistreating them,"" Pritzker said.

Clinton County, where Guardian was detained, is a rural area 45 miles east of St. Louis. It is overwhelmingly white with just 4% of the population reporting they are Latino, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

ICE says he was deported three times

Guardian was detained in a lobby outside the Clinton County Circuit Clerk's Office as he headed up the stairs to the courtroom when he was approached by four men who said they were ICE agents. They asked his name, then put handcuffs on him. One of the men who identified himself as an immigration agent said Guardian has been deported three times before - an allegation his daughter refuted.

As a reporter captured Guardian's detention on video, one of the men asked a court bailiff to get the reporter to stop recording. The bailiff declined, saying video recording was allowed in public areas outside of the courtroom.

The purported federal agents walked out of the courthouse with Guardian, tailed by his daughter, Isabel, who was holding her baby. Guardian was placed in the back of one of the cars. Isabel Guardian asked for her father's phone, then asked where they were taking him.

One of the men responded that her father was facing deportation and would be taken to St. Louis.

As they were leaving, the four ignored requests from a reporter for them to identify themselves, then got into their unmarked cars parked nearby and left.

""This is the first instance we have heard of an apprehension taking place at a Spanish- language docket. The targeting of a Spanish-language docket in a broad way would be troubling, as it might suggest that ICE officials - as we saw in Los Angeles and heard directly from their leadership in Chicago - are targeting people for the language they speak,"" said Ed Yohnka, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Guardian, 48, came to the U.S. from Mexico 25 years ago, according to his daughter. He worked in the orchards and fields around Clinton County as a picker and a rancher.

Guardian began drinking after recent stressors - a move, financial troubles and a family member's health issues, his daughter said. He was arrested in July for drinking and driving and went to in-patient treatment but was discharged after a couple of days, she said. He was arrested again a week later, again for drinking and driving.

After the second arrest, Isabel Guardian said her father, who is undocumented, gave up drinking and wanted to address the DUI charges, understanding that convictions on those charges could jeopardize his ability to get a Green Card.

His public defender advised Guardian to turn himself in to ICE, Isabel Guardian said, but her father wanted to deal with his traffic cases so that if he was deported, he could return to his family someday. That's why he showed up to court on Monday, his daughter said.

""He said he was willing to cooperate,"" Isabel Guardian said. ""He wasn't fighting them.""

All of Guardian's children have legal status, his daughter said, and his wife just received her Green Card, but Guardian remained undocumented. He was beginning the process of being documented after the rest of the family because it was expensive, Isabel Guardian said.

ICE activity seen elsewhere in Illinois

In the Metro East, Fairmont City is a village that for decades has been heavily populated by Latino immigrants - citizens, those with legal status and undocumented. ICE has been active in the area. Earlier this year, Marleen Suarez, a Fairmont City attorney, began offering free conditional guardianships for parents who are undocumented.

Suarez, who also practices criminal law, said she had three defendants scheduled to appear at Clinton County's Spanish-speaking docket, but had rescheduled them due to a scheduling conflict on Monday morning. She said she was shocked but not surprised that ICE was targeting downstate courthouses.

""I am going to advise my clients to be much more conscientious from now on,"" Suarez said. ""I will work with the staff and judiciary there to ensure the safety of my clients so we can adjudicate their cases. It's disheartening because our courthouses should be a refuge for those seeking justice.""

Yohnka, the ACLU spokesperson, said it's not just traffic dockets drawing ICE. After reports of apprehensions at Chicago's domestic violence courts, victims were failing to appear and complaints were being dropped, Yohnka said.

In Cook County, a judge issued an order two weeks ago barring the civil arrest of any ""party, witness, or potential witness"" while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and surrounding parking lots, sidewalks and entryways.

""The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,"" the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it ""common sense.""

The newly passed legislation would address immigration arrests at courthouses around the state.

In Macoupin County, Ismael Sandoval Ayuzo, owner of Caldera Bar and Grill on Main Street in Staunton located about 35 miles northeast of St. Louis, was detained by ICE this week. A message on the restaurant's front door and on their social media stated that the eatery would be closed on Wednesday.

The day before, Ayuzo, a husband and father of two who has lived in the U.S. for two decades, was delivering a computer cord to his children's school in Staunton when he was stopped and detained, his brother said. Now, his family worries he will face deportation to Mexico.

""His home is here. His daughters are here,"" said Ismael Ayuzo's brother, Rafael Ayuzo.

Ayuzo's detention launched an outcry in his hometown, planning a community event: ""We stand with Ismael."" Chelsa Pruden, co-founder of Macoupin County Indivisible and event organizer, said the restaurateur was very involved with the community and the school, including hosting a recent fundraiser for the high school band.

""This community loves him. We are a small town and this has rocked us,"" Pruden said. ""I don't think that anyone thought that ICE would come here.""

Isabel Guardian said she talked to her father on Tuesday. He was in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, awaiting deportation. His DUI cases were postponed to November but remain pending.

In Springfield, Democratic House members held a press conference at the Statehouse on Tuesday, suggesting legislative fixes such as safe zones around childcare centers, hospitals and courthouses.

""We are a nation built on liberty and due process, not fear and disappearance. No one should be taken from their family, from their home, from our courthouse, from the store or their job without cause or compassion, said Rep. Nicolle Grasse, D-Arlington Heights. ""Our community deserves real safety, the kind that comes from justice, not intimidation.""

And those who move to Texas from other states could also see their Daca work permits revoked.
She and all Daca recipients in Texas pay more than $830m in state and local taxes each year, according to the American Immigration Council.
The Texas department of public safety recently suspended the issuance of commercial driver’s licenses to non-citizens, including Daca recipients.
Immigration rights groups are urging Daca recipients to wait for Hanen’s decision about the program’s future before taking any action.","A federal judge could soon decide whether tens of thousands of so-called “Dreamers” in Texas could lose their ability to work in the US legally under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) immigration program – prompting fears of upheaval and heartbreak.

As part of the years-long legal battle over Daca, US district court judge Andrew Hanen is set to rule on competing proposals for the future of the Obama-era program. One of those proposals, submitted by the Trump administration, would make Daca recipients in Texas, in particular, ineligible for the work permits typically offered by the policy.

Created in 2012, Daca currently provides deportation protections and work permits to more than 500,000 immigrants who, as children, entered the US without permission or overstayed their visas. To qualify, they all had to have arrived before 2007, attend an American high school or enlist in the military, and pass background checks.

The average age of those enrolled in Daca is now 31. After California, Texas is the home to the second largest Daca population in the country, with 86,000 recipients living there.

But what has remained a lifeline for an entire generation of young adults – in the absence of Congress being willing to pass legislation to embed the protections in law – many of whom are now raising families and building professional careers, continues to be in legal peril, especially in Texas.

If Hanen approves the federal government’s plan, Daca recipients in Texas would lose their income, career opportunities and financial support, pushing them towards the shadows or out of the state. And those who move to Texas from other states could also see their Daca work permits revoked.

“It would be heartbreaking having to leave my family’s dream, my dream, everything I worked for,” said Laura Alguera, who was born in Mexico City in 1990 and came to the US at four.

“Thanks to Daca I’m a licensed cosmetologist and was able to open my own salon. How am I going to explain it to my clients, whom I have built relationships with? If I have to go to another state it would feel like I’m escaping.”

The Daca program has survived years of uncertainty. During Donald Trump’s first term, his administration tried to terminate Daca, declaring it an illegal program. But its effort was blocked, ultimately by the US supreme court, which in 2020 halted the termination on technical grounds.

But it’s currently threatened by a lawsuit filed by Republican-led states, led by Texas, that argue the policy is an overreach of executive authority.

Hanen, a federal judge in Texas, and the fifth circuit court of appeals have sided with the GOP-controlled states in recent years, finding that Daca is unlawful. The courts have so far allowed the program to continue for current recipients, closing it only to new applicants.

In its latest ruling in January, the fifth circuit agreed with Hanen that Daca is unlawful, but narrowed the impact of the order to Texas, saying the state proved it was harmed by the policy due to the costs of providing services to Dreamers.

To comply with the circuit’s order, the Trump administration submitted a proposal saying US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) had developed plans to reopen Daca to new applicants in all states except Texas.

Daca has been closed to new applications since 2021 due to litigation, but those enrolled continued to renew their two-year work authorizations.

The administration’s proposal also calls for the revocation of Daca work permits in Texas, where the program’s recipients would only be eligible for deportation deferrals.

The federal government and attorneys defending Daca had opportunities to file responses to the proposal until late October.

Hanen is now reviewing the proposals submitted by the parties, which also include a request from nine Republican-led states for Daca to be completely shut down over a certain period. Hanen’s final decision is expected to be announced soon.

Thomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which is representing Daca recipients in the federal court case, said in an interview with the Guardian that the potential termination of work permits for those in Texas would, far from saving the state money, hurt the state’s economy.

“Texas would suffer because all their highly qualified Daca recipients would choose to move elsewhere,” said Saenz, adding: “But those are the consequences of Texas deciding to entertain a challenge to Daca when, in reality, it benefits from it.”

According to a report by the American Immigration Council, more than 221,000 Texans are eligible for Daca and 97% of them are employed. Nearly 19,000 are described as entrepreneurs.

Alguera, a 32-year old mother, is a salon owner in Houston, where she lives. She and all Daca recipients in Texas pay more than $830m in state and local taxes each year, according to the American Immigration Council.

“How many years have we been following the rules, paying our taxes and we are still in this limbo? Every two years it feels like someone is playing with our feelings,” she said.

At the national level, as employers and employees, Daca recipients have contributed nearly $2.1bn each year to social security and Medicare, programs that benefit all Americans, according to a recent survey.

Since the turn of the century, lawmakers have introduced at least 20 versions of the “Dream Act”, which would place Dreamers on a path to US citizenship. Despite garnering bipartisan support, the proposals have all died in Congress.

In 2001, under Republican governance, Texas became the first state to give undocumented immigrants access to in-state tuition places at public colleges and universities, through the Texas Dream Act.

Half the states in the nation followed suit. However, the Texas law those measures were modeled on is no longer in effect.

In June, the Trump administration sued Texas over the Texas Dream Act and state officials, instead of defending it, joined the justice department in asking a federal judge to strike down the law. The federal judge agreed.

The Texas department of public safety recently suspended the issuance of commercial driver’s licenses to non-citizens, including Daca recipients. The agency then enforced English proficiency requirements for commercial drivers.

“Every commercial driver license operator on Texas roadways must be able to communicate clearly in English to ensure compliance with traffic laws, follow safety directions, and prevent accidents,” said the state governor, Greg Abbott.

Immigration rights groups are urging Daca recipients to wait for Hanen’s decision about the program’s future before taking any action.

Beyond the more than half a million people across America already enrolled in Daca, about 1.1 million people may be eligible for the policy, according to the Migration Policy Institute, including an estimated 221,000 Texans.

Since Trump returned to the White House, his administration has aggressively expanded immigration raids across the country, granting deportation agents a broad mandate to target those in the country without proper documents.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f69f4f49ebba72b242bf56f65a141657ee319ea/299_0_4201_3360/master/4201.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=29f90f1bb0c9d9bc8c2b8cce055bbdc5",N,,2025-11-01 12:02:33.355993

Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center say US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have denied people being held at the Broadview facility private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from entering the building.

Such actions have created essentially a “black box” they say has allowed authorities to act “with impunity”.

Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don’t understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and face deportation, according to the lawsuit.

Alexa Van Brunt, the director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office and lead attorney for the lawsuit, said members of the public are “being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights”.

“Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” she said.

Attorneys accuse ICE, US Customs and Border Protection and their parent agency the Department of Homeland Security of violating detainees’ fifth amendment right to due process and first amendment right to legal counsel, and have asked the court to force the agencies to improve the facility’s conditions.

Advocates have for months raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Conditions in ICE holding cells across the US have proved highly controversial.

Lawyers and relatives of people held at the facility have called it a de facto detention center, where up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.

DHS previously dismissed the claims, saying those held at the facility have proper meals, medical treatment and access to communication with family members and lawyers.

The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, which have led to the arrests of numerous protesters amid an aggressive crackdown. The protests are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their first amendment rights by repeatedly using teargas and other weapons on them.

“The families of some of the deceased have denounced the fact that the victims had no prior condition that would have predicted a tragic end,” EL PAÍS noted in its October report.

2025 has become the deadliest year for detained immigrants in federal immigration custody in two decades. EL PAÍS reported this month that at least 22 individuals have died while in ICE custody in the current fiscal year, making this the deadliest year for detained immigrants since 2005.

They have been as young as 27-years-old. Brayan Garzón-Rayo, a Colombian immigrant who died by suicide in April, “did not receive a mental health evaluation due to staffing shortages,” KCUR reported. “Jail staff found Garzón-Rayo unresponsive in his cell with a blanket wrapped around his neck on April 7, according to the ICE report.” Isidro Pérez, a 75-year-old Cuban man, died while in immigration custody after six decades in the U.S. The fishing aficionado “lived on a boat anchored near a park in Key Largo, south of Miami, and spent his days sitting on a bench in a coastal park, his family says,” EL PAÍS reported in July.

“The families of some of the deceased have denounced the fact that the victims had no prior condition that would have predicted a tragic end,” EL PAÍS noted in its October report.

One grieving mom said that she was not aware of her 39-year-old son suffering any health difficulties when he suddenly died after being jailed at Adelanto ICE Processing Center, a privately-operated detention facility in southern California. “Her son, Ismael Ayala-Uribe, died on September 22 at Victor Valley Hospital, where he was transferred from the Adelanto Detention Center in California. Ayala-Uribe was arrested on August 17 while working at a car wash in Huntington Beach, where he had been employed for 15 years.”

“The family maintains that his health was good and that they have not received an explanation as to how, in just over a month, the 39-year-old Mexican died in detention,” EL PAÍS reported in July.

And, these deaths have been coming with alarming frequency. Just two weeks after Ayala-Uribe’s death, Huabing Xie, a Chinese immigrant of unreported age, died after being detained at Imperial Regional Detention Facility, another privately-operated site in southern California, L.A. Taco reported. Detention staff “reported Xie having a seizure. He became unresponsive at 2:13 p.m. CPR was given and a defibrillator was used, administered by medical personnel on site. Xie was transported to the hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.” The outlet further stated that federal immigration officials actually violated their own policies on how quickly they must publicly report in-custody deaths.

“The record for deaths in ICE custody was set in 2004, a year after the immigration agency’s creation,” EL PAÍS continued in its October report. “There were 32 reported deaths that year. The following year there were 20, a figure not surpassed again until 2020, during the Covid pandemic, when 21 deaths were recorded, according to government data.” But as researchers at the American Immigration Council note, the current administration has been “deadlier for ICE detainees than COVID-19 pandemic.”

These alarming statistics, lack of transparency, and failure to follow internal guidelines come “as ICE is also holding nearly 60,000 people in immigration detention, the highest number in several years,” NPR reported. According to data from TRAC Immigration, the overwhelming majority of immigrants in federal immigration detention, 71.5%, have no criminal convictions at all. “Former agency officials are warning that increased detention population, decreased oversight, an increase in street and community arrests and continued difficulties staffing medical teams will result in more deaths,” NPR continued.

An ongoing Congressional investigation has already uncovered hundreds of credible reports of shocking human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities, including dozens of allegations of physical and sexual abuse and the mistreatment of pregnant women and children as young as two, including U.S. citizens. This includes 41 reports of physical and sexual abuse, 32 reports of abuses against pregnant women and kids, reports of denial of health care and legal representation at facilities in more than two dozen states, Puerto Rico, and even U.S. military bases in Cuba and as far away as Djibouti in the Horn of Africa.

The ongoing probe has even alleged that detention facility staffers have used solitary confinement – which is considered torture by many experts – to punish detained individuals for reporting allegations.

Following a series of complaints and lawsuits, “ICE is scrambling to hire doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other healthcare workers” for positions “ranging from dental hygienists through psychiatric nurse practitioners to medical risk managers and data scientists,” The Independent reported. But whether the approximately 45 new positions will make any significant impact as federal immigration officials detain an unprecedented number of immigrants remains to be seen.

ICE’s death reporting page also does not show the at least three individuals who’ve tragically lost their lives while apparently trying to flee immigration agents. Just last week in Virginia, Josué Castro Rivera was heading to a gardening job when he tried to flee ICE on foot and was hit by a vehicle on the interstate. “He had a very good heart,” his brother said. “He didn’t deserve anything that happened to him.”

As families grieve and continue to press for answers, the Disappeared In America campaign said that immigrant community members who’ve lost their lives while in ICE custody will be remembered during Day of the Dead vigils set to take place this weekend.

“These cultural and creative events uplift the sanctity of life,” said the campaign’s Disappeared In America Weekend of Action website, “and affirm that our communities will not be erased or forgotten.” Day of the Dead, or Día de Muertos, is observed from Nov. 1 to Nov. 2 and is a traditional “day of celebration, particularly for the people in Mexico and Central America, and for many Mexican Americans in the United States,” said the National Museum of the American Latino. “It is a day to honor and commemorate the lives of the dearly departed and to welcome the return of their spirits.” These celebrations typically include an ofrenda, or altar, that features photos of deceased loved ones, candles, marigolds, and even favorite food items.

Advocates erected one such ofrenda outside the privately-operated Otay Mesa Detention Center in southern California on Wednesday, Fox 5 San Diego reported. “Groups like the American Friends Service Committee, Detention Resistance, Free Them All-SD and more organized the vigil. Director of the American Friends Service Committee Pedro Rios said they want to make sure those who died in custody are not forgotten.”

“Rios said they gathered ‘to honor them and to recognize them as important because they have names, they have families that likely did not have to be under detention, we want to make sure they are not forgotten,’” the report continued. In Los Angeles, Venice Bakery’s ofrenda similarly remembers individuals who’ve died while under ICE watch.

“They were part of our community, and our community is being targeted, and they needed to be remembered,” said the bakery’s operator. “Sorry, it’s emotional because it’s my community. It’s the people I grew up with. It’s the people I see day in, day out. It’s family members. It’s my son’s friends and their family members. And that can happen to any one of us because we all look Latino. It doesn’t matter if I was born here, if I wasn’t born here, if I have papers. I look Hispanic, I look Latina. So it can happen to me, and that’s scary.”",http://americasvoice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-31-at-8.13.38-AM-scaled.png,N,,2025-11-01 13:01:21.308006

A federal judge on Friday ordered theTrump administration to continue to fund Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the ongoing government shutdown, delivering near-term relief to roughly 42 million Americans who received the aid just hours before the funding was slated to dry up.

The emergency order from U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani said the Trump administration must resume SNAP benefits, which were slated to expire Nov. 1, ruling that plaintiffs who filed the lawsuit are likely to succeed on their claims that the suspension of the benefits is unlawful. She ordered the government to provide the court no later than Monday, Nov. 3, with additional details on how it plans to keep the program funded, and whether the appropriated benefits must be distributed in full or in part.

Moments later, a separate federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the Trump administration to continue paying for food stamps during the shutdown.

U.S. District Judge John McConnell said the administration must tap its emergency funds to pay for the SNAP benefits ""as soon as possible"" next month. He issued the emergency order from the bench Friday during an emergency court hearing in Providence.

STATES SUE TRUMP ADMIN OVER BILLIONS IN LOOMING CUTS TO SNAP, FOOD STAMPS

Talwani heard arguments Thursday from the Trump administration and from a coalition of 25 Democratic governors and state attorneys general, who sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture over its refusal to keep SNAP benefits funded during the ongoing government shutdown.

The benefits were slated to expire Nov. 1, marking the first time in 60 years that the program lapsed because of a government shutdown.

Talwani seemed sympathetic to the states’ arguments on Thursday. ""It’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency when there’s no money and a lot of people need their SNAP benefits,"" she said in court, vowing to rule as soon as possible on the matter.

She also agreed with the argument that the cuts to SNAP would be ""devastating.""

State leaders said in the lawsuit that suspending the aid would disproportionately harm some tens of millions of vulnerable and low-income Americans in their states. ""Because of USDA’s actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,"" they said in the lawsuit, filed Tuesday.

""Worse still, USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits,"" they added.

The lawsuit was filed several days after the Trump administration said last week that it would not use the Agriculture Department's roughly $5 billion contingency fund to cover the food stamp benefits provided by SNAP for the month of November.

SENATE GOP DIVIDED AS MILLIONS RISK LOSING FOOD AID IN SHUTDOWN STANDOFF

Instead, officials said, the agency is planning to keep it on hand to respond to natural disasters.

In the near-term, the states asked Talwani to order the Trump administration to release the USDA contingency funds to help ensure there is not a lapse in SNAP program benefits beginning Nov. 1.

""Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,"" they said in the lawsuit.

The USDA, for its part, had not yet shared details on the policy decision or decision not to funnel the contingency funds to SNAP beneficiaries.

A note on its website stated simply that, ""[T]he well has run dry.""

California's ballot question was a reaction to Trump's redistricting push

This summer President Trump set off a national redistricting race, starting in Texas, to boost chances for GOP candidates in 2026. Missouri and North Carolina Republicans also redistricted and Trump is urging leaders in Indiana, Kansas and other states to follow. Democrats say the GOP is gerrymandering in ways that dilute the votes of Black and Latino communities.

California's redistricting proposal, Proposition 50, would redraw the state's congressional map to help yield up to five new seats for Democrats. California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom set it in motion after Texas Republicans moved to get the edge in five seats in their state.

Republicans in California could pay the price. Mike Murray, another Republican voter in the third Congressional district that Loomis is in, says the ballot proposal will dilute his community's voice by splitting the county into three separate districts.

""If we wanted to live in an urban community with the problems and the benefits of an urban community, we would. But we choose to live here. And when we choose to live here, we hope that somebody will represent us in our way of life,"" Murray said.

Eric Schickler, co-director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, says opponents of California's redistricting plan are concerned it will sideline the state's independent citizens redistricting commission, which has helped give their communities a voice.

""The basic argument made by opponents of Prop 50 is that the non-partisan process that was set up in 2008 for the legislature and 2010 for Congress has worked well for the state. It's giving rise to more competitive elections,"" Schickler said.

""To the extent that voters care about having a check on President Trump, well, you need a Democratic House to do that, is the argument that Democrats are making,"" Schickler added.

Cyan Samone lives in Truckee, California near Lake Tahoe, a blue dot in the same Republican congressional district as the town of Loomis.

At a recent gathering of local Democrats organizing to support Prop 50, Samone said the redistricting is a chance to push back on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

""I have a lot of friends who are immigrants from different countries who have left authoritarian regimes,"" said Samone. ""You see the patterns and you just don't want to see that happen here and I don't want to have to see people who fled terrible situations having to run again.""

Samone's husband, Ben Woodard, says redistricting could mean Democrats here are able to elect a representative that'll pay more attention to what his community needs.

""The Democratic Party representative would do that,"" Woodard said. ""Look over our interests like, you know, the cuts to Medicare definitely impact rural health care.""

Supporters of California's redistricting measure appear to have the upper hand heading into election week.

CARLYLE, Ill. — When Jose Jeronimo Guardian showed up at a Spanish language traffic court this week, he didn’t expect to be detained and face expulsion from a country he’d lived in for more than two decades.

Guardian, 48, was scheduled to appear Monday in a courtroom where a county-provided translator would aid communication with about a dozen Spanish-speaking defendants who face charges from traffic infractions like his — two charges of driving under the influence of alcohol — to serious felony charges.

Guardian never made it into the courtroom.

Instead, an agent who said he was from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement questioned him in a lobby of the Clinton County Courthouse, handcuffed him, then loaded him into the back of an unmarked car and drove him to a Missouri detention center where he would await deportation.

Detentions at state and county courthouses would be banned under legislation passed early Friday morning. The state legislature approved a bill barring immigration arrests in and around county courthouses, and nearby parking lots and sidewalks. House Bill 1312, which would also allow Illinois residents to sue for civil rights violations, still must be signed by Gov. JB Pritzker.

Though instances of ICE detentions in Illinois have been centered on Chicago since President Donald Trump began “Operation Midway Blitz” in September, Gov. JB Pritzker said Tuesday there has been an uptick recently in ICE activity in central and southern Illinois.

“They are literally targeting people who are brown and Black, whether you are undocumented or not, and they are tackling people, detaining people for hours, zip-tying people who are U.S. citizens. So, they’re indiscriminately grabbing people who don’t look like the ICE agents, typically, and holding them or mistreating them,” Pritzker said.

Clinton County, where Guardian was detained, is a rural area 45 miles east of St. Louis. It is overwhelmingly white with just 4% of the population reporting they are Latino, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

ICE says he was deported three times

Guardian was detained in a lobby outside the Clinton County Circuit Clerk’s Office as he headed up the stairs to the courtroom when he was approached by four men who said they were ICE agents. They asked his name, then put handcuffs on him. One of the men who identified himself as an immigration agent said Guardian has been deported three times before — an allegation his daughter refuted.

As a reporter captured Guardian’s detention on video, one of the men asked a court bailiff to get the reporter to stop recording. The bailiff declined, saying video recording was allowed in public areas outside of the courtroom.

The purported federal agents walked out of the courthouse with Guardian, tailed by his daughter, Isabel, who was holding her baby. Guardian was placed in the back of one of the cars. Isabel Guardian asked for her father’s phone, then asked where they were taking him.

One of the men responded that her father was facing deportation and would be taken to St. Louis.

As they were leaving, the four ignored requests from a reporter for them to identify themselves, then got into their unmarked cars parked nearby and left.

“This is the first instance we have heard of an apprehension taking place at a Spanish- language docket. The targeting of a Spanish-language docket in a broad way would be troubling, as it might suggest that ICE officials — as we saw in Los Angeles and heard directly from their leadership in Chicago — are targeting people for the language they speak,” said Ed Yohnka, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union.

Guardian, 48, came to the U.S. from Mexico 25 years ago, according to his daughter. He worked in the orchards and fields around Clinton County as a picker and a rancher.

Guardian began drinking after recent stressors — a move, financial troubles and a family member’s health issues, his daughter said. He was arrested in July for drinking and driving and went to in-patient treatment but was discharged after a couple of days, she said. He was arrested again a week later, again for drinking and driving.

After the second arrest, Isabel Guardian said her father, who is undocumented, gave up drinking and wanted to address the DUI charges, understanding that convictions on those charges could jeopardize his ability to get a Green Card.

His public defender advised Guardian to turn himself in to ICE, Isabel Guardian said, but her father wanted to deal with his traffic cases so that if he was deported, he could return to his family someday. That’s why he showed up to court on Monday, his daughter said.

“He said he was willing to cooperate,” Isabel Guardian said. “He wasn’t fighting them.”

All of Guardian’s children have legal status, his daughter said, and his wife just received her Green Card, but Guardian remained undocumented. He was beginning the process of being documented after the rest of the family because it was expensive, Isabel Guardian said.

ICE activity seen elsewhere in Illinois

In the Metro East, Fairmont City is a village that for decades has been heavily populated by Latino immigrants — citizens, those with legal status and undocumented. ICE has been active in the area. Earlier this year, Marleen Suarez, a Fairmont City attorney, began offering free conditional guardianships for parents who are undocumented.

Suarez, who also practices criminal law, said she had three defendants scheduled to appear at Clinton County’s Spanish-speaking docket, but had rescheduled them due to a scheduling conflict on Monday morning. She said she was shocked but not surprised that ICE was targeting downstate courthouses.

“I am going to advise my clients to be much more conscientious from now on,” Suarez said. “I will work with the staff and judiciary there to ensure the safety of my clients so we can adjudicate their cases. It’s disheartening because our courthouses should be a refuge for those seeking justice.”

Yohnka, the ACLU spokesperson, said it’s not just traffic dockets drawing ICE. After reports of apprehensions at Chicago’s domestic violence courts, victims were failing to appear and complaints were being dropped, Yohnka said.

In Cook County, a judge issued an order two weeks ago barring the civil arrest of any “party, witness, or potential witness” while going to court proceedings. It includes arrests made inside courthouses and surrounding parking lots, sidewalks and entryways.

“The fair administration of justice requires that courts remain open and accessible, and that litigants and witnesses may appear without fear of civil arrest,” the order states.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has defended the practice of making arrests at courthouses, calling it “common sense.”

The newly passed legislation would address immigration arrests at courthouses around the state.

In Macoupin County, Ismael Sandoval Ayuzo, owner of Caldera Bar and Grill on Main Street in Staunton located about 35 miles northeast of St. Louis, was detained by ICE this week. A message on the restaurant’s front door and on their social media stated that the eatery would be closed on Wednesday.

The day before, Ayuzo, a husband and father of two who has lived in the U.S. for two decades, was delivering a computer cord to his children’s school in Staunton when he was stopped and detained, his brother said. Now, his family worries he will face deportation to Mexico.

“His home is here. His daughters are here,” said Ismael Ayuzo’s brother, Rafael Ayuzo.

Ayuzo’s detention launched an outcry in his hometown, planning a community event: “We stand with Ismael.” Chelsa Pruden, co-founder of Macoupin County Indivisible and event organizer, said the restaurateur was very involved with the community and the school, including hosting a recent fundraiser for the high school band.

“This community loves him. We are a small town and this has rocked us,” Pruden said. “I don’t think that anyone thought that ICE would come here.”

Isabel Guardian said she talked to her father on Tuesday. He was in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, awaiting deportation. His DUI cases were postponed to November but remain pending.

In Springfield, Democratic House members held a press conference at the Statehouse on Tuesday, suggesting legislative fixes such as safe zones around childcare centers, hospitals and courthouses.

“We are a nation built on liberty and due process, not fear and disappearance. No one should be taken from their family, from their home, from our courthouse, from the store or their job without cause or compassion, said Rep. Nicolle Grasse, D-Arlington Heights. “Our community deserves real safety, the kind that comes from justice, not intimidation.”

Soon, according to the newly published procurement document, private sector ICE contractors will surveil and confirm the home or work addresses of tens of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. and then report their locations back to the government.

Under the plan, bounty hunters may receive “monetary bonuses” depending on how successfully they track down their targets — and how many immigrants they then report to ICE.

According to the document, which solicits information from interested contractors for a potentially forthcoming contract opportunity, companies hired by ICE will be given bundles of information on 10,000 immigrants at a time to locate, with further assignments provided in “increments of 10,000 up to 1,000,000.”

The solicitation says ICE is considering “monetary bonuses” paid out based on performance.

The solicitation says ICE is “exploring an incentive based pricing structure” to encourage quick results, with “monetary bonuses” paid out based on performance. For example, ICE says contractors might get paid a bonus for identifying a person’s correct address on the first try or finding 90 percent of its targets within a set timeframe. (ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)

The document closely resembles a plan reportedly circulated by a group of military contractors, including former Blackwater CEO and Trump ally Erik Prince.

In February, Politico reported that Prince and other were pushing for the formation of a private efforts to locate immigrants and a “bounty program which provides a cash reward for each illegal alien held by a state or local law enforcement officer,” according pitch materials obtained by the outlet.

The proposal called for “skip-tracing,” a method of using available information to locate people — something ICE is already handing out multimillion-dollar contracts for, according to a recent report in The Lever.

Soon, according to the newly published procurement document, private sector ICE contractors will surveil and confirm the home or work addresses of tens of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. and then report their locations back to the government.

“DHS ICE has an immediate need for Skip Tracing and Process Serving Services using Government furnished case data with identifiable information, commercial data verification, and physical observation services, to verify alien address information, investigate alternative alien address information, confirm the new location of aliens, and deliver materials/documents to aliens as appropriate,” according to the October 31 request for information.

Data provided by ICE will include “case data” provided by the government, location data, social media information, as well as “photos and documents” showing where a person lives or works. With this in hand, contractors will surveil their target to confirm the accuracy of their home address, including “time-stamped photographs of the location,” before reporting back to ICE.

“The vendor should prioritize the alien’s residence,” the document notes, “but failing that will attempt to verify place of employment.”

The plan entails not just on-the-ground monitoring but the use of digital surveillance. ICE says contractors can use off-the-shelf surveillance technology to confirm immigrants’ addresses, including “Enhanced location research, which entails automated and manual real-time skip tracing.”

Surveillance tools that ingest and track mobile phone location data are widely available on the private market, many of them already used by ICE.

“Multiple verification sources are recommended to achieve a high confidence level,” the document says, encouraging potential vendors to use “all technology systems available.”

The new procurement document notes that “the Government is contemplating awarding contracts to multiple vendors” due to the large number of immigrants whose whereabouts it seeks to confirm.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2195569259-1-e1761954223923.jpg?fit=4000%2C2000&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-11-01 12:02:20.277495

Brooke Jackson, lawyers tried to show a pattern and a practice since President Trump took office of ICE not following the law.
The federal government argued there wasn’t “standing” in this case, which means it wasn’t appropriate to bring to a federal court for relief.
But Judge Jackson seemed skeptical of that argument and asked why they didn’t just stipulate that ICE follows the law that is in the books.
At one point, Jackson said it appeared Davies didn’t understand the law he purports to follow every day.
Under oath, Davies mangled the two reasons a person should be detained without a warrant nationally.","A top-ranking Colorado Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervisor testified Friday that the man and two children stopped and detained in Durango earlier this week were initially mistaken for someone ICE was targeting — but were grabbed and detained by the agency anyway.

Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, 45, and his two children, identified in court as J, a 12-year-old girl in middle school in Durango and K, a 15-year-old boy, were picked up en route to school on Monday and now they are now in Dilley Detention Center in Texas. That’s the only ICE holding facility nationally that accommodates families.

ICE Supervisor Gregory Davies told a judge on Friday in a separate civil case on warrantless detentions that his understanding was that Jaramillo-Solano is what ICE called a “collateral arrest” and that they didn’t have a warrant for him, but they took him in anyway.

It actually played into the hand of the argument made over the past two days in court by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado in their newest federal lawsuit against the Trump administration. The ACLU has filed suit arguing ICE fails to assess whether people are at risk of fleeing before detaining them for weeks and sometimes months.

Their four plaintiffs had similar circumstances before they were detained by ICE: they were all in the country without status, they had no criminal records, they had long ties to their respective communities and families and they didn’t pose any known public safety risk.

In a two-day hearing in front of the federal U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson, lawyers tried to show a pattern and a practice since President Trump took office of ICE not following the law. That has already resulted in a consent decree imposed by a federal judge in Illinois, where ICE was failing to properly document why someone is a flight risk and therefore should be detained. That’s the same complaint being made against the agency in Colorado.

In court on Friday, plaintiffs lawyer Kenzo Kawanabe showed a number of I-213 forms, which are filled out at the time of arresting an undocumented immigrant, to the judge. Those forms were supposed to show why the various people were considered a flight risk. The forms entered into evidence didn’t have that information.

The federal government argued there wasn’t “standing” in this case, which means it wasn’t appropriate to bring to a federal court for relief. Department of Justice lawyer Logan Brown said the four plaintiffs in the lawsuit would have a “vanishingly small” chance of being arrested again without a warrant and the plaintiffs’ lawyers couldn’t prove future injury.

But Judge Jackson seemed skeptical of that argument and asked why they didn’t just stipulate that ICE follows the law that is in the books.

“They’re not challenging the actual policy,” Brown said, of the plaintiffs’ attorneys.

“They want you to follow your own policy,” Jackson said.

One of the plaintiffs who testified, Caroline Dias Goncalves, was stopped in Mesa County this summer. Goncalves is a University of Utah student and was brought here as a child by her parents from Brazil. Her flight risk or her individual life circumstances did not appear to be assessed by immigration officials before she was detained for two weeks.

Brown, who was representing ICE, said that Goncalves was driving in Colorado, which is out of state from her home and that ICE knew she was a “visa overstayer,” which was enough for a warrantless arrest.

“That’s what your client thinks is enough,” Jackson said. “That’s not what this court thinks is enough.”

While Jackson didn’t rule immediately after the two-day hearing, at times he was openly skeptical of the government’s defense that they already follow the law. At one point, Jackson said it appeared Davies didn’t understand the law he purports to follow every day. Under oath, Davies mangled the two reasons a person should be detained without a warrant nationally.

“There is a policy and these guys don’t follow it, they may just not know what it is,” Jackson said. “I think it’s reasonable that the policy they’re really following is what the supervisors are telling them to do, and the supervisors are saying go arrest people, as many as you can get!”

Immigration and Border Patrol officers have arrested more than 3,000 people who authorities say were in the U.S. illegally and in some cases wanted for serious crimes, all in the seven weeks since feds intensified their efforts in the state.

Attorneys consulted by NBC Chicago, however, say federal authorities have refused — or are unable — to disclose where many of those detainees are being held or whether they have already been deported.

""It is quite dire,"" said Mark Fleming of the National Immigrant Justice Center, which is suing federal authorities. ""These are folks that have been here for decades, have long standing ties to the community, family members, employment, businesses that are all being torn apart.""

Fleming said he believes the government is arresting people, placing them into ""unlawful mandatory detention,"" then pressuring them into so-called voluntary departure — in which detainees waive legal rights and return to their home countries. Homeland Security officials have not released a full list of arrestees or deportations.

Separately, attorneys filed new motions Monday to block federal agents from using tear gas in Chicago, citing repeated alleged violations of an existing restraining order. ABC7 Chicago reported that complaints have come from multiple neighborhoods, with residents — including a pregnant woman — expressing concern about health impacts.

The filings reference Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, who has overseen Midway Blitz operations. In a recent ABC News interview, Bovino confirmed nearly 3,000 arrests since the crackdown began and defended the use of chemical agents as ""the least amount of force necessary.""

Bovino is scheduled to appear before Judge Sarah Ellis to explain his actions as court filings accuse him of violating restrictions by deploying chemical agents without audible warning. DHS has said Bovino was struck by an object thrown by protesters, though plaintiffs dispute that account.

Additional court documents describe multiple recent incidents in which agents allegedly used force, including during a neighborhood Halloween parade. Plaintiffs say federal officers tackled residents and repeatedly deployed tear gas without warning. DHS said in a statement that ""rioters and terrorists"" have attacked officers and that ICE and CBP personnel ""use the minimum amount of force necessary.""

The court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers.

Ellis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order before further freezing it Friday.

Meanwhile, Illinois advocates in a different case Friday sued federal authorities for what they described as “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.

Attorneys with the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center say U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have denied people being held at the Broadview facility private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from entering the building, creating a “black box” they say has allowed authorities to act “with impunity.”

Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don’t understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and face deportation, according to the lawsuit.

Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Illinois office and lead attorney for the lawsuit, said community members are “being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights.”

“Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,” she said.

Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin denied the assertions and said such allegations have contributed to an increase in death threats against immigration officers. She said people are held only briefly before being transferred to detention facilities.

“Any claims there are subprime conditions at the Broadview ICE facility are false. All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers,” the statement said. “No one is denied access to proper medical care. There is a privacy wall around the toilet for detainees.”

Attorneys accuse ICE, DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection of violating detainees’ constitutional rights to due process and access to a lawyer and have asked the court to force the agencies to improve the facility’s conditions.

The 76-page lawsuit paints a bleak picture of the facility, which attorneys say is “extremely cramped” and “smells strongly of feces, urine, and body odor,” while insects were found in the sinks and clogged toilets led to urine on the floor. One man described people lying on top of each other and in the bathroom, unable to find space to sleep.

“They treated us like animals, or worse than animals, because no one treats their pets like that,” one woman said in the lawsuit.

Several people said they were detained at the processing center for durations ranging from a couple days to three weeks.

Advocates have for months raised concerns about conditions at the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held there have called it a de facto detention center, saying up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.

The Broadview center has also drawn demonstrations, which have led to the arrests of numerous protesters. The protests are at the center of a separate lawsuit from a coalition of news outlets and protesters who claim federal agents violated their First Amendment rights by repeatedly using tear gas and other weapons on them.

Ellis sided with the coalition earlier this month, requiring federal agents in the Chicago area to wear badges and banning them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. Later, Ellis also required body cameras for agents who have them after raising concerns about her initial order not being followed.

,Litigation,2025-11-01 10:07:45+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Proposition 50 could disenfranchise Republican California voters. Will it survive a legal challenge?,"Jenny Jarvie, www.latimes.com, jenny-jarvie",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-11-01/why-prop-50-likely-to-survive-legal-challenge-despite-disenfranchising-some-california-voters,"Experts say opponents of Proposition 50 have no viable federal legal challenge against the new maps on the basis that they disenfranchise a large chunk of California Republicans.
Even since the 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision Rucho vs. Common Cause, complaints of partisan gerrymandering have no path in federal court.
One route would be to claim that Proposition 50 violates the California Constitution.
David A. Carrillo, executive director of the California Constitution Center at Berkeley Law, said that if Proposition 50 passes, he expects a barrage of “see what sticks” lawsuits raising California constitutional claims.
Another option is a narrower bill proposed this summer by Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe and could lose his seat if Proposition 50 passes.","Six years ago, when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld highly partisan state election maps in North Carolina and Maryland — ruling that federal courts cannot block states from drawing up maps that favor one party over the other — one of the court’s liberal justices issued a warning.

“If left unchecked, gerrymanders like the ones here may irreparably damage our system of government,” Associate Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissent.

Kagan argued that Republicans in North Carolina and Democrats in Maryland — the two examples before the court — had rigged elections in a way that “deprived citizens of the most fundamental of their constitutional rights,” “debased and dishonored our democracy” and turned “upside-down the core American idea that all governmental power derives from the people.”

“Ask yourself,” Kagan said as she recounted what had happened in each state: “Is this how American democracy is supposed to work?”

That’s the question Californians are now weighing as they decide how, or whether, to vote on Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to scrap congressional maps drawn by the state’s independent redistricting commission and replace them with maps drawn by legislators to favor Democrats through 2030.

Democrats don’t deny that the measure is a deliberate attempt to dilute GOP voting power.

From the start, they’ve argued that the point of redistricting is to weaken Republicans’ voting power in California — a move they justify on the grounds that it is a temporary fix to offset similar partisan gerrymandering by Texas Republicans. This summer, President Trump upped the ante, pressing Texas to rejigger maps to shore up the GOP’s narrow House majority ahead of the 2026 election.

Experts say opponents of Proposition 50 have no viable federal legal challenge against the new maps on the basis that they disenfranchise a large chunk of California Republicans. Even since the 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision Rucho vs. Common Cause, complaints of partisan gerrymandering have no path in federal court.

Already, Proposition 50 has survived challenges in state court and is unlikely to be successfully challenged if passed, said Richard L. Hasen, professor of law and director of the Safeguarding Democracy Project at UCLA School of Law.

“If you’re a Republican in California, or you’re a Democrat in Texas, you’re about to get a lot less representation in Congress,” Hasen said. “I don’t think there’s anything you can do about that.”

If Californians vote in favor of the measure on Tuesday, the number of Republicans in the state’s House — nine of 52 total members — would likely be reduced by five. That could mean Republicans have less than 10% of California’s congressional representation even though Trump won 38% of the 2024 vote.

“All of this is unconstitutional, but the federal courts aren’t available to help,” said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Law School.

“Every time you redraw a district specifically to protect some candidates and punish others,” Levitt said, “what you’re basically saying is it shouldn’t be up to the voters to weigh in on whether they think the candidates are doing a good job or not.”

Possible legal avenues

But even if the issue of partisan gerrymandering is blocked in federal courts, there are other potential legal avenues to challenge California’s new legislative maps.

One route would be to claim that Proposition 50 violates the California Constitution.

David A. Carrillo, executive director of the California Constitution Center at Berkeley Law, said that if Proposition 50 passes, he expects a barrage of “see what sticks” lawsuits raising California constitutional claims. They stand little chance of success, he said.

“Voters created the redistricting commission,” he said. “What the voters created they can change or abolish.”

Attorneys might also bring racial discrimination claims in federal court alleging California lawmakers used partisan affiliation as a pretext for race in drawing the maps to disenfranchise one racial group or another, Carrillo said. Under current law, he said, such claims are very fact-dependent.

Attorneys are already poised to file complaints if the referendum passes.

Mark Meuser, a conservative attorney who filed a state complaint this summer seeking to block Proposition 50, said he is ready to file a federal lawsuit on the grounds that the new maps violate the Equal Protection Clause in the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

“We’re saying that race was a predominant factor in drawing the lines,” Meuser said. “When race is a predominant factor in drawing the lines without a compelling interest, strict scrutiny will mandate the maps be stricken.”

Some legal experts believe that would be a tricky case to prove.

“It sure seems like the new map was oriented predominantly around politics, not race,” Levitt argued. “And though they’d be saying that race was a predominant factor in drawing the lines, that’s very, very, very different from proving it. That’s an uphill mountain to climb on these facts.”

Some experts think the new maps are unlikely to raise strong Voting Rights Act challenges.

Eric McGhee, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California who specializes in elections, said the new districts appeared to have been carefully carved to preserve Latino- or Black-majority districts.

A successful challenge is possible, McGhee said, noting there are always novel legal arguments. “It’s just the big ones that you would think about that are the most obvious and the most traditional are pretty closed,” he said.

Supreme Court looms large

Ultimately, legal experts agree the fate of California maps — and other maps in Texas and across the nation — would depend on the Supreme Court’s upcoming ruling on a redistricting case from Louisiana.

Last month, conservative Supreme Court justices suggested in a hearing that they were considering reining in a key part of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act that prohibits voting practices or procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language minority group.

“Whatever happens with Proposition 50 — pass or fail — almost doesn’t matter in the grand scheme of things,” Carrillo said, noting that the Supreme Court could use the Louisiana case to strike Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. “There’s a big litigation storm coming in almost any scenario.”

Levitt agreed that the Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act, which could come any time between now and June, could change current law. But he stressed it is impossible to predict how broad the ruling could be.

“Whether that leaves any of California’s districts vulnerable — either in the current map or in the map if Prop. 50 passes — depends entirely on what Scotus says,” Levitt argued. “There are only nine people who know what they’ll actually say, and there are a lot of possibilities, some of which might affect California’s map pretty substantially, and some of which are unlikely to affect California’s map at all.”

Will Congress intervene?

As the redistricting battle spreads across the country and Democratic and Republican states look to follow Texas and California, Democrats could ultimately end up at a disadvantage. If the overall tilt favors Republicans, Democrats would have to win more than 50% of the vote to get a majority of seats.

Congress has the power to block partisan gerrymandering in congressional map drawing. But attempts so far to pass redistricting reform have been unsuccessful.

In 2022, the House passed the Freedom to Vote Act, which would have prohibited mid-decade redistricting and blocked partisan gerrymandering of congressional maps. But Republicans were able to block the bill in the Senate, even though it had majority support, due to that chamber’s filibuster rules.

Another option is a narrower bill proposed this summer by Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley, who represents parts of the Sacramento suburbs and Lake Tahoe and could lose his seat if Proposition 50 passes. Kiley’s bill, along with similar legislation introduced by California Democratic representatives, would ban mid-decade redistricting.

“That would be the cleanest way of addressing this particular scenario we’re in right now, because all of these new plans that have been drawn would become null and void,” McGhee said.

But in a heavily deadlocked Congress, Kiley’s bill has little prospect of moving.

“It may have to get worse before it gets better,” Hasen said.

If the redistricting war doesn’t get resolved, Hasen said, there will be a continued race to the bottom, particularly if the Supreme Court weakens or strikes down Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.

Another scenario, Hasen argued, is Democrats regain control of Congress and the presidency, overcome the filibuster rule and pass redistricting reform.

If that doesn’t happen, Levitt said, the ultimate power rests with the people.

“If we want to tell our representatives that we’re sick of this, we can,” Levitt said. “There’s a lot that’s competing for voters’ attention. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t have agency here.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/37b56fa/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7779x4084+0+623/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fef%2Fa1%2F0fe3f51744dd80938758ad78c79a%2F1523944-me-human-chain-standalone-cmh-04.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 06:56:25.262007

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign on Wednesday.
The administration announced that determination in a notification to Congress in September, after the first couple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Mediterranean.
The Trump administration sanctioned Petro last week, saying he had allowed ""drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.""","Geneva — The United Nations human rights chief said Friday that U.S. military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are ""unacceptable"" and must stop.

The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a U.N. organization.

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk's office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: ""These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.""

She said Türk believed ""airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.""

President Trump has justified the attacks on what his administration calls ""narco-trafficking vessels"" as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the U.S., but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign on Wednesday. He said it targeted a boat carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Four people on board the vessel were killed. It was the 14th strike and the 15th boat destroyed since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.

In some but not all of the strikes, U.S. officials have said the boats were linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which the Trump administration has designated a terrorist organization.

The administration announced just weeks ago that it had determined the U.S. is in a ""non-international armed conflict"" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, including Tren de Aargua.

The administration announced that determination in a notification to Congress in September, after the first couple strikes on alleged drug boats in the Mediterranean. That notice referred to three individuals killed in a Sept. 15 strike as ""unlawful combatants,"" which is the same term former President George W. Bush's administration used to describe members of al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks.

After Sept. 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress authorized the use of military force against the terrorist organizations responsible for the terrorist attacks carried out that day. Congress has not yet authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels, and many details of the operations remain unclear, including which U.S. forces are carrying out the strikes, based on what specific intelligence, and with what weapons.

Colombian President Gustavo Petro has been among the most vocal critics of the strikes, questioning their legality under international law, and their efficacy in combating the gangs that traffic narcotics during an interview with CBS News. The Trump administration sanctioned Petro last week, saying he had allowed ""drug cartels to flourish and refused to stop this activity.""

Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by ""careful limits"" placed on the use of lethal force.

Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing ""an imminent threat to life,"" she said. ""Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.""

The strikes are taking place ""outside the context"" of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/03/c9624818-4187-4cd5-90f2-3daf629661fc/thumbnail/1200x630/d868188413fb260dbe1bae195f978fb6/venezuela-screenshot-2025-10-03-130743.png,N,,2025-11-01 07:16:50.639904

Reed of the Criminal Division’s HRSP and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Stitt for the Northern District of New York are prosecuting the case.","A dual Canadian American citizen made her initial appearance in court in Plattsburg, New York today after being extradited to New York from Canada to face charges relating to her role in a deadly human smuggling conspiracy that left a family of four, including two small children, dead in the St. Lawrence River.

In June 2024, a federal grand jury in the Northern District of New York returned an indictment against Stephanie Square, 52, of the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian Reservation (AMIR), Canada, for conspiring to engage in alien smuggling, four counts of alien smuggling for profit, and four counts of alien smuggling resulting in death.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, Acting United States Attorney John A. Sarcone III, and Erin Keegan, Special Agent in Charge of the Buffalo Field Office of Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), made the announcement.

Square was arrested in Canada in August 2024 at the request of the U.S. government. Her extradition followed extensive coordination and cooperation between U.S. and Canadian law enforcement authorities. Co-conspirator Timothy Oakes, 34, from the AMIR, was arrested on June 15, 2025, and remains detained pending trial for his role in the deadly conspiracy. U.S.-based co-conspirators Dakota Montour, 31, and Kawisiiostha Celecia Sharrow, 43, both of Akwesasne, New York, and Janet Terrance, 45, of Hogansburg, New York, entered guilty pleas on Jan. 23, 2025, Oct. 8, 2024, and March 6, 2025, respectively.

According to court documents, Square allegedly was the U.S.-based leader of an alien smuggling organization (ASO), that regularly smuggled aliens across the U.S.-Canada border via the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian Reservation. During the week of March 27, 2023, a prolific Canadian smuggler contacted Square to smuggle a Romanian family of four across the St. Lawrence River into the United States. In furtherance of the conspiracy, Square is alleged to have recruited multiple co-conspirators to assist with the smuggling of the family, though one refused to assist due to the high winds on the St. Lawrence River that night. Undeterred by the dangerous weather conditions, as alleged, Square enlisted one of her regular drivers, Dakota Montour, to transport the family via automobile to Timothy Oakes’ residence on Cornwall Island, a notorious staging area for cross-border smuggling operations.

The family of four arrived at the Oakes’ residence on March 29, 2023, at approximately 3:35AM, and stayed there until evening. On March 29, 2023, at approximately 9:29PM, Timothy Oakes’ vehicle with a light blue boat in tow, is recorded traveling eastbound away from the Oakes’ residence towards a public boat launch.

On March 29, 2023, between 10:09PM and 10:50PM, the Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service (AMPS) received multiple calls from citizens on Cornwall Island reporting hearing cries for help on the St. Lawrence River. The callers also reported the terrible weather conditions. At the same time, Square instructed Montour to search the banks of the St. Lawrence River for the missing family. On March 30, 2023, at approximately 3:36AM, Square instructed Montour to delete all their messages.

Between March 30 and 31, 2023, AMPS conducted a riverine search and recovered the bodies of the Romanian family of four, including two small children. AMPS also recovered Oakes’ light blue boat. The body of the boat captain, Case Oakes, was found eight months later.

HSI Massena engaged in an extensive years-long investigation of the case, with assistance from the U.S. Border Patrol, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), HSI’s Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C., CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force, New York State Police, Canada Border Services Agency, Akwesasne Mohawk Police Service, St. Regis Mohawk Tribal Police Department, Ontario Provincial Police, Sûreté du Québec, St. Lawrence County Sheriff’s Department, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Cornwall Police Service. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs provided significant support with foreign legal assistance requests.

The investigation is a result of the coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA). JTFA, a partnership with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been elevated and expanded by the Attorney General with a mandate to target cartels and other transnational criminal organizations and eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating within the Americas that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the border, including the Northern District of New York. Dedicated support is provided by numerous components of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations and the Office of International Affairs (OIA), among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, and the Drug Enforcement Administration, and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 420 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers, and significant facilitators of alien smuggling; more than 370 U.S. convictions; more than 315 significant jail sentences imposed; and forfeitures of substantial assets.

It shouldn't happen

Many Americans have never thought they would be food insecure, but some 500,000 federal workers will not be getting the paychecks they were promised. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) serves about 40 million parents with children, the elderly, and non-elderly disabled people. Today, these benefits could stop. Combine the federal workers with the SNAP recipients, add the people who were already food insecure, then add all the federal workers who were fired by the current administration for no apparent reason, and we have a lot of people who will be hungry. Food banks nationwide will be overwhelmed. Thousands of first-time users will be lining up. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom will deploy the National Guard to stand watch at food banks to protect the volunteers.

What a shame this is! In a country with so much, this should not be happening. What can we all do to help? If you have the means, give generously to local food banks. If your church runs a food bank, make your weekly offering substantial and designate it to go to the food bank. Do not keep blinders on and hope this situation will resolve itself quickly. Do whatever you can to help lessen the impact of Donald Trump's policies. Per John Wesley, ""Do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, in all the places you can, at all times you can, to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.""

Immigrants pay taxes

Charles Vermont of Bentonville wrote that Democrats had let ""tens of millions of unvetted immigrants into the country with no thought of the cost."" I guess he never read that in 2022, those immigrants that he seems to abhor paid $25.7 billion into Social Security and $6.4 billion into Medicare, programs from which they can never draw. Actually, those immigrants' money is ""propping up"" both. In addition to those two amounts, they paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state, and local taxes. This information came from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP). If you doubt it, check it.

Now, look at it like this, Mr. Vermont: All those billions that federal, state, and local entities rely on and those billions that were helping old folks who depend on both Social Security and Medicare for income and health care are now lost because the immigrants who were paying them have been sent out of the country. You think that is a smart move?

Inviting fear and hate

America is in the midst of deeply unsettling societal change. Globalization and AI-driven automation have created significant economic insecurity. Malignant political polarization has enticed many news outlets to emphasize ""red or blue"" versions of truth. The Russian president is boasting about his country's nuclear capabilities. Existential fear is rising.

Laboratory animals exposed to random mild electrical shocks will soon begin to attack one another, mistakenly viewing the ""other"" as the cause of their discomfort. We humans are not immune to blaming others. Increasingly politicians exploit our fears and exaggerate our differences for political gain. Social media algorithms aim to capture and monetize our attention and ignore the damage of leading us down rabbit holes of anger and division. Cultural cohesion is being shattered by our willingness to join the ""red or blue army"" and ignore our common values.

""They"" too have sleepless nights when their children are ill. ""They"" don't ask about political leanings when an injured person needs help. ""They"" too have deep anxiety when their job security is threatened. We share many more values than we take the time to realize.

Our politicians hone their performative skills in a self-defeating tragicomedy of ""blaming"" others. They too are human, caught in the storm of political division and trying to survive. If we fail to awaken from this soulless, nation-destroying battle, a crushing tragedy will befall our children.

Fear and anger can cloud our basic goodness and bring forth our darkest and most dangerous emotion: hate. Any politician that invites us to feel fear and hate toward other citizens clearly lacks moral clarity and is attempting to exploit us for political purposes. If seduced by hate, lurking in that darkness is the potential for unimaginable cruelty. Being mean and coldhearted reveals underlying cowardice; being kind requires confidence and courage.

Jaramillo-Solano’s wife told Hamilton that ICE agents had “beaten” her husband and children and kept them in a “dungeon”-like room in Durango, where the adolescents — a boy and girl — had to share a urinal with their father.","Immigration authorities mistakenly identified a Durango father when they pulled him over earlier this week, a senior enforcement official said Friday, but agents still arrested the father and his two children in an incident that quickly sparked protests in the Colorado mountain town.

Gregory Davies, Denver’s third-ranking official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified about the incident in court Friday morning during a hearing in a lawsuit challenging ICE’s arrest practices in Colorado. He had previously said ICE officials research and surveil their targets using multi-agent teams before they try to arrest them.

But he acknowledged that the ICE agents didn’t know they were pulling over Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, who is Colombian, when they stopped him and his 12- and 15-year-old children on their way to their Durango school Monday morning.

“It’s my understanding that the father was mistaken for somebody else when (ICE) encountered him,” he said during the federal court hearing in Denver.

He said Jaramillo-Solano and his children were then arrested anyway, without warrants. While that is allowed in certain circumstances, the lawsuit asserts that ICE has done that too often as part of a broader policy and without meeting legal requirements.

Agents have to determine that the person is in the country illegally and that they’re likely to flee if they’re not arrested. Four people detained by ICE in Colorado this year filed the lawsuit at issue in Friday’s hearing, alleging that ICE arrested them and others without first determining if they were likely to flee.

They’ve argued that the arrests are part of the Trump administration’s broader efforts to mass-deport immigrants without proper legal status.

The plaintiffs have asked a judge to intervene and declare ICE’s alleged arrest practices illegal, and they pointed to Jaramillo-Solano’s arrest as evidence that ICE’s alleged pattern has escalated in real time. All four testified this week, describing spending weeks in detention and having their lives upended after ICE arrested them. One man, identified only by his initials JST, said he lost “everything” after he was arrested near Aurora’s Whisping Pines apartments in February.

“I lost my apartment. I lost all the things I had, my clothing. I was left with nothing. I started from zero,” the man said through an interpreter.

Davies served as a government witness to defend against that lawsuit, as part of a two-day hearing seeking a prohibition on the allegedly illegal arrests. Lawyers representing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, have argued that standing federal policy — reiterated in an Oct. 22 memo — requires officers to follow certain procedures to ensure their arrests are lawful.

Because of that policy, they said this week, U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson doesn’t need to enter an order prohibiting a practice that ICE already regulates. The memo was issued in part because of similar litigation in Illinois.

Seeking an order restricting arrests

But the attorneys who filed the lawsuit have argued that ICE agents have consistently ignored that policy and continue to do so, even after the recent memo from ICE’s top legal advisor.

Kenzo Kawanabe, one of the attorneys on the case, pointed to the arrests in Durango, along with the immigration arrest of a Douglas County teacher and her family last week, to allege that ICE still wasn’t following its own policy.

During the hearing, Jackson repeatedly asked the Homeland Security Department’s attorneys if they would agree to a court order — requiring ICE agents in Colorado to follow the policy — and end the suit. But the attorneys refused because, they argued, the Colorado lawsuit was baseless and they shouldn’t be subjected to a court order to end litigation they believed was doomed.

The department’s lawyers argued that the four plaintiffs were unlikely to be arrested again and that ICE had no policy of arresting any undocumented immigrant unlawfully. Nor does the agency pursue every immigrant without legal status, they said — an assertion that contrasts with comments in interviews by both Stephen Miller, a senior White House aide, and Denver’s now-former top ICE official, both of whom told reporters that ICE did indeed intend to arrest anyone in the country illegally.

“What (plaintiffs) have done is take several instances of supposedly unlawful behavior, asserted there’s a policy underneath all of them, and said that they’re challenging that policy,” said Logan Brown, an attorney for the department.

Davies testified that the agency targets “criminal aliens” and “terrorists.” While its agents may arrest other people, he and another ICE official said, those arrests are “collateral” and aren’t the type of case that ICE prioritizes.

But the accounts of the four plaintiffs — a college student, a grocer and two men who work in construction — as well as testimony from two immigration attorneys and the incident in Durango painted a much different picture of ICE’s practices than those described by the agency’s lawyers and supervisors.

One man said ICE arrested him while looking for someone else. The college student, Caroline Dias Goncalves, was arrested only by chance, after a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy pulled her over in a traffic stop and then alerted ICE. The other two men were arrested in large-scale raids in Aurora and Colorado Springs and were later released.

Judge expresses skepticism of ICE

Jackson, who declined to immediately issue an order Friday, said the plaintiffs’ arrests all appeared to have been unlawful, and he seemed inclined to agree that ICE was operating under a policy of mass arrests, regardless of the circumstances.

While Davies testified that his office had let two people go in recent days because they didn’t pose a flight risk, Jackson pointed to the Durango arrests and the Douglas County teacher’s detention. He also noted that Davies — a near-20-year veteran of the agency — didn’t appear to know the details of the policy, either.

“There’s a policy,” Jackson said of the ICE memo. “These guys just don’t follow it. They might not even know what it is. I think it’s at least reasonable that the policy they really follow is what supervisors tell them to do, and what supervisors are telling them is, ‘Go arrest people, as many as you can get.’ ”

He also questioned how Goncalves could’ve posed a flight risk or represented one of the “criminal aliens” that ICE purports to pursue. Goncalves, a University of Utah student, was arrested by ICE in June and then held in detention for nearly three weeks. The Brazilian came to the U.S. with her family when she was 7 and has a pending asylum application, the Salt Lake Tribune has reported.

She testified Thursday that she now lives at home, no longer has a driver’s license and is taking a significantly reduced course load because of the arrest.

The immigrants are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado and local attorneys. To the lawyers, the Durango detentions represented a clear example that ICE was neither making targeted arrests nor following its own purported policy of only detaining those who pose a flight risk.

The incident spurred demonstrations in the southwestern Colorado city earlier this week and clashes with federal authorities. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation announced Thursday that it would investigate an incident in which a federal agent threw a protester’s phone and pushed her to the ground outside the local ICE field office.

On Friday, attorney Carly Hamilton testified that she’d spoken to Jaramillo-Solano’s wife, who wasn’t in the car and wasn’t detained; she was referred to using her initials to protect her privacy. The family had been seeking asylum because the woman had been tortured in Colombia and her previous husband was assassinated, Hamilton said.

Jaramillo-Solano’s wife told Hamilton that ICE agents had “beaten” her husband and children and kept them in a “dungeon”-like room in Durango, where the adolescents — a boy and girl — had to share a urinal with their father.

The man and children have been transported to a family detention center in Dilley, Texas. The Denver Post located the father using ICE’s detainee locator, which does not provide information on minors. Davies testified that the family members were all transported to Texas.

The Douglas County teacher, who was arrested with her family, is also detained in the same facility, ICE’s database shows.

Jackson said he would decide soon whether to issue an injunction against ICE to restrict its arrest practices.",https://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/TDP-Z-durango-ice-protest-002.jpg?w=1024&h=738,N,,2025-11-01 09:57:17.870842

The judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November.
Along with ordering the federal government to use emergency reserves to backfill SNAP benefits, McConnell ruled that all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored.

___ Mulvihill reported from Haddonfield, New Jersey; and Kruesi from Providence, Rhode Island.","BOSTON (AP) — Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must continue to pay for SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using emergency reserve funds during the government shutdown.

The judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island gave the administration leeway on whether to fund the program partially or in full for November. That also brings uncertainty about how things will unfold and will delay payments for many beneficiaries whose cards would normally be recharged early in the month.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program starting Nov. 1 because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown. The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. It costs about $8 billion per month nationally.

U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat and the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said Friday’s rulings from judges nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama confirm what Democrats have been saying: “The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.”

Trump posted on social media Friday blasting congressional Democrats for the shutdown and suggesting the government would comply with the rulings but also that it needed more clarity first: “If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.”

Judges agree at least one fund must go toward SNAP

Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states and the District of Columbia challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.

The administration said it wasn’t allowed to use a contingency fund of about $5 billion for the program, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep SNAP running. The Democratic officials said not only could that money be used, but that it must be. They also said a separate fund with around $23 billion is available for the cause.

In Providence, Rhode Island, U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell ruled from the bench in a case filed by cities and nonprofits that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds. He asked for an update on progress by Monday.

Along with ordering the federal government to use emergency reserves to backfill SNAP benefits, McConnell ruled that all previous work requirement waivers must continue to be honored. The USDA during the shutdown has terminated existing waivers that exempted work requirements for older adults, veterans and others.

There were similar elements in the Boston case, where U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani ruled in a written opinion that the USDA has to pay for SNAP, calling the suspension “unlawful.” She ordered the federal government to advise the court by Monday as to whether they will use the emergency reserve funds to provide reduced SNAP benefits for November or fully fund the program “using both contingency funds and additional available funds.

“Defendants’ suspension of SNAP payments was based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments,” she wrote. “This court has now clarified that Defendants are required to use those Contingency Funds as necessary for the SNAP program.”

For many, benefits will still be delayed after the ruling

No matter how the rulings came down, the benefits for millions of people will be delayed in November because the process of loading cards can take a week or more in many states.

The administration did not immediately say whether it would appeal the rulings.

States, food banks and SNAP recipients have been bracing for an abrupt shift in how low-income people can get groceries. Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills.

Most states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the SNAP debit cards.

Across the U.S., advocates who had been sounding the alarm for weeks about the pending SNAP benefits cut off let out a small sigh of relief as the rulings came down Friday, while acknowledging the win is temporary and possibly not complete.

“Thousands of nonprofit food banks, pantries and other organizations across the country can avoid the impossible burden that would have resulted if SNAP benefits had been halted,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Council of Nonprofits, one of the plaintiffs in the Rhode Island case.

The possibility of reduced benefits also means uncertainty

Cynthia Kirkhart, CEO of Facing Hunger Food Bank in Huntington, West Virginia, said her organization and the pantries it serves in Kentucky, Ohio and West Virginia will keep their extra hours this weekend, knowing that the people whose benefits usually arrive at the start of the month won’t see them.

“What we know, unless the administration is magical, is nothing is going to happen tomorrow,” she said.

Kristle Johnson, a full-time nursing student and mother of three in Florida, is concerned about the possibility of reduced benefits.

Despite buying meat in bulk, careful meal planning and not buying junk food, she said, her $994 a month benefit doesn’t buy a full month’s groceries.

“Now I have to deal with someone who wants to get rid of everything I have to keep my family afloat until I can better myself,” Johnson said of Trump.

The ruling doesn’t resolve partisan tussles

At a Washington news conference earlier Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department runs SNAP, said the contingency funds in question would not cover the cost of the program for long. Speaking at a press conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol, she blamed Democrats for conducting a “disgusting dereliction of duty” by refusing to end their Senate filibuster as they hold out for an extension of health care funds.

A push this week to continue SNAP funding during the shutdown failed in Congress.

To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four’s net income after certain expenses can’t exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $31,000 per year. Last year, SNAP provided assistance to 41 million people, nearly two-thirds of whom were families with children.

“The court’s ruling protects millions of families, seniors, and veterans from being used as leverage in a political fight and upholds the principle that no one in America should go hungry,” Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, said of the Rhode Island decision.

California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017.","SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) — Illinois lawmakers have sent Gov. JB Pritzker legislation prohibiting federal authorities from making immigration arrests near courthouses, but even one of the measure's top sponsors questions whether it can survive a court challenge.

The proposal adopted early Friday also allows lawsuits when people believe their constitutional rights have been violated during civil immigration arrests.

The legislation imposes civil damages for false imprisonment when someone attending a court hearing or appearing as a party or witness to a legal proceeding is arrested. Proponents say courts must be accessible to everyone to pursue remedies to violations of their rights.

Democratic Senate President Don Harmon, a lead sponsor, acknowledged the measure will face a court challenge.

“It’s not just about the constitutionality of the law, which I think is sound, but it’s the reality that the courts are stacked against us,” Harmon said. “The federal government can try to remove it from state courts to federal courts. They can try to substitute the government itself for the individual defendants, but that’s not a reason not to try.”

Pritzker, a Democrat, supports the idea and will review the plan when it reaches his desk, spokesperson Matt Hill said.

Two weeks ago, the top judge in Cook County, home to Chicago, issued an order with the same prohibition. It's unclear whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has followed the dictum, but at the time, federal officials dismissed it, saying “there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.”

The Trump administration's immigration enforcement, which began two months ago in Chicago and its suburbs, is intended to round up migrants living in the country illegally, particularly those with criminal records. But witnesses have reported repeated incidents in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detain people regardless of citizenship or legal status.

“No one should have to choose between seeking justice and risking their freedom,” said co-sponsoring Sen. Celina Villanueva. “Courthouses must be places where people can resolve disputes, testify and support loved ones, not sites of fear or intimidation.""

The legislation, approved largely along party lines, also requires hospitals, day care centers and higher education institutions to create policies delineating how they would handle immigration agents inside their facilities.

Other states have taken similar action or otherwise adopted practices to protect immigrants. California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017. Guidance published by California Attorney General Rob Bonta says the state can't control federal immigration action, but “the state has a responsibility to provide safe and secure access to court facilities to all residents regardless of immigration status.”

In September, Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins issued a policy prohibiting warrantless arrests inside state courts, as well as banning the use in judicial buildings of face coverings, routinely worn by ICE officers.

“Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public, they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption,"" Mullins said.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2o3Oym59n1wtDiFfYDJfEA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/f7e6e951d6851f580f789f45d0cfd3d9,N,,2025-11-01 06:56:29.798229

That parking lot is city property; the Johnson administration has responded to the immigration raids there by installing signage and security to keep the feds out, but they aren’t working.","CHICAGO — Leo Feler’s message to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Friday began with him quoting the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

Standing at a downtown news conference with local elected leaders, the 45-year-old Lakeview resident then said masked federal agents violated that foundational language that sets warrant requirements and prohibits illegal searches by bursting into his property last week and leaving a bloody scene in his garage while trying to arrest construction workers who were installing windows on his building.

“I think many of you and many of the viewers who are watching this will have similar experiences as me,” Feler said. “Across the United States, these types of jobs are done disproportionately by Hispanic and Latino workers. So I have a question for all of you and for all of the viewers: Should the U.S. government be allowed to invade your property, to jump over a locked fence, to come on to your home?”

Feler, an economist, showed the Chicago Tribune security footage timestamped to Oct. 24 that featured what appeared to be federal agents, faces shielded with bandanas, running through a gangway and struggling to pull down a man who was straddling a fence mid-escape.

One worker was detained inside his garage, Feler said, adding that the agents did not appear to have a warrant at any point.

“I spent most of last weekend cleaning up blood at my property,” Feler said. “Every now and then, I’ll still be walking around and there will be a spot of blood I failed to clean up, and I will clean that up.”

Neighbors blowing whistles — as well as Feler yelling, “ICE, you are not allowed on my property. Get off my property. This is the United States. You are going into people’s homes” — dominated much of the audio in his security camera footage.

In one video, an agent hops over a fence and a voice off-camera then remarks, “You made me cut myself, and when I cut myself, I get mad.”

DHS spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

However, Feler also had gripes with local leadership in Chicago.

He said he attempted to file a police report on Monday accusing the federal agents of trespassing, breaking and entering, burglary, battery and assault and kidnapping. But after being rebuffed at his local Chicago Police Department precinct, and then filing a criminal damage to property report with CPD’s detective bureau, he got disappointing news.

“I later got a call from a sergeant saying they would not be able to continue with that police report because his higher-ups told him not to pursue it,” Feler said, before addressing the media gaggle directly. “So I am asking you to come with me to the police precinct after this press conference to help me get a police report filed.”

Chicago is bound by a sanctuary city ordinance that prohibits local police from cooperating with federal immigration officials. And as President Donald Trump’s unpopular deportation campaign in the nation’s third-largest city progresses, residents have grown increasingly emboldened to confront federal agents directly and try to physically block them from carrying out raids.

Mayor Brandon Johnson has nodded to that sentiment, signing a flurry of executive orders banning immigration agents from using city land or private property to carry out their deportation operations. He has even called for criminal charges against federal officers who violate his municipal decrees, and bristled at the notion that they were merely “symbolic.”

But the mayor has yet to offer specifics on how he thinks enforcement against such agents should work. At the time Johnson signed the orders, Chicago police Superintendent Larry Snelling said that cops will not and cannot arrest federal agents “because someone deems what they are doing is illegal.”

CPD spokespeople didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday about Feler’s complaint. His alderman, Bennett Lawson, walked out with him after the news conference and promised to contact police district leadership on his behalf.

Friday’s news conference at the Cook County Building was convened by U.S. Rep. Mike Quigley, a Chicago Democrat who called for DHS’s Office of the Inspector General to investigate abuses by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection during their operations in the Chicago area.

Quigley stopped short of saying federal agents should be prosecuted under a future Democratic president but noted that “documentation” was a good first step.

“ICE and CBP have blatantly violated the rights of Chicago and since they arrived in our city,” Quigley said. “They have racially profiled citizens.”

Another speaker the congressman brought up was Vanessa Aguirre-Avalos, the owner of the Luna y Cielo Play Cafe in Logan Square. She choked back tears as she laid out the lasting effects of the tear gas deployment from early this month outside her business as well as Funston Elementary School.

“My business has suffered deeply because our families are too afraid to go out. I am behind on rent, and may soon have to close my business, a space built to keep our culture and our language and our children’s joy alive,” Aguirre-Avalos said.

Aguirre-Avalos said one 3-year-old girl who has attended her day care since she was an infant clung tightly to her mother that afternoon and asked, “Mommy, what happened?”

“Now whenever she sees police lights, she freezes, reliving that trauma from Oct. 3,” Aguirre-Avalos said. “I’m deeply worried about the trauma this is causing our children.”

All the while, arrests by federal immigration officers mount — including at O’Hare International Airport, where a waiting area for rideshare drivers has been the grounds for more than 50 arrests. That parking lot is city property; the Johnson administration has responded to the immigration raids there by installing signage and security to keep the feds out, but they aren’t working.

Johnson, asked by the Tribune this week what he will do about immigration officers flouting his executive orders, said “we’ll have to look at every single tool to hold this administration accountable.”

Asked how soon, the mayor said: “Soon. As soon as possible.”

“President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections,” she said.
“The Court pauses to note a conspicuous absence from the legal and historical context thus far provided,” Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote.
Democrats and the voting rights groups hailed the decision as a major breakthrough.
“The court not only stopped the executive order on its own terms, but also delineated the constitutional parameters that bar the president from pursuing these false conspiracy theories in the electoral arena,” he said.","A federal judge in Washington permanently barred the Trump administration on Friday from requiring proof of citizenship on federal voter registration forms, a change dictated in an executive order President Trump signed in March.

The ruling definitively halted the effort to compel the Elections Assistance Commission, an independent body, to adopt nationwide changes to voting procedures at a time when the president has also called for requiring voter identification in elections and ending mail-in voting. For months, voting rights groups have warned that those changes, in tandem with the deployment of the national guard to the streets of Democratic-led cities, resembled steps of a voter-suppression strategy.

In a firm 81-page opinion, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia wrote that Mr. Trump’s order clearly violated the separation of powers, claiming authority over the voting process not afforded by the Constitution.

“Congress has never assigned any responsibility for the content of the federal form to the president or to any other individual in the executive branch with the power to act unilaterally,” she wrote. “The power to alter the federal form is — and always has been — delegated solely to a bipartisan, independent commission.”

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesman, said the government would appeal Judge Kollar-Kotelly’s latest ruling. “President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to ensure only American citizens are casting ballots in American elections,” she said.

The opinion also traced American history back to the country’s founding, repeatedly noting that besides the small role of the Elections Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress in 2002 to assist with elections, the Elections Clause of the Constitution grants authority over elections to the states.

“The Court pauses to note a conspicuous absence from the legal and historical context thus far provided,” Judge Kollar-Kotelly wrote. “The states have initial authority to regulate elections. Congress has supervisory authority over those regulations. The President does not feature at all.”

The decision settled the question raised in a trio of lawsuits brought by a broad coalition Democrats and voting rights groups including the League of United Latin American Voters and the League of Women Voters Education Fund.

Judge Kollar-Kotelly, who was appointed to her current post by President Bill Clinton, had previously sided with the groups that filed the suits, temporarily blocking the proof of citizenship provision in a decision in April. In a related case brought by a coalition of attorneys general from Democratic states, a judge in Massachusetts in June temporarily blocked the executive order more broadly, including a provision imposing on states for counting mail-in ballots.

Democrats and the voting rights groups hailed the decision as a major breakthrough.

Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, celebrated the ruling on X, calling the executive order an attempt at “disenfranchising Americans” and “voter suppression.”

Throughout his political career, Mr. Trump has repeatedly made claims about significant noncitizen voting, which have been repeatedly debunked. More recently, the president has also enlisted the Justice Department in an effort to build a national voter roll database over the objections of many states, seeking to substantiate the false claims.

Norm Eisen, the executive chair of the Democracy Defenders Fund, which helped represent one of the groups that sued, said the executive order “represented the intersection of two of President Trump’s obsessions” — bringing together false premises about noncitizens’ voting with more general alarmism about immigration.

“The court not only stopped the executive order on its own terms, but also delineated the constitutional parameters that bar the president from pursuing these false conspiracy theories in the electoral arena,” he said.

In other statements on Friday, leaders of the groups behind the suit said the requirement to prove citizenship would have likely fallen hardest on women, service members and the poor, among other groups that statistically tend not to have such proof readily available.

Around 21.3 million people do not have government-issued proof of citizenship on hand, according to a 2023 study by the Brennan Center for Justice, a voting rights and democracy group, and the University of Maryland.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/31/multimedia/31trump-news-voting-citizenship-proof-qtcp/31trump-news-voting-citizenship-proof-qtcp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 02:56:39.191792

The lawsuit describes one instance where a federal immigration officer allowed detainee Willian Giménez González to call his wife using his cellphone.
Dig deeper: The lawsuit was brought by two Illinois men who are originally from Mexico.
He was arrested by federal immigration officials on Oct. 30 in Wheeling, where he was working as a delivery driver.
Both men were detained at the Broadview ICE processing facility until Friday morning, when they were transferred to another out-of-state facility.","Disturbing allegations are surfacing about the conditions inside the Broadview ICE Processing Center.

The facility has served as the Department of Homeland Security’s main hub during ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

What we know:

A class action lawsuit now claims federal agents are treating men and women detained at the facility like ""animals"" — describing the site as a ""black box"" and alleging that immigrants taken there are being stripped of their right to an attorney.

""It's supposed to be a holding facility, where people are housed for about 12 hours and they go somewhere else, but that's not how it's being used and that's the core of the problem,"" said Samuel Cole, chief immigration litigation counsel for the ACLU of Illinois. ""It's being used as a detention facility to keep people day after day after day.""

The 76-page lawsuit names DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino, and others as defendants. It shines a spotlight on allegations of ""degrading"" and ""inhumane"" treatment.

""There's not enough food given to the people who are detained there, there's not enough water given to the people who are detained there, there is very little medical care, no mental healthcare. There are no beds to sleep in, no pillows — people are using toilet paper as pillows,"" Cole said.

The lawsuit also claims detainees are watched when using the restroom — something that's ""especially distressing for the women"" as most of the federal agents there are men, the lawsuit stated.

Cole said there are very few photos of the described conditions because the detainees allegedly have limited or no access to their cellphones. He added that those being held have also been stripped of a key constitutional right.

""Absolutely no access to attorneys, and that's outrageous. Because they are being told, and asked, and cajoled to sign immigration forms that waive their rights to appear in immigration court before an immigration judge and return to their country, and they're being asked to sign forms in English, and many of them don't speak English,"" Cole said.

The lawsuit describes one instance where a federal immigration officer allowed detainee Willian Giménez González to call his wife using his cellphone. His wife was with an immigration attorney at the time, and ""when the officer heard [the lawyer's] voice and learned that he was an attorney, the officer told Giménez González to end the call. The officer then reached for the phone and hung up the call himself.""

Dig deeper:

The lawsuit was brought by two Illinois men who are originally from Mexico. Pablo Moreno Gonzalez has lived in the U.S. for about 32 years, according to court documents. He is married with four children.

Attorneys say he was taken by federal agents on Oct. 29 near West Foster Avenue and North Pulaski Road in Chicago.

Felipe Agustin Zamacona is also a lead plaintiff in the case. He was arrested by federal immigration officials on Oct. 30 in Wheeling, where he was working as a delivery driver.

Both men were detained at the Broadview ICE processing facility until Friday morning, when they were transferred to another out-of-state facility.

During a scheduling conference with Judge Robert W. Gettleman on Friday afternoon, their attorneys — from the ACLU of Illinois and the MacArthur Justice Center — demanded the men be returned to Illinois.

On the same call, a U.S. attorney said he has not been able to reach his clients, and it has not yet been determined who in the Department of Justice will be assigned to handle the case. For that reason, he asked the judge if they could postpone the hearing until next week.

Judge Gettleman said he was ""not happy"" to have to wait, but in fairness to both parties, he agreed.

In a brief statement on Friday, Senator Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman of the panel, and Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat, made public two letters that they jointly sent to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth over the past several weeks requesting the information.

“To date, these documents have not been submitted,” Mr. Wicker and Mr. Reed wrote.

The senators’ decision to publicize their requests and Mr. Hegseth’s failure to meet them reflected growing bipartisan alarm on Capitol Hill about President Trump’s expanding and open-ended military campaign, undertaken without consultation with or approval by Congress. It also reflected deepening frustration with the administration’s lack of transparency about an operation whose legal justification is in question.

The senators shared two separate requests made to the Pentagon. In one letter, in late September, they asked for a copy of the president’s orders to carry out the military strikes. By law, that letter noted, the Pentagon is required to provide Congress with copies of “execute orders” within 15 days of the president’s issuing of them, a deadline the senators said the Trump administration had missed.

In a second letter, in early October, they again sought the execute orders, as well as the Justice Department’s legal justification for the attacks and a “complete list” of designated terrorist organizations and drug trafficking organizations “with whom the president has determined the United States is in a noninternational armed conflict and against whom lethal military force may be used.” Top House Democrats sent a similar request earlier this month for the list of targets but have not received any information from the White House.

Representative Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said on Friday that House Republicans were also concerned about the lack of transparency around the legal justification for the strikes, even if they were not saying so broadly or publicly.

The immigration activity on Friday impacted more than just schools.","A U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent was caught on video Friday repeatedly striking a man in the head after having pinned the man down during an arrest in Evanston, Illinois.

Witnesses posted video of agents holding a man down on Friday near the intersection of Oakton and Asbury in Evanston, about a block away from Chute Middle School.

Video recorded by witness Kerry Littel shows an agent pinning the man down on the street, and repeatedly hitting him in the head as the man and witnesses tell agents he can't breathe.

In the video, witnesses can be heard asking, ""Why did you do that?""

U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials said agents ""were being aggressively tailgated by a red vehicle,"" which crashed into the agents' SUV as they made a U-turn.

""A hostile crowd surrounded agents and their vehicle, and began verbally abusing them and spitting on them. As Border patrol arrested one individual, who actively resisted arrest, pepper spray was deployed spray to deter the agitator and disperse the crowd,"" a spokesperson said in a statement.

Three citizens were arrested during that incident. It was not immediately clear if the man seen being punched in the video was involved in the crash that sparked the incident.

Meantime, DHS said five immigrants from Mexico were arrested on Friday in Evanston and neighboring Skokie. All five were in the U.S. illegally, and had criminal histories, including trespassing charges and multiple illegal entries into the U.S.

The flurry of immigration enforcement activity in Chicago's northern suburbs on Halloween left neighbors angry about the presence of federal agents.

Not far from the incident near Chute Middle School, Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino was spotted at the Home Depot.

The sighting of federal agents, including Bovino, was not what people living in Evanston and the North Side of Chicago wanted to see.

Federal immigration activity so close to schools had community members asking, ""where is the humanity?"" when and if children witness such aggressive arrests.

""Our children are terrified, and our families are terrified, and some are not sending their kids to school. They're missing school. They're missing their education. It's not okay. This is not okay,"" said Allie Harned, of Evanston.

Demian Kogan, director of organizing for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said ""What happened today was disgusting.""

""It was morally reprehensible, and the only thing that's more disgusting about what happened today is that it is not an isolated incident. What happened today is our daily reality in Illinois,"" he said.

Meantime, a woman was taken into custody after she dropped off a student believed to be her child at Volta Elementary School in Chicago's Albany Park neighborhood, officials there confirmed. CBS News Chicago was told the child was able to get into the school safely.

Schools in Evanston and neighboring Skokie took precautions to protect students from immigration operations on Friday.

Evanston Township High School was placed under a ""closed campus protocol,"" meaning students were required to remain on campus during lunch and free blocks.

""There is currently no threat to our school community, and federal authorities are not present on school grounds,"" ETHS officials said in an alert to the school community. ""While we currently have no indication that federal activity will occur on our campus, we are implementing this proactive measure to help ensure the safety and well-being of all students.""

A Cook County commissioner said some Skokie schools were also taking steps to lock down buildings.

Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss confirmed immigration enforcement activity was reported multiple times in Evanston on Friday.

""Our message for ICE is simple, get the hell out of Evanston."" Biss said. ""Enough is enough, and so I would say to every Evanston resident: sign up, get trained, join a rapid response team, be a part of the effort to keep our neighbors safe.""

The immigration activity on Friday impacted more than just schools.

Friday afternoon, Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias said all road exams at the DMV facility at the Levy Senior Center were temporarily suspended for the rest of the day, because ICE activity had blocked designated testing routes ""making it unsafe and inaccessible for staff and customers.""",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/01/a964fbc6-5030-4bc8-ab51-2704913da8b9/thumbnail/1200x630/66cc662f2f42991664200fc0ef26bb12/screenshot-2025-10-31-213002.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 02:56:47.026419

Human Rights Council.
It abruptly terminated nearly all U.S. foreign aid, which had supported human rights defenders and provided lifesaving humanitarian assistance around the world.
Cuts to grants by the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and offices on refugees, women and global justice further downgraded America’s commitment to human rights.

This work is part of a broad global movement advancing justice for victims and survivors of the human rights abuses.","When the world emerged from the horrors of World War II and vowed “never again,” nations laid the foundation for the system of international justice that now exists to address the planet’s worst crimes. Today, the United States is actively trying to dismantle it.

The Trump administration on Sept. 4 imposed sanctions on three leading Palestinian human rights organizations: Al Haq, founded in 1979 and a pioneer in documenting violations in occupied Gaza and the West Bank; Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, which for more than two decades has meticulously chronicled laws of war violations in Gaza; and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, which has long provided legal aid to victims, particularly from Gaza.

In June, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on another leading Palestinian rights group, Addameer, under a different set of measures.

This is part of a broader Trump administration effort aimed at those who support justice for Palestinians. The stated reason for the September sanctions was that the three groups had helped the International Criminal Court in its investigation of Israel “without Israel’s consent.” But the U.S. government has also gone after officials of the court, which has taken on an investigation that covers allegations of grave crimes by Israeli forces in Gaza; it has issued arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and former defense minister Yoav Gallant, accusing them of crimes against humanity and war crimes. The administration has placed sanctions on the I.C.C. prosecutor, deputy prosecutors and six of the court’s judges, as well as Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Gaza and the West Bank.

Beyond what has been done to the Palestinians, the Trump administration has undermined the rule of law, protection of human rights and international justice, which all lie at the heart of a rules-based global order. The administration has slashed funding to the United Nations and threatened more cuts while disengaging from the U.N. Human Rights Council. It abruptly terminated nearly all U.S. foreign aid, which had supported human rights defenders and provided lifesaving humanitarian assistance around the world. Cuts to grants by the State Department’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor and offices on refugees, women and global justice further downgraded America’s commitment to human rights.

Al Haq, Al Mezan and the Palestinian Center are award-winning organizations that in extraordinarily difficult circumstances have exposed violations of human rights and environmental law by Israeli and Palestinian authorities, armed groups and businesses. They are the voice of Palestinian victims, amplifying stories of injustice that would otherwise remain unheard.

The groups have continued their courageous work in Gaza over nearly two years. Al Mezan and the Palestinian Center are based in Gaza, and Al Haq, based in Ramallah in the West Bank, has staff there as well. They have faced bombardment that has resulted in the killings or wounding of staff members and hundreds of their relatives as well as starvation and forced displacement. On Sept. 7, Israeli bombings flattened the high-rise building that housed the Palestinian Center’s headquarters. The offices of Al Mezan across Gaza were damaged and destroyed in 2024.

The U.S. sanctions will not only disrupt the critical work that they are still able to do but also send a chilling signal to human rights defenders whose work implicates powerful actors or their allies. The Palestinian groups have been vocal in their support of the I.C.C.’s investigation into Israeli conduct and have made submissions to the court’s prosecutor.

Our organizations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have worked closely with these groups for decades and, consistent with our longstanding and independent mandates to speak out in protecting human rights, we can attest that their work is indispensable to the human rights community not only in the region but internationally.

This work is part of a broad global movement advancing justice for victims and survivors of the human rights abuses. A credible system of international justice that addresses genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity is an essential element of building respect for human rights.

The International Criminal Court is a central pillar of this system. Created through a treaty in 1998, the court is a forum of last resort. Governments intended to deliver on the post-World War II promise of “never again” by establishing such a permanent institution. The system is not perfect, but its capacity to seek to hold accountable even those in the highest positions of power can help end cycles of abuses. This power of the law is now at risk.

Further sanctions or other actions by the United States, including extending sanctions to the court as a whole, would jeopardize the rights of victims across the globe. Governments should rise to the occasion to protect the system they created.

When Israel designated leading Palestinian human rights groups including Addameer and Al Haq as “terrorist organizations” in 2021, nine European Union member states rejected the allegations as unsubstantiated. That pushback was likely a major reason Israel did not go further.

So far, other governments have carefully balanced their reactions to the U.S. sanctions for fear of provoking the Trump administration. This is a flawed strategy and out of step with the urgency the situation demands.

Governments need to condemn efforts to undermine the I.C.C.’s independence and to silence those who are documenting abuses. They should use regional and national laws, like the European Union Blocking Statute, which can be employed to nullify external laws in the union, to mitigate the impact of U.S. sanctions on those working with the court. Those who helped establish the international court and claim to uphold the values underpinning it must step up to defend them.

He still believe in the system of the United States and policies of the immigration.","William Brangham:

The Trump administration's immigration agenda has included efforts to cut back on both illegal and legal pathways into the country.

Yesterday, the president set the lowest ever cap on refugee entries, 7,500 per year. And at the same time, more than 2.2 million migrants are awaiting asylum hearings here in the United States.

Amna Nawaz sat down with the family member of one asylum seeker caught up in these immigration restrictions.

Amna Nawaz:

Officials carrying out President Trump's immigration crackdown have detained and deported thousands of undocumented people with criminal records. But many with no criminal history who were following legal pathways to remain are also being detained.

One of them is 31-year-old Ali Sajad Faqirzada from Afghanistan, who crossed the U.S. southern border in 2022 without authorization to make an asylum claim, which he and his family did, turning themselves into Border Patrol. As their asylum cases moved through the courts, Ali went to a routine immigration check-in earlier this month and was detained by ICE.

For more on his case, we're joined now by his sister, Saida Faqirzada, and their family lawyer Anwen Hughes.

Welcome to you both, and thank you for joining us.

And, Saida, I will just begin with you, because you and other members of your family have been through this asylum process. What did you expect to happen the day that Ali went in for this routine check-in?

Saida Faqirzada, Sister of Detained Asylum Seeker: We were expecting the process to be the same as the rest of the family member who already seek their asylum for him as well to be a smooth process.

And, actually, it was. So he went in for his interview and he actually answered all the questions that he was asked. And he was texting me and said: ""Yes, Saida, I passed the interview and I'm so happy.""

Then he also, like, immediately texted me saying that: ""They are taking me.""

Amna Nawaz:

And was that the last time you heard from him?

Saida Faqirzada:

Yes, when they detain him, yes.

Amna Nawaz:

So, Anwen, let me turn to you here because I do want to put to you what the Department of Homeland Security said in response to our request for more information about the case.

They sent us a statement confirming that Ali did enter the U.S. in February of 2022, and they also said, back, then he ""was arrested by Border Patrol, released by the Biden administration into the country. This poses serious national security risk for the United States and his citizens.""

Anwen, what is your understanding of their statement there, why they believe he's a national security risk or why he was detained?

Anwen Hughes, Attorney For Detained Asylum Seeker:

Well, it's unclear to me from that statement whether the — what DHS is saying is that Ali poses a national security risk or that simply they disagree with the Biden administration's approach to arriving asylum seekers.

With respect to Ali himself, obviously, he doesn't pose a threat to the United States. If we did, we would know by now. He's been here for 3.5 years. Ali as an asylum seeker is not responsible for these differences in policies, any more than he was responsible for the U.S. decision to withdraw from Afghanistan.

He has been trying to cope with these various policy changes and abide by the instructions that he was given. And so — and, as a result, he's now been detained.

Amna Nawaz:

Anwen, do you know why he was detained? Have you been given a reason by the government?

Anwen Hughes:

The government's general explanation as to why it has been detaining most people is that they — essentially, that they lack lasting immigration status in the United States. I haven't seen any articulation of any person-specific reason for them to do that.

Amna Nawaz:

Saida, let me back it up here so people can sort of understand how we arrived at this point, because, after the Taliban reclaimed power in 2021 in Afghanistan, we increasingly saw people from Afghanistan making their way to the United States through South America, Central America, arriving at the U.S. southern border.

Tell me why you and your family left and what that journey was like.

Saida Faqirzada:

So, my family, due to the reasons that they had at that time or we still have, that we believe in human rights and woman rights and democracy and freedom, my family couldn't stay and live under Taliban control and to live in Afghanistan.

So they left the country, and they arrived to the United States hoping that they will rebuild the life that they really wanted from the day first. And they really worked on it. Specifically, Sajad was also working towards that and follow the laws of this country, and gave it back to the community that gave us safety and hope in the United States.

Amna Nawaz:

Was it a general sense of not being able to stay in Afghanistan? Had you been specifically targeted in any way?

Saida Faqirzada:

Due to our ethnicity and minorities that we are coming from, we are one of those minorities in Afghanistan, and also due to our activities, my mom's job with the government and my job with the government and also Ali's job with the government.

And we faced discrimination. We faced life-threatening messages, phone calls. We received all these phone calls and messages. It was not only opposing to me. It was always opposing to the whole family, mentioning their names, mentioning our names.

So this was difficult for us to remain in Afghanistan and live our — the rest of our life there.

Amna Nawaz:

Saida, people will also wonder, was there another way that Ali could have entered the United States? Could he have presented at a legal port of entry, for example, to make an asylum claim?

Saida Faqirzada:

As far as my family concern is, or Ali's, I can clearly say, Amna, when you are running away from something, when you are in search of safety and you are just looking for something — so let me just give you an example.

If our kid is really, like, seriously injured, are we going to the doctor's appointment and calling the secretary to book an appointment with a specific doctor regarding that situation, or we just run to the emergency?

For asylum seekers, I can compare that with that situation as well, specifically for Afghans who were running away from something and to save their life. So they had to run and they had to seek asylum.

Amna Nawaz:

Anwen, let me bring you in here, because there's obviously been a number of reports of other people from Afghanistan in not dissimilar circumstances who have been deported to a number of other countries, to Panama and to Costa Rica and to the United Arab Emirates. What happens now in Ali's case?

Anwen Hughes:

His lawyers have made a request for parole to the ICE field office responsible for his case. And this is basically asking ICE to release him while his case goes on.

Given that he has passed this credible fear interview, what happens from here is going to be the same procedurally, regardless of whether or not he's released, which is to say that he's going to have a series of hearings in front of the immigration court and an immigration judge is then going to make a decision on his asylum claim.

After suffering already the upheaval of forced migration from Afghanistan to the United States and now the additional trauma of detention, we very much hope that he can be released, so that his case can move forward before the immigration court.

Amna Nawaz:

Since he was taken into detention into custody, have you been able to speak with him? Do you know anything about where he's being held or how he's doing?

Saida Faqirzada:

Yes. Yes. We are in contact with him. He can call us and we can also visit him.

Amna Nawaz:

And what can you tell us about how he's doing? What has he shared with you?

Saida Faqirzada:

He's still hopeful. He still believe in the system of the United States and policies of the immigration. And, also, he still believe, our family still believe in justice. And we are hopeful.

Amna Nawaz:

“This is not crowd control but a campaign of intimidation and a clear message that dissent will be punished,” the report says.
The federal crackdown in Chicago comes just months after the Trump administration deployed the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles during demonstrations against ICE raids in June.
Like in Chicago, HRW accused federal agents in Los Angeles of “brutal, excessive, and unnecessary force.” In Chicago, agents from the Department of Homeland Security “repeatedly used excessive force against small groups of protesters who appeared to pose no threat to the agents or to public security, and against clearly identifiable journalists, legal observers, and volunteer street medics,” the new report explains.
“The federal government is not just violating the human rights of protestors here,” said Belkis Wille, HRW’s associate crisis and conflict director.","The global watchdog Human Rights Watch (HRW) has published a new report that details reportedly widespread and alarming abuses that have marked the federal law enforcement deployment in Chicago, Illinois, since mid-September.

“There is no rhyme or reason to the violence agents are resorting to.” – Raven Geary

Drawing on interviews with 18 people and analysis of video footage, the report details federal agents’ “firing of projects” and their use of “chemical irritants” during the demonstrations.

On Sept. 26, for instance, journalist Raven Geary was struck in the face by a pepper-spray projectile outside the detention facility. “I have never seen anything like this response in my life,” she told HRW. “There is no rhyme or reason to the violence agents are resorting to.”

Agents also fired pepper balls at a protester named Ashley Vaughn, who relies on the use of a cane, on Sept. 12, an incident the demonstrator said caused them to black out. A week later, in an incident that gained national media attention, a federal agent fired a pepper ball that hit Reverend David Black in the skull while he was conducting a prayer outside the ICE facility.

For its part, DHS has defended its agents’ conduct during the protests. In a Sept. 19 statement, DHS claimed that “rioters assaulted law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property,” though demonstrators who spoke with HRW denied those allegations.

In response to the crackdown, media groups, reporters, and demonstrators have filed a class action lawsuit “against President Donald Trump and senior officials from DHS, ICE, Customs and Border Protection, the Department of Justice, and other federal agencies, citing the use of excessive force, suppression of free speech and religious expression, and unlawful arrests.”

HRW has called on congressional DHS oversight committees to host public hearings in order to investigate federal agents’ conduct in Chicago. The watchdog also pointed to the need for stronger legislation to protect against federal abuses and increased accountability for immigration authorities.

“The federal government is not just violating the human rights of protestors here,” said Belkis Wille, HRW’s associate crisis and conflict director. “These violent abuses are part of a broader assault on US democratic norms and institutions.”",https://inkstickmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/Anti-ICE_protest_at_Broadview_10_11_2025_20251011_4219_54849799818-1920x1280.jpg,N,,2025-11-01 07:17:04.448807

The measure also allows lawsuits when people believe their constitutional rights were violated during civil immigration arrests.

The legislation, approved largely along party lines, was sent to Democrat Gov. JB Pritzker's desk. His office said he supports the idea and will review the proposal when it reaches his desk.

According to the bill, civil damages for false imprisonment could be imposed when a migrant attending a court hearing or appearing as a party or witness to a legal proceeding is arrested.

BLUE CITY JUDGE CITES 'FEAR OR OBSTRUCTION' IN BLOCKING ICE COURTHOUSE ARRESTS DURING COURT PROCEEDINGS

Supporters of the bill say courts must be accessible to everyone to seek resolutions to violations of their rights, but even one of the measure's top sponsors acknowledges it will face an uphill battle in court.

""It’s not just about the constitutionality of the law, which I think is sound, but it’s the reality that the courts are stacked against us,"" Democrat Senate President Don Harmon said. ""The federal government can try to remove it from state courts to federal courts. They can try to substitute the government itself for the individual defendants, but that’s not a reason not to try.""

Earlier this month, a judge in Cook County, which includes Chicago, issued an order blocking immigration arrests at county courthouses, citing concerns about ""fear or obstruction"" while migrants attend court proceedings. The order prohibits immigration authorities from making civil arrests of any ""party, witness, or potential witness"" during court appearances.

The federal government, however, contended that ""there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.""

The Trump administration's immigration agenda aims to detain suspected illegal migrants as part of the president's mass deportation policies. But witnesses have reported numerous incidents of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detaining people regardless of citizenship or legal status.

""No one should have to choose between seeking justice and risking their freedom,"" said Democrat state Sen. Celina Villanueva, who is co-sponsoring the bill. ""Courthouses must be places where people can resolve disputes, testify and support loved ones, not sites of fear or intimidation.""

The measure also requires hospitals, day care centers and higher education institutions to create policies detailing how they would handle immigration agents inside their facilities.

Earlier this year, the federal government reversed a Biden administration policy prohibiting immigration arrests in sensitive locations such as hospitals, schools and churches.

Other states have made similar efforts to protect migrants against federal raids.

FEDERAL JUDGE LIMITS ICE ARRESTS WITHOUT WARRANT, PROBABLE CAUSE

California has restricted immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state cannot control federal immigration action, but ""the state has a responsibility to provide safe and secure access to court facilities to all residents regardless of immigration status.""

In Connecticut, state Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins issued a policy in September banning warrantless arrests inside state courts, and prohibited the use of face coverings, often worn by ICE officers to shield their identities, in judicial buildings.

But to hardliners in the Trump administration bent on carrying out mass deportation, ICE has actually been something of a disappointment.

So they’re increasingly turning to another agency that they view as willing to go faster and harder: the Border Patrol.

Border Patrol agents have already played a major role in the administration’s highly visible and controversial operations in cities like Los Angeles and Chicago over the summer and fall, patrolling residential areas in militarized fashion, and using tactics like tear gas. “A majority of the viral videos you see online are Border Patrol agents,” rather than ICE agents, Fox News reporter Bill Melugin posted on X.

Administration hardliners evidently like what they’ve seen. In a late October “purge,” several leaders of ICE field offices were removed from their posts, with some to be replaced by Border Patrol officials instead.

Some ICE officials, and others sympathetic to their perspective, aren’t thrilled about this, and their anonymously-sourced grievances have spilled out in the press. “Since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,” one official complained to Fox News. Another said that “ICE is arresting criminal aliens,” while Border Patrol is “hitting Home Depots and car washes.”

Rise of the cowboys

Behind the tension is a fundamental difference in the two agencies’ approaches — one that has major implications for what will unfold in cities going forward.

The typical ICE approach is to have some idea of who is being targeted in advance of an enforcement operation — say, particular names, or a workplace. They get specific information that someone is in the country illegally, or that a workplace is employing people illegally, and then they try to make arrests.

By contrast, the approach of the Border Patrol — stemming from their work at the border — is more akin to going in and trying to impose order on a hostile area. It often involves spotting and questioning people they deem suspicious, or people they inevitably have little information about. (The term “cowboy” frequently comes up when Border Patrol is discussed.)

What we’ve seen in Los Angeles and Chicago in recent months is the Trump administration increasingly using these Border Patrol tactics in American cities. Rather than acting on specific information about targets in advance, they just go to places where they think unauthorized immigrants are and question people they deem suspicious.

This is being done because White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and other hardliners think the typical ICE approach of figuring out who you’re targeting in advance takes too long and isn’t producing enough arrests. They want their crackdown, and they want it now. And the apparent effort to bring a Border Patrol mindset to ICE means we should expect many more scenes of chaos and aggression on city streets going forward.

The internal Trump administration tensions that have led to the Border Patrol’s empowerment

Miller wants to make mass deportation happen, and he’s obsessed with the numbers. He said on Fox News in May that “we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day,” which would mean over 1 million arrests a year.

DOJ lawyers have since claimed in court that this quota is not official administration policy, but the stories of Miller berating officials to make ever more arrests are legion.

One such grilling occurred in May, when Miller summoned ICE officials to Washington and posed them a question that would prove extremely consequential.

Why, he asked, aren’t you at Home Depot?

Miller was voicing frustration with the ICE approach of first, identifying people or businesses to target, and then going to arrest them. That took too long and wasn’t achieving the numbers he wanted. He wanted them, instead, to basically go to where unauthorized immigrants work, live, or congregate — and just go try to grab people.

There’s a tension between this approach and the desire expressed by Trump and others to prioritize deporting the “worst of the worst” — unauthorized immigrants who have committed crimes. Investigating, identifying, and apprehending dangerous criminals takes time. Grabbing brown-skinned Spanish-speaking people off the street, by contrast, is a quicker way to get arrest numbers up, even if it looks a lot like racial profiling.

Miller’s new priorities have been carried out by ICE and Border Patrol, as well as personnel from other agencies who have been reassigned to work on immigration enforcement.

But Border Patrol took to them with a particular flair, especially in the Los Angeles and Chicago operations overseen by Gregory Bovino. In dealing with protesters and carrying out operations, Bovino embraced tools like tear gas — including, in at least one recent case, throwing a tear gas canister personally. His militarized exploits have been heavily featured in the administration’s social media propaganda videos, often set to peppy music, that the online MAGA base eats up.

In early October, Bovino’s teams conducted what may be the most shocking and controversial operation yet: a nighttime raid of an apartment building in Chicago’s South Shore, in which what seemed to be everyone in the building — including US citizens — was detained for hours. (They have claimed they had information that members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua used the building.)

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and her top adviser Corey Lewandowski have reportedly become enamored of the Bovino and Border Patrol approach. At the same time, they’ve soured on White House Border Czar Tom Homan, who is more aligned with ICE’s way of thinking. Homan has faced criticism after an August report that he accepted $50,000 in cash in a Cava bag last year, but according to New York magazine, Noem’s relationship with him had already deteriorated because she thought he was going on TV more than her.

Meanwhile, Border Patrol was making arrest after arrest — by October, it had made more arrests during the Chicago operation than ICE had, per CBS News. All this appears to have convinced administration higher-ups that ICE needs more of what Border Patrol has. So we should expect more and more scenes of tense, militarized confrontations in American cities going forward.

Can the Border Patrol approach make mass deportation happen?

Yet whether all this will meaningfully increase deportations is a different question.

Mass deportation is an immense logistical challenge with three main stages. At each stage, there are resource constraints, practical difficulties, and legal roadblocks that the Trump administration is trying to surmount.

The first stage is arresting unauthorized immigrants. The administration has been expanding the number of personnel who can make arrests (through hiring new people and reassigning people from other agencies), while trying to get existing personnel to arrest more (including with these Border Patrol operations in cities).

The second stage is detention — the arrested people must be held somewhere. But detention capacity is limited, so conditions have been overcrowded, and some arrested people have been released out of necessity. (The GOP’s “big, beautiful bill” devoted billions to expanding detention capacity, but implementation has not been so easy, The Atlantic’s Nick Miroff reports.)

The final stage is deportation, and getting there often requires approval from backlogged immigration courts, as well as diplomatic consent from another country to accept the deportee — oh, and you need a plane too.

This is the most challenging bottleneck to surmount, but the administration has been trying to do it in various ways, including by circumventing the court system in some cases, or by threatening people that if they don’t agree to be deported, they’ll be sent to some country where they’ve never been.

Border Patrol’s tactics can arrest more people, but by themselves, they won’t necessarily speed up deportations. Then again, they might have at least some impact — by sending the message that the US has become an ugly, unwelcoming, and dangerous place to immigrants, and therefore scaring people enough to leave.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-2243386663.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.746068936881%2C100%2C78.507862126237&w=1200,N,,2025-10-31 22:20:52.510737

Little progress on shutdown Trump’s demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to become the longest in history.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Back from a week abroad, President Donald Trump threw himself into the shutdown debate, calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster and reopen the government, an idea swiftly rejected Friday by Republican leaders who have long opposed such a move.

Trump pushed his Republican Party to get rid of the Senate rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. In the chamber that’s currently split, 53-47, Democrats have had enough votes to keep the government closed while they demand an extension of health care subsidies. Neither party has seriously wanted to nuke the rule.

“THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER,” Trump said in a late night social media post Thursday.

Trump’s sudden decision to assert himself into the shutdown now in its 31st day — with his highly charged demand to end the filibuster — is certain to set the Senate on edge. It could spur senators toward their own compromise or send the chamber spiraling toward a new sense of crisis. Or, it might be ignored.

Republican leaders responded quickly, and unequivocally, setting themselves at odds with Trump, a president few have dared to publicly counter.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules to end the shutdown, arguing that it is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.

The leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.

A spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged. And former GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who firmly opposed Trump’s filibuster pleas in his first term, remains in the Senate.

House Speaker Mike Johnson also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call,” from his chamber across the Capitol.

“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.”

Broad GOP support for filibuster

Even if Thune wanted to change the filibuster, he would not currently have the votes to do so in the divided Senate.

“The filibuster forces us to find common ground in the Senate,” Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah posted on X Friday morning, responding to Trump’s comments and echoing the sentiments of many of his Senate Republican colleagues. “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it.”

Debate has swirled around the legislative filibuster for years. Many Democrats pushed to eliminate it when they had full power in Washington, as the Republicans do now, four years ago. But ultimately, enough Democratic senators opposed the move, predicting such an action would come back to haunt them.

Little progress on shutdown

Trump’s demand comes as he has declined to engage with Democratic leaders on ways to end the shutdown, on track to become the longest in history.

He said in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to his choice on his flight home from Asia and that one question that kept coming up during his trip was why “powerful Republicans allow” the Democrats to shut down parts of the government.

But later Friday, he did not mention the filibuster again as he spoke to reporters departing Washington and arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago home.

While quiet talks are underway, particularly among bipartisan senators, Trump has not been seriously involved. Democrats refuse to vote to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate an extension to the health care subsidies. The Republicans say they won’t negotiate until the government is reopened.

House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said on CNN that Trump needs to start negotiating with Democrats, arguing the president has spent more time with global leaders than dealing with the shutdown back home.

From coast to coast, fallout from the dysfunction of the shuttered federal government is hitting home. SNAP food aid is scheduled to shut off. Flights are being delayed. Workers are going without paychecks.

And Americans are getting a first glimpse of the skyrocketing health care insurance costs that are at the center of the stalemate.

“People are stressing,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, as food options in her state grow scarce.

“We are well past time to have this behind us.”

Money for military, but not food aid

The White House has moved money around to ensure the military is paid, but refuses to tap funds for food aid. In fact, Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” signed into law this summer, delivered the most substantial cut ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, projected to result in some 2.4 million people off the program.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Friday the agency cannot release contingency funds to keep SNAP running, but two judges ruled nearly simultaneously Friday that the administration must continue to fund the food aid program. How quickly that might happen remains to be seen, as further consultation with the courts is expected on Monday.

Trump, in a social media post, said administration lawyers will be asking the courts “to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible.”

“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding,” Trump said.

“We are holding food over the heads of poor people so that we can take away their health care,” said Rev. Ryan Stoess during a prayer with religious leaders earlier this week at the U.S. Capitol.

“God help us,” he said, “when the cruelty is the point.”

Deadlines shift to next week

The House remains closed under Johnson with no plans to resume the session, and senators left for the weekend and are due back Monday.

The next inflection point comes after Tuesday’s off-year elections — the New York City mayor’s race, as well as elections in Virginia and New Jersey that will determine those states’ governors. Many expect that once those winners and losers are declared, and the Democrats and Republicans assess their political standing with the voters, they might be ready to hunker down for a deal.

If the shutdown continues into next week, it could surpass the 35-day lapse that ended in 2019, during Trump’s first term, over his demands to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall.

The rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.

It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.

New York Attorney General Letitia James seeks to block Trump administration’s subpoenas

The challenge comes as James pushes back against the administration’s investigation of cases she brought against the president and the National Rifle Association, according to court documents unsealed Friday.

James filed a motion in August to block subpoenas issued by acting U.S. Attorney John Sarcone for records related to the legal actions, claiming the Justice Department’s probe of the cases was retaliatory.

She also argued that Sarcone was improperly appointed and therefore lacked legitimate authority to authorize the subpoenas.

Dozens of court documents in the case have been filed under seal since August. Late Friday a federal judge in Manhattan granted James’ motion to unseal most of them, over the objection of the Justice Department.

Judge Lorna Schofield, however, has not yet ruled on the motion to quash the subpoenas.

An email seeking comment was sent to Sarcone’s office. A phone message was not immediately returned late Friday.

SNAP has provided grocery help for 60-plus years. Here’s how it works

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is a major piece of the social safety net used by nearly 42 million, or about 1 in 8 Americans, to help buy groceries.

Originally known as the food stamp program, it has existed since 1964, serving low-income people, many of whom have jobs but don’t make enough to cover all basic costs.

There are income limits based on family size, expenses and whether households include someone who is elderly or has a disability.

Most participants are families with children, and more than 1 in 3 include older adults or someone with a disability.

Nearly 2 in 5 recipients are households where someone is employed.

Most participants have incomes below the poverty line, about $32,000 for a family of four, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The Agriculture Department, which administers SNAP, says nearly 16 million children received benefits in 2023.

Air traffic controller shortages lead to broader US flight delays as shutdown nears 1-month mark

The Federal Aviation Administration reported staffing shortages that were causing flight delays Friday at a number of airports, including in Boston, Phoenix, San Francisco, Nashville, Houston, Dallas and the Washington, D.C., area. Airports serving the New York City area — John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark Liberty — were also experiencing delays averaging around two hours, according to the FAA.

Staffing shortages can occur both in regional control centers that manage multiple airports and in individual airport towers, but they don’t always lead to flight disruptions. According to aviation analytics firm Cirium, flight data showed strong on-time performance at most major airports for the month of October despite isolated staffing problems throughout the month.

But Cirium said the data also showed a “broader slowdown” Thursday across the nation’s aviation system for the first time since the shutdown began Oct. 1, suggesting staffing-related disruptions may be spreading.

Instacart, DoorDash, Gopuff among companies offering discounts to SNAP recipients

Instacart said Friday that it will offer customers who receive SNAP benefits 50% on their next grocery order to ease strain as the government prepares to cut off food aid payments.

the company said any customer who placed an order in October using a SNAP/EBT card will be eligible for the discount, which will be available even if the government makes payments as planned on Nov. 1. Instacart said it is also expanding the number of food banks it supports through online food drives from 100 to 300.

The San Francisco-based grocery delivery company said both programs amount to $5 million in direct relief.

Instacart is one of several big companies reacting to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on Nov. 1 due to the government shutdown.

Trump back on ’60 Minutes’ for the first time after settling lawsuit

The president is returning to the weekly newsmagazine this weekend for the first time since the suit, which centered on its interview with Kamala Harris, was settled in the summer.

Trump was interviewed by CBS’ Norah O’Donnell on Friday at Mar-a-Lago for the appearance, which will air Sunday.

The president has a checkered history with television’s most popular newsmagazine. But he has signaled friendlier relations with CBS News after the takeover of its parent company this summer by new Paramount CEO David Ellison, the son of wealthy supporter Larry Ellison.

Trump says he’ll fund SNAP if the courts give more clarity

The president suggested on social media that the government would comply with court rulings to pay for food aid during the government shutdown but said more clarity is needed first.

“Even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out,” Trump said. Federal funds for the program are expected to be frozen starting Saturday.

“If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding.”

He sought to blame Democrats for the delay and urged SNAP recipients to call Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

New Pentagon policy undercuts trans troops’ ability to ask to stay in the military, AP learns

The policy will severely undercut the ability of transgender troops who have been banned from the armed forces by the Trump administration to turn to peer boards to argue for their right to stay, according to a memo obtained by AP.

If military separation boards decide to allow transgender service members to remain in uniform, commanders can override those decisions, according to an Oct. 8 memo to all services from the Pentagon’s undersecretary for personnel and readiness. That breaks with longstanding policy that boards act independently.

It is the Pentagon’s latest step to drive transgender troops out of the armed forces following a presidential executive order. Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have targeted diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in what they say is an effort to make the military more lethal.

The new memo also requires that trans service members appear before separation boards in uniforms that match the gender assigned to them at birth. If they do not, their absence can be used against them.

Court says Border Patrol official won’t have to brief judge on Chicago-area immigration sweeps

An appeals court ruled in favor of the Trump administration and stopped a judge from trying to get daily updates from a Border Patrol official about the government’s immigration crackdown in the Chicago area.

The court said the order from U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis put her “in position of an inquisitor rather than that of a neutral adjudicator” and would have turned her into a supervisor of Greg Bovino, a violation of the separation of powers.

Ellis, concerned about allegations of excessive force and the use of tear gas against protesters, wanted daily updates from Bovino, starting Wednesday. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals intervened that day and suspended the order, before going further and freezing it Friday.

Also Friday, advocates in a different case sued over what they called “inhumane” conditions at a Chicago-area immigration facility.

The renewed request came in a letter Friday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard.

“We also request that you provide all legal opinions related to these strikes and a list of the groups or other entities the President has deemed targetable,” the senators said in the letter, which was obtained by The Associated Press.

Signatories included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as Jack Reed, Jeanne Shaheen, Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Patty Murray and Brian Schatz.

The letter said the administration so far “has selectively shared what has at times been contradictory information” with some members “while excluding others.”

Democrats and some Republicans have complained that the administration has failed to provide basic information about lethal strikes that U.S. forces have carried out against alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and Pacific the last two months.

Trump opens the door for sanctions on Nigeria over alleged persecution of Christians

The president announced Friday that he would designate the West African nation “a country of particular concern” as it relates to religious freedom, a move that has been pushed by some U.S. lawmakers.

The designation does not necessarily mean that sanctions, which could include a ban on all non-humanitarian aid, will be imposed, but it is a step ahead of that.

“Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria,” Trump said via social media. “Radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter. I am hereby making Nigeria a ‘COUNTRY OF PARTICULAR CONCERN.’”

Nigeria vehemently rejects such claims about persecution of Christians. Analysts say that while Christians are among those targeted, the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigeria’s Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.

Trump said he would ask lawmakers to look into the matter and report back on what the response to the designation should be.

Union president for air traffic controllers says ‘end this shutdown’

The president of the union representing air traffic controllers is calling on Congress to pass a clean continuing resolution to end the government shutdown, make sure federal workers get paid and then engage in bipartisan negotiation on other pressing issues.

Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said the workers the union represents got no paycheck on Tuesday after receiving a partial check two weeks earlier. He said going without a full month’s pay or more would be unsustainable.

Daniels also said the situation is creating substantial distractions for individuals already engaged in extremely stressful work.

“The financial and mental strain increases risks within the National Airspace System, making it less safe with each passing day of the shutdown,” Daniels said in a statement.

Top Senate Judiciary Democrat challenges YouTube’s claims of Biden censorship

Attorneys for YouTube’s parent company Alphabet last month sent the Senate Judiciary Committee a letter claiming the Biden administration pressed the social media site to delete content during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But Sen. Jamie Raskin, the committee’s Democratic ranking member, on Friday publicly questioned that assessment in his own letter to YouTube CEO Neal Mohan.

Raskin wrote that the sworn testimony of 20 Alphabet employees contradicted the claims the company had made. He questioned whether YouTube was coerced to claim censorship by the Trump administration.

“What was Alphabet promised or threatened with in order to dance to this new MAGA tune?” Raskin asked in Friday’s letter.

Republicans argue the Biden administration illegally censored Americans through coercion to tech companies. Democrats dispute that narrative.

Judge sides with Democratic groups that sued over Trump’s proof-of-citizenship directive

The federal judge ruled that Trump’s request to add a documentary proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers.

The ruling deals a blow to the administration and its allies who have argued that such a mandate is necessary to restore public confidence that only Americans are voting in U.S. elections.

“Because our Constitution assigns responsibility for election regulation to the States and to Congress, this Court holds that the President lacks the authority to direct such changes,” U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly in Washington, D.C., wrote in her opinion.

Kollar-Kotelly echoed comments she made when she granted a preliminary injunction over the issue.

Senators press Hegseth for more information on boat strikes

The Republican chair and ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee have asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide the legal rationale for the U.S. military’s fatal attacks on alleged drug boats off the South American coast.

The senators also requested the directives Hegseth approved for the military strikes, which have killed at least 61 people in 14 attacks since early September. They also want the list of drug cartels that the Trump administration has designated as terrorist organizations in its justification for the use of military force.

The requests were made in two letters from late September and early October that were released Friday by Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, and Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island.

Lawmakers in both parties have raised questions about the use of military force without congressional approval. The Trump administration has shown no evidence to support its claims about the boats that have been attacked, their connection to drug cartels, or even the identity of the people killed in the strikes.

Top Democrat says Trump administration must release SNAP funds after judge’s ruling

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, the ranking member of the Senate Agriculture committee that oversees the food aid program, said the court’s decision “confirms what we have said all week: The administration is choosing not to feed Americans in need, despite knowing that it is legally required to do so.”

The district court’s decision leaves “no excuse to withhold food assistance from Americans,” she said.

If the administration decides not to issue SNAP funds, she said, “it is purely a cruel political decision, not a legal one. They should immediately act — as the court has required — to ensure food assistance continues to go to families in need.”

Judges in the SNAP payment lawsuits expect updates by Monday

A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from the bench that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds — and asked for an update on progress by Monday.

A Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.

It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling.

That process often takes one to two weeks.

The rulings are likely to face appeals.

Senate Republicans reject Trump’s call to eliminate the filibuster

Trump has long pushed Senate Republicans to get rid of the rule that requires 60 votes to overcome objections and gives the minority Democrats a check on GOP power. He posted on social media late Thursday that the Senate should “Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!”

But Senate Majority Leader John Thune has repeatedly said he is not considering changing the rules even as he seeks to end the shutdown, arguing that the filibuster is vital to the institution of the Senate and has allowed them to halt Democratic policies when they are in the minority.

The leader’s “position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged,” Thune spokesman Ryan Wrasse said Friday.

A spokeswoman for Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the No. 2 Republican, said his position opposing a filibuster change also remains unchanged.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also defended the filibuster Friday, while conceding “it’s not my call.”

“The safeguard in the Senate has always been the filibuster,” Johnson said, adding that Trump’s comments are “the president’s anger at the situation.”

Trump administration must fund SNAP payments during the shutdown, judge rules

Two federal judges ruled nearly simultaneously on Friday that President Donald Trump’s administration must to continue to fund SNAP, the nation’s biggest food aid program, using contingency funds during the government shutdown.

The rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.

The program costs around $8 billion per month nationally.

Trump says he’s renovated the Lincoln Bathroom

The president announced the renovation and posted side-by-side photos of the before and after of the rehab of the bathroom attached to one of the most famous rooms in the White House.

“It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump added. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”

White House set to resume public tours in December, after interruption for ballroom construction

The White House says tours will restart Dec. 2, following their suspension for months due to the construction of Trump’s $300 million ballroom.

The East Wing was once part of tour routes, but has been demolished as part of the project.

The White House says it’ll now offer “an updated route offering guests the opportunity to experience the history and beauty of the People’s House.”

To mark the holidays, December tours feature Christmas decorations curated by first lady Melania Trump on the State Floor.

Congressional offices can begin submitting tour requests for their constituents on Monday. Such requests had been paused since the summer for ballroom construction.

Several people, including at least one woman who said that she was a U.S. citizen, were arrested after appearing to interfere with immigration operations. In Evanston, a suburb north of Chicago, Border Patrol agents detained at least one additional person after a car rear-ended the agents’ vehicle on Friday, according to the Evanston police.

Evanston police officers responded to the scene as dozens of people shouted and jeered at the agents while demanding that the people detained be released.

In Albany Park, on Chicago’s Northwest Side, Border Patrol agents on Friday morning arrested at least two people who had physically confronted them, witnesses said.

The chaotic day of arrests came more than seven weeks into President Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration in Chicago. Earlier this week, Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois made a plea to the Trump administration: Leave Halloween alone.

“Illinois families deserve to spend Halloween weekend without fear,” Mr. Pritzker, a Democrat, wrote in a letter to federal officials. “No child should be forced to inhale tear gas or other chemical agents while trick-or-treating in their own neighborhood.”

Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, said on Thursday that the operation would not be temporarily halted. On Friday, the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to questions about the episodes in Evanston and Albany Park.

Families across Chicago have been bracing for Halloween, fearful that immigration agents would target and arrest people on the streets during trick-or-treating. Neighborhoods set up watch groups for Friday evening, with volunteers to be stationed on corners with whistles, ready to alert neighbors if immigration agents were seen.

Evanston was especially roiled by the presence of Border Patrol agents on Friday.

Bystanders said that a motorist had been following federal agents along a major street when the agents stopped short, causing the car to crash into it.

Videos shared with the The New York Times show the agents tackling the driver, a woman, to the ground.

Allie Harned, a social worker at Chute Middle School a block away, said she heard the crash and came running.

“When I came upon her, they were tearing her out of the car,” Ms. Harned said. “She was on the ground. Her shoes fell off.”

After bystanders began yelling and blowing whistles, the agents detained at least one person in the group, according to the Evanston police.

One officer briefly pulled a weapon and aimed it at the crowd, one of the videos shows. Ms. Harned said she screamed and ran. It was uncertain exactly what type of weapon the officer was holding.

The incident happened near the middle school and an elementary school, just a few hours before children were set to go door to door for holiday candy. Nearby schools locked down because of the heightened federal activity, keeping students inside for recess.

At a news conference held in front of Chute Middle School later in the day, children peered out of open windows to listen to local officials denounce the federal government’s actions.

“Just today, ICE agents have assaulted Evanston residents, beaten people up, grabbed them, abducted them, taken people off the street,” said Daniel Biss, the Democratic mayor of Evanston, who is also running for Congress. “It is an outrage,” he added.

Gregory Bovino, a senior Border Patrol official who has been leading the immigration crackdown in Chicago, was admonished by a federal judge earlier this week for his agency’s use of force and tear gas in recent weeks.

The judge ordered Mr. Bovino to appear in her courtroom each weeknight to answer questions about that day’s enforcement activities and agents’ compliance with restrictions that the judge imposed. But the federal government objected, and an appellate court on Friday blocked the requirement for Mr. Bovino to make those daily appearances.

JB Pritzker legislation prohibiting federal authorities from making immigration arrests near courthouses, but even one of the measure's top sponsors questions whether it can survive a court challenge.

The proposal adopted early Friday also allows lawsuits when people believe their constitutional rights have been violated during civil immigration arrests.

The legislation imposes civil damages for false imprisonment when someone attending a court hearing or appearing as a party or witness to a legal proceeding is arrested. Proponents say courts must be accessible to everyone to pursue remedies to violations of their rights.

Democratic Senate President Don Harmon, a lead sponsor, acknowledged the measure will face a court challenge.

""It's not just about the constitutionality of the law, which I think is sound, but it's the reality that the courts are stacked against us,"" Harmon said. ""The federal government can try to remove it from state courts to federal courts. They can try to substitute the government itself for the individual defendants, but that's not a reason not to try.""

Pritzker, a Democrat, supports the idea and will review the plan when it reaches his desk, spokesperson Matt Hill said.

Two weeks ago, the top judge in Cook County, home to Chicago, issued an order with the same prohibition. It's unclear whether the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has followed the dictum, but at the time, federal officials dismissed it, saying ""there are no legal sanctuaries where you can hide and avoid the consequences for breaking the law.""

The Trump administration's immigration enforcement, which began two months ago in Chicago and its suburbs, is intended to round up migrants living in the country illegally, particularly those with criminal records. But witnesses have reported repeated incidents in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers detain people regardless of citizenship or legal status.

""No one should have to choose between seeking justice and risking their freedom,"" said co-sponsoring Sen. Celina Villanueva. ""Courthouses must be places where people can resolve disputes, testify and support loved ones, not sites of fear or intimidation.""

The legislation, approved largely along party lines, also requires hospitals, day care centers and higher education institutions to create policies delineating how they would handle immigration agents inside their facilities.

Other states have taken similar action or otherwise adopted practices to protect immigrants. California has limited immigration enforcement action in courthouses since 2017. Guidance published by California Attorney General Rob Bonta says the state can't control federal immigration action, but ""the state has a responsibility to provide safe and secure access to court facilities to all residents regardless of immigration status.""

In September, Connecticut Supreme Court Chief Justice Raheem Mullins issued a policy prohibiting warrantless arrests inside state courts, as well as banning the use in judicial buildings of face coverings, routinely worn by ICE officers.

""Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public, they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption,"" Mullins said.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/10/07/b5a6caac-780d-417f-8876-760410fd8779/thumbnail/1200x630/c002d2d976544b3bed76f6bab2ef0d58/screenshot-2022-10-07-144245.png,N,,2025-11-01 09:16:46.525992

Chicago, the center of the effort dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, is the latest target in the Trump administration’s nationwide immigration crackdown. Agents have arrested more than 3,000 people during the operation. Noem said the effort covers the area ""that the field office is covering,"" and local news outlets reported that the Chicago Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office also includes Indiana, Wisconsin, Missouri, Kentucky and Kansas.

""There’s no American citizens have been arrested or detained. We focus on those that are here illegally"" Noem said during the Oct. 30 press conference in Gary, Indiana. ""And anything that you would hear or report that would be different than that is simply not true and false reporting.""

Noem didn’t say whether she was referring to Operation Midway Blitz specifically or the nationwide immigration crackdown more broadly, and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to our questions about her statement.

By either measure, Noem’s wrong. News reports and lawsuits show that U.S. citizens have been detained during Operation Midway Blitz, and a ProPublica investigation documented 170 cases of U.S. citizens who have been arrested by immigration agents across the country since Trump started his second term.

Homeland Security addressed such reports in an Oct. 1 statement: ""We have said it a million times: ICE does NOT arrest or deport U.S. citizens.""

But DHS has also released several statements and posted on social media explaining why U.S. citizens have been detained or arrested.

Here are some examples.

Several U.S. citizens in Chicago say they’ve been arrested by immigration agents

The detentions and arrests of U.S. citizens during Operation Midway Blitz have included people who DHS said were obstructing law enforcement, and people who were released after showing proof of U.S. citizenship.

Journalists in Chicago sued the Trump administration saying federal agents have illegally stopped, detained and ""arrested hundreds of people, including many citizens.""

The suit names Steve Held, a U.S. citizen who the lawsuit says was arrested and later released without charges.

Another lawsuit details the detention of U.S. citizen Julio Noriega, who said he was taken into custody by federal immigration agents and held overnight in an ICE processing facility. Immigration officers released Noriega after looking in his wallet and seeing his identification.

Noriega is among 22 people the American Civil Liberties Union is representing against the Trump administration, alleging unlawful arrests and detentions by ICE. Immigration agents failed to properly verify Noriega’s citizenship and did not document his arrest, the lawsuit says.

Federal immigration agents also detained Debbie Brockman, a U.S. citizen who works for a Chicago TV station, before releasing her.

""Deborah Brockman, a U.S. citizen, threw objects at Border Patrol’s car,"" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN after video of Brockman’s arrest went viral. Brockman was released without charges and denies wrongdoing, and witnesses have disputed the DHS account.

ICE has arrested U.S. citizens across the country

The detention of U.S. citizens hasn’t been restricted to Operation Midway Blitz.

In New Mexico, Border Patrol arrested Jose Hermosillo in April and kept him in custody for about 10 days. DHS said Hermosillo answered ""yes"" when officers asked if he was in the U.S. illegally.

Agents released Hermosilo after his family produced a birth certificate and Social Security documentation and a federal judge dismissed a criminal case against him. Hermosillo’s parents told CBS News that their son has an intellectual disability and can’t read or write.

In Florida, Juan Carlos Lopez Gomez, a 20-year-old born in Georgia, was arrested after a traffic stop and briefly held on charges tied to a Florida immigration law. The charges were dismissed after his mother presented his birth certificate, state ID and Social Security card.

During an immigration raid in Hawthorne, California, ICE agents detained pregnant citizen Cary López Alvarado, releasing her later that day.

""Cary Lopez was arrested because she obstructed federal law enforcement by blocking access to a car that had two Guatemalan illegal aliens in it,"" McLaughlin told NBC News.

In Alabama, Leonardo Garcia Venegas said he was working at a construction site when masked agents entered the area, according to ProPublica. When his undocumented brother asked to see a warrant, Garcia Venegas started recording on his phone.

He kept filming until officers turned on him. In the footage, agents try to take him down as he shouts, ""I’m a citizen!"" They pulled out his Alabama REAL ID — which is issued only to legal residents — but dismissed it as fake, according to ProPublica.

Garcia Venegas was handcuffed and held for more than an hour before being released. His brother, who is not a U.S. citizen, was later deported.

Our ruling

Noem said ""No American citizens have been arrested or detained"" during the Trump administration’s immigration crackdowns.

That’s wrong.

Lawsuits, news reports and DHS statements show that numerous U.S. citizens have been detained or arrested by immigration agents in and around Chicago during Operation Midway Blitz. A ProPublica investigation documented 170 cases of federal immigration officers detaining U.S. citizens nationwide under the Trump administration.

Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.","EDITOR’S NOTE: This article was updated on Oct. 31, 2025, to include social media comments from Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, that he posted after publication.

The Trump administration has ordered states to investigate certain individuals enrolled in Medicaid to determine whether they are ineligible because of their immigration status, with five states reporting they’ve together received more than 170,000 names collectively — an “unprecedented” step by the federal government that ensnares the state-federal health program in the president’s immigration crackdown.

Advocates say the push burdens states with duplicative verification checks and could lead people to lose coverage just for missing paperwork deadlines. But the administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Mehmet Oz, said in a post on the social platform X on Oct. 31 that more than $1 billion “of federal taxpayer dollars were being spent on funding Medicaid for illegal immigrants” in five states and Washington, D.C.

Medicaid’s overall spending topped $900 billion in fiscal year 2024.

It wasn’t clear from Oz’s statement or an accompanying video over what period the spending happened, and CMS spokespeople did not immediately respond to questions, either for an earlier version of this article or after Oz’s statement was posted.

Only U.S. citizens and some lawfully present immigrants are eligible for Medicaid, which covers low-income and disabled people, and the closely related Children’s Health Insurance Program. Those without legal status are ineligible for federally funded health coverage, including Medicaid, Medicare, and plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

At least one state said it disagreed with Oz’s comments.

“Our payments for coverage of undocumented individuals are in accordance with state and federal laws,” said Marc Williams, a spokesperson for Colorado’s Department of Health Care Policy & Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program. “The $1.5 million number referenced by federal leaders today is based on an incorrect preliminary finding, and has been refuted with supporting data by our Department experts.”

He added: “It is disappointing that the administration is announcing this number as final when it is clearly overstated and the conversations are very much in the education and discussion phase.”

In August, CMS began sending states the names of people enrolled in Medicaid that the agency suspected might not be eligible, demanding state Medicaid agencies check their immigration status.

KFF Health News in October reached out to Medicaid agencies in 10 states. Five provided the approximate number of names they had received from the Trump administration, with expectations of more to come: Colorado had been given about 45,000 names, Ohio 61,000, Pennsylvania 34,000, Texas 28,000, and Utah 8,000. More than 70 million people are enrolled in Medicaid.

Most of those states declined to comment further. Medicaid agencies in California, Florida, Georgia, New York, and South Carolina refused to say how many names they were ordered to review or did not respond.

Oz said in his X post that California had misspent $1.3 billion on care for people not eligible for Medicaid, while Illinois spent $30 million, Oregon $5.4 million, Washington state $2.4 million, Washington, D.C., $2.1 million, and Colorado $1.5 million.

“We notified the states, and many have begun refunding the money,” he said. “But what if we had never asked?”

Washington, D.C.’s Medicaid director, Melisa Byrd, said CMS had identified administrative expenses for the district program that covers people regardless of immigration status that should not have been billed to the federal government and her agency has already fixed some of those areas. “We run a big program that is very complex and when mistakes or errors happen, we fix them,” she said.

The program plans to pay $654,014 back to CMS by mid-November.

All five states, plus Washington, D.C., are led by Democrats, and President Donald Trump didn’t win any of them in the 2024 election.

In recent days, Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill began posting pictures on X of people he said are convicted criminals living in the U.S. without authorization who had received Medicaid benefits.

O’Neill could not be reached for comment.

“We are very concerned because this seems, frankly, to be a waste of state resources and furthers the administration’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Ben D’Avanzo, senior health advocacy strategist with the National Immigration Law Center, an advocacy group. “This duplicates what states already do,” he said.

As part of the administration’s crackdown on people in the U.S. without authorization, President Donald Trump in February directed federal agencies to take action to ensure they are not obtaining benefits in violation of federal law.

In June, advisers to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered CMS to share information about Medicaid enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security, drawing a lawsuit by some states alarmed that the administration would use the information for its deportation campaign against unauthorized residents.

In August, a federal judge ordered HHS to stop sharing the information with immigration authorities.

State Medicaid agencies use databases maintained by the Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security to verify enrollees’ immigration status.

If states need to go back to individuals to reverify their citizenship or immigration status, it could lead some to fall off the rolls unnecessarily — for example, if they don’t see a letter requesting paperwork or fail to meet a deadline to respond.

“I am not sure that evidence suggests there really is a need for this” extra verification, said Marian Jarlenski, a health policy professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.

Oz made clear that the Trump administration disagrees.

“Whether willful or not, the states’ conduct highlights a terrifying reality: American taxpayers have been footing the bill for illegal immigrants’ Medicaid coverage, despite many Democrats and the media insisting otherwise,” Oz said in his X post.

In an August press release, CMS said it would ask states to verify eligibility for enrollees whose immigration status could not be confirmed via federal databases. “We expect states to take quick action and will monitor progress on a monthly basis,” the agency said.

Leonardo Cuello, a research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families, called the CMS order to states “unprecedented” in the Medicaid program’s 60-year history.

He said the federal government may have been unable to verify certain individuals’ immigration status because names were misspelled or outdated, such as when a beneficiary is identified by their maiden instead of married name. The names may also include people helped by Emergency Medicaid, a program that covers the cost of hospital emergency services, including labor and delivery, for people regardless of immigration status.

“CMS is conducting pointless immigration status reviews for people whose hospital bills were paid by Emergency Medicaid,” Cuello said.

Oz noted in his post that federal law “does permit states to use Medicaid dollars for emergency treatment, regardless of patients’ citizenship or immigration status,” and that states can “legally build Medicaid programs for illegal immigrants using their own state tax dollars, so long as no federal tax dollars are used.”

The states Oz mentioned all run their own such programs.

The verification checks create an added burden for state Medicaid agencies that are already busy preparing to implement the tax and policy law Trump signed in July. The measure, which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, makes many changes to Medicaid, including adding a work requirement in most states starting by 2027. The law also requires most states to more frequently check the eligibility of many adult Medicaid enrollees — at least twice a year.

“I fear states may do unnecessary checks that create a burden for some enrollees who will lose health coverage who should not,” Cuello said. “It’s going to be a whole lot of work for CMS and states for very little pay dirt.”

Cuello said the effort may have “greater political value than actual value.”

Brandon Cwalina, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services, which runs Medicaid in the state, said the state already requires every Medicaid applicant to verify their citizenship or, where applicable, their eligible immigration status.

However, he said, the directive issued by CMS “constitutes a new process, and DHS is carefully reviewing the list in order to take appropriate actions.”

Oz did not name Pennsylvania, which Trump won in 2024, in his post.

If a lawful resident does not have a Social Security number, the state confirms their legal status by checking a database from Homeland Security, as well as verifying specific immigration documents, he said.

Other state Medicaid agencies said they also needed to regroup before reaching out to enrollees.

“Our teams just received this notice and are working through a process by which we will perform these reviews,” Jennifer Strohecker, then Utah’s Medicaid director, told a state advisory board in August.

Here, we summarize some of the most important recent developments in immigration policy on the federal, legal, state, and local levels.

Federal

Trump Administration Slashes Refugee Program to Lowest Level

President Trump set the refugee admissions ceiling at 7,500 for fiscal year 2026, the lowest cap since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980, according to a Federal Register notice dated September 30 and published on October 31. The determination states that admissions will “primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa” and “other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.” President Trump suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program on his first day in office, later creating an exemption for white South Africans whom his administration claims face racial persecution, despite denials from the South African government. The administration stated the 7,500 level is “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.” The cap contrasts sharply with historical averages of around 95,000 refugee admissions under both Democratic and Republican administrations.

Lawmakers condemned the decision as “morally indefensible” and “illegal,” arguing the president failed to conduct required Congressional consultations before setting the refugee cap. Refugee resettlement organizations criticized the policy for undermining the program’s purpose, with Global Refuge President Krish O’Mara Vignarajah stating it “lowers our moral standing” at a time of global crises in Afghanistan, Venezuela, and Sudan. A senior administration official blamed the government shutdown for delayed Congressional consultation, saying no refugees will be admitted until those discussions occur.

Trump Administration Reassigns ICE Leadership in Major Overhaul

The Trump administration is reassigning at least a dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) field office directors and replacing most with Border Patrol officials in an unprecedented leadership overhaul affecting roughly half of ICE’s 25 field offices nationwide. Directors in Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Diego, El Paso, Seattle/Portland, and New Orleans have been reassigned to other positions. The replacements are being vetted by Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and White House adviser Corey Lewandowski.

The changes stem from frustration that ICE has not met the White House target of 3,000 arrests per day, averaging approximately 1,178 daily arrests as of late September. Senior administration officials expressed preference for Border Patrol’s tactics, including helicopter deployments to residential buildings and retail parking lot operations, amid dissatisfaction with ICE’s performance. Meanwhile, internal tensions have emerged within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), with one official telling reporters that “we’re arresting criminals, while they are going to Home Depots and car washes,” referring to Border Patrol operations.

DHS Eliminates Automatic Work Permit Extensions for Renewal Applicants

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) published a rule on October 30 eliminating automatic work authorization extensions for most renewal applicants who previously received up to 540 days of continued employment authorization while their applications were pending. Under the new policy, applicants who file renewals on or after October 30 will lose work authorization when their current documents expire, even if their renewal is pending, and must wait until immigration officials approve the renewal and issue a new card before resuming employment. Limited exceptions remain for Temporary Protected Status holders and certain students.

The policy is expected to disrupt businesses and force employers to remove workers from payroll due to processing delays, affecting hundreds of thousands of workers including those seeking green cards, spouses of visa holders, and applicants under humanitarian programs. Immigration attorneys warned that workers who have lived in the U.S. for years and consistently renewed their work permits will face termination because processing times frequently exceed six months.

USCIS Implements Electronic-Only Payment Policy

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) began requiring electronic payments for all paper-filed immigration forms on October 28, ending acceptance of checks and money orders. Applicants must now pay fees by credit or debit card or through direct bank account transfers from U.S. banks. USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser stated the change aims to reduce processing delays and risks associated with fraud, lost payments, and theft, noting that checks and money orders previously comprised over 90% of payments. The policy aligns with Executive Order 14247, which requires government-wide electronic payment systems.

USCIS said it will allow exemptions for applicants who lack access to banking services or electronic payment systems, though exemption requests must be submitted using a separate form. The agency also said it will reject applications without valid payment of the correct fee amount. Forms filed through USCIS online accounts continue to accept electronic payments as before, with the agency encouraging applicants to file online.

Legal

Portland and Chicago National Guard Cases Advance Through Federal Courts

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals voted on October 28 to rehear the case over President Trump’s National Guard deployment to Portland, vacating a previous 2-1 ruling that had sided with the Trump administration and reinstating a lower court’s temporary restraining order blocking the deployment. The full appeals court will now reconsider the case with an 11-judge panel after a judge requested the review, writing in her earlier dissent that colleagues should “act swiftly to vacate the majority’s order before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur.” The decision maintains the current status quo in which 200 Oregon National Guard troops remain under federal control but cannot be deployed to Portland while litigation continues. A federal judge is simultaneously presiding over a three-day trial that began October 29 to determine whether Trump’s deployment plans violate federal law and state sovereignty.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court requested additional briefing on October 29 in the administration’s bid to deploy National Guard troops to Chicago, asking both parties to clarify whether “regular forces” in federal law refers specifically to U.S. military forces and how that interpretation affects the deployment authority. The justices set a November 10 deadline for initial briefs and November 17 for replies, indicating no decision will come before mid-November and suggesting the Court wants more information before ruling on the administration’s emergency request to lift a lower court’s temporary restraining order blocking Illinois deployment. The Trump administration has argued that protests against immigration enforcement in Chicago constitute a “rebellion or danger of rebellion,” while Illinois and Chicago officials maintain the deployment is unnecessary and violates state sovereignty.

Federal Judge Intensifies Oversight of Immigration Agents in Chicago

A federal judge ordered Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino on October 28 to appear in her courtroom daily at 6 p.m. until November 5 to report on immigration enforcement operations after agents deployed tear gas in residential neighborhoods for three consecutive days. The judge also required Bovino to obtain a body camera and training by October 31 after he testified he does not wear one despite leading approximately 200 Border Patrol agents during “Operation Midway Blitz.” Subsequently, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals granted an administrative stay on October 29 pausing the daily appearance requirement while the court considers the Justice Department’s argument that the order “significantly interferes” with enforcing immigration laws.

The increased oversight stemmed from alleged violations of the judge’s October 9 temporary restraining order restricting agents’ use of force against protesters, journalists, and clergy. Video evidence showed Bovino throwing tear gas canisters at protesters on October 24 without giving required warnings. The judge expressed particular concern about an October 26 incident where agents deployed tear gas in the Old Irving Park neighborhood while children were walking to a Halloween parade, stating that “these kids, their sense of safety was shattered.”

Justice Department Hires Immigration Judges Following Layoffs

The Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) hired 36 new judges on October 27. Of the judges hired, 11 are permanent hires and 25 are temporary hires, and they will be placed in courts across 16 states. States that have seen significant losses of immigration judges, such as Massachusetts and Chicago, have also seen judges hired into their respective courts. These Department of Justice (DOJ) described the hires as part of an “immigration judge corps that is committed to upholding the rule of law.” The hired judges come from an array of backgrounds, from different branches of the U.S. Military to federal government branches such as the Department of Homeland Security.

This hiring phase comes after losing more than 125 judges from “firings and voluntary resignations” over the past 10 months, and down from 700 total judges from the start of 2025. The firing of immigration judges continues throughout the country, and 24 immigration judges were fired this past September alone, including an immigration judge in Seattle hired during the Biden Administration who had less than “favorable” rulings towards immigrants. A DOJ August memo stated that judges will face punishment if they do not comply and have their rulings align with the administration.

State and Local

Governor DeSantis Directs Florida Universities to End the Use of H-1B Visas

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced a directive for state universities to cease hiring foreign workers under H-1B visa programs. The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily employ foreign workers in specialty occupations requiring theoretical or technical expertise. Universities have traditionally used these visas to hire international faculty, researchers, and specialized staff members across various academic departments and research programs. Governor DeSantis’s directive applies to Florida’s state university system, which includes major institutions such as the University of Florida, Florida State University, and Florida International University. Nearly 400 foreign nationals are currently employed at Florida’s public universities under the H-1B visa program.

LEGISLATIVE FLOOR CALENDAR

The U.S. Senate will be in session from Monday, November 3, through Friday, November 7. The U.S. House of Representatives will be in session from Tuesday, November 4, through Thursday, November 6.

And the practical reality is, challenges probably have to go to the Court of Federal Claims, at least until certainty prevails.
Terry Gerton What does this mean longer term for the future of federal grant making?
Terry Gerton And is the Court of Federal Claims prepared for this onslaught of cases?","Terry Gerton This administration has sort of turned the world of grants on its head. It’s been very disruptive. What is the big news now, eight months in?

David Robbins Well, I agree with you, it’s been very disruptive, and the big news now is that the courts are weighing in, including the Supreme Court, forcing grant recipients who want to recover for money they’re otherwise owed into a specialized court called the Court of Federal Claims.

Terry Gerton This is a new process for grantees, right? They’ve had other paths that they’ve followed in the past.

David Robbins They have had other paths. They could have used normal district court, Article III courts, to enjoin a termination or wrongful action and get their grant restarted. This is different. You have to sue for monetary damages. For recoveries, you let the grant get terminated and then sue in the Court of Federal Claims to recover what you can.

Terry Gerton This seems like a real change in both judicial philosophy and administrative processing. What’s driving that change?

David Robbins I’m not entirely sure what’s driving the change; I focus more on the effects. The effects really are you have to give up on restarting the grant, which is a truly unfortunate development for a lot of the tremendous organizations out there doing great things — or they used to be doing great things — with federal grant dollars.

Terry Gerton And so what kind of cases fall into this new process?

David Robbins Anyone seeking to recover from the fund freeze. If you recall, the administration just stopped paying any money on grants for a while, and many didn’t restart. That’s blatantly unlawful, and it’s a breach of the grant itself. They’re entitled to recover for that money, and they’re entitled to recover forward termination costs, things like that, driving a lot of this need to recover and need for redress. But that’s all up to the Court of Federal Claims now.

Terry Gerton But they used to begin to process these through district court, is that correct?

David Robbins If they could have processed through district court, there was a choice. If you wanted to bring a breach of contract claim — because a grant at its core is a contract: We agree to do certain things, the federal government agrees to give us certain money — that could theoretically have gone to the court of federal claims, but that takes a while. So you could go to normal district court and try and restart things much faster.

Terry Gerton Well, now that everybody is being pushed into the Court of Federal Claims, what does that mean in terms of reasonable amount of time for resolution?

David Robbins There’s still just one bit of nuance. There’s an ability to go to district court, but you’re gonna face a motion to dismiss. You’re gonna to face uncertain judicial precedent. Do you actually get to recover? That’s probably a lot of lost time and a lot lost money. The Court of Federal Claims is a longer process. It’s a multi-year process, generally, before you finally recover. It’s much longer.

Terry Gerton So does this have the effect of dissuading even applying for grants, if you know that this is going to be a very complicated and expensive resolution process should your grant be terminated?

David Robbins I’m not sure that termination rules and where to sue will dissuade people from applying. But the risks of not seeing the money at all, the actual fear of real terminations, which have been happening in great numbers, is probably going to dissuade organizations from applying.

Terry Gerton And so how can organizations, especially grantees, grant recipients, prepare for this on the front end of a grant application?

David Robbins I think the important part for grant applicants is to watch their spending. Don’t get ahead of themselves. Make sure they’re spending in line with actual receipts from the government. The challenge is, let’s say they take on a lease that’s overly long, because they’re expecting the full course of their government grant to play out. I’m not sure that’s a reasonable assumption, at least in these times. So the best preparation is a little bit smarter fiscal management

Terry Gerton I’m speaking with David Robbins. He’s a partner at Jenner and Block. So we’re in an odd period of time right now. We’ve just finished a fiscal year. We’re in a lapse of funding, at least for a while. How should grantees be thinking about future opportunities?

David Robbins It’s still worth looking out on grants.gov or the normal funding sources for new opportunities because if they can get government money and that’s important to their organization, it’s worth doing. But I would view it less as a lifeline and more of opportunities that arise once in a while.

Terry Gerton And how is this administration defending this new approach to grants and its terminations? Are those holding up in court?

David Robbins We haven’t seen challenges in the Court of Federal Claims yet. We have seen some courts giving injunctions, Article 3 normal district courts giving injunctions, but then the appellate courts are saying, there’s no jurisdiction here. Go talk to the Court Of Federal Claims. So I don’t know if it’s holding up in court, and that’s part of the problem. That’s why we have such uncertainty. And the practical reality is, challenges probably have to go to the Court of Federal Claims, at least until certainty prevails.

Terry Gerton And the way this is playing out if you’re a grantee, if your grant was terminated, you used to be able, if you filed a case, the grant payment or process would continue until the case was resolved. That doesn’t seem to be playing out here now.

David Robbins There was an ability in normal district court to get an injunction, stopping the government from terminating, basically forcing them to pay until the case resolves. You’re right. That’s not happening anymore because the Court of Federal Claims can’t enjoin the government. It’s not that kind of court. They can only award monetary damages at the end of a sometimes lengthy process.

Terry Gerton So now if you’re terminated, you’re just terminated and the best you can do is sort of fight for the leftovers.

David Robbins It’s still worth looking at whether it’s worth trying in district court. I just view the odds as pretty long, so I think your statement is right.

Terry Gerton What does this mean longer term for the future of federal grant making? Does this chill the application process? What do you think the atmosphere will be going forward?

David Robbins I think in the near term, it will suppress the process. I think there will be fewer applicants. I think there will be fewer awards, social policies being engineered through government funds, of course. But this is administration by administration. New administrations can have new priorities. So I’m not sure what the medium or long term holds, but for the short term, it will have a chilling effect.

Terry Gerton And is the Court of Federal Claims prepared for this onslaught of cases?

David Robbins The Court of Federal Claims has a full load of judges for the first time in a while, which is great, but no, they’re still busy just like every other court. And at this stage of my career, I’ve got a lot of friends who are judges. I am projecting that they are a little bit worried about what might be a bow wave of potential inbound cases that they will have to decide.

Terry Gerton So if you’re a federal grant maker, a program manager, for example, what do you need to know about this change in process?",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-1404226899-e1740078272495.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 21:03:16.902762

Therefore, even in a prolonged and painful war, there is an obligation to investigate suspicions of unlawful acts,” she wrote.
Media reports later found that the abuse was so severe that the prisoner was hospitalized and unable to walk afterwards.
Their arrest sparked riots from hundreds of Israelis, who clashed with soldiers at Sde Teiman and broke into the camp.
The protesters and several Israeli ministers called for the soldiers to be released, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling them “heroic warriors.”","Israel’s top military lawyer has resigned after taking responsibility for the leak of a horrific video showing the sexual abuse of a Palestinian prisoner by Israeli guards, after the military launched a investigation into the leak this week.

The military announced on Wednesday that it was opening a criminal probe into the leak in order to seek out and punish those responsible, after receiving newly obtained information on the leak from last year. Israeli ministers have long called for the prosecution of the leaker.

Military Advocate General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi was placed on leave amid the investigation. She resigned on Friday, and said in a letter that she approved the release of the video because she felt it was her duty to shine a light on illegal actions and abuses within the military in order to maintain Israel’s credibility on the world stage.

“The [Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)] is a moral and law-abiding army. Therefore, even in a prolonged and painful war, there is an obligation to investigate suspicions of unlawful acts,” she wrote. “This is our legal and ethical duty. It does not weaken or harm the IDF. On the contrary. It is a source of strength.”

Tomer-Yerushalmi said that she hoped the release of the video could also push back on efforts by top Israeli leaders who say that allegations of abuses in prisons are fabricated, including “severe allegations suggesting that we favor terrorists over our own troops.”

She said that, while the people detained in Israeli prisons are “terror operatives of the worst kind,” (ignoring that Israel’s detainees are often Palestinians imprisoned for arbitrary reasons), she still feels they deserve to be treated within the bounds of the law. “Unfortunately, this basic understanding — that there are actions which must never be taken even against the vilest of detainees — no longer convinces everyone,” she said.

Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz welcomed her resignation and nonsensically likened the video to “blood libel.”

“Anyone who spreads blood libels against IDF troops is unfit to wear the army’s uniform,” he said.

The video, originally shown on Israel’s Channel 12 in August of 2024, showed Israeli guards at the notorious Sde Teiman torture camp picking out an imprisoned Palestinian from a group and leading him to a wall. Using shields to cover what they were doing, they gang rape the prisoner. Media reports later found that the abuse was so severe that the prisoner was hospitalized and unable to walk afterwards.

Several soldiers were arrested for the incident, with five soldiers ultimately facing charges. Their arrest sparked riots from hundreds of Israelis, who clashed with soldiers at Sde Teiman and broke into the camp. The protesters and several Israeli ministers called for the soldiers to be released, with Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich calling them “heroic warriors.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_10-31-sde-teiman-prison.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 20:02:13.962438

In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the cutoff would be effective for November benefits.
“Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds,” Talwani wrote.
“I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,” Trump wrote.
The plan called for SNAP benefits to continue during a shutdown because the contingency fund existed.","WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Boston ruled Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s plan to pause a food assistance program for 42 million people was illegal — but gave the Trump administration until Monday to respond to her finding before she decides on a motion to force the benefits be paid despite the ongoing government shutdown.

At nearly the same time Friday, a Rhode Island federal judge in a similar case brought by cities and nonprofit groups ordered USDA to continue payments and granted a request for a temporary restraining order.

However, experts and a key member of Congress said that some SNAP recipients still may see delays in their benefits because changes in administration from the federal government to states to vendors take time.

There was also no immediate word from USDA on how it will implement the judicial orders, while the administration sought guidance from the courts.

In a social media post late Friday, President Donald Trump said administration lawyers believed the funds could not legally be paid and that he needed clarification about how to legally distribute SNAP benefits.

In Massachusetts, in a Friday afternoon order, District Court of Massachusetts Judge Indira Talwani said she would continue to take “under advisement” a coalition of Democratic states’ request to force the release of funds from a contingency account holding about $6 billion.

Her ruling came a day before a cutoff of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits to low-income households.

Because Congress is locked in a stalemate over a stopgap spending bill and did not appropriate money for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, administration officials say the program cannot provide federal funds beginning Saturday. In states, SNAP benefits are loaded onto cards on varying dates, but the cutoff would be effective for November benefits.

Talwani, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama, called the administration’s conclusion it can’t provide SNAP funding “erroneous,” and said the reserve fund was sufficient for SNAP benefits to flow to states and the vendors that add money to debit-like cards issued to the program’s beneficiaries that are used to purchase groceries.

The law creating the program mandated that benefits continue, she said.

“Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds,” Talwani wrote.

Talwani ordered the administration to say by Monday whether it would provide at least partial benefits for November.

Trump seeks clarification

Trump on social media said that he would be happy to see the funding go out and blamed Democrats for the monthlong shutdown.

“I have instructed our lawyers to ask the Court to clarify how we can legally fund SNAP as soon as possible,” Trump wrote. “It is already delayed enough due to the Democrats keeping the Government closed through the monthly payment date and, even if we get immediate guidance, it will unfortunately be delayed while States get the money out.”

The government filed a brief in the Rhode Island case asking the judge in that case to clarify how his order could legally be carried out.

Earlier Friday, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was noncommittal when asked if the department would comply with an order to resume benefits, according to CNN.

Spokespeople for the Department of Justice, which is representing the administration in the case, did not return messages seeking comment Friday.

The 25 states that sued were Massachusetts, California, Arizona, Minnesota, Connecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state, Wisconsin Kansas, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. The District of Columbia also sued.

Contingency fund can’t flow in shutdown, USDA chief says

At a press conference with U.S. House Republicans earlier Friday, Rollins said it was “a lie” that the contingency fund could be used to provide benefits.

“There is a contingency fund at USDA, but that contingency fund, by the way, doesn't even cover, I think, half of the $9.2 billion that would be required for November SNAP,” she said. “But it is only allowed to flow if the underlying program is funded. It's called a contingency fund, and by law, a contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing.”

The judges authoring Friday’s court orders disagreed with Rollins’ argument, which was also at odds with a shutdown plan her own department published on Sept. 30 before quietly deleting it sometime in October. The plan called for SNAP benefits to continue during a shutdown because the contingency fund existed.

“Congressional intent is evident that SNAP’s operations should continue since the program has been provided with multi-year contingency funds,” the Sept. 30 plan said.

U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, said benefit payments “will likely be delayed by several days or more” and blamed the situation on the administration’s refusal to spend from the contingency fund.

“The administration has chosen to hold hungry families hostage in their partisan political games,” she said in a statement. “It is cruel. It is shameful. And as federal judges in two states have now affirmed, it is illegal.”

Rhode Island case

In Rhode Island, where the judge granted a temporary restraining order, the advocacy group Democracy Forward, which was among those bringing the suit, praised the move.

“A federal court today granted a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump-Vance administration’s unlawful effort to halt the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) during the ongoing government shutdown,” the group said. “The decision ensures that millions of children, seniors, veterans, and families will continue to receive essential food assistance while the case proceeds.”

The judge in that case, John James McConnell Jr., said the administration’s actions violated a key federal administrative law against arbitrary and capricious executive action and federal spending laws “by disregarding Congress’s direction that SNAP must continue operating,” Democracy Forward said.

McConnell also was appointed by Obama.

Delays in benefits likely

Friday’s orders will likely not stop some SNAP benefits from at least being delayed, according to Lauren Kallins, a senior legislative director for state-federal affairs at the National Conference of State Legislatures.

Even if the Trump administration immediately complied with McConnell’s order that benefits must be released, the process of moving money from the U.S. Treasury to states to vendors to beneficiaries takes time.

“Under the best of circumstances… it's not a switch that can be flipped on once USDA decides to release funds,” Kallins, whose organization coordinates and advocates for bipartisan state lawmakers in every state, said.

States generally release SNAP funds to beneficiaries on a staggered basis, meaning that different beneficiaries receive their allotments on different days of the month.

With the situation unresolved a day before the new benefits month begins, some are certain to see at least delays in benefits, Kallins said.

“For people who get their allotments in the beginning of the month, there's definitely going to… be a delay here,” she said.

Additionally, if USDA were to release money only from the contingency fund, it could take states time to determine how to distribute prorated benefits.

Congress no closer to resolution

On Capitol Hill, the parties appeared no closer Friday to reaching an agreement as the government shutdown stretched into its second month.

House Republicans continued to blame Democrats for the standstill, urging Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to get his caucus behind the House-passed GOP measure to reopen the government at last fiscal year’s spending levels.

“Republicans have done our part to end the Democrat shutdown, and now it's time for Democrats to do theirs,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday morning.

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for Türk’s office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular U.N. briefing: “These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.”

She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law.”

President Donald Trump has justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the United States, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest U.S. military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61.

Shamdasani noted the U.S. explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.

Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. “Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.”

The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.

It’s one of the most thorough legal rebukes in recent memory.

More than 100 federal judges have now ruled at least 200 times that the Trump administration’s effort to systematically detain immigrants facing possible deportation appeared to violate their rights or was just flatly illegal, according to a POLITICO review.

The rulings come from judges appointed by every president since RONALD REAGAN, including 12 appointed by President DONALD TRUMP. One of those appointees took the bench just last month.

Since July 8, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement reversed 30 years of practice and determined that ICE must lock up everyone facing deportation — even if they’ve lived in the country for decades and have no criminal record — federal courts have issued increasing warnings. The new ICE policy, they note, doesn’t just subject millions more people to detention while they fight deportation, it also bars them from even asking an immigration judge to consider releasing them on bond.

“Courts around the country have since rejected the government’s new interpretation,” U.S. District Judge KYLE DUDEK, a Florida-based Trump appointee, ruled Wednesday. “This Court now joins the consensus.”

Other Trump-appointed judges who have ruled against the administration’s position include TERRY DOUGHTY in Louisiana, NANCY BRASEL in Minnesota, J.P. HANLON in Indiana and JASON PULLIAM in Texas. Pulliam ruled Oct. 21 that one ICE detainee, who had been held without any “individualized assessment” of his dangerousness, was deprived of his constitutional due process rights.

The onslaught of legal rejections has come in hundreds of individual cases, typically filed on an emergency basis after ICE’s targets are arrested at courthouses or check-ins with immigration officers. Though a handful of class action lawsuits have been filed seeking to block the administration’s expanded detention policy, they have advanced slowly and seem weeks — perhaps months — from resolution. One case broke through Thursday, however, when U.S. District Judge PATTI SARIS, a BILL CLINTON appointee, approved a statewide class for immigrants in Massachusetts who are subject to the mandatory detention policy.

A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson noted that the administration’s position was recently upheld by the Board of Immigration Appeals, an executive branch court that sets policy for immigration judges — also appointed and overseen by the Trump administration.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem are now enforcing this law as it was actually written to keep America safe,” said TRICIA McLAUGHLIN, who predicted appellate courts would side with the administration.

The Justice Department echoed DHS, saying “President Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda is a top national security priority that this Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend whenever challenged in court.”

But federal judges have explicitly rejected the immigration court’s position, saying it flies in the face of decades of precedent.

In recent days, the response from the courts has been deafening. The new detention policy, judges repeatedly ruled, has ripped parents from U.S. citizen spouses and children and subjected them to abrupt transfers all over the country on flimsy, untested legal grounds.

“The overwhelming majority of district courts across the country, including this Court, that have considered [the Trump administration’s] new statutory interpretation have found it incorrect and unlawful,” ruled U.S. District Judge RICHARD BOULWARE, a BARACK OBAMA appointee.

The Trump administration contends that the new detention policy is a better reading of immigration law that no administration had adopted. Anyone in the U.S. who is an “applicant for admission” to the country is subject to “mandatory detention,” ICE argues. Though previous administrations considered only those arriving at the border or seeking permission to enter as “applicants for admission,” the Trump administration says the label applies to anyone residing in the United States, no matter how long they have lived here.

But courts across the country say this is a misreading that has resulted in abuses. Those who have lived in the U.S. are not “applicants for admission” under the law and must be given an opportunity to contest their detention before an immigration judge or federal court, they say.

According to POLITICO’s analysis, the bulk of rulings against the Trump administration’s position has come from judges appointed by Democratic Presidents JOE BIDEN (50), Obama (31) and Clinton (6). But the decisions have been resoundingly adopted across political lines. Judges appointed by Republican presidents — Trump (12), GEORGE W. BUSH (12), GEORGE H.W. BUSH (1) and Reagan (2) — have reached the same conclusions.

Only two judges, meanwhile, have adopted the administration’s position: one appointed by Obama and another by Trump.

The lopsided results have outpaced another similar wave of legal rebukes by federal district courts over the administration’s decision to threaten the legal status of thousands of foreign students studying at American schools. The legal pushback led the administration to withdraw its policy.

Despite the overwhelming consensus in the detention cases, the administration is pinning its hopes on appellate courts to reverse the tide. The Justice Department, in recent days, has begun appealing many of the adverse decisions.

POTUS PUZZLER

Which former president is known to haunt the White House?

(Answer at bottom.)

The Oval

HOCUS POTUS: On Thursday, the president and first lady MELANIA TRUMP participated in this year’s annual White House Halloween celebration, greeting children of administration officials and guests dressed in their spooky best.

Our ALEX GANGITANO has the dispatch:

Some attendees came through the trick-or-treat line, including STEPHEN and KATIE MILLER and their two young children, one dressed as a ghost and the other in a skeleton ensemble matching mom’s. Press secretary KAROLINE LEAVITT, her husband, NICHOLAS RICCIO, and their baby pumpkin also got candy from Trump.

There were a few repeat Spidermans, ghosts, NASCAR drivers, HARRY POTTER and Toy Story characters, plus a variety of bugs.

Some kids went all out — one dressed as a McDonald’s drive thru with two very small employees — while others sported costumes like a Secret Service agent, a banana, a recycling workers sibling duo, an American flag firecracker and an infant in an old-school pilot outfit.

Additionally, there were twins from the STEPHEN KING classic “The Shining,” UNCLE SAM, a costume made to look like a child sitting on a toilet with “wide load” written on it (Trump seemed perplexed), a costume of a kid riding a dinosaur — and a young duo of very hungry caterpillars.

The president and first lady (not in costume) handed out large candy bars and stopped and chatted with several of the families as they came through, though it was out of earshot from the media.

And yes, Trump put another chocolate bar on a child’s head.

If anyone would like to submit their costumes for judgment, our tip line (westwingtips@politico.com) is very, very open.

LEAVING A STATEMENT: Should we be seeing pictures of the president’s personal bathroom? Well, erm, you can decide that.

But this afternoon, Trump announced on Truth Social that he has renovated the White House’s Lincoln bathroom, our FAITH WARDWELL reports. “It was renovated in the 1940s in an art deco green tile style, which was totally inappropriate for the Lincoln Era,” Trump wrote in the post. “I did it in black and white polished Statuary marble. This was very appropriate for the time of Abraham Lincoln and, in fact, could be the marble that was originally there!”

Out with the art deco green, in with the marble and gold.

Musk Radar

ELON CASHES IN: ELON MUSK’s SpaceX is set to receive $2 billion to develop satellites that can track missiles and aircraft under Trump’s Golden Dome defense project, WSJ’s DREW FITZGERALD and MICAH MAIDENBERG report. The funding was included in the spending megabill that Trump signed in July, but wasn’t publicly linked to a contractor. The planned “air moving target indicator” system could eventually field as many as 600 satellites, people familiar with the matter told the Journal.

SpaceX is expected to play a major role in two other Pentagon satellite networks, according to the people. One, called Milnet, would relay sensitive military communications, while the other involves satellites capable of tracking vehicles on the ground.

WHO'S IN, WHO’S OUT

STAY TUNED: EPA Administrator LEE ZELDIN said today that his agency is preparing to issue a major new round of furloughs as the shutdown heads into its second month, our ANNIE SNIDER reports. The agency’s official shutdown plan calls for 89 percent of staff to be furloughed in the absence of appropriations, but so far the administration has been taking a nontraditional approach, selectively furloughing staffers and conserving carry-over funds for “priority” staff.

“Tomorrow we will be looking at, unfortunately, having to implement that next round of furlough, and the impacts on our efforts inside our agencies are significant,” he said following the G7 Energy Ministers’ meeting in Toronto.

More than 4,000 of EPA’s roughly 15,000 workers have thus far been furloughed.

Agenda Setting

I’LL PASS: Since Trump took over the iconic Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in February, he and the executive he installed there have repeatedly bashed the center’s prior leadership for running the place into the ground — including by not selling enough tickets. “We had spent way too much on programming that doesn’t bring in any revenue,” RICHARD GRENELL, a Trump ally and former ambassador to Germany, told the Washington Reporter in March. According to Grenell, the center hadn’t been making any money.

Nearly nine months after Trump became chair of the center and more than a month into its main season, ticket sales for the Kennedy Center’s three largest performance venues are the worst they’ve been in years, according to a Washington Post analysis of ticketing data from dozens of recent shows as well as past seasons. According to the Post, tens of thousands of seats have been left empty.

The Kennedy Center did not respond to the Post for comment.

POTUS PUZZLER ANSWER

Former President ABRAHAM LINCOLN was known to haunt the White House following his death, with staff, presidents, first ladies and foreign dignitaries all claiming to have encountered him, mostly around the Lincoln Bedroom and the Yellow Oval Room, both of which were part of his old office suite.

Former first lady GRACE COOLIDGE reported seeing him standing at a window in the Oval Office, hands clasped behind his back, looking out toward the Potomac. Former British Prime Minister WINSTON CHURCHILL said he witnessed our former president’s ghost while staying in the Lincoln Bedroom during World War II.

Having just stepped out of the bath, cigar in hand, Churchill claimed he saw Lincoln leaning on the fireplace mantel. Churchill supposedly said, “Good evening, Mr. President. You seem to have me at a disadvantage,” before calmly exiting.

“The fact is: Funding exists to keep SNAP benefits flowing, and President Trump has instead chosen to force millions of Americans to go hungry.” Maya Shwayder contributed reporting from Boston.","The disruptions followed a chaotic night of air travel on Thursday, when the F.A.A. stated that no certified controllers were expected to show up for the evening shift at Orlando International Airport, forcing the agency to take contingency measures that caused spillover delays at airports along the East Coast. It was not clear whether staffing conditions would worsen throughout the afternoon and evening on Friday, normally a relatively busy time for airports as people travel for the weekend.

The growing problems, unfolding just days after the controllers missed their first full paycheck because of the shutdown, after receiving a partial paycheck two weeks ago, appeared to prompt the union representing controllers to take the rare step of endorsing one party’s preferred approach to ending the impasse.

“Congress must pass a clean continuing resolution (CR) to immediately end the government shutdown, ensure that all individuals who have not been paid during this prolonged closure receive their compensation, and then engage in bipartisan negotiations on other pressing issues facing our nation,” Nick Daniels, the president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, said in a statement, effectively endorsing Republicans’ approach.

Democrats have insisted that any bill to reopen the government include an extension of pandemic-era subsidies for people who purchase health insurance on public exchanges, to keep costs to consumers from rising significantly.

The F.A.A.’s work force of approximately 11,000 certified air traffic controllers has risen to uncommon prominence during the federal government shutdown, now the second-longest on record and entering its second month. Senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly highlighted the plight of controllers, who were already working overtime shifts to make up for severe staffing shortages before the shutdown began, and have gone unpaid through for weeks even as they are required to continue showing up to work. That combination, officials said, has left many strapped for cash and forced to take on side jobs to make ends meet, particularly since Tuesday, their first full missed payday.

On Thursday, Vice President JD Vance and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy warned that flight delays would increase and that passengers’ ability to reach their destinations would become more tenuous if the shutdown continued into November, when holiday travel picks up. Those comments came two days after the head of the air traffic controllers’ union said the stresses on his members were making the nation’s air travel system “less safe.”

The coming seasonal increase in flights and the onset of wintry weather would put additional stressors on the already overtaxed controllers at the same time as the financial crunch of the shutdown would become untenable for them, officials said. Mr. Duffy has said on multiple occasions this week that while some controllers may have enough savings to weather one missed paycheck, few would have the resources to get through a second missed check.

Controllers took their message to the public this week, fanning out over a number of major airports to distribute leaflets encouraging travelers to press their congressional representatives for an end to the impasse. Mr. Daniels, who has made joint appearances with Mr. Duffy this month, has rejected suggestions that controllers would take matters into their own hands by refusing to show up for work, stressing that such collective action would be illegal.

The F.A.A. imposes flight restrictions when air traffic facilities hit “staffing triggers” — thresholds at which the agency considers control towers to be insufficiently staffed to meet the needs of previously scheduled traffic. Because the F.A.A. currently has about 3,000 vacant controller positions, many towers operate very close to the margin of a staffing trigger. That means that any unexpected absence — whether because of illness, or a concern specific to the shutdown — can force the agency to slow or stop traffic, resulting in compound delays.

While the F.A.A. has not published a reason for Friday’s absences, experts said the spread of the delays appeared to be organic.

“The impact is growing over time with more ground delay programs due to staffing,” said Michael McCormick, a professor of air traffic management at Embry‑Riddle Aeronautical University. “But I do not see any signs of organized activity for a slowdown.”

Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota and the majority leader, has made preserving the legislative filibuster a central tenet of his tenure, though he has already weakened it with a rules change to speed confirmations and by stretching the reach of special filibuster-proof tax and spending bills, among other steps.

Earlier this month, Mr. Thune reiterated that he would oppose a change that would enable Republicans to bulldoze past Democratic opposition and pass a stopgap spending bill on a simple majority vote. But he has come under mounting pressure from some on the right, including Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican of Georgia.

A Thune spokesman said on Friday that, “Leader Thune’s position on the importance of the legislative filibuster is unchanged.”

Even if he tried to get rid of the filibuster to appease Mr. Trump, Mr. Thune might lack the votes to do so. Multiple Senate Republicans have indicated an unwillingness to overturn the 60-vote legislative threshold using what is known as the “nuclear option,” in which the majority party changes the chamber’s rules with a simple majority, party-line vote.

Mr. Trump was adamant as he returned from his trip to Asia, urging Mr. Thune and his colleagues to act.

“It is now time for the Republicans to play their “TRUMP CARD,” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Under the current rules, at least 60 senators must agree to a final vote on any major legislation, including a spending bill that would reopen the government. Republicans hold 53 seats, and three Democratic-aligned senators have consistently joined them in voting to advance a stopgap spending bill, while one of their own, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, has repeatedly voted no. Without more defections, Republicans remain short of the 60-vote margin, prompting Mr. Trump’s push to rewrite the rules.

Advocates of doing so have argued that the change could be written narrowly to cover specific bills. But in reality, any change in the filibuster rules in the Senate, which operates according to precedent, would effectively end it for all bills. Opponents have suggested it would be a drastic move for such a limited win as a stopgap spending bill.

The president pushed multiple times during his first term to neuter the filibuster when Republicans controlled Congress. But Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who was the majority leader at the time, refused. Mr. McConnell had made deploying the filibuster against Democrats a hallmark of his career.

Senate Democrats in 2022 sought to end the 60-vote threshold on election-related measures but came up short when two of their members, Senators Joe Manchin III of West of Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, sided with Republicans against changing the rules.

“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” he said, in blunt criticism of the United States. “The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”

Mr. Türk’s statement has more symbolic power than direct influence over the actions of the United States, which is a permanent member of the U.N Security Council. But the forceful condemnation offers fodder for the criticism of the Trump administration’s policy from Democrats and civil society groups.

President Trump authorized the strikes, and his administration has told Congress that the United States was engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels that it has declared to be terrorist organizations.

But the administration has presented little evidence to support its claims, and specialists in the laws of war and executive power say he has used the military in a way that had no clear legal precedent or basis. Mr. Türk’s office said it had no credible evidence of a confrontation with the cartels that met the criteria of armed conflict under international law.

In early October, Mr. Türk wrote in a letter to the U.S. government that countering drug trafficking was a law enforcement issue and lethal force was only justified as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life.

“Based on the very sparse information provided publicly by the U.S. authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to the lives of others or otherwise justified the use of lethal armed force against them under international law,” Mr. Türk said.

But it remained unclear if or when food stamps would actually reach the roughly 42 million people who rely on monthly federal help to purchase groceries. It was also unclear the exact amounts that they would receive. Lawyers for the Trump administration had previously suggested it could take weeks to disburse benefits, and the Justice Department could still try to appeal in the case, perhaps further delaying aid.

A spokesman for the agency and a spokeswoman for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The legal wrangling concerned the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Without a last-minute intervention, the decades-old safety net program is set to run out of funds on Saturday, exacting a substantial economic toll on families more than four weeks into a shutdown seemingly without an end in sight.

Despite the imminent lapse, the Trump administration had maintained that it would not try to cover the shortfall, not even by using billions of dollars that Congress had previously set aside for SNAP to address possible emergencies. That triggered a series of lawsuits, as state and local officials, nonprofits and others argued that the White House had a legal and moral obligation to provide the benefits.

In one of the cases, Judge John J. McConnell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, ordered on Friday that the Trump administration “must distribute the contingency money timely, or as soon as possible, for the Nov. 1 payments to be made.”

His order came shortly after another federal court in Massachusetts handed an early victory to about two dozen states, which similarly had sued to force the release of food stamp funding.

In that case, Judge Indira Talwani, of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, found that the decision to halt SNAP benefits was “unlawful.” She required the administration to explain by Monday how it would fund aid in November.

“Congress has put money in an emergency fund,” Judge Talwani said during a hearing in the case this week. “It’s hard for me to understand how this isn’t an emergency, when there’s no money and a lot of people are needing their SNAP benefits.”

The twin court defeats nonetheless amounted to a major rebuke of the White House, where President Trump’s leading deputies have maintained that they could do little to save SNAP — even after taking unusual steps to rearrange the budget to sustain other programs while the government remained closed.

“The American people are already suffering, and the suffering is going to get a lot worse,” Vice President JD Vance said on Thursday, insisting that Mr. Trump had “tried to do everything” in his power to make the shutdown as “unpainless as possible.”

With SNAP, the potential loss of federal aid risked severe financial distress for the roughly one in eight Americans enrolled in the program. Fearing the end of federal support, a handful of states had scrounged in recent days to provide food stamps on their own, though many said that they could only provision aid for a few days or weeks.

The SNAP benefits, which average around $187 a month per recipient, cost the federal government about $8 billion monthly, which lawmakers must regularly replenish as part of their work to fund the government. But the program also maintains a reserve in case of emergencies or shortfalls, which many Democrats and Republicans have encouraged the Trump administration to tap during the shutdown. That reserve currently stands at about $5 billion, enough to provide at least partial payments next month.

The Agriculture Department initially said it would use that money if the government remained closed, but reversed its policy in late October, saying that it could not legally drain the available reserves except in response to natural disasters. At a news conference Friday on Capitol Hill, Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, argued that the emergency fund was “only allowed to flow if the underlying program is funded” by Congress.

Democrats largely rejected her interpretation of the law. The agency’s moves also prompted a series of lawsuits, including one filed by cities and nonprofit groups, who argued that the White House had “needlessly plunged SNAP into crisis.”

“Where there are appropriated funds available, benefits have to be furnished. And in this case, appropriated funds are available,” said Michael Torcello, a lawyer representing the groups that sued, during a hearing on Friday.

Officials in Arizona, California, New York, Massachusetts, Nevada and other states filed their own lawsuit earlier this week. Michelle Pascucci, a lawyer for the attorney general of Massachusetts who represented the states, told Judge Talwani at a hearing on Thursday that the loss of SNAP benefits could prove dire.

“Millions of Americans will lose the benefits they’ve had for decades,” she said.

In filings submitted ahead of the hearing, the Trump administration reaffirmed its opposition to using the emergency funds, even as it acknowledged it had ample leftover money there and in other accounts to spare millions of people from benefit cuts. Officials told the court that the law did not allow them to transfer or spend the cash absent a clear directive from Congress.

“What a sick joke,” said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee. “The fact is: Funding exists to keep SNAP benefits flowing, and President Trump has instead chosen to force millions of Americans to go hungry.”

At the same time, healthcare costs for millions will skyrocket.

That means that children across the country would go to bed hungry and families will be thrown off their healthcare plans — for no reason at all.

Funding for SNAP is set to expire tomorrow.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is sitting on billions of dollars of contingency funding to maintain SNAP benefits through November. This money was appropriated by Congress to ensure SNAP benefits would continue in the event of a prolonged shutdown.

The Trump administration could stop millions of kids from going hungry. They simply refused to do so. Just this afternoon, a court ruled that the administration must use this funding.

Also starting tomorrow, millions of people will begin shopping for their health insurance plans, only to find that their premiums have surged. For many, insurance will become unaffordable, meaning they will be forced to go without healthcare.

Subsidies under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire, and the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have refused to extend them. This is the primary issue behind the ongoing shutdown.

Let’s take a step back. As FCNL’s Bridget Moix said earlier this month, the United States is facing another “moment of moral reckoning.”

In the wealthiest nation in the world, all people – all children – should have enough food to eat.

All people should be able to receive the healthcare that they need.

All people should be able to live lives of dignity and joy.

All people should be able to thrive and fulfill their potential.

What kind of country do we want to be? With the basic dignity of so many people on the line, that is the question our leaders in Washington need to answer right now.

Elsewhere

We can’t risk a nuclear arms race

In a strange social media post, President Trump announced that the U.S. will “start testing our Nuclear Weapons” for the first time in more than 30 years, falsely claiming that other nations have resumed testing. Nuclear testing is unnecessary, deeply harmful, and raises the risks of a nuclear arms race.

There are fewer than 100 days left until the end of New START, the last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between the U.S. and Russia. FCNL joined a week of action to urge Congress to act swiftly to make sure the world isn’t plunged into a dangerous and expensive arms race.

Dramatic cut to refugee admissions

The Trump administration announced that the U.S. would only accept 7,500 new refugees in the coming year, with a focus on Afrikaners from South Africa. As FCNL’s Bridget Moix put it, “This Presidential Determination represents a deplorable shift in American history. We will miss out on the vibrancy, resilience, and joy of our refugee brothers and sisters from all walks of life.””

Ongoing Genocide in Sudan

This week, we saw a devastating escalation in the conflict and in Sudan. The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) captured El Fasher from the Sudanese Armed Forces. Atrocities have followed in the city, with reports of mass murders and extensive war crimes.

Congressional leaders have begun to condemn the violence and have called for accountability and safety for civilians. But the U.S. government needs to act swiftly to help stop these atrocities. That means holding the UAE accountable for arming the RSF, and surging U.S. aid to those in dire need. Join us and ask your members of Congress to speak up and to act!

Threatened attacks on military targets in Venezuela

The Trump administration may soon launch attacks at military targets within Venezuela, perhaps as a prelude to attempted regime change against the Maduro government. This comes as the U.S. government continues to murder people in boats in Latin America. The death toll is now over 60.

FCNL is lobbying Congress to assert their constitutional authority to stop this violence and reject this rush to war. Tell the Senate to stop Trump’s murder on the high seas!

(WLS) -- An emergency proposed class-action lawsuit has been filed against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) over ""abusive and cruel"" conditions for people who have been detained and held inside Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)'s processing center in the village of Broadview.

Following a Friday afternoon court hearing, a federal judge set a hearing for Tuesday, Nov. 4 to discuss several emergency motions before the court over improving conditions at facility, noting that the allegations raised ""require immediate attention.""

ABC7 Chicago is now streaming 24/7. Click here to watch

The ICE processing facility has been the target of controversy and the community's ire over enhanced immigration enforcement - codenamed ""Operation Midway Blitz"" - that has resulted in thousands arrested by federal agents.

Most of those people arrested by immigration agents pass through the Broadview processing center, which attorneys say was never meant to be a ""longer-term detention facility"" but now DHS is allegedly ""warehousing people at Broadview for days on end,"" transforming it into a ""de facto detention center.""

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two people - Pablo Moreno Gonzalez and Felipe Agustin Zamacona -- who were detained by ICE since Oct. 29 and were held at the Broadview facility. At a Friday court hearing in the case, an attorney representing the government said both men have already been transferred to a detention facility in Kansas.

U.S. District Judge Robert Gettleman ordered both Gonzalez and Zamacona to be returned to the Chicago-area ""as quickly as possible,"" ahead of Tuesday's hearing.

Attorneys with the ACLU of Illinois, the MacArthur Justice Center, and the Chicago office of Eimer Stahl allege ICE agents have denied people held at the Broadview facility private calls with attorneys and have blocked members of Congress, faith leaders and journalists from entering the building, creating a ""black box"" they say has allowed authorities to act ""with impunity.""

Agents have also allegedly coerced people held at the processing center to sign paperwork they don't understand, leading them to unknowingly relinquish their rights and face deportation, according to the lawsuit.

""The conditions are horrific, and everyone is experiencing some form of degradation, just deplorable everyday conditions and lack of necessities,"" Alexa Van Brunt, lead attorney on the case with the MacArthur Justice Center, told the I-Team.

""There's not enough food; there's certainly not enough water. There's not free access to potable water,"" Van Brunt said. ""So many, many people have described just the overwhelming thirst, overwhelming hunger, and if you have a medical condition or religious practice that forbids you from eating what they offer, there's no alternative.""

Attorneys accuse ICE, DHS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection of violating detainees' First Amendment right to speak to an attorney, Fifth Amendment right to due process and Sixth Amendment right to legal counsel.

The lawsuit included several emergency motions for a judge to consider forcing the federal agencies to improve the facility's conditions.

""It is supposed to be holding people for 12 hours or less,"" Van Brunt told the I-Team. ""It is now holding people for up to a week.""

According to the lawsuit, one person was held at the Broadview facility for three weeks.

Advocates have for months raised concerns about conditions inside the facility, which has drawn scrutiny from members of Congress, political candidates and activist groups. Lawyers and relatives of people held at the facility have called it a de facto detention center, where up to 200 people have been held at a time without access to legal counsel.

""There are serious privacy concerns. The holding cells are open to the people of both genders inside the facility,"" Van Brunt explained. ""So as a result, men can watch women use the restroom. Women can watch men, and the guards can watch everybody. It raises a real concern for safety and security.""

The ABC7 I-Team recently reported on allegations of deteriorating conditions inside the Broadview facility, with one attorney writing in a court declaration, ""Broadview is a black hole. When my clients are there, I am unable to speak to them or contact them.""

DHS officials have continued to vigorously dismiss these allegations surrounding the Broadview facility.

""Any claims there are subprime conditions at the Broadview ICE facility are false. All detainees are provided with 3 meals a day, water, and have access to phones to communicate with their family members and lawyers. No one is denied access to proper medical care. There is a privacy wall around the toilet for detainees,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, in part.

""As ICE arrests and removes criminal illegal aliens and public safety threats from the U.S., the agency has worked diligently to obtain greater necessary detention space while avoiding overcrowding,"" McLaughlin said. ""Further, Broadview is a processing center, not a detention center. Detainees are briefly processed before being transferred to detention facilities.""

Van Brunt and other attorneys say the evidence they have gathered shows that's not the case.

At Friday's court hearing, Van Brunt called the situation at Broadview, ""a human rights emergency... a problem entirely of the defendants' own making.""

""ICE's own standards require them to have certain amount of food for people, certain sleeping facilities, certain drinking water and certainly medical care, and they are certainly not allowed to threaten or coerce people to sign documents against their will,"" Van Brunt said. ""ICE is violating all of these procedures.""

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin and other lawmakers recently were turned away from the facility after requesting tours to see the conditions inside.

At a news conference on Friday, Durbin said the facility was never designed to hold people longer than a few hours.

""I never envisioned it as a detention facility. There weren't enough cells, restrooms, but that's what's happening,"" Durbin said. ""I have to tell you, my only knowledge of that is second hand. They will not let us in. They won't answer questions. They literally will not tell us who's there and how long they've been held.""

Durbin added, ""Every single day our office gets a call from people saying, 'We've lost a parent,' 'We've lost a brother,'... We spend hours and hours trying to find out [ and ] some of them are in Broadview.""

Durbin, along with a group of local Catholic nuns, would often hold prayer services for the people detained and workers at the Broadview ICE facility.

Sister JoAnn Persch told the I-Team she has provided religious counsel to people detained by ICE at Broadview for more than ten years and knowing what the inside of the facility looks like, she's concerned with how many people are being held there.

""There are no beds being a processing center. No showers, no doors,"" Persch told the I-Team. ""And there aren't that many toilets in there... I just think it's very inhumane, very disrespectful.""

""It just makes me furious to hear people say they're Christian, but they can treat human beings like they're being treated,"" Persch said.

The Department of Homeland Security says it intends to add state driver’s license information to a swiftly expanding federal system envisioned as a one-stop shop for checking citizenship.

The plan, outlined in a public notice posted Thursday, is the latest step in an unprecedented Trump administration initiative to pool confidential data from varied sources that it claims will help identify noncitizens on voter rolls, tighten immigration enforcement and expose public benefit fraud.

According to emails obtained by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune, DHS approached Texas officials in June about a pilot program to add the state’s driver license data, but it’s not clear if the state participated.

Earlier this year, DHS added millions of Americans’ Social Security data to the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, system, allowing officials to use the tool to conduct bulk searches of voter rolls for the first time. According to the document filed Thursday, SAVE also recently expanded to include passport and visa information.

Incorporating driver’s license information would allow election officials whose rolls don’t include voters’ Social Security numbers to conduct bulk searches by driver’s license number. Ultimately, the system would link these two crucial identifiers for the purpose of citizenship checks, said Michael Morse, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

“It is the key that unlocks everything,” Morse said.

State driver’s license databases often include a variety of sensitive information on drivers, including place of birth, passport number, biometrics, address, email and employment information, said Claire Jeffrey, a spokesperson for the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators.

Beyond the privacy concerns this creates, using driver’s license numbers in SAVE could lead to citizens being wrongly flagged as noncitizens, said Rachel Orey, director of the elections project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Driver’s license numbers are sometimes reused and people can have licenses in multiple states. Also, if SAVE isn’t linked to live versions of state driver’s license databases, the information in the system will be outdated.

“This could have far-reaching consequences for voter access and public trust if inaccurate data were used to question eligibility or citizenship,” Orey said.

DHS says in the notice that linking to driver’s license data, which it calls the most widely used form of identification, “will allow SAVE to match against other sources to verify immigration status and U.S. citizenship, which will improve accuracy and efficiency for SAVE user agencies.”

The department did not respond to questions about the expansion.

Up until this year, SAVE was mostly used to check individual immigrants’ citizenship status when they applied for public benefits. DHS has said the aim in expanding the system was to enable election officials to check voter rolls en masse. But the agency’s data-sharing agreement with the Social Security Administration as well as Thursday’s disclosure make clear that DHS and other agencies can use SAVE for other purposes, including for immigration enforcement investigations.

Information uploaded into the system by state and local election officials and other users will be saved and may be “shared with other DHS Components that have a need to know of the information to carry out their national security, law enforcement, immigration, intelligence, or other homeland security functions,” the notice explains.

Advocacy groups have sued the federal government claiming the pooling of data in SAVE violates the Privacy Act, which is meant to prevent misuse of private data. In filings, the government has said that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 explicitly allows information sharing to verify citizenship status and that DHS would exercise caution in flagging voters as potential noncitizens.

Some privacy lawyers called DHS’ move to add driver’s license information more evidence of federal overreach. “The administration wants to get as much data as it can, however it can, whenever it can,” said Justin Levitt, a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.

The DHS notice, known as a system of records notice, allows for public comment on several aspects of SAVE’s expansion, including some already completed. Typically, such notices are filed when agencies propose changes to federal systems, and the comments are meant to inform how officials go forward. That didn’t happen in this case.

In June, email records show, DHS asked the Texas Department of Public Safety, which issues driver’s licenses and ID cards, to partner on a pilot program to add its data into SAVE.

Timothy Benz of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the branch of DHS that oversees SAVE, wrote that the planned expansion was part of the “evolution” of SAVE into a “one-stop shop for all election agency verification needs.”

“That would require collaboration with each states’ DL agency in order for us to query those DL records in order to provide that information to the querying elections agency,” Benz wrote.

Rebekah Hibbs, a supervisor in the Texas Department of Public Safety’s driver’s license division, replied that DPS is “always happy” to support the SAVE tool and agreed to talk again with USCIS.

It’s not clear what happened next. In response to questions from ProPublica and the Tribune, DPS spokesperson Sheridan Nolen said the “department does not have any ongoing projects with USCIS related to driver record information for registered voters, nor have we been asked to provide that information.”

She did not answer questions about whether DPS has given any data to USCIS. DHS did not respond to questions about whether the partnership moved forward.

Texas Secretary of State Jane Nelson announced Oct. 20 that her office had run the state’s entire voter roll through SAVE. Alicia Pierce, Nelson’s spokesperson, said the office did the check using full Social Security numbers, which it routinely obtains from the Department of Public Safety to match with registered voters.

The results showed that around 0.015% of Texas voters, or 2,724 people, are potentially noncitizens.

At least one Texas official is concerned that those initial SAVE results may not be accurate. In a court filing submitted Wednesday as part of the Privacy Act litigation, Travis County voter registration director Christopher Davis wrote that state data shows about 25% of the voters that SAVE flagged as potential noncitizens in the county had provided proof of citizenship when registering to vote.

“I am concerned that the list Travis County received from the Secretary of State is flawed and worry about the potential for voters to be improperly cancelled from the voter rolls and possibly disenfranchised as a result,” Davis’ filing says.

So the NANA dividend is paid twice a year.","Northwest Alaska's NANA Regional Corporation is a major player in government contracts for immigration detention facilities.

As the Trump administration's immigration crackdown continues, allegations of human rights abuses have led calls from some NANA shareholders to get out of the immigrant detention business.

As an Alaska Native corporation, NANA is able to pursue the contracts as a small or disadvantaged business under what's known as the 8(a) program.

Bloomberg Businessweek, working with Kotzebue radio station KOTZ, found NANA held nearly 58.1% of ICE's 8(a) contracts over the past decade, a period during which it raked in about $1.2 billion.

As some NANA shareholders told Bloomberg reporter Polly Mosendz and KOTZ reporter Desiree Hagen, that financial payoff is not worth the human toll.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Desiree Hagen: Between the two of us, we interviewed nearly two dozen shareholders, and one of the most common things that I heard was that this goes against our Iñupiaq values, Iñupiat illitqusait, which is like 17 values that range from, you know, respect for others, cooperation, respect for elders.

Another thing that we heard was that maybe NANA was not communicating this. A few shareholders said, ""This was the first time we've heard about it,"" or, ""We're just learning about this,"" which was kind of calling into question the corporate transparency.

Polly Mosendz: Yeah, I think that's an excellent point. I think there were a lot of people who sort of asked us, ""Well, where can I find this in the shareholder report? Where has this been disclosed by the company?"" And pretty consistently, we would have to say that it's just not really been a matter of profound disclosure. If you look at the annual report, you certainly wouldn't get the impression that this is a detention center giant.

Casey Grove: There's a chart in the story that shows that NANA has a huge proportion of these type of contracts, compared to other Alaska Native corporations. Is there something about how 8(a) contracting works that lends itself to getting ICE contracts?

PM: Just to kind of give a size and scope, the value of NANA's ICE contracts this year is approaching $300 million, which is an increase of about $100 million over last year. So that is substantial for any company. And one thing to keep in mind is that regardless of how big NANA gets, it still qualifies for the set-aside contracts under 8(a), and that is unique. You know, other small businesses, disadvantaged businesses, can kind of scale out of being 8(a) contractors. That is not the case with Alaska Native corps, and that is unique. So even a multi-billion-dollar company like we're talking about here is still going to qualify for those set asides. And that is, you know, that can be really lucrative, that can be a really serious advantage.

DH: So it was like NANA is a medium-sized fish in a smaller bowl, as opposed to being in a bowl full of large fishes.

CG: Well, I mean, for that money, then, what are NANA shareholders getting out of it?

PM: Yeah, let's talk about the dividend a little bit. So the NANA dividend is paid twice a year. There was one that was about $8 (per share). There's one coming up, it's gonna be about $20 per share. And while NANA doesn't disclose the median quantity of shares that a shareholder might have, an average that we were able to deduce based on the quantity of shares outstanding, to the approximation of how many shareholders there are, would be about 117.

So for this year, you're looking at about $3,300 a person. And one shareholder who we interviewed, David Leslie, basically made the argument that he feels like the company is complicit in a human rights violation, and it's not quite enough money per dividend to pay his rent with it. So he was frustrated with the dividend.

On the flip side, there's other shareholders who we spoke with who said, you know, the dividend is helpful to them, and that they also wanted to take into account the other elements of support that NANA was providing, like, for example, fuel subsidies. That's something that came up a lot.

So I think that the dividend can be controversial. Some people think that they are being paid a fair amount, and some people feel like, no, it isn't enough. So I don't think that there is agreement. And frankly, I think any 15,000 people who you poll on such a matter would probably have natural disagreements on whether they thought that the dividend was fair.

DH: I would say that NANA does do a lot for the region. Just in the course of reporting, I'm keeping track of how much money is going to, let's say, you know, this renewable energy project, which is something that we just heard. You know, oh, there's another $5 million that Nana is contributing. So there are contributions, but echoing what Polly said, we heard a lot of different things about how people felt about their dividend and how NANA was contributing to the communities.

CG: Well, speaking of some of the things that shareholders told you that they considered to be human rights abuses and stories that we've heard coming out of these detention facilities, what did NANA say in response to these, either these allegations or questions from their own shareholders?

PM: While NANA did not respond to us in the course of reporting this story, they did send a letter earlier this summer specifically to a shareholder who had asked them about these contracts, and in that letter, they had denied some of the media reports and they felt that these contracts did uphold their community's values.

They had also made a reference to site visits. We don't know what those site visits might have consisted of, where they might have gone, or who went, or what they were allowed to see, but that was what they had said sort of privately, and we have not heard from the company since the article was publicized.

CG: Where does this go from here? The story leaves off sounding like NANA is not going to be shying away from these contracts in the future.

PM: Yeah, I think we genuinely can't know. What we do know is that the federal government has clearly made this a mission. The president campaigned on this. This is a notable campaign promise that he made. It was a landmark part of his first administration, and it seems like it's an even more committed to part of this administration the second go around.

So I think that what we do know is that the federal government is extremely focused on this, and historically, they do use contractors to hold people in these facilities. And, you know, with $45 billion released for this administration's deportation, detention plan broadly, I think we know that this is work that someone is going to do, whether NANA is going to do it, or another Alaska Native corp, we don't know. We can't know, but there is going to be a lot of money when the government eventually reopens with which to do this work.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/453838f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3456x1814+0+245/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F06%2FIMG_9260.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 18:03:12.151717

""We can debate immigration policy but there is no debating the denial of legal rights and holding those detained in conditions that are not only unlawful but inhumane.","Oct. 31 (UPI) -- The American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois sued the Trump administration Friday for allegedly violating the civil rights of those detained in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Ill.

The suit, which includes lawyers for the MacArthur Justice Center, the ACLU of Illinois and the Chicago law office of Eimer Stahl, was filed in federal court in Chicago, a press release said.

The suit demands that Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, and ICE ""stop flouting the law inside Broadview."" The press release said the agencies ""must obey the Constitution and provide the people they detain with ready access to counsel and humane conditions of confinement.""

Since the beginning of Operation Midway Blitz on Sept. 8, in which federal agents increased actions against undocumented immigrants in and around Chicago, protests and legal battles have ensued. On Tuesday, a judge issued a temporary restraining order on Gregory Bovino, a U.S. border patrol commander, after video footage showed Bovino throwing tear gas into a crowd during public demonstrations in Chicago and outside of the Broadview detention center. Clergy members, media groups and protesters had filed a suit alleging a ""pattern of extreme brutality"" intended to ""silence the press"" and American citizens.

Judge Sara Ellis ordered all agents to wear body cameras. She also ordered Bovino to check in with her daily, but an appeals court overturned that requirement.

""Everyone, no matter their legal status, has the right to access counsel and to not be subject to horrific and inhumane conditions,"" said Alexa Van Brunt, director of the MacArthur Justice Center's Illinois office and lead counsel on the suit, in a statement. ""Community members are being kidnapped off the streets, packed in hold cells, denied food, medical care, and basic necessities, and forced to sign away their legal rights. This is a vicious abuse of power and gross violation of basic human rights by ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. It must end now.""

The press release said that agents at Broadview ""have treated detainees abhorrently, depriving them of sleep, privacy, menstrual products, and the ability to shower."" Agents have repeatedly denied entry for attorneys, members of Congress, and religious and faith leaders, it said.

DHS has not responded to the suit or its allegations.

""This lawsuit is necessary because the Trump administration has attempted to evade accountability for turning the processing center at Broadview into a de facto detention center,"" said Kevin Fee, legal director for the ACLU of Illinois, in a statement. ""DHS personnel have denied access to counsel, legislators and journalists so that the harsh and deteriorating conditions at the facility can be shielded from public view. These conditions are unconstitutional and threaten to coerce people into sacrificing their rights without the benefit of legal advice and a full airing of their legal defenses.""

Lawyer Nate Eimer emphasized the importance of access to a lawyer.

""Access to counsel is not a privilege. It is a right,"" Eimer, partner at Eimer Stahl and co-counsel in the lawsuit, said in a statement. ""We can debate immigration policy but there is no debating the denial of legal rights and holding those detained in conditions that are not only unlawful but inhumane.

According to The Washington Post, officials say that the possible violations were reported by the State Department’s watchdog, known as the Office of Inspector General.
Indeed, the U.S. maintains a different process for assessing potential Israeli violations, which is distinct from that of any other country.
Tellingly, though it has existed since 2020, the Israeli Leahy Vetting Forum has never found an Israeli unit to be ineligible for receiving U.S. assistance, former State Department officials have reported.
Blaha said that the U.S. has consistently sought to give Israel a pass across administrations, amid its genocide in Gaza.","A classified State Department report released just days before the current ceasefire agreement went into effect found that Israel has committed “many hundreds” of potential human rights violations in Gaza that would render it illegal to continue sending weapons to many Israeli military units, reporting finds.

According to The Washington Post, officials say that the possible violations were reported by the State Department’s watchdog, known as the Office of Inspector General. These reports would take “multiple years” to investigate, officials told the Post, as former officials have noted that the U.S. maintains a special process for potential Israeli violations to give preference to the Israeli military.

The office’s website has a page for the report, but it is listed as “Classified” and “not available for public viewing.”

The report is notable as it’s the first confirmation of the State Department’s acknowledgement of the scale of Israel’s violations in relation to the Leahy Laws. The Leahy Laws bar the U.S. from sending weapons to foreign military units credibly accused of human rights violations, and have been cited countless times by advocates for Palestinian rights calling for an arms embargo to Israel.

The report includes incidents like Israel’s bombing of a World Central Kitchen aid caravan in April 2024, which killed seven workers of international backgrounds.

It also includes the killing of 78-year-old Palestinian American Omar Assad by Israeli forces in 2022. Soldiers stopped Assad at a checkpoint in the occupied West Bank, dragged him out of his car, bound him, and left him on the ground to die overnight; Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in 2024 that the unit responsible was “remediated” and still eligible for military assistance.

However, U.S. officials familiar with the report cast doubt on the possibility of the U.S. acting upon any findings in the report “given the large backlog of incidents and the nature of the review process, which is deferential to the Israel Defense Forces,” the Post reported.

Indeed, the U.S. maintains a different process for assessing potential Israeli violations, which is distinct from that of any other country. The protocol is known as the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum, and, unlike other such processes, has burdensome requirements like in-person meetings with high-level officials in order to make assessments, in which every official must agree on the conclusion.

The protocol heavily favors Israel, with assessments also requiring a request for information from Israel directly in order to proceed — meaning that Israel could theoretically indefinitely delay the process.

This is in sharp contrast to other countries where even a single official’s objection to sending a unit arms could trigger a withholding of assistance, former State Department official Josh Paul told the Post.

Tellingly, though it has existed since 2020, the Israeli Leahy Vetting Forum has never found an Israeli unit to be ineligible for receiving U.S. assistance, former State Department officials have reported.

“What worries me is that accountability will be forgotten now that the noise of the conflict is dying down,” Charles Blaha, a former State Department official under the Biden administration, told The Washington Post. Blaha was in charge of the office that oversees Leahy Law implementation.

Detainees have been denied insulin, left without medical attention for days and forced to compete for clean water, the investigation found.

The report, released by Georgia Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff, is the second in a series of inquiries into alleged human rights abuses within the system.

It builds on an August review detailing mistreatment of children and pregnant women, drawing on more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect between January and August.

Detainees also described meals being too small for adults, milk that was sometimes out of date and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick.

Mr Ossoff said the findings expose “a deeper failure of oversight,” adding: “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment.”

National Immigration Project regional attorney Stephanie Alvarez-Jones said one of her clients at Louisiana’s Camp J facility had been left partially paralysed after being denied a prescribed medical device and placed in segregation.

“He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance,” she said.

A federal judge in Rhode Island on Friday afternoon blocked the Trump administration from suspending all food aid for millions of Americans, in a case brought by a group of US cities, non-profit organizations and a trade union.

At almost the same time, in a separate but similar case, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the government must continue to fund the program that helps low-income households stave off food insecurity, in a case brought by the Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia and three governors who sued the administration.

Without intervention, the US Department of Agriculture said it planned to suspend payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as Snap or food stamps, on Saturday, 1 November, putting millions of low-income households that rely on the benefits at risk of food insecurity and financial hardship.

John McConnell, a US district judge in Providence, issued a temporary restraining order in the Rhode Island case at the behest of those plaintiffs. They had argued that the US Department of Agriculture’s suspension of Snap benefits due to kick in on Saturday was unlawful.

Snap, the nation’s largest anti-hunger initiative, provides assistance to nearly 42 million – one in eight – low-income Americans each month. The USDA has said insufficient funds exist to pay full benefits, as issuing food stamps costs the public purse between $8.5bn and $9bn every month.

The Trump administration contends the agency lacks authority to pay them until Congress passes a spending bill that will ending the enduring government shutdown which began on 1 October.

The plaintiffs in the civil case being heard in Rhode Island are represented by the liberal legal advocacy group Democracy Forward. The group argued that the federal government’s decision to suspend the nutritional benefits was wrong and unlawful, as the USDA still had funds available to fulfill its obligation to fund the Snap program.

Such available funding includes $5.25bn in contingency funds that Congress has previously provided for the USDA to use when “necessary to carry out program operations”, the plaintiffs said.

Aside from the contingency funds, the plaintiffs argued that a separate fund with about $23bn in it could also be utilized to avoid what would be an unprecedented suspension of Snap benefits.

In the Massachusetts case, the US district judge Indira Talwani in Boston gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partly pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds.

It wasn’t immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.

The rulings are likely to face appeals.

In their challenge, the Democratic-led states argued that the agriculture department has the legal authority – and available funds – to at least partly maintain the program during the shutdown.

“Because of [the] USDA’s actions, Snap benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,” the states said in their complaint. “Worse still, [the] USDA suspended Snap benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November Snap benefits.”

The Trump administration has maintained that the department’s contingency fund is intended for natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes and floods, not government shutdowns. The government has acknowledged that it has billions of federal dollars left, including emergency funds especially marked for Snap, but top officials have maintained they are unable to tap into those reserve funds.

The administration warned that a court order requiring it to use emergency reserves to fund Snap would be “operationally fraught”, arguing it could take weeks to deliver benefits and might leave families with less than half their normal monthly allotment. In court filings, officials noted that such a partial payment “has never been made – and for good reason”.

The argument appears to contradict the department’s lapsed-funding plan, released in late September, which stated that Congress’s “evident” intent was for Snap operations to continue during a government shutdown and pointed to “multi-year contingency funds” that could be tapped in the event the closures dragged on. The plan has been removed from the department’s website.

The USDA’s website now carries a strikingly partisan notice, accusing Senate Democrats, incorrectly, of shutting down the government to provide healthcare to undocumented immigrants and trans Americans. “Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the notice says. “At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01.”

The administration’s refusal to intervene underscored a broader strategy during the shutdown, now the second-longest in US history. Throughout the impasse, Trump has selectively reprogrammed federal funds to protect priorities central to his political agenda – such as paying troops and law enforcement officers, including those involved in immigration enforcement – while allowing other programs like Snap to starve.

Bracing for the loss of federal nutrition assistance, food banks and pantries, already stretched thin amid rising food prices, were bracing for a surge in demand. Officials in states such as Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, Hawaii and Minnesota have announced plans to tap state and local funds to provide food aid and assist food banks in the interim.

The governors of New York, Delaware, Oregon and Virginia have declared the looming crisis a state of emergency, while states set aside millions to help offset the lapse of federal benefits.

“Unlike Washington Republicans, I won’t sit idly by as families struggle to put food on the table,” New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, announced on Thursday.

In California, the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, said he would deploy the California national guard under his command to support food banks and announced $80m in state support to fill the Snap gap.

The rulings came a day before the U.S. Department of Agriculture planned to freeze payments to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program because it said it could no longer keep funding it due to the shutdown.

The program serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation's social safety net. Word in October that it would be a Nov. 1 casualty of the shutdown sent states, food banks and SNAP recipients scrambling to figure out how to secure food. Some states said they would spend their own funds to keep versions of the program going.

The program costs around $8 billion per month nationally.

Democratic state attorneys general or governors from 25 states, as well as the District of Columbia, challenged the plan to pause the program, contending that the administration has a legal obligation to keep it running in their jurisdictions.

The administration said it wasn't allowed to use a contingency fund with about $5 billion in it for the program, which reversed a USDA plan from before the shutdown that said money would be tapped to keep SNAP running. The Democratic officials argued that not only could that money be used, it must be. They also said a separate fund with around $23 billion is available for the cause.

A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled from a bench that the program must be funded using at least the contingency funds - and asked for an update on progress by Monday.

A Massachusetts-based judge also gave the administration until Monday to say whether it would partially pay for the benefits for November with contingency money or fund them fully with additional funds

It wasn't immediately clear how quickly the debit cards that beneficiaries use to buy groceries could be reloaded after the ruling. That process often takes one to two weeks.

The rulings are likely to face appeals.

In a hearing in Boston Thursday on a legal challenge filed by the Democratic officials from 25 states, one federal judge seemed skeptical of the administration's argument that SNAP benefits could be halted.

U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani told lawyers that if the government can't afford to cover the cost, there's a process to follow rather than simply suspending all benefits. ""The steps involve finding an equitable way of reducing benefits,"" said Talwani, who was nominated to the court by former President Barack Obama.

Talwani seemed to be leaning toward requiring the government to put billions of dollars in emergency funds toward SNAP. That, she said, is her interpretation of what Congress intended when an agency's funding runs out.

""If you don't have money, you tighten your belt,"" she said in court. ""You are not going to make everyone drop dead because it's a political game someplace.""

Government lawyers say a contingency fund containing some $5 billion cannot legally be used to maintain SNAP, a program that costs about $8 billion a month. The states say it must be used for that purpose and point to more money available in a second federal account with around $23 billion.

Talwani said her ruling would apply nationwide, not just in the states that are part of the challenge. That could defy the intentions of the U.S. Supreme Court, which has limited the use of nationwide injunctions, though it hasn't prohibited them.

Meanwhile, states, food banks and recipients have been bracing for an abrupt shift in how low-income people can get groceries.

The majority of states have announced more or expedited funding for food banks or novel ways to load at least some benefits onto the debit cards used in the program.

Advocates and beneficiaries say halting the food aid would force people to choose between buying groceries and paying other bills.

At a Washington news conference Friday, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, whose department runs SNAP, said the contingency funds in question would not cover the cost of SNAP for long. Speaking at a press conference with House Speaker Mike Johnson at the Capitol, she blamed Democrats for conducting a ""disgusting dereliction of duty"" by refusing to end their Senate filibuster as they hold out for an extension of health care funds.

A push this week to continue SNAP funding during the shutdown failed in Congress.

To qualify for SNAP in 2025, a family of four's net income after certain expenses can't exceed the federal poverty line, which is about $31,000 per year. Last year, SNAP provided assistance to 41 million people, nearly two-thirds of whom were families with children, according to the lawsuit.",https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18095864_103125-cc-ap-snap-food-img.jpg?w=1600,N,,2025-10-31 19:02:09.084826

Roughly 42 million Americans rely on SNAP to help buy food.

In a case brought by a coalition of states in federal court in Massachusetts, Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government is required by law to tap into the emergency money to make at least partial payments, and gave the administration until Monday to tell the court whether it planned to do so.

In Rhode Island, another federal judge granted a request for a temporary restraining order from a group of municipalities and nonprofits who sued to block the imminent funding freeze, according to attorneys for Democracy Forward, the group leading the suit. The ruling was made from the bench. An entry on the case docket said the court ""orders the USDA to distribute contingency funds"" and report back to the court by noon on Monday.

In her ruling, Talwani stopped short of ordering the administration to send SNAP payments on Saturday, but she rejected the government's argument that the $5 billion contingency fund cannot be used to fund benefits during the lapse in appropriations.

""At core, Defendants' conclusion that USDA is statutorily prohibited from funding SNAP because Congress has not enacted new appropriations for the current fiscal year is erroneous,"" Talwani wrote. ""To the contrary, Defendants are statutorily mandated to use the previously appropriated SNAP contingency reserve when necessary and also have discretion to use other previously appropriated funds.""

Talwani wrote that ""the court will allow Defendants to consider whether they will authorize at least reduced SNAP benefits for November, and report back to the court no later than"" Monday.

SNAP benefits provide eligible families with an average of $187 a month on a prepaid card for food purchases. Many families rely on those benefits as their main source of money for food. The Trump administration said money for the program was due to expire on Saturday because of the ongoing government shutdown, now on its 31st day.

The suit in Massachusetts was brought by two dozen states and the District of Columbia earlier this week. They asked the court to require the administration to tap into the emergency funds to keep SNAP money flowing to states, which administer food stamp programs. The states argued that the administration's decision to cut off payments was unlawful and threatened to deprive millions of Americans of essential food benefits that help protect against food insecurity and hunger.

""Shutting off SNAP benefits will cause deterioration of public health and well-being,"" state officials wrote in their lawsuit. ""Ultimately, the States will bear costs associated with many of these harms. The loss of SNAP benefits leads to food insecurity, hunger, and malnutrition, which are associated with numerous negative health outcomes in children, such as poor concentration, decreased cognitive function, fatigue, depression, and behavioral problems.""

The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees SNAP, said in a memo last week that ""the well has run dry"" and that November benefits would not be paid without an end to the shutdown. Administration officials and Republicans in Congress have said that the roughly $5 billion in the contingency fund could not legally be used to cover the shortfall.

""By law, the contingency fund can only flow when the underlying fund is flowing,"" Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said at the Capitol on Friday.

Talwani, the judge in Massachusetts, rejected that argument in her ruling: ""[U]nder Defendants' statutory construction, the use of the separately appropriated contingent reserve to fund SNAP benefits is somehow predicated on Congress's annual appropriation of funds to the SNAP program. Congress placed no such restrictions in the 2024 Consolidated Appropriations Act.""

She wrote that the suspension of SNAP payments to the states was ""based on the erroneous conclusion that the Contingency Funds could not be used to ensure continuation of SNAP payments.""

OAKLAND — California Attorney General Rob Bonta today issued a bulletin to all California healthcare providers, service plans, and contractors summarizing their new responsibilities under Senate Bill 81 (SB 81). Authored by State Senator Jesse Arreguín (D-Oakland), SB 81 amends the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) and the Health and Safety Code to designate the immigration status of patients as protected medical data and requires healthcare facilities to designate non-public areas where access for immigration enforcement purposes is limited. SB 81 was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and took effect on September 20, 2025.

“Immigrants deserve to receive the healthcare they need without fear. Thanks to legislation like SB 81, California is taking action to protect the personal information of immigrants receiving healthcare, and hospitals remain safe spaces to seek care without the threat of immigration enforcement,” said Attorney General Bonta. “Our information bulletin aims to remind healthcare providers of their new obligations under SB 81. We expect full compliance with this vital new law and will continue to support and defend the rights of California’s immigrant communities.”

The information bulletin outlines the following changes:

Restrictions on Sharing Medical Information:

SB 81 designates place of birth and current or prior immigration status as protected “medical information” under the CMIA.

SB 81 reasserts that healthcare providers, service plans, and contractors must comply with all federal and California state court orders but prohibits them from complying with court orders issued by any other court.

These provisions apply to any healthcare providers and other covered entities in California.

Restriction on Access to Private Areas of Healthcare Facilities:

Healthcare providers must designate areas at healthcare facilities where patients receive care or discuss protected health information as non-public. Facilities should designate areas as non-public through mapping, signage, or key entry.

Healthcare providers must not allow anyone access to the non-public areas of health facilities for immigration purposes, unless required by state or federal law, or unless provided with a valid judicial warrant or court order that specifically grants access to private areas of the facility.

These provisions apply to any healthcare providers that receive public funding. The law encourages all other healthcare provider entities to adopt the law’s requirements.

Provide Notice of Immigration Enforcement:

Healthcare provider personnel must notify management, administration, or legal counsel of any request for access to a patient, information, or site for immigration enforcement purposes, including requests made through a subpoena, warrant, or court order.

Healthcare provider entities must, to the extent possible, establish or amend procedures for monitoring, documenting, and receiving visitors. The law further encourages provider entities to post “notice to authorities” at facility entrances.

Attorney General Bonta is committed to protecting and defending the rights of California's immigrant communities. He previously issued guidance to help California immigrants better understand their rights and protections under the law and avoid immigration scams.

ICE has long been monitoring immigrants in Chicago using facial recognition technology.
Facial recognition ‘threatens privacy’ For years, Democrats in Washington have unsuccessfully tried to place limits on facial recognition technology.
“This is what dystopian nightmares are made of, this kind of continual expansion of surveillance without any real oversight or restrictions.” Meanwhile, the uphill battle to curtail the use of facial recognition has only gotten tougher.
“Facial recognition technology is often biased and inaccurate, especially when used against communities of color,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who signed the letter and has introduced legislation aimed at regulating facial recognition.","The Trump administration has wiped a facial recognition policy from its website while further embracing the controversial technology and securing a $9 million contract with a company barred from selling to Illinois law enforcement agencies.

The ban was the result of a lawsuit filed in Cook County that alleged Clearview AI’s massive database of photographs pulled from across the internet violated a landmark state law protecting people’s personal information.

But a settlement of the case didn’t apply to federal law enforcement agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and its immigration agents. ICE has long been monitoring immigrants in Chicago using facial recognition technology.

Clearview — described by an attorney who sued the company as “one of the largest threats to personal privacy” — can be used in Chicago by federal authorities carrying out President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign.

The FBI, Army, US. Marshals Service and Department of Homeland Security currently hold nearly $10 million in contracts with Clearview, whose chief executive reportedly has close ties to Trump allies.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement is using the largest contract — worth up to $9.2 million — to identify victims and perpetrators of child sex crimes, as well as people suspected of “assaults against law enforcement officers,” records show.

The contract began Sept. 5, days before ICE launched its aggressive immigration enforcement operation in the Chicago area known as “Midway Blitz.” As agents fan out across the city and suburbs, there’s no federal law governing the use of facial recognition technology and apparently little to no restrictions.

A facial recognition policy implemented under former President Joe Biden was removed from the DHS website shortly after Trump took office, according to an oversight body’s report, which said it’s unclear whether the policy still applies or is being updated.

A DHS spokesperson claims the policy remains in effect, but it still can’t be found online. Web pages that mention the policy have been wiped or archived.

“In an effort to keep DHS.gov current, the archive contains outdated information that may not reflect current policy or programs,” some of the pages say.

The DHS spokesperson said the notices “simply reflect standard web-management practices to prevent outdated materials from being presented as current; they do not represent a change in policy. DHS continually reviews issuances to strengthen clarity and accuracy.”

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., raised concerns about the potential rollback of protections and oversight.

“I find it appalling that the Trump Administration is attempting to silently revoke previous guidance that was put in place to protect our privacy and due process rights,” Durbin said. “We need answers on how and why the Trump Administration is using surveillance technology, such as what is provided by Clearview AI, especially as DHS continues to ruthlessly carry out cruel, excessive immigration raids and detain both immigrants and U.S. citizens.”

The Biometric Information Privacy Act

The Cook County legal settlement barring most businesses, entities and state law enforcement agencies from using Clearview stemmed from a lawsuit filed in May 2020 by the ACLU of Illinois and other advocacy organizations.

The lawsuit claimed the company was violating the Biometric Information Privacy Act, which requires people to consent to the collection and use of their personally identifying information such as fingerprints or face scans.

In March, a federal judge in Chicago approved another settlement to resolve a class-action lawsuit brought by people who claimed their biometrics were illegally scraped from the internet and used without their approval.

U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman created a novel settlement structure to resolve the class-action suit for thousands of potential plaintiffs.

They could get a possible 23% stake in Clearview that would be paid out based on a variety of factors, including if the company goes public or is liquidated. The company was valued at $225 million, putting the stake at $51.75 million.

In addition to the $9.2 million Clearview is now getting from ICE, the company has these contracts:

$407,000 for the FBI to “reduce crime, fraud, and risk in order to make communities safer” in New York City

$95,000 for the U.S. Marshals Service for “apprehending fugitives” in Springfield, Virginia

$75,000 for the U.S. Army at the Fort Bragg military installation in North Carolina

$30,000 for Customs and Border Protection at the Spokane Sector in Washington state

$15,000 for Customs and Border Protection at the Yuma Sector in Arizona

A company spokesperson didn’t respond to questions.

Clearview allegedly tied to alt-right ideology

One of the cases consolidated to create the class-action suit was filed in California.

It claimed the company’s founder, Hoan Ton-That, and others associated with Manhattan-based Clearview had “longstanding ties to the alt-right, a far-right ideology based on the belief that white identity is under attack.”

Ton-That now works as chief technology officer for Architect Capital, a San Francisco-based financial firm. Reuters reported that Ton-That was replaced in February by Richard Schwartz, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s onetime adviser, and Republican megadonor Hal Lambert.

The suit was originally filed in Alameda County court in California by a group of advocates who said they didn’t consent to have their biometric information harvested. It alleged the company was tied to a “pizzagate” conspiracy theorist, a neo-Nazi hacker and a man who marched during the deadly “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.

According to the lawsuit, Charles Johnson, a Holocaust denier and purported Clearview co-founder, allegedly made a Facebook post about “building algorithms to ID all the illegal immigrants for the deportation squad.”

Johnson was pushed out of Clearview and ordered to pay $71 million in July after he was sued for allegedly posing as an intelligence agent as part of an extortion scheme targeting Lambert, Clearview’s co-chief executive officer, and his investment management firm.

Facial recognition ‘threatens privacy’

For years, Democrats in Washington have unsuccessfully tried to place limits on facial recognition technology.

Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., introduced legislation in July that would bar law enforcement officials from using “facial recognition to enforce the immigration laws of the United States or share facial recognition data with other agencies for the purposes of enforcing the immigration laws of the United States.”

The legislation was referred to both the House Judiciary and Science, Space, and Technology committees, which are controlled by Republicans.

On Jan. 16, four days before Trump returned to office, DHS officials announced what they described as “the most extensive requirements” of any federal agency to ensure facial recognition was “used properly.”

The next month, the agency removed the text of the underlying policy from its website, according to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, the independent agency that questioned the move in May. By then, Trump’s administration had effectively whittled the watchdog group down to a single Republican member.

Jeramie D. Scott, senior counsel at Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington-based nonprofit focused on civil liberties and privacy, said: “It’s very unclear what the policy is, or if there even is a policy that’s in effect with respect to DHS’ use of facial recognition technology.

“ICE is now seemingly using it without any guardrails to identify anyone they deem suspicious,” Scott said. “This is what dystopian nightmares are made of, this kind of continual expansion of surveillance without any real oversight or restrictions.”

Meanwhile, the uphill battle to curtail the use of facial recognition has only gotten tougher.

In September, nine Democrat senators wrote to acting ICE Director Todd Lyons to question him about an app known as Mobile Fortify, which they said “reportedly allows agents to point a smartphone at an individual’s face or fingerprints and identify the individual based on a biometric match against several federal databases.”

Videos of masked agents scanning people with cellphones have begun cropping up on social media.

The Mobile Fortify app is part of a growing arsenal of tools the feds have to vet whether someone is in the country without legal status, including iris scanning, the use of license plate readers, and fingerprint matches between a DHS database of immigrants removed from the United States and an FBI database containing fingerprints from arrests by the Chicago Police Department and other local law enforcement agencies.

“Facial recognition technology is often biased and inaccurate, especially when used against communities of color,” said Sen. Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who signed the letter and has introduced legislation aimed at regulating facial recognition.

“The use of this technology against protesters and private citizens is concerning, dangerous, and is not just a threat to privacy, but foments a threat on democracy itself.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4d9c2d1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4226x2412+0+202/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fda%2F58%2Fad7c2e1db96d7ff2da1745180b0f%2Fmerlin-105634995.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 14:56:59.058686

The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.

The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.

A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that “ambulances have to come almost every day,” according to the report.

Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.

“Americans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,” Ossoff told The Associated Press. “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.”

The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.

Expired milk, foul water, scant food are reported

The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.

The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report’s findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff’s first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to “score political points.”

Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they’ve seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.

Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization’s clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola’s Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,” she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn’t able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he’s been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

The Baltimore field office is examined

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization’s clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it’s much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,” Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren’t always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”",https://i0.wp.com/bdn-data.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/10/preview-748.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-31 14:02:23.608152

This would be a gift to China.” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.
“Nobody believes he’s [Putin] going to use nuclear weapons … having said that, he’s been doing this all along trying to intimidate Trump.
Russia has denied it has tested nuclear weapons and criticized the U.S. as confusing its testing of a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable missile with a nuclear explosive.","President Trump’s decision to restart nuclear weapons testing as a warning to Moscow is being cheered by his Republican allies in Congress, while Democrats fume over what they describe as a dangerous and misguided retaliation.

It’s an unsurprising public divide and represents another example of how partisan positioning has Congress speaking on opposite sides of national security and foreign policy issues.

While Republicans are praising Trump for pushing back on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s nuclear saber-rattling, Democrats are questioning the utility, safety, financing and precedent of such a step.

“It would be a mistake for us to do this because we have nothing, we have very little to gain,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee with oversight of America’s nuclear arsenal.

“If we did a test and then China decided, OK, I’m going to start testing. They’ll start testing their nuclear weapons, then their strategic forces capability gets much better,” Kelly told reporters Thursday. “We have zero to gain. This would be a gift to China.”

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), another member of the subcommittee, questioned why Republicans are not concerned over how much money is required to carry out the president’s directive if their focus is on lowering federal spending.

“The Department of Defense has a long history of understating costs and claiming shorter timelines for these giant nuclear programs. They sell Congress on a rosy picture of how it will all work out,” she said.

“As soon as Congress signs on the dotted line, the costs start going up, and the time to completion stalls, rolling further and further out … Republicans should be just as outraged as Democrats over the DOD’s lack of honesty about how this program is operating.”

But Republicans are standing resolutely with the president, who announced his decision to resume nuclear weapons testing in a Truth Social post Thursday morning in South Korea, shortly before he met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and shortly after Putin boasted of testing new nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable missiles.

“This is not escalatory,” said Sen. James Risch (R-Idaho), chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, calling Putin a “mad man” trying to push Trump’s boundaries.

“Nobody believes he’s [Putin] going to use nuclear weapons … having said that, he’s been doing this all along trying to intimidate Trump. I think Trump was saying, I’m not intimidated about it.”

Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) backed up Trump when asked about the president’s directive to the Pentagon to restart testing nuclear weapons, saying it sends a “strong message” to U.S. adversaries.

“The commander in chief wants us to be fully prepared. We are the last great superpower on the Earth. China intends to be a near peer-to-peer advisory to us,” Johnson told reporters Thursday morning. “But in order to maintain peace around the world, you have to show strength, and that’s what the president believes in. That’s what he’s demonstrated over and over.”

Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a defense hawk and a close ally of the president, said Trump’s directive to the Department of Defense (DOD) was a “response” to Putin, whom Trump has been pushing to come to the negotiating table in hopes of ending the Russia-Ukraine war.

“I think Putin’s misjudging Trump,” Graham told The Hill on Thursday. “You threaten our country. You will regret it.”

But some senators acknowledged the president’s directive was short on details.

Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said Thursday he will “have to see” what Trump means regarding testing nuclear weapons but emphasized that the U.S. has to keep its “nuclear forces modernized for sure.”

Trump said the U.S. would start testing its nuclear weapons “because of other countries testing programs” and would do so on an “equal basis.”

It’s not clear exactly what Trump wants to achieve. For opponents and arms control experts, the most concerning directive is if the president decides to resume nuclear explosive testing.

Russia has denied it has tested nuclear weapons and criticized the U.S. as confusing its testing of a nuclear-powered and nuclear-capable missile with a nuclear explosive.

Russia claimed that last week it successfully tested a new nuclear-capable cruise missile, known as the Burevestnik, which purportedly flew for 8,700 miles and cannot be stopped by air defenses.

The Kremlin said Wednesday it also tested a new atomic-powered and nuclear-capable underwater drone, known as the Poseidon, with Putin claiming the nuclear reactor that powers it is “100 times smaller” than those on submarines.

“As far as Russia is concerned, it recently tested delivery vehicles, not nuclear explosive devices,” Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, including the International Atomic Energy Agency, posted on social platform X.

Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a member of the Senate Armed Services subcommittee with oversight of nuclear weapons, argued during Thursday’s confirmation hearing of Vice Adm. Richard Correll — tapped to be the next commander of the U.S. Strategic Command — that the U.S. should maintain and “modernize” its nuclear arsenal.

Separately, the Arkansas senator wrote in a Thursday post on X that Russia and China have conducted “super-critical nuclear weapons tests to advance their nuclear programs.”

“The U.S. has been bound to a zero-yield test standard since 1992,” Cotton said. “It’s welcome news that President Trump is allowing us to conduct activities on par with Russia and China to advance and modernize the U.S. nuclear stockpile.”

But Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, pushed back on Cotton’s claims that Russia and China have carried out any sort of nuclear weapons testing as “unsubstantiated and highly-debatable.”

“Trump’s nuclear policy is incoherent and unclear: calling for denuclearization talks one day; threatening nuclear tests the next,” he said in a statement.

“But what is clear: U.S. resumption of nuclear testing or reckless words and actions, that trigger a nuclear testing chain reaction, harm U.S. security.”

Farhan Haq, spokesperson for the United Nations secretary-general, responded to reporters’ questions Thursday about Trump’s directive as raising the risks of nuclear conflict when tensions are “already alarmingly high.”

“All actions that could lead to miscalculation or escalation with catastrophic consequences must be avoided,” he said. “From our standpoint, from the secretary-general’s standpoint, nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.”

Iran used the opportunity to paint Trump and the U.S. as the nuclear aggressor, while the country is under sanctions for failing to comply with nuclear-safety commitments. Iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, but the U.S., Israel, allies and experts say Iran is intent on having the capability of building a weapon.

She clocked in at Eagle Beverage in Kent, a bottling factory where she had worked for 20 years, most recently supervising a team that repairs the machinery. She’s good at fixing things.

Espinoza and G, her partner of 12 years, had dreamed about their upcoming wedding day, surrounded by the people who love them. The date was set for May 24, and they had invited friends and family to celebrate after a brief ceremony at the King County courthouse. Over the years, Espinoza had become a second mom to her partner’s teenage son — family photos show the three of them in Christmas sweaters, celebrating birthdays and school graduations.

But then Espinoza spent what would have been her wedding day in detention, after she was picked up during a workplace immigration raid on May 20. Federal agents came into Eagle Beverage with a search warrant for 41 people who appeared to have false employment papers. They made 17 arrests.

""Inside ICE Detention: A Documentary"" investigates Tacoma's immigration detention center during a time of swift policy changes under the Trump administration. Listen to the full, in-depth story by Liz Jones by clicking the audio link above, on the KUOW app, or your favorite podcast app.

These arrests came during the early months of the Trump administration’s escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. Espinoza and her coworkers soon joined a surging population of detainees at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, one of the largest immigration detention centers in the country. During Trump’s first months in office, the daily headcount at the Tacoma facility would nearly double, and at times appear to surpass the facility’s capacity of 1,575 beds.

As the facility became more crowded, new Trump administration policies also began to shift the experience for detainees inside immigration lockups, stripping away access to legal aid programs and bond hearings. As detainees like Espinoza took stock of the shifting landscape, they weighed tough choices about whether to stay in detention and fight their case. Her story opens a window into a time of rapid transition at the Tacoma ICE facility, a place often far from public view.

“When we arrived at the detention center, we started to talk to the other people,"" Espinoza said. “Some people had been there for 11 months, four months, six months...they said that there were no bail options, that nobody would be getting out — so the way out appeared to be to sign for a voluntary departure.”

Voluntary departure is a way for someone to avoid a deportation on their record, but they typically have to pay for the flight themselves.

KUOW is not using Espinoza’s full name because she is worried about potential consequences for her ongoing immigration case. But she said she is sharing her story because others are in a similar situation, often without family or legal support.

Sponsored

“I think the most difficult thing for me, and for everybody, was the feeling of being locked up without any communication,” she said.

In Tacoma, and nationwide, roughly half the people in detention are in ICE custody due to civil violations of immigration law. Seventy percent of detainees there have no criminal history.

A wedding postponed

Espinoza, 52, is originally from a small town in Sinaloa, Mexico. She came to Seattle 20 years ago on a tourist visa to visit her brothers and felt safe in a way that never seemed possible in Sinaloa. Because she's gay, she said she faced discrimination most of her life back home, a place known for violence and cartel activity.

Xiomara Urán, an immigration an attorney with the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, took up Espinoza’s case in detention and set an idea in motion: What if Espinoza and her partner went ahead with the marriage – but in detention?

Sponsored

Urán was hopeful the marriage would give Espinoza a better chance for bond, to get out of detention and continue fighting her case. But she also worried about red tape and delays to get the ceremony approved in time. Guards at the Tacoma facility were telling Urán and other attorneys about staffing shortages as the center filled to capacity.

ICE and GEO Group, the contractor that operates the facility, declined multiple requests to comment for this story.

Urán has worked exclusively with detained clients in Tacoma since 2020. She and her colleagues began to notice shifts in the operations there after Trump returned to office in January.

“The speed at which we're seeing the changes now – it's insane,” Urán said. “They’ve gone so fast.”

An initial blow for attorneys like Urán came in January, when the federal government cut funds for a longstanding legal orientation program at detention centers, including in Tacoma. Urán said program cuts led to logjams where attorneys would end up waiting a full day to see a client.

Sponsored

“They used to reserve three rooms for us, now they don’t,” Urán said, referring to attorney rooms. “So now, if you go at 10 a.m. or 11 a.m. you're probably going to wait between three and five hours before you can see anyone.”

Only about 14 percent of people in detention can find or afford an attorney, and those who do are 10 times more likely to win their case, according to government data.

With the legal orientations gone, Urán said detainees have heard discouraging messages from staff inside about access to counsel.

“They've told people that we have disappeared, [so] what's the point of fighting?"" She said. ""Because there's no one to fight for you. So just ask for your removal, or like self deport now.”

Sponsored

As Urán started to work on Espinoza’s case, sometimes Espinoza would sink into depression and talk about giving up, as conditions inside detention wore on her. Urán kept encouraging her to fight.

The detention center fills up

Inside detention, Espinoza said she slept poorly at night because some lights stayed on, and heavy doors slammed as the cleaning or kitchen crews moved through the halls. When her unit got time in the outdoor yard, sometimes she would stay in the dormitory area just for a bit of quiet or she would play basketball in a smaller courtyard.

“At the beginning, I didn’t understand why people slept a lot during the day,” she said. “Then later I understood it was a way of making sure that time went by quickly.”

Espinoza also worried about her health. She has stage four kidney disease and said she lost about seven pounds during her first weeks in detention, trying to avoid high-sodium foods. She usually felt cold.

The women who’d been detained for months told her everything was running slower than usual because there wasn’t enough staff to move them place to place. Several detainees KUOW recently interviewed also complained about a lack of outdoor time, meals that arrived hours late, and long waits for health care.

Around the country, congress members have stepped up visits to ICE detention centers and called for more transparency -- especially as places hit capacity.

“They have a number of staff openings that are unfilled that give me concern,” said U.S. Representative Emily Randall after an August visit to the Tacoma facility, which is in her district. “Lots of folks have said that they're unable to get outside, given the number of shifts for outdoor recreation.”

The daily population inside the Northwest ICE Processing Center has risen from 801 people on January 20, 2025, to slightly above its capacity of 1,575 in early June, according to ICE data analyzed by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights and the Deportation Data Project.

The August visit was Randall’s third this year. Health care is another concern she’s monitoring. She gave credit to the medical staff inside that provide care, although detainees continue to tell her about long delays.

“A lot of folks are just deciding not to keep showing up, not to keep trying not to even file complaints for a lack of access to care,” she said.

“And that demoralization, I think, can have really negative outcomes for individuals, for their physical health, for their mental health. And we're seeing more and more people who are signing to, like, self-deport because they don't have any fight left in them.”

RELATED: Washington farmworker who led union efforts talks life after ICE detention, returning to Mexico

Randall, a member of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, said she plans to keep up these visits because “it's important for the staff and detainees to know that Congress is watching.”

GEO Group has long maintained that it follows national detention standards and is committed to providing the highest quality services possible.

The immigrant advocacy group La Resistencia has been tracking some of these same concerns about healthcare and living conditions in the Tacoma facility for years. Rufina Reyes, the group’s director, said they now can receive up to 100 calls a day from detainees in Tacoma.

She flagged a pattern of detainees getting transferred farther away after publicly sharing complaints with her group, including a group of men transferred to Alaska in June. GEO Group and ICE did not respond to KUOW’s questions about transfers.

Other minor logistics can also create barriers for detainees to stay in contact with family, lawyers or support networks.

On a Saturday in July, Sister Mary Ellen Robinson, a Catholic nun, drove three hours from Wapato to visit a young man in detention from her community.

""He's part of a large family that needed to leave Mexico because their lives were in danger,” she said. ""His family are very worried about him, and they are totally afraid to come anywhere near here.”

Outside the detention gates, Sister Mary Ellen and another woman from Ethiopia with a nephew inside compared copies of the daily visiting schedule. It showed a detailed system of odd and even days for each unit, but the schedule on ICE’s website was different than the paper version at the check-in desk. Neither woman was able to do their planned visit that morning – they came at the wrong time.

Waiting to marry, as a court deadline approaches

Urán filed paperwork with ICE to get the marriage approved, with support from the office of Congressmember Pramila Jayapal, who had met Espinoza during a visit at the detention center. Urán had no idea if the response from ICE would come in days or weeks or longer.

Meanwhile, Espinoza attended her first two hearings at the court inside the detention center, where each time she asked the judge for more time to prepare her case. After the second hearing, Judge John Odell told her they would need to proceed with her case at her next hearing, in early July.

Ten days before her hearing date, Urán received the wedding approval. Espinoza and G set the date, again, for a Saturday.

Espinoza’s fiancée arrived at the detention center that morning in a white pant suit, her long brown hair down past her shoulder. G's teenage son, Espinoza’s brother and nephew, and a family friend also joined them.

The ceremony lasted about 20 minutes, then G walked out, clearly trying to keep up a smile.

“I have like two emotions, like feeling excited because it was a special day for us but also sad because it’s not the place that we wanted or the way we wanted,” G said.

Until that day, all their visits for the past seven weeks had been behind a glass window, talking through a phone on the wall.

“Just to be able to hug each other, that's the moment that my heart was like…it was very emotional,” she said, no longer able to hold back her tears.

She was also encouraged to see Espinoza in better spirits after many weeks of seeing her scared and stressed.

After they exchanged rings, it caught them both off guard when the officiant asked if they wanted to share personal vows — they didn’t think they’d have a chance to speak here.

“I said something like this is like a test for us,” G said. “And I know that after this we are going to always be together and keep going.”

Urán, their attorney, seemed hopeful this marriage would give Espinoza a better chance to be released and continue her case outside of detention.

“I can never say that things are going be smooth because immigration court is always difficult, particularly in the detainee setting, and so the plan is now to get her out through a bond,” Urán said.

But bond is just one step toward freedom because even if Espinoza gets out, she’ll still have to fight to stay in the U.S. For people in deportation proceedings, like Espinoza, there can be a higher bar to prove it’s a bonafide marriage and qualify for a green card.

New restriction to get released on bond

In the past few years, the Tacoma immigration court has become known as one of the strictest in the country for bond approvals. The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project filed a class-action lawsuit in March, challenging a recent practice in Tacoma that resulted in bond denials for a whole class of detainees previously eligible for release. Since 2023, the lawsuit argued, the Tacoma court adopted a “unique” and “draconian” policy to deny bond requests by noncitizens who entered the U.S. without inspection, including those who have lived here for decades.

In September, a federal judge found the Tacoma bond policy unlawful but judges there have not changed course, according to The Seattle Times. In her ruling, U.S. District Judge Tiffany Cartwright noted that Tacoma immigration judges granted only three percent of bond requests in fiscal year 2023, making its rate “the lowest among immigration courts” during that period.

RELATED: Filipina green card holder and UW worker released from Tacoma ICE

This summer, the Trump administration also implemented a national policy that follows Tacoma’s model, calling for mandatory detention for far more immigrants. This national policy change is also facing a court challenge.

ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons described the new policy to Fox News as a way to more efficiently process immigration cases.

“We saw so many people that were apprehended illegally coming through the border and then using the bond system just to go ahead and be released out into the community, to have a court date in, you know, 2037, 2035, and never show up for court,” Lyons said.

Attorney Xiomara Urán has watched all these recent shifts in detention build on each other — the access to attorneys, to bonds, detainees transferred far from home -- and she sees it all leading to a much tougher fight for anyone who wants to stay here.

On the day of Espinoza’s bond hearing, she returned to Judge Odell’s courtroom. Family members lined the wood benches behind her.

Espinoza sat in front facing the judge, wearing a yellow uniform with a sweatshirt layered underneath. Her new wife gripped a legal folder in her hand, her son close at her side. She kept her eyes trained forward, occasionally darting a worried glance at her sister-in-law or niece.

Judge Odell evaluated Espinoza’s case, including her likelihood to show up for future court dates. He also reviewed whether she posed any risk to the community, noting a conviction for driving under the influence in 2009, for which she served one day in jail since it was a first offense. Odell found she met the bar for bond and set the amount at $3,500, on the lower end. Espinoza turned to her family as she left court, pushing a tear off her cheek.

'It's difficult to think of starting over'

After 52 days in detention, Espinoza returned home to her wife and teenage son and put her focus on her health, her legal case and her family life.

“It's difficult for me to think about starting over,” she said in Spanish. “We are together the three of us always.”

Her freedom came with the unexpected burden of an electronic ankle monitor, even though Judge Odell granted her bond with no conditions, including no monitor. Perplexed, her attorney Xiomara Urán appealed the monitor to Judge Odell and he lowered the bond amount to $1,500. Urán would later realize the confusion likely stemmed from a ICE policy change in July to expand the use of these monitors.

The monitoring calls would wake Espinoza in the middle of the night, asking for her location. “I’m in bed sleeping,” she’d tell them. In public, she’d keep it hidden.

She’s happy to be married, and chafes at the question about why the couple didn’t marry years ago, as a way to protect Espinoza from deportation.

“A marriage is not just a piece of paper and that’s it,” she said. “[You] have to do it for love, not just for convenience.

Espinoza is hopeful she’ll be able to get a work permit while her immigration case is pending but that can take months to get approved. She enjoyed her two decades at Eagle Beverage, where she fixed broken machines. She sees something broken with the way ICE targets workers like her, in an economy that often relies on them.

“I think there are many good people who all they want is to get ahead,” she said. “In spite of everything that's going on, this is a hope that many people have.”

Looking back, she said the time in detention left her feeling like a different person.

“I think very much so, more than anything mentally, because basically, in reality, everything happened that I didn't want to have happen to me,” she said, her voice choked with emotion.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/16d5002df6011bf99bf9499772da31f2.png?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-10-31 14:02:29.330219

Many federal workers have missed paychecks, including air traffic controllers, who are working unpaid.

The impacts of the shutdown could soon get worse. That's because a number of federal programs are set to run out of money on Nov. 1. If that happens, tens of millions of people would lose federal food and nutrition benefits like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, previously known as food stamps.

Also set to run out of funding are some Head Start programs, early-learning centers for low-income families, that serve more than 65,000 children nationwide.

The Agriculture Department says it will reopen about 2,100 county offices despite the government shutdown to help farmers get access to $3 billion of aid. At the same time many American farmers say the Trump administration's trade policies have them on the brink.

As the shutdown continues, here's the latest on what we know.

Jump to state-specific impacts.

Why did the federal government shut down?

A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the health care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.

Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.

NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when subscribers could see big premium increases unless the subsidies that have been helping people pay for coverage since 2021 are extended.

What about WIC and SNAP benefits?

Of those at risk of losing food and nutrition aid if the shutdown continues into November, 7 million receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC.) Nearly 42 million who rely on SNAP are also expected to lose their benefits. Their debit-like cards were funded a month in advance through October, but the Trump administration has warned the program will run out of money Nov. 1.

In a letter dated Oct. 10, the USDA told state agencies to hold off distributing November benefits ""until further notice"" because of insufficient funds. The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has called on the agency to shift money from its contingency fund and other places to keep SNAP at least partially funded.

As NPR's Stephen Fowler reports, a coalition of more than two dozen Democratic state leaders are suing the Trump administration over its decision to suspend federal food benefits during the government shutdown. A federal court decision in that case may come as soon as Thursday.

WIC was initially slated to lose funding after only a couple weeks. The Trump administration shifted $300 million in tariff revenue to keep it afloat, but the National WIC Association says that emergency funding will only last through October. It's calling for an additional $300 million to keep WIC operating for a couple more weeks. Some states could step in to help fill the gap, depending on their resources.

What about Head Start?

Beginning Nov. 1, more than 65,000 children will be at risk of losing access to Head Start, the federal early-learning program for low-income families. That's because federal funding for individual Head Start programs cannot be disbursed while the government is shut down.

Among the states hit hardest by this Nov. 1 deadline: Florida, Georgia, Missouri and Ohio.

Nationally, Head Start serves roughly 750,000 infants, toddlers and preschool-age children, providing not just childcare and early learning but also free meals, health screenings and family support.

Local Head Start programs are funded annually, though at different times of the year. Some programs get their money on Oct. 1, others on Nov. 1 and so on. If the shutdown lasts until December, says Tommy Sheridan of the National Head Start Association, still more programs would see their funding run out.

Without federal funding, Sheridan says, some programs will have to close immediately. Others have the resources to stay open at least another week, in hopes that politicians in Washington can resolve their differences.

What the shutdown means for federal workers

Altogether, about 1.4 million civilian federal employees across the country are going without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a think tank in Washington, D.C.

Of those, roughly half are furloughed, which means they are not working and not getting paid, but expect to return to work once the federal shutdown is over.

The other half have been deemed essential and so are continuing to work.

By law federal workers are supposed to get back pay once the shutdown ends, but the White House has tried to cast doubt on that.

The Senate has failed to advance a pair of competing measures to pay at least some federal employees during the government shutdown.

The Trump administration has managed to move money around to ensure that some people get paid, including active duty military and law enforcement officers with the Department of Homeland Security.

Many other federal workers are also still getting paid as usual during the shutdown. Salaries for some federal employees, including the vast majority of those at the Department of Veterans Affairs, do not come out of appropriations that Congress must approve every year.

Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?

The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month.

Some unions that represent workers are fighting back in court; the federal judge overseeing the case on Tuesday indefinitely halted the Trump administration's shutdown layoffs, noting human toll. The order applies to federal employees in programs or offices where the plaintiff unions have members or bargaining units.

How is the shutdown impacting active duty military?

The White House has identified additional funding for the latest round of military paychecks despite the shutdown, according to a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget. The spokesperson says that the agency is using around $5 billion from a military housing fund, a military research and development fund and a Defense Department account used for building ships. NPR asked if part of the money is also coming from a $130 million donation made by a billionaire Trump ally, but the OMB did not respond.

The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay many active military members so they wouldn't miss a full paycheck earlier this month, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly.

Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.

USPS is 'open for business as usual'

""U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted,"" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.

IRS furloughs nearly half its staff

A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.

The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.

National Nuclear Security Administration furloughs 1,400 employees

On Oct. 20, the National Nuclear Security Administration, which oversees the nation's nuclear weapons, said it is furloughing approximately 1,400 employees. The agency is responsible for overseeing thousands of warheads that are not currently deployed on missiles, bombers and submarines.

According to an Energy Department spokesperson, the furloughs are due to the ""Democrat shutdown.""

Roughly 400 employees remain on the job providing security and safety oversight. And the office responsible for moving nuclear weapons around the country remains funded until next week.

— Geoff Brumfiel, NPR

In addition, Nevada Public Radio is reporting more than 1,000 nuclear contractors in Nevada could receive notices by the end of the month, because their work relies on the federal government remaining open.

Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might

Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.

At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.

This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. The courts have halted those layoffs. If they're ultimately allowed to go through, multiple sources told NPR the special education office would be left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.

In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.

— Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.

National Parks are a mixed bag

Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.

As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails ""will generally remain accessible to visitors"" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.

Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.

The Salem, Mass. visitor center will be open through Halloween thanks to community support

WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.

Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.

Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue

Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.

But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.

In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.

Some furloughed employees at the Labor Department were brought back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. Last week, the SSA said the payments to recipients will increase by 2.8% next year, or an increase of about $56 per month starting in January.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted

Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. ""We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,"" McLaughlin said.

According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.

""More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,"" Noem posted on X last week. ""By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a ""super check"" — which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.""

The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to Noem; funds will be appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.

If you're flying soon …

Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered ""essential workers"" and have to stay on the job. This week they officially missed their first full paycheck since the shutdown began.

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.

Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. According to NPR's Joel Rose, the Transportation Department says there has been an uptick in the number of controllers who are calling in sick.

The Transportation Department says that federal subsidies for rural air travel will continue through Nov. 18, reports Alaska Public Media's Eric Stone. The department previously said it had enough funding to continue the program through Sunday.

The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country

Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.

Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:

Alaska

The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media]

About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media]

Arizona

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open should the government shutdown. [KJZZ]

Social services in Grand Canyon Village are gearing up to support non-essential employees at Grand Canyon National Park, including food pantry resources. [KNAU]

Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ]

Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]

California

Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that he would deploy the California National Guard to support food banks across California as the federal government shutdown drags on, threatening to delay and stall food stamp benefits for millions of residents. [KQED]

Well over 1 million people in L.A. County get food benefits from CalFresh — the state's implementation of the federally funded SNAP program. The other major SoCal counties — San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange — each have more than 300,000 people on CalFresh, according to state data. [LAist]

The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]

Colorado

Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but ""some services may be limited or unavailable,"" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]

In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]

Court documents show almost 200 Colorado-based positions that the Interior Department wants to cut. [Colorado Public Radio]

Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio]

Several Colorado credit unions are already issuing Government Relief Loans to help workers make ends meet. These short-term loans charge no interest as long as they're paid off within six months. [Colorado Public Radio]

Connecticut

Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU]

Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. Legislative leaders are considering appropriating the money during a special session next month. [WSHU]

Georgia

For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]

Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sensitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]

Hawaii

University of Hawaiʻi is paying affected employees out of pocket during shutdown. Over 830 University of Hawaiʻi employees are at least partially paid through federal dollars, with thousands more in positions that are fully federally funded. UH has been able to pay them with internal funds, but it costs more than $20 million a pay period — every two weeks — for the system to match their salaries. [Hawaiʻi Public Radio]

Illinois

Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media]

Indiana

An estimated 24,000 civilians in Indiana work for the federal government. Gleaners Food Bank set up food distribution systems to help federal workers in Indiana impacted by the shutdown. [WFYI]

Iowa

Over 60,000 Iowans participate in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children. [IPR]

Kansas

If the federal government shutdown continues, the Mid-America Regional Council said it may need to temporarily close Head Start centers serving more than 2,300 Kansas City children beginning Nov. 1. [KCUR]

During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]

Kentucky

Funding for food assistance benefits next month isn't coming, Gov. Andy Beshear said, due to the federal government shutdown. Funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program is also delayed. [LPM]

Louisiana

The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]

Maine

Nearly 170,000 Mainers, or over 12% of the state's total population, could lose food assistance if SNAP benefits are not funded for November. [Maine Public]

Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it has still been busy at the park. [Maine Public]

Maryland

Prince George's County is home to more than 60,000 federal workers. The Capital Area Food Bank has been distributing food to federal workers affected by the shutdown. But the timing is a double burden: The Capital Area Food Bank has seen some of its own federal funding slashed even as demand skyrockets. [WAMU]

Massachusetts

While travelers across the U.S. are experiencing delays and cancellations as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown, it's mostly business as usual at Boston's Logan International Airport. [GBH]

Michigan

In response to how the federal shutdown will affect rural flights in Michigan, airport officials said they are continuing with ""business as usual."" At least, for now. Federal funding for the Essential Air Service (EAS) program is set to extend only through Nov. 2. [Michigan Public]

Minnesota

Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [MPR News]

Missouri

Roughly 650,000 Missourians will not receive SNAP benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing government shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]

The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio]

New Hampshire

SNAP serves more than 75,000 people in New Hampshire. And while state officials say they've received extra money to keep WIC running into November, it's unclear if SNAP will also be funded. [NHPR]

On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground."" [NPR]

Oregon

The federal government program used to subsidize commercial flights in Pendleton got a last-minute reprieve from grinding to a halt due to the partial government shutdown. But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB]

Pennsylvania

Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]

Tennessee

On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN]

Texas

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides food purchasing support to approximately 3.5 million Texans, including more than 1.7 million children. Those benefits amount to around $617 million per month. [KUT]

U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]

“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” he said, in blunt criticism of the United States.
But the forceful condemnation offers fodder for the criticism of the Trump administration’s policy from Democrats and civil society groups.
President Trump authorized the strikes, and his administration has told Congress that the United States was engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels that it has declared to be terrorist organizations.
Mr. Türk’s office said it had no credible evidence of a confrontation with the cartels that met the criteria of armed conflict under international law.","The United Nations human rights chief has condemned the Trump administration’s military strikes on boats that it says are being used to smuggle drugs from South America, saying that they violate international law and should be investigated.

Volker Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement released on Friday that there was no justification under international law for the strikes, which have killed at least 61 people since the start of September.

“These attacks — and their mounting human cost — are unacceptable,” he said, in blunt criticism of the United States. “The U.S. must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them.”

Mr. Türk’s statement has more symbolic power than direct influence over the actions of the United States, which is a permanent member of the U.N Security Council. But the forceful condemnation offers fodder for the criticism of the Trump administration’s policy from Democrats and civil society groups.

President Trump authorized the strikes, and his administration has told Congress that the United States was engaged in an armed conflict with drug cartels that it has declared to be terrorist organizations.

But the administration has presented little evidence to support its claims, and specialists in the laws of war and executive power say he has used the military in a way that had no clear legal precedent or basis. Mr. Türk’s office said it had no credible evidence of a confrontation with the cartels that met the criteria of armed conflict under international law.

In early October, Mr. Türk wrote in a letter to the U.S. government that countering drug trafficking was a law enforcement issue and lethal force was only justified as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life.

“Based on the very sparse information provided publicly by the U.S. authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to the lives of others or otherwise justified the use of lethal armed force against them under international law,” Mr. Türk said.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/31/world/31un-trump-caribbean-strikes-001/31un-trump-caribbean-strikes-001-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:03:48.402153

If subject to the proclamation, payment must be made through pay.gov before a U.S. employer files an H-1B petition with USCIS.
Lawsuits challenging the Proclamation Two lawsuits have already been filed that challenge the H-1B proclamation.
The proclamation ties the $100,000 payment to the filing of an H-1B petition.
Employers who comply with the existing H-1B program requirements should not be precluded from keeping or adding H-1B workers to their workforce because of the $100,000 fee.","Many U.S. employers and H-1B workers panicked when the Trump administration issued a proclamation on September 19, 2025, that appeared to require a $100,000 payment for a noncitizen to enter the United States with an H-1B visa after 12:01 am Eastern Time on September 21. Within 24 hours, the administration clarified that the $100,000 fee would only apply prospectively. But many questions remained, and the White House and agencies were not consistent in messaging as to who would be affected.

On October 20, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) posted information as to how it would implement the proclamation. If subject to the proclamation, payment must be made through pay.gov before a U.S. employer files an H-1B petition with USCIS. The U.S. employer/petitioner must submit either proof of payment or evidence that it received an exception or USCIS will deny the petition.

When does the Proclamation apply?

USCIS confirmed that the proclamation does not apply to:

Petitions filed before 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on September 21, 2025. This means that a noncitizen can be issued an H-1B visa, or be admitted to the United States in H-1B status—without the fee being collected—if the approved H-1B petition was filed before this deadline.

Previously issued and currently valid H-1B visas.

The agency also resolved some questions by identifying the following situations when an H-1B petition is filed on or after 12:01 am Eastern Time on September 21, 2025:

Fee payment or exception required if the noncitizen on whose behalf the H-1B petition was filed (the beneficiary) is outside the United States and does not have a valid H-1B visa.

Fee payment or exception required if the beneficiary is in the United States but the H-1B petition requests consular, port of entry, or preflight inspection notification if USCIS approves the petition.

No fee required to file an H-1B petition if USCIS approves an amended H-1B petition, or approves a request for extension of stay in H-1B status or a request for change of status from another nonimmigrant status to H-1B. (A beneficiary must be in the United States when a U.S. employer files an H-1B petition requesting that USCIS approve either an extension or change of status in addition to approving the H-1B classification.)

No fee required for a beneficiary of an H-1B petition for which USCIS approved an amendment, extension of stay, or change of status who later travels abroad and applies for an H-1B visa based on that approved petition and/or seeks to reenter the United States on a valid H-1B visa.

But questions remain as to USCIS’ statement:

[I]f a petition filed at or after 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on September 21, 2025, requests a change of status or amendment or extension of stay and USCIS determines that the noncitizen is ineligible for a change of status or an amendment or extension of stay (e.g., is not in a valid nonimmigrant visa status or if the [noncitizen] departs the United States prior to adjudication of a change of status request), the Proclamation will apply and the payment must be paid according to the instructions provided by USCIS.

These questions include:

How will payment be requested? Will USCIS issue a Notice of Intent to Deny, which would give the U.S. employer/petitioner the option of withdrawing the H-1B petition without paying the fee?

A U.S. employer/petitioner could request an amendment, which if denied, would mean the H-1B worker remains in their current situation and does not leave the United States. For example, certain changes of work site require that an amendment be filed—no extension of H-1B status is requested and the U.S. employer/petitioner intends to keep the H-1B worker at the current worksite if the petition is denied. Why would a fee be due?

What will USCIS do if it denies an extension of stay or change of status request but the U.S. employer/petitioner did not complete the section of the petition designating consular or other notification (since notification is unnecessary if USCIS approves the extension or change of status)?

National interest exception

USCIS’ description of the national interest exception is far more restrictive than the presidential proclamation indicates it should be. The proclamation gives the DHS secretary discretion to provide an exception to any noncitizen, and by category, “all [noncitizens] working for a company, or all [noncitizens] working in an industry” if the secretary determines that the hiring of such H-1B worker(s) “is in the national interest and does not pose a threat” to national security or welfare. But the DHS secretary has only provided for individual determinations.

USCIS describes the DHS secretary’s grant of a national interest exception as an “extraordinarily rare circumstance” where the secretary determines that four criteria have been met:

The noncitizen’s presence in the United States is in the national interest.

No “American worker is available to fill the role.”

The noncitizen does not pose a threat to the national security or welfare.

Requiring the U.S. employer/petitioner to pay the fee would “significantly undermine U.S. interests.”

The restrictive criteria likely will discourage many U.S. employers petitioners from applying. A U.S. employer must submit the exception request to a dedicated DHS email address before filing the H-1B petition. USCIS requires that “evidence of the exception” be submitted with an H-1B petition for which the fee otherwise would be due upon filing or the agency will deny the H-1B petition.

Lawsuits challenging the Proclamation

Two lawsuits have already been filed that challenge the H-1B proclamation.

The first, Global Nurse Force v. Trump, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, shows the range of U.S. employers and individuals affected by the proclamation. For example, one plaintiff is a union with members who are involved with medical residency training and education, advancing patient care, and expanding access to healthcare. Another plaintiff is a religious missionary order which relies on the H-1B category for religious workers with foreign language fluency.

The second lawsuit, Chamber of Commerce of the United States v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Chamber and the Association of American Universities (AAU) on behalf of their members. On October 24, 2025, the Chamber and the AAU filed a motion to stop the enforcement of the proclamation against them and their members while the lawsuit is pending, or alternatively for a decision that the proclamation is unlawful and vacating it (so the proclamation would not apply to anyone). The court has given the government until November 28 to oppose the motion and the court could decide the motion any time after December 8.

In both cases, plaintiffs maintain that the president does not have the authority to create new requirements for the H-1B program, which Congress established, including what fees may be charged; that the fee is not permitted by the authority Congress gave to the president to restrict entry of certain noncitizens—in one case calling the fee an unlawful tax; and that agency implementation is unlawful.

The proclamation is vulnerable to attack because its structure and requirements are inconsistent with its stated intent to restrict entry of H-1B visa holders. The proclamation ties the $100,000 payment to the filing of an H-1B petition. But USCIS approval of an H-1B petition is not enough for entry to the United States and USCIS does not decide who gets to enter. The proclamation’s focus on claimed abuses in the H-1B program in the United States—which can be addressed by existing law and regulations—also underscores that the fee is not an entry restriction.

As illustrated by the two complaints, the fee will restrict or eliminate the use of the H-1B category by many types of U.S. employers, and noncitizens who benefit the public by their work in many different fields. Employers who comply with the existing H-1B program requirements should not be precluded from keeping or adding H-1B workers to their workforce because of the $100,000 fee.",https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/immigration-impact-uscis-implements-h1b-fee.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 13:04:16.171569
,Litigation,2025-10-31 15:34:35+00:00,Default,The Appellate Void: Trump Could Defy Judges Without Confronting the Supreme Court,Andrew Coan,,,,,http://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-appellate-void--trump-could-defy-judges-without-confronting-the-supreme-court,"Simply put, the Supreme Court or court of appeals is correcting a mistake by a lower court.
And this dispute fell outside the narrow categories of original cases the Constitution authorizes the Supreme Court to hear.
But a circuit court affirmance establishes binding precedent across multiple states, and a Supreme Court affirmance becomes supreme law of the land.
An administration pursuing the appellate void strategy will likely develop a reputation for untrustworthiness, affecting its litigation positions across all cases.
That is the whole point of the appellate void strategy—to keep a case stranded in district court.","When a federal district judge blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Portland on Oct. 4, U.S. Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller called the decision a “legal insurrection.” Other influential MAGA personalities demanded President Trump openly defy the courts. Though the administration ultimately appealed and obtained a stay of the decision—later thrown out by the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit—this rhetoric represented a sharp escalation from earlier in the year. Outright defiance of court orders seems increasingly plausible.

If and when that moment arrives, it could play out in several ways. The most obvious scenario—and the one that has dominated the popular imagination—is a dramatic showdown between the president and the Supreme Court. But another plausible scenario has been largely overlooked: After an adverse ruling, government defendants might simply ignore the district court’s order and decline to appeal. As the prevailing party, the plaintiffs could not appeal either. The result is what I call an “appellate void”—a jurisdictional gap in which lower federal courts lack effective tools for enforcing their decisions against a recalcitrant executive, and higher courts lack any obvious path to intervene.

This scenario is not purely hypothetical. The Trump administration has already tested variations of this strategy. After multiple district courts preliminarily enjoined the president’s executive orders targeting law firms on First Amendment grounds, the administration initially declined to appeal these decisions even as it filed interlocutory appeals in scores of other cases. During this period, it continued holding the orders over the heads of firms that chose to settle rather than litigate, while apparently complying with preliminary injunctions protecting firms that brought suit. For instance, “Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, A&O Shearman, and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett each agreed to provide $125 million in pro bono or free legal work,” according to the White House. The orders thus retained much of their in terrorem effect despite being held unconstitutional by multiple judges. Eventually, the administration filed appeals in these cases.

The Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc. has created new opportunities for this kind of gamesmanship. By prohibiting universal injunctions in most circumstances, the Court enabled this and future administrations to comply with adverse judgments only as to named plaintiffs while continuing challenged policies against everyone else. When coupled with a refusal to appeal, this “appellate void lite” strategy could deny higher courts any vehicle to establish binding precedent on important constitutional questions, while allowing the government to maintain—truthfully—that it has fully complied with all court orders.

The appellate void strategy is most attractive when a president expects to lose on appeal. If the Supreme Court operates as a virtual rubber stamp for the administration, the expected benefits of appealing remain high and the costs low, making the appellate void strategy unnecessary. Many observers believe the Court is already taking this approach, though others argue that this conclusion is premature given that most decisions have turned on procedural rather than merits questions. But if the Court proves willing to block important presidential initiatives—or if the administration believes it will—then refusing to appeal while defying district courts might seem preferable to risking a high-profile defeat at the Supreme Court. If past is prologue, the administration will eventually push boundaries that even a sympathetic Court will not tolerate, making the appellate void strategy increasingly tempting.

The Jurisdictional Trap

The appellate void emerges from the confluence of several settled jurisdictional rules. The most fundamental is that prevailing parties generally cannot appeal. This principle flows directly from Article III of the Constitution, which limits federal courts to deciding disputes with real, concrete injuries, rather than abstract legal questions or hypothetical scenarios. Without a concrete injury that judicial relief can redress, there is no “case or controversy”—per Article III—for an appellate court to resolve. As the Supreme Court explained in Deposit Guaranty National Bank v. Roper, “a party who receives all that he has sought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief and cannot appeal from it.”

This makes intuitive sense. If plaintiffs win everything they sought in district court, why would they need to appeal? The problem arises when government defendants refuse to appeal while simultaneously defying or circumventing the district court’s order. In this case, the proper recourse for plaintiffs is to request that the district judge enforce compliance with the order through fines or other contempt sanctions. It is not to appeal the judgment in their favor. Only an injury caused by the judgment itself—not by the government’s noncompliance—creates a legal right to appeal to a higher court, whose decisions the administration might feel more compelled to respect.

Could the courts of appeals or Supreme Court step in by issuing what is called a writ of mandamus—a court order commanding an official to perform a specific duty? Not easily. When a higher court issues mandamus to a lower court—directing it to transfer a case or exercise jurisdiction, for instance—the writ operates as a form of appellate review within the judicial hierarchy. Simply put, the Supreme Court or court of appeals is correcting a mistake by a lower court.

Mandamus against executive officials works differently. When a court orders, say, the secretary of homeland security to comply with an injunction, that order is not correcting a lower court’s error. It is functionally a whole new lawsuit. In legal terms, this type of mandamus is an “original” action, rather than an appeal. The distinction dates to Marbury v. Madison. Following the presidential election of 1800, William Marbury asked the Supreme Court to order Secretary of State James Madison to deliver Marbury’s commission as justice of the peace. Chief Justice John Marshall rejected the request because Marbury was asking the Court to decide a new dispute rather than to review a lower court’s decision. And this dispute fell outside the narrow categories of original cases the Constitution authorizes the Supreme Court to hear. Courts of appeals have no original jurisdiction at all. So without a pending appeal, these higher courts cannot issue mandamus to executive officials.

Federal law does include something called the All Writs Act, a statute authorizing federal courts to issue “all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions.” A writ is simply a formal court order. But the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that this act does not create jurisdiction where none exists. It merely protects jurisdiction that courts already have or might soon acquire. When the government deliberately forgoes appeal and no party with standing seeks review, there is typically no appellate jurisdiction to protect and no authority to issue orders under the All Writs Act.

The Fragility of Contempt

This leaves district courts to enforce their own orders through contempt sanctions. In theory, these sanctions might include escalating civil fines or even the arrest of recalcitrant officials. But contempt has always been a fragile remedy against federal defendants.

Civil contempt aims to coerce future compliance and must be “purgeable”—that is, it must be possible for the person or official found in contempt to escape sanctions by complying with the court’s order. But when government defendants claim compliance lies beyond their authority or budget, or would violate presidential policy, courts face a dilemma. If compliance is genuinely impossible without presidential acquiescence, escalating sanctions begin to resemble criminal punishment without proper procedural protections.

Criminal contempt avoids this problem but faces even more serious difficulties. Such proceedings require proof beyond reasonable doubt—the highest standard of proof known to law—and generally entitle defendants to jury trials. Both create additional hurdles. Criminal contempt proceedings also require a prosecutor—typically a government attorney who, at the president’s direction, might well decline to pursue charges. Worse, convictions for criminal contempt are subject to the presidential pardon power, which could nullify any sanctions.

Both civil and criminal contempt enforcement ultimately depend on executive cooperation. By statute, U.S. marshals must “obey, execute, and enforce all orders” of federal courts, including contempt sanctions. But the U.S. Marshals Service reports to the attorney general, its director, and district marshals—all of whom are removable at will by the president. A president determined to defy the courts could threaten marshals with termination and direct the attorney general to choke off the operating capacity of the marshal’s office in question.

A valuable recent analysis by David Noll identifies additional enforcement tools that courts might deploy—including escalating personal fines enforceable through state-law procedures, professional sanctions against government lawyers, and the appointment of non-marshal court deputies under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. These tools operate with varying degrees of independence from executive cooperation, and Noll persuasively shows that “courts have more power to prolong conflicts over compliance with their orders” than is commonly assumed.

But this does not alter the bottom line. The best historical scholarship shows that courts have historically lacked the appetite to use the tools they already possess against the federal government. In particular, “courts hardly ever employ personal contempt fines to deal with true institution-level recalcitrance.” Additionally, most of the tools Noll identifies remain untested in modern practice and would themselves trigger formidable resistance from a defiant executive branch. It is impossible to predict with certainty how such a conflict would play out in practice. But the balance of power strongly favors a determined president over a federal district judge.

Strategic Logic

Why might a president simply forgo appeal and risk the costs of defying a court order? Confronting a single district judge is fundamentally different from defying the Supreme Court. Most Americans probably cannot name a single federal district judge. When a president resists a district court order, he can frame the conflict as pushback against overreach by a nameless, faceless judge blocking policies the American people elected him to pursue. He can emphasize the judge’s political affiliation and appointment by a president of the opposite party. What might be a constitutional crisis if the order came from the Supreme Court instead becomes a lopsided confrontation with an obscure and seemingly subordinate official.

This political calculus is reinforced by an enormous disparity in media coverage. There is only one Supreme Court, and its decisions frequently dominate news cycles for days or weeks. By contrast, there are 94 district courts, and their decisions rarely penetrate public consciousness. An administration that quietly drags its feet on compliance—claiming substantial cooperation while exploiting every ambiguity—stands a good chance of keeping the conflict below the threshold of sustained attention.

Beyond minimizing political costs, the appellate void strategy avoids creating adverse nationwide precedent. A single district court decision binds no other court. But a circuit court affirmance establishes binding precedent across multiple states, and a Supreme Court affirmance becomes supreme law of the land. For an administration advancing legally dubious policies, the benefits of avoiding this risk may exceed the uncertain prospects of prevailing on appeal.

The appellate void lite strategy offers most of these benefits at lower cost. By complying with court orders solely as to named plaintiffs while maintaining the challenged policies against everyone else, an administration can truthfully claim to be in compliance with all court orders while achieving most of its unlawful objectives.

Costs and Constraints

The appellate void strategy carries significant downsides. Most immediately, the strategy forfeits the possibility of winning on appeal. Historically, the federal government has won more than 70 percent of its appeals, and the current Supreme Court has proved especially receptive to executive power arguments. Pursuing the appellate void strategy throws away this very good chance of reversal.

The strategy also carries political risks. Even defiance of a district judge will generate media coverage, particularly if sustained. While ordinary Americans may not know the names of most district judges, they understand lawlessness, and find it unsettling. Polls consistently show that large majorities expect the executive branch to comply with court orders, and presidents generally care quite a bit about public opinion, which translates into political capital.

Perhaps most important, sustained defiance risks poisoning the administration’s relationship with the entire federal judiciary. An administration pursuing the appellate void strategy will likely develop a reputation for untrustworthiness, affecting its litigation positions across all cases. Judges who would otherwise be sympathetic may become skeptical. Close cases may start being decided against the government when it would otherwise receive the benefit of the doubt. Requests for stays or expedited relief may be denied.

This matters because every administration relies on courts in countless ways to implement its affirmative agenda—from immigration to environmental law to civil rights enforcement. Federal judges issue search warrants, approve wiretaps for criminal investigations, authorize asset freezes, and process thousands of government requests that transform executive policy directives into legally enforceable actions on the ground. No administration can realistically function without the courts.

The appellate void strategy is most attractive when several conditions align: when the administration’s legal position is weak, when the Supreme Court appears hostile, when policy stakes are high, and when courts seem more likely to be intimidated than fortified by defiance. Conversely, when the likelihood of appellate success is high, when the policy is relatively unimportant, and when the judiciary appears sympathetic or likely to react forcefully to executive defiance, the strategy is less attractive. Why poison relationships with courts that are already giving the president most of what he wants?

Reverse Marbury

The appellate void strategy bears striking resemblance to Chief Justice Marshall’s famous jujitsu maneuver in Marbury v. Madison—but in reverse. In that foundational case, Marshall faced a dilemma: If the Court ordered Madison to deliver Marbury’s justice of the peace commission, President Jefferson would almost certainly ignore the order, exposing the Court’s weakness. But dismissing the case would signal that officials could violate legal rights without any judicial remedy.

As every first-year law student learns, Marshall’s solution was ingenious. He painstakingly explained why Marbury was entitled to his commission, while holding that the Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to order its delivery because the statute granting that jurisdiction was unconstitutional. This established the power of judicial review of congressional legislation without issuing any order Jefferson could defy.

The appellate void flips this dynamic. Where Marshall leveraged limits on the Supreme Court’s jurisdiction to avoid issuing an order the president would have ignored, a modern president could leverage the same jurisdictional limits to ignore a district court order and shield this defiance from Supreme Court review. If the government refuses to appeal, there is no case for the Supreme Court to decide. And under Marbury’s own logic, the Court cannot issue an order directing the government to comply with a district court order because that would be an exercise of original, rather than appellate, jurisdiction.

Of course, both the Supreme Court and the presidency have changed dramatically since 1803. The Court commands far greater prestige than it did then, despite recent declines in public approval. The executive branch has expanded from a few thousand federal employees to a massive administrative state. Yet the institutional balance remains delicate, and there is no modern precedent for direct defiance of the Supreme Court. This uncertainty is precisely what makes the appellate void appealing for a president determined to escape legal constraints. The result is the same—the president does what he wants—but without risking a high-profile showdown with the Court, which would be forced to watch from the sidelines.

Potential Responses

The appellate void is not inevitable. Courts and litigants have several potential responses, though all have significant limitations and drawbacks.

District courts can structure remedial orders to make defiance more visible through ongoing supervision and detailed reporting requirements, which create potential flashpoints for conflict and media coverage. They can also impose escalating contempt sanctions calibrated to maximize pressure on the government to appeal. More creatively—and controversially—they might strategically deny some requested relief to give plaintiffs something to appeal. But this would be an unorthodox and extralegal basis for decision, raising serious ethical and legal questions.

Appellate courts have limited options. The All Writs Act might permit intervention in narrow circumstances where executive noncompliance threatens to moot potential appeals. Immigration habeas cases where the government seeks to deport petitioners from U.S. territory provide one possible example. Death penalty cases are another. If left unchecked by higher courts, government defiance of an order blocking a petitioner’s deportation or execution would foreclose the possibility of any future appeals. That could be enough to trigger the All Writs Act. But most challenges to government action do not have this characteristic.

More exotic possibilities exist but are extreme long shots. The Supreme Court could grant certiorari before judgment, using its rarely invoked power to review a case before the court of appeals has ruled. Or lower courts could certify specific legal questions directly to the justices for resolution. But by statute, both of these powers extend only to cases already “in” the courts of appeals. If the government defies a district court order while refusing to appeal, the case would never get to that stage. That is the whole point of the appellate void strategy—to keep a case stranded in district court.

Sophisticated plaintiffs might engage in “reverse forum shopping”—deliberately filing some challenges in jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to the administration to increase the odds that at least one plaintiff loses. That defeated plaintiff could then appeal to the court of appeals and, ultimately, the Supreme Court. But this strategy requires significant coordination—advocacy organizations would need to recruit clients in multiple jurisdictions and file simultaneous challenges across the country. The approach also raises ethical concerns about lawyers’ duties to individual clients versus broader strategic goals. More important, reverse forum-shopping remains vulnerable to default judgments—government defeats by forfeit—and settlement offers designed to moot potential appeals. These are just different forms of voluntary surrender. Either would make plaintiffs the prevailing party and block their ability to appeal.

Perhaps most controversially, the Supreme Court might try to preempt the appellate void strategy by ruling for the administration so consistently that appeal always appears more attractive than defiance. The justices might pursue this approach for many reasons—sincere belief in expansive executive power, ideological sympathy, partisan solidarity, or general fear of confrontation. But the appellate void adds one more strategic reason for deference: discouraging the executive from circumventing Supreme Court review entirely by refusing to appeal its district-court defeats.

Like other responses, placating or appeasing the president has serious limitations. It would require sustained coordination across fractious justices on exceedingly difficult questions: How much deference is necessary to keep the president appealing? Which cases matter enough to risk confrontation? And so forth. These calculations require speculation about presidential psychology, political fallout, and the Court’s own popular support—making consensus difficult and mistakes highly probable. There is a strong prudential argument that the justices would do better by not asking these questions. There is also a legal formalist argument that these questions are legally irrelevant and should never enter the judicial calculus.

Looking Ahead

The deliberate saber-rattling of the Trump administration, combined with increasing political polarization and populist disdain for official authority, calls many previously settled norms into question. It is no longer unthinkable that the president might direct his subordinates to defy a district court judgment, rather than appeal it. The recent CASA decision has created new opportunities for plaintiff-specific compliance that allow the president to continue enforcing unlawful policies against all other parties, while keeping the Supreme Court on the sidelines.

These scenarios are speculative, not inevitable. Courts and litigants have many potential responses, which may well carry the day. But the stakes are high enough that we should not let the appellate void take us by surprise. Indeed, understanding the risk in advance may be the key to averting it.",http://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-31 13:04:20.979825

Arlington, VA — [October 31, 2025] — Today, the White House set the FY 2026 refugee admissions goal at just 7,500 refugee admissions. This number represents the lowest refugee admissions goal in the history of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) at a time of significant global resettlement need.

“USCRI is deeply disappointed that the United States’ commitment to refugees is not in step with the alarming level of forced displacement around the world,” said Eskinder Negash, President and CEO of USCRI. “We urge the Administration to maintain and strengthen its historic leadership by supporting refugees who have safely resettled in American communities and the thousands more who have already been conditionally approved for resettlement and are waiting overseas to be processed. At a time of growing instability and declining humanitarian assistance around the world, we cannot lose our conviction to protect humanity. USCRI will continue to advocate for displaced populations who urgently need safety and protection.”

Today’s announcement undermines decades of bipartisan support for the refugee program. It also disregards urgent international calls to expand durable protections for the more than 123.2 million refugees and internally displaced people worldwide who are forcibly displaced due to persecution, violence, and human rights violations.

The decision also stands in stark contrast to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 2024 Global Trends report, which highlights historic levels of displacement and identifies 2.5 million refugees in need of resettlement. Despite these figures, fewer than one percent of refugees in need are ever resettled—a sobering reminder of the gap between global commitments and pathways to protection.

The White House published the refugee admissions goal without legally required Congressional consultations, including the submission of a “Report to Congress.” The White House announcement states that admissions will “primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa pursuant to Executive Order 14204, and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.” The absence of the required Report to Congress leaves significant uncertainty about how the Administration intends to implement the program and prioritize admissions.

“USCRI has spent the past century welcoming newcomers to the United States. We know from first-hand experience that refugee resettlement strengthens communities across the country,” said Negash. “When refugees rebuild their lives here, they contribute to our shared prosperity. Refugees enrich America. They make our communities stronger. We must renew our nation’s proud humanitarian tradition.”

Background

This year’s Presidential Determination leaves thousands of refugees in limbo. Many have spent years navigating the USRAP process and were already at the final stages of screening and approval at the start of 2025. In January 2025, the Trump Administration’s indefinitely suspended refugee admissions, which abruptly deserted over 120,000 refugees in the USRAP pipeline. Despite having completed extensive interviews and security clearances, none of these individuals seem to have been prioritized for admission in FY 2026 according to the announcement published today, leaving them in uncertainty and, for some, facing impossible choices about their safety and future.

Since its founding in 1911, USCRI has helped forcibly displaced people and, since 1978, has been a formal partner of the U.S. Government in resettlement efforts. USCRI continues to welcome and support refugees and special immigrant visa (SIV) holders across its nationwide offices and network organizations, working alongside community partners to ensure newcomers can thrive and contribute to American life.

Aztec dancers lead the way, followed by thousands of revellers, adorned in marigolds and face paint that transforms the living into a parade of colourful skulls.

The celebration marks Dia de los Muertos, a holiday celebrated in Mexico and throughout Latin America to honour the dead.

Louie Gutierrez, one of the organisers behind San Francisco's festivities, considers it a time of somber reflection but also joy and exuberance.

“There’s a compassion in the air,” said Gutierrez, who works with the cultural advocacy group El Colectivo del Rescate Cultural de la Mission.

This year, however, as Latino communities across the United States prepare to mark the holiday this weekend, many are contending with another emotion: fear.

Since taking office for a second term, President Donald Trump has pursued aggressive immigration enforcement policies, as he seeks to carry out a ""mass deportation"".

In some communities, Dia de los Muertos events have been called off due to concern that they could serve as magnets for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) or Border Patrol agents.

Decatur, Alabama, for instance, called off its annual Dia De Los Muertos Festival this month, citing the threat of immigration raids.

""The decision comes in light of the current national climate surrounding immigration status and safety concerns, and our top priority remains the well-being of our community, attendees, and friends,"" organisers wrote on Facebook.

And in California's San Francisco Bay Area, a Día de los Muertos event that had been slated for October 25 at Berkeley High School was also cancelled.

Adriana Betti, executive director of the academic nonprofit RISE, explained that the decision was taken after parents expressed anxiety about attending the yearly event.

Even on a normal day, Betti added, some immigrant families are afraid to come to the school, for fear they might encounter law enforcement.

“We have parents who have somebody else walk their kids to school,” Betti said. Others carry their passports everywhere they go.

The last-minute cancellation was a loss for vendors who sell foods like tamales and aguas frescas at the event, according to Betti. And it's also a missed opportunity to connect families with community resources, like nutritional assistance programmes.

But the threat of immigration arrests has forced community leaders like Betti to weigh the benefits and risks.

Over the past year, the number of people in ICE detention has increased by about 59 percent, from about 37,395 in September 2024 to 59,762 last month.

Deportations have increased, too, with 527,000 removals reportedly conducted since Trump began his second term.

""The Trump Administration is on pace to shatter historic records,"" White House spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an October statement, celebrating the uptick.

California is among the states that Trump has threatened with a federal troop deployment, as he seeks to carry out his deportation drive, as well as a crackdown on crime.

Already, he sent 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines to Los Angeles in June as a response to protests against his immigration policies.

Earlier this month, he was also poised to send military forces to San Francisco, though he ultimately called off the ""surge"" for now.

About six hours south of San Francisco, the Museum of Contemporary Art Santa Barbara is among the institutions suspending this year's Calenda Día de los Muertos, a traditional procession.

In the past, the event has featured music and dances from the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, as well as an altar for the dead and Oaxacan cuisine.

But this year, Dalia Garcia, the museum’s executive director, told Al Jazeera that organisers could not guarantee that the event would be safe, given that it takes place in an open street.

Celebrating can be a form of resistance, Garcia acknowledged.

But for Black people, Indigenous people and people of colour — known collectively as the BIPOC community — Garcia believes there is an expectation that their traditions should be performed as a spectacle, regardless of the threats they face.

“The BIPOC community, we always have to show that we’re happy,” Garcia said. “And we continue to have these celebrations. But in reality, for me, it’s, like, no. I think we have to show that it’s affecting us.”

The heavily Latino farming community around Santa Barbara, she pointed out, has suffered losses in recent months.

In July, when ICE raided two cannabis farms — one in Santa Barbara County and another in neighbouring Ventura County — a farmworker died after falling from a greenhouse rooftop. More than 300 people were arrested.

In a public statement about the Dia de los Muertos event cancellation, Garcia explained, ""Not everyone has the privilege to celebrate openly. For many in our community, visibility carries risk.""

Still, in her interview with Al Jazeera, she clarified that she was not opposed to communities celebrating this year.

“By no means am I saying nobody should celebrate,” Garcia said. “It’s fine to celebrate, but how can we also bring awareness to what’s happening? How can we ignore the reality that joy is not present for everyone?”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2019-Dia-de-los-Muertos-8-1761838969.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-31 12:02:59.967296

(NewsNation) — Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Thursday a federal crackdown on states issuing commercial driver’s licenses to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally following a Department of Homeland Security operation in Indiana that resulted in 223 arrests.

The operation, conducted in northern Indiana, identified 146 truck drivers among those arrested. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said several of the arrested drivers had criminal records.

Duffy said the Transportation Department discovered multiple states have improperly issued commercial driver’s licenses designated for U.S. citizens to foreign nationals and immigrants without legal status. The licenses allow holders to operate large commercial vehicles, including fuel tankers and school buses.

The secretary threatened to withhold federal highway funding from states that fail to comply with licensing requirements. California faces losing $160 million in federal transportation funds for refusing to enforce English proficiency requirements and audit previously issued nondomiciled commercial licenses.

The Transportation Department directed states in May to enforce existing English proficiency requirements for commercial drivers. Officials also halted the issuance of nondomiciled commercial licenses nationwide and ordered states to review previously issued licenses for compliance.

Nondomiciled licenses were originally intended for U.S. citizens seeking commercial licenses in states where they don’t reside. Duffy said some states began issuing such licenses to foreign nationals, sometimes with expiration dates that extended beyond work permit expirations.

Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration Administrator Derek Barrs said Indiana conducted 191 roadside inspections over 30 days that revealed commercial license violations or English proficiency issues.

Of those, 115 involved license violations, including drivers with no license, suspended licenses or disqualifications.

Duffy said the department will target commercial driver training schools that certify unqualified students and companies that hire improperly licensed drivers.

“We will stop at nothing to make sure that our roads are safe,” Duffy said, adding that states like Oklahoma are partnering with federal authorities on enforcement operations.

When asked whether removing migrant drivers would create truck driver shortages, Duffy disputed industry claims of labor scarcity. He said unlicensed drivers willing to work for lower wages have suppressed industry pay rates.

“There are enough American truck drivers to meet the demands that we have in this country,” Duffy said.

Midwest enforcement operation targets criminal migrant truckers: Noem

The Indiana operation has been included in DHS’s ongoing operation in Chicago, dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz“, but the targeted enforcement in the Hoosier State is geared specifically at making America’s roadways safer.

Much of the operation has focused on Chicago, where Noem said Thursday that more than 3,000 migrant arrests have been made. Yet, while DHS officials, including U.S. Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino, have continually been met with roadblocks, Noem and Todd Lyons, the acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director, have found an ally in Indiana Gov. Mike Braun.

On Thursday, Noem highlighted the arrest of Mexican and Colombian nationals who were issued truck-driving licenses from “sanctuary” states like California and Illinois. Noem said DHS agents and officers have been conducting targeted enforcement operations in Indiana.

Those arrested have previous convictions for cruelty toward a child, assault, driving under the influence of alcohol, drug offenses and other crimes, Noem said. But the DHS secretary said that migrants who were granted commercial operators’ licenses under the Biden administration have been responsible for crashes that have led to serious injuries and deaths.

Noem said in many instances, law enforcement officers have reported that these drivers are unable to communicate with troopers and cannot understand road signs, which “presents a danger many times over” and “endangers every single citizen that is on our roads.”

She added, “If you are here driving on our streets illegally and [on] our highways, you are endangering our citizens, and your days are numbered.”

The crackdown on immigrant truck drivers comes as federal immigration operations continue in Chicago, where DHS officials insist the focus remains on “the worst of the worst.” Lyons said Thursday when “Operation Midway Blitz” began, ICE was “out to rid the sanctuary status of Chicago.”

He said officials knew problems existed beyond the city’s limits, but said “ICE protected Chicago when local leadership failed.”

In response to a push by Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for DHS to pause enforcement operations for Halloween, Noem said the agency would “absolutely not” pause and will continue to focus on keeping communities safe.

“The fact that Governor Pritzker is asking for that is shameful,” Noem said. “I think it’s unfortunate he doesn’t recognize how important the work that we do is to make sure we’re bringing criminals to justice.”

Yet, while citing more than 3,000 Midway Blitz arrests, Noem could not provide a specific percentage of arrests that have involved those with serious criminal convictions. Federal officials have acknowledged that U.S. citizens have been arrested and detained during enforcement operations, including during protests at an ICE processing center in suburban Broadview.

However, Noem told reporters Thursday that no American citizens have been arrested or detained during Operation Midway Blitz. She said the Trump administration is focusing on those who are in the country illegally and characterized reports that suggest otherwise as “false reporting.”

Noem said that arrests, which administration officials have characterized as “collateral” involving those without criminal charges or convictions, have led to immigration status checks. She said those found without legal immigration status are given due process and then deported.

However, as of Sept. 21, only 28% of the nearly 60,000 in federal custody have previous criminal convictions, and 25% have pending criminal charges, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

The two senior DHS officials’ appearance in Indiana on Thursday came two days after Bovino, the Border Patrol commander-at-large, appeared before U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis, who has expressed concerns with the use of force being utilized by federal agents.

Bovino was ordered Tuesday to meet daily with Ellis to review the daily operations of federal officers. However, on Wednesday, an Illinois appeals court issued a temporary stay on the order. Bovino told NewsNation on Wednesday evening that CBP and ICE officers have not violated a temporary restraining order that was issued by Ellis earlier this month. Bovino characterized Operation Midway Blitz as “a resounding success.”

“We’re talking all sorts of bad people and bad things off the street,” Bovino told NewsNation.

Bovino said that residents living in communities where migrants who entered the U.S. illegally are operating “have no voice” because of the presence of dangerous migrant criminals. Bovino said that his agents are being asked by local community leaders to address residents on the tactics being used in enforcement operations.

This is a record low since the 1980 Refugee Act when a cap on refugees entering the country was set at 50,000 per year, but could be changed. That was the same year that the US refugee resettlement programme was launched. Currently, the cap sits at 125,000, set by former President Joe Biden.

Furthermore, the Trump administration said priority will be given to white South Africans.

But while the new cap is a significant drop from the number of refugees admitted by the US in more recent years, the US has made use of highly restrictive and often racist immigration policies throughout its history.

Who will be allowed to take refuge in the US from 2026?

No more than 7,500 people will be granted refugee status and these must undergo very tough checks before they can enter. Approval by the secretaries of state and homeland security will be required.

The White House announcement reiterated that Trump also signed a proclamation in June that stipulates that foreign nationals can still be denied entry if allowing them into the country would harm the country’s interests.

Why is Trump prioritising white South Africans?

Trump claims that White Afrikaaners are at risk of “genocide” in South Africa. In February this year, he signed Executive Order 14204, titled “Addressing Egregious Actions of the Republic of South Africa”. The order was made in response to South Africa’s Expropriation Act 13 of 2024, which allows for land to be seized and redistributed.

The order criticised South Africa for seizing land owned by “ethnic minority” white South Africans. The US threatened to withhold aid to South Africa if the government continues with this. In May, 59 white South Africans arrived in the US as part of a special refugee programme Trump established for them.

The same month, Trump ambushed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa during a visit the White House, only to be ambushed by Trump with a video of people singing “Kill the Boer” in South Africa and allegations that a “white genocide” was taking place.

“People are fleeing South Africa for their own safety. Their land is being confiscated, and in many cases, they’re being killed,” Trump said during the meeting with Ramaphosa in May.

Do white Afrikaaners need refugee status?

Experts say not really.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa signed the Act to right apartheid-era wrongs. However, the law allows the government to seize privately owned land from anyone, regardless of race, for public purposes with compensation, or in some cases, without compensation.

The Act replaces a previous 1975 law, which was criticised for its lack of clarity about compensation.

During apartheid, white South Africans, who are mainly Afrikaans-speaking descendants of Dutch settlers and English-speaking descendants of British colonists, held control, and often violently sidelined the Black majority.

While apartheid ended in 1994, white South Africans, who represent about 7 percent of the population, still own more than 70 percent of the land, while more than half of the Black population lives in poverty.

At his White House meeting, Ramaphosa told Trump that while South Africa does have a problem with violent crime, it was being perpetrated against all South Africans, not just white people.

Experts have also dismissed Trump’s claims of a white genocide.

“There is no merit to Trump’s fantasy claims of white genocide,” South African historian Saul Dubow, professor of Commonwealth history at the University of Cambridge, told Al Jazeera in May.

“South Africa is a violent country and, in economic terms, one of the most unequal societies in the world. The violence is criminal rather than political, though racial injustice inevitably forms part of the context.”

Dubow suggested that Trump may be more angry about South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, filed in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in December 2023 in relation to the war on Gaza.

Is this really the strictest US cap on refugees ever?

This is the lowest cap on refugees in recent history. As well as being lower than the initial 50,000 cap established by the 1980 Act, it is also lower than the previous ceiling of 17,400 the Act sought to replace.

Every year, the number of refugees allowed into the US is determined by the president in consultation with the US Congress. For the fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, a maximum of 125,000 refugees were allowed into the US.

In 1980, the US refugee resettlement programme was established to allow the US to identify, admit and resettle refugees fleeing conflict or persecution from around the world.

Prior to 1980, however, the United States did not admit significant numbers of refugees and had a history of highly restrictive laws which barred people from specific countries from entering or holding citizenship.

A history of prohibitive immigration policy in the US

Here’s a timeline of some key US citizenship and immigration policies which have affected people of specific ethnicities and nationalities.

1790: Naturalisation Act

The Naturalisation Act defined limits on who could become a naturalised citizen of the US.

According to this act, naturalisation was limited to free white people who had lived in the US for two years and demonstrated good moral character.

It excluded Native Americans, enslaved people and anyone who was not white.

1875: The Page Act

Signed in March 1875 by President Ulysses S Grant, the Page Act was the first US federal law on immigration.

The law targeted immigrants, especially women from Asia. It decreed that the US government must determine that “the immigration of any subject of China, Japan, or any Oriental country, to the United States, is free and voluntary”.

The Act was worded as if it was protecting vulnerable immigrants, as it prohibited bringing women into the US for forced labour or sex work. Anyone found to have brought an immigrant from an Asian country into the US without their consent could be imprisoned and fined.

However, critics have pointed out that, in practice, the Act was racist and sexist. It came at a time when poverty and famine in China had caused many Chinese people to seek opportunities in the US. In particular, Chinese women migrated to the US, seeking jobs, from the 1850s.

According to an article published by the National Council for the Social Studies (NCSS), San Francisco officials started making efforts to deport Chinese women of “ill fame” from the 1860s. The article added that at that point, “all Chinese women were most likely stereotyped as prostitutes”.

The article highlights that one of the enduring impacts of the Page Act was the stigmatisation of Asian women. Beyond facing racial discrimination, Asian women were fetishised and sexualised culturally.

1882: The Chinese Exclusion Act

Signed in May 1882, the Chinese Exclusion Act barred all Chinese labourers from entering the US for 10 years.

It also prevented Chinese immigrants from becoming naturalised citizens of the US.

The Act was extended by the Geary Act of 1892 and remained in place until it was repealed in 1943.

1907: The Gentlemen’s Agreement

This was not a formal law – it was, rather, an agreement between the US and Japan.

The agreement, negotiated by President Theodore Roosevelt, asked the Japanese government to restrict the migration of Japanese labourers to the US.

In exchange for this, Japanese students would be permitted to continue to attend integrated schools.

The agreement was drawn up in response to public anger about the rising number of Japanese labourers and agricultural workers who had migrated to fill the gap left by Chinese workers.

1917: Asiatic Barred Zone Act

This law created a “barred zone” from the Middle East and Southeast Asia, spanning most Asian countries.

Nationals of these countries were restricted from entering the US.

1924: The Johnson-Reed Act

This immigration act imposed strict limits on the number of people from other countries who could migrate to the US every year.

It stipulated a “national origins” quota, which decreed that only 2 percent of the number of people of any nationality living in the US in 1890 could enter the country each year.

The law also completely barred people from Asian countries from immigrating to the US.

2017: Trump’s own ‘Muslim ban’

During his first term, Trump enacted a travel ban dubbed the “Muslim ban”.

Under this ban, Trump signed an executive order banning citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, from entering the US for 90 days.

The order also suspended the US refugee programme for 120 days and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees.

Trump’s travel ban went through subsequent rounds of revisions. The initial version was blocked by courts for being discriminatory.

The final version, which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018, affected citizens from Yemen, Syria, Iran, Libya and Somalia alongside Venezuela and North Korea.

In 2021, President Joe Biden signed an executive order reversing the travel ban.

2025: Trump’s travel ban

While Trump did not reinstate his original travel ban during his second term, he signed a proclamation in June this year imposing a complete ban on nationals of 12 countries from travelling to the US. Many of them are African nations.

They include Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.

Under this proclamation, citizens from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela are subject to partial restrictions.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_69049ffb1f15-1761910779.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-31 12:02:55.613886

U.S. District Court Judge J. Michael Seabright disqualified Essayli from supervising the criminal prosecutions in three cases, siding with defense lawyers. Essayli has been unlawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for the Central District of California since July 29, Seabright wrote. But he may continue to serve as a First Assistant United States Attorney, Seabright ruled, effectively leaving him as the office’s top prosecutor.

“Nothing is changing,” Essayli wrote in a social media post on Oct. 28, saying he looked forward to advancing President Donald Trump’s agenda.

The decision represents another setback to the Trump administration‘s effort to extend handpicked acting U.S. attorneys beyond the 120-day limit set by federal law. A judge ruled in September that acting U.S. attorney of Nevada, Sigal Chattah, was serving in her position illegally. Another judge disqualified acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey, Alina Habba, in August.

Essayli is a former federal prosecutor turned Republican California Assemblymember, where he took up conservative causes and criticized the state’s COVID-19 restrictions. He has been outspoken against California policies to protect immigrants living in the country illegally, and he has aggressively prosecuted people who protest Trump’s ramped up immigration enforcement across Southern California.

Under federal law, if a permanent U.S. attorney is not nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate within 120 days, judges of the federal district court can appoint an interim until the vacancy is filled. Essayli has not been confirmed by the U.S. Senate — something that generally requires a degree of bipartisan support. California Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla have criticized Essayli’s appointment.

Essayli was appointed as interim U.S. attorney in March, several months after former President Joe Biden’s appointee to the job resigned. Just shy of the 120-day mark, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi appointed him as first assistant U.S. attorney and said he would have the authority to serve as acting U.S. attorney upon a vacancy in the role. He then resigned as interim U.S. attorney.

The government has argued that he can do so under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, which Congress passed specifically to regulate the temporary filling of executive branch vacancies that require presidential appointment and Senate confirmation.

Seabright, however, said that provision of the law only applies if the previous U.S. Attorney dies, resigns, or is otherwise incapacitated.

The lawsuit seeking to disqualify Essayli was brought by three men facing federal firearms charges. They sought to have their indictments dismissed. Seabright ruled the indictments can proceed.",https://masslawyersweekly.com/files/2025/10/AP25281611539665-scaled-1.webp,N,,2025-10-31 10:57:18.304144

“ICE launched operation Midway Blitz to remove illegal alien threats to public safety, which is exactly what we have done in Chicago,” said acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons. “We recognized from the start that this must include protecting roadways carrying interstate traffic and cargo. Sanctuary policies like those in Illinois sadly don’t recognize borders, and ICE and the Indiana State Police have successfully arrested hundreds of illegal alien truck drivers who should not be operating on our highways. In recent weeks, we have seen illegal semi-truck drivers responsible for significant loss of life across the country. This was preventable, and that is precisely why we are working to ensure this doesn’t happen in Indiana or Illinois.”

Many of the illegal aliens’ CDLs were from states with sanctuary policies, including California, Illinois and New York. Of the 46 truck drivers detained as illegal aliens, 10 had a type of CDL that has been subject to abuse in some states. The Trump administration has pushed states to stop issuing CDLs to illegal aliens.

The results show again how neglect of the nation’s immigration laws has undermined the rule of law and made America less secure. President Donald J. Trump’s common-sense enforcement efforts are restoring the rule of law and making the U.S. safe again.

Imogen Foulkes,Geneva Correspondent

The UN's human rights chief has condemned US military strikes on vessels allegedly carrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific, saying the lethal attacks violate international law and amount to ""extrajudicial killing"".

Volker Türk said on Friday that more than 60 people have reportedly been killed in US strikes since early September.

Calling the attacks ""unacceptable"", he said Washington must halt them immediately and conduct prompt, independent and transparent investigations.

President Donald Trump has said the strikes are necessary to stem the flow of drugs into the US and he has the legal authority to continue bombing boats in international waters.

Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth has said strikes are being carried out on vessels operated by drug-trafficking groups designated as terrorist organisations by the US, saying this week that ""the Western Hemisphere is no longer a safe haven for narco-terrorists bringing drugs to our shores to poison Americans"".

Türk, while acknowledging the challenges of tackling drug trafficking, said in a statement that the circumstances for the deadly strikes ""find no justification in international law"".

""Countering the serious issue of illicit trafficking of drugs across international borders is - as has long been agreed among States - a law-enforcement matter, governed by the careful limits on lethal force set out in international human rights law.""

Under law, the intentional use of lethal force ""is only permissible as a last resort against individuals who pose an imminent threat to life"", he said.

He added that based on ""very sparse information provided publicly by the US authorities, none of the individuals on the targeted boats appeared to pose an imminent threat to lives of others"".

He called on the US to use law enforcement methods including intercepting boats and detaining suspects, and if necessary, prosecuting individuals.

Most strikes have taken place off the coast of South America in the Caribbean, though attacks in the Pacific this week killed at least 18 people, according to Hegseth.

In the Caribbean, the US has deployed troops, aircraft and naval vessels and last week ordered the world's largest warship - the USS Gerald R Ford - to the area.

The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. Members of US Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have also raised concerns and questioned the president's authority to order them.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said her government does not ""agree with these attacks"" and has called for meetings with the US ambassador, insisting that ""all international treaties be respected.""

The US actions have also heightened tensions between Washington and the governments of Colombia and Venezuela.

The US has placed sanctions on Colombian president Gustavo Petro, accusing him of failing to curb drug trafficking and allowing cartels to ""flourish"". Petro has responded that he has been fighting drug trafficking ""for decades"".

Trump has also accused Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of leading a drug-trafficking organisation, which he denies.

Venezuela's attorney general told the BBC there is ""no doubt"" that Trump is trying to overthrow the Venezuelan government. He accused the US of hoping to seize the country's natural resources, including reserves of gold, oil and copper.

A U.S. Senate investigation has uncovered dozens of credible reports of medical neglect and poor conditions in immigration detention centers nationwide — with detainees denied insulin, left without medical attention for days and forced to compete for clean water — raising scrutiny about how the government oversees its vast detention system.

The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.

The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.

A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that “ambulances have to come almost every day,” according to the report.

Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.

“Americans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,” Ossoff told The Associated Press. “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.”

The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.

Expired milk, foul water, scant food are reported

The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.

The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report’s findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff’s first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to “score political points.”

Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they’ve seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.

Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization’s clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola’s Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,” she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn’t able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he’s been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

The Baltimore field office is examined

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization’s clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it’s much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,” Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren’t always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”",https://www.voicenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Immigration_Detention_Senate_Probe_35648.jpg?w=1024&h=682,N,,2025-10-31 13:04:04.059062

What is the filibuster and why does Trump want to get rid of it?

Rachel Leingang

Donald Trump on Thursday suggested ending the filibuster to bring an end to the government shutdown, which has now passed one month with no signs of compromise on the horizon.

Both parties have previously defended or sought to dismantle the US Senate rule, depending on the moment and the contours of the debate.

“….BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GONE STONE COLD ‘CRAZY,’ THE CHOICE IS CLEAR — INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER AND, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” the US president wrote on Truth Social.

While the Trump administration argues the department does not have the legal authority to use a $5bn contingency fund to continue the aid, Democrats disagree, and two dozen states have sued the government to force the program to continue.

Meanwhile, Democrats are also refusing to vote to end the shutdown because health insurance costs are set to go up dramatically as insurers prepare for a lapse in subsidies. Senate Democrats are demanding that any short-term government funding deal include an extension of the enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, while Trump and the Republicans have said they will not negotiate until the government is back up and running. Extending the subsidies would require $350bn in federal spending over the coming decade.

We’d like to hear from Americans who are about to lose Snap food assistance due to the shutdown, as well as from people whose healthcare may become unaffordable due to rising premiums. Have you received any notices or paperwork that your insurance will change soon? Tell us using the link below:

Neither agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins nor House speaker Mike Johnson commented on the issue Democrats have been holding the government closed in order to address: health insurance premiums that will double, triple or more for people using healthcare insurance exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act.

Instead, Johnson attributed the shutdown to a call for a “leftwing, radical agenda”.

Agriculture secretary rejects calls to use alternative funding for food stamps program

Name-checking New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and his “socialist rhetoric,” US secretary of agriculture Brooke Rollins decried Senate Democrats who are holding out on opening the government.

Rollings described the shutdown as “disguising dereliction of duty, all to favor illegal aliens and other far left policies”.

The irony of attacking Democrats for supporting “socialist policies” while arguing in support of a public benefit for nutrition support went unremarked upon.

She described the call for the agriculture department to use alternative funding to cover Snap – as Donald Trump has drawn on to cover salaries for soldiers and other employees – as “a lie” and legally impossible.

Mike Johnson seeks to blame Democrats for Americans losing food benefits

US House speaker Mike Johnson spoke about millions of families suffering “because of Snap benefits drying up” during the government shutdown, while offering “a word of sincere gratitude” to millions of federal workers who have showed up without pay, “not knowing when or if their next paycheck will be delivered”.

“We just want to say thank you for your diligence … even though Democrats are withholding your paycheck. They are shameless in doing so.”

Johnson laid blame for the shutdown on Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats choosing not to approve a continuing resolution on funding the government. “The pain of the people is their political lever,” he said. “Republicans have done their part.”

Mike Johnson doubles down on refusing to bring back House until shutdown ends

US House Speaker Mike Johnson reiterated this morning that he will not bring the chamber back into session until the government shutdown ends.

Speaking to Fox News on Friday, Johnson said: “We are anxious to get the house back to regular legislative session, but we have to get the lights turned back on. Chuck Schumer and the Democrats in the Senate have got to reopen the government. Again, it’s the most fundamental responsibility of congress is to have the government operate and work for the people. That’s the number one priority right now and we cannot deviate from that.”

The government is on day 31 of shutdown today. The senate adjourned on Thursday without resolving demands by Democrats to negotiate on healthcare subsidies for insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. The senate won’t meet again until Monday, extending the shutdown into at least its 34th day, equaling the longest in US history.

Meanwhile, health insurance exchanges enter an open enrollment period tomorrow. An early peek at prices without subsidies suggests that the cost of many plans will double or more. Paychecks for most government employees will not go out tomorrow. And the government will not pay Snap food benefits that would normally land on prepaid cards tomorrow, leaving about 42 million beneficiaries – mostly children and disabled elderly recipients – searching for ways to pay for food.

The president of the Heritage Foundation has denied the suggestion that the conservative thinktank should distance itself from former Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson, after interviewing white nationalist Nick Fuentes, who made antisemitic statements during the two-and-a-half hour video.

“Christians can critique the State of Israel without being anti-Semitic, and of course, anti-Semitism should be condemned,” said Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, in a video on X yesterday. “[C]onservatives should feel no obligation to reflexively support any foreign government, no matter how loud the pressure becomes from the globalist class or from their mouthpieces in Washington.”

Roberts said: “The Heritage Foundation didn’t become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won’t start doing that now. We don’t take direction from comments on X, though we are grateful for the robust free speech debate.”

House Republicans increasingly frustrated with Johnson over shutdown tactics

House Republicans are increasingly expressing frustration with the chamber’s moribund activity and the legislative backlog piling up as speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana keeps Congress out of session during the government shutdown.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia confronted speaker the speaker during a House GOP conference call to criticize his tactics to negotiate the shutdown, according to a piece in the Hill today.

Representative Dan Crenshaw of Texas has also been critical of the shutdown’s effect on the legislative agenda, Axios reported.

Kennedy Center ticket sales for orchestra, dance and theatre performances are at the worst they have been since the pandemic, analysis by the Washington Post has found.

Back in September, the Guardian reported that ticket sales at the Kennedy Center had continued to plummet following Donald Trump’s takeover of Washington DC’s premier performing arts venue.

Since then typical ticket sales are down from 93 per cent in late 2024 to about 57% this year, according to the Post.

Audiences are “voting with their feet to skip out” on shows that would once have been packed, in protest at the US president inserting himself into the center’s management and operations as its new chair.

A federal judge has indicated that she would order the Trump administration to use reserves to partially fund food assistance for about 42 million Americans in November, reports the Washington Post. If the order goes ahead, it could delay a cutoff in benefits during the government shutdown.

US grocers and food companies ranging from Walmart to Smithfield Foods are bracing for a dip in November sales if federal food aid benefits lapse for the first time due to the ongoing government shutdown.

The shutdown has imperiled next month’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap), also known as food stamps, which serves nearly 42 million people.

Neither Congress nor the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has acted to fund the benefits beyond Saturday. The gap could mean an $8bn revenue drop for grocers, declining sales for their suppliers and reduced hours for workers as it drives Snap recipients to reduce spending, trade groups, companies and a union said this week, reports Reuters.

Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of health, nutrition and food studies at New York University said:

It’s not only poor people who are on Snap who are going to be affected. It means the places where they spend the money aren’t going to get that money.

The National Grocers Association said on Wednesday that Congress should reopen the government and fund Snap to avoid instability for customers and retailers, warning of “serious consequences for local grocers, their employees, and the food supply chain.”

“Retailers are going to be in a terrible situation here trying to manage costs and inventory,” said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, adding stores could see unsold perishable goods go to waste.

A USDA spokesperson called the benefit lapse “an inflection point for Senate Democrats”. The agency has repeatedly blamed Democrats for the shutdown, most of whom have withheld votes on a spending bill in an attempt to keep healthcare costs from increasing for many Americans.

A US Republican senator is asking President Donald Trump’s administration to help the Malaysian government prevent US artificial intelligence chips from being smuggled through the country to China, according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Reuters has previously reported that US officials believe Malaysia is among a handful of countries where organized smuggling operations have worked to get US chips into China that would otherwise be banned from export to China.

Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, wrote a letter to US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick saying Malaysian officials had begun cracking down on such activity and the Trump administration should aid Malaysian officials in the effort by helping the country develop screening programs to ensure chips are not being diverted to China.

Cotton, who along with the Trump administration has supported the idea of requiring US chips to contain technology that would verify their location to prevent smuggling, said chips with such technology should be given a green light for export to Malaysia, reports Reuters.

Cotton wrote in an 30 October letter:

As is often the case, US companies are at the forefront of developing creative and innovative technical solutions, which will help add layers of assurance against illegal diversion.

Cotton said:

To support the semiconductor industry in their efforts, it may be beneficial for US and Malaysian officials to develop priority customs clearance procedures for shipments of advanced U.S. chips with anti-diversion mechanisms.

Malaysia, China’s largest trading partner in Southeast Asia, announced in July it was requiring permits for all exports, trans-shipments and transits of US-made high-performance chips, such as those made by Nvidia.

UN human rights official says US strikes on alleged drug boats are 'unacceptable'

The UN high commissioner for human rights said on Friday that US military strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean allegedly carrying illegal drugs from South America are “unacceptable” and must stop.

Volker Türk called for an investigation into the strikes, in what appeared to mark the first such condemnation of its kind from a United Nations organization, reports the Associated Press (AP).

Ravina Shamdasani, a spokesperson for Türk’s office, relayed his message on Friday at a regular UN briefing:

These attacks and their mounting human cost are unacceptable. The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats.

She said Türk believed “airstrikes by the United States of America on boats in the Caribbean and in the Pacific violate international human rights law”.

President Donald Trump has Justified the attacks on the boats as a necessary escalation to stem the flow of drugs into the US, but the campaign against drug cartels has been divisive among countries in the region.

US defense secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday announced the latest US military strike in the campaign, against a boat he said was carrying drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean. All four people aboard were killed. It was the 14th strike since the campaign began in early September, while the death toll has grown to at least 61, reports the AP.

Shamdasani noted the US explanations of the efforts as an anti-drug and counter-terrorism campaign, but said countries have long agreed that the fight against illicit drug trafficking is a law-enforcement matter governed by “careful limits” placed on the use of lethal force.

Intentional use of lethal force is allowed only as a last resort against someone representing “an imminent threat to life,” she said. Shamdasani added:

Otherwise, it would amount to a violation of the right of life and constitute extrajudicial killings.

The strikes are taking place “outside the context” of armed conflict or active hostilities, Shamdasani said.

US Senate votes to reject Trump’s global tariffs on more than 100 countries

Rachel Leingang

The US Senate took a stand against Donald Trump’s global tariffs affecting more than 100 countries on Thursday, voting to nullify the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs.

Four Republicans joined with all Democrats to vote 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs that the president put into place via executive order.

It was the third time the Republicans have voted alongside Democrats on a tariff resolution this week, previously rallying to end tariffs targeting Brazil and Canada.

Going against Trump is rare for Republicans in his second term. But Republican senators Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined the opposition party.

The vote came as Trump is wrapping up a week in Asia, where he struck a deal with China to lower tariffs on Chinese goods into the country and get China to buy up US soya beans, a pain point of the trade wars that had farmers on edge, among other concessions.

Despite the opposition in the Senate, the House is unlikely to take any similar action. House Republicans created a rule earlier this year that will block resolutions on the tariffs from getting a floor vote.

The tariff resolutions are a rebuke to the tariffs themselves and to Trump overstepping his authority and bypassing Congress. Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, told reporters that the symbolic opposition should catch the president’s attention.

Kaine said:

I did learn in the first Trump term that the president is responsive to things like this. When he sees Republicans starting to vote against his policies, even in small numbers, that makes an impression on him and can often cause him to alter his behavior.

Trump says Senate should scrap the filibuster to end the government shutdown

President Donald Trump is calling on the Senate to scrap the filibuster, so that the Republican majority can bypass Democrats and reopen the federal government.

Trump posted Thursday night on his social media site, Truth Social:

THE CHOICE IS CLEAR – INITIATE THE ‘NUCLEAR OPTION,’ GET RID OF THE FILIBUSTER.

The filibuster is a longstanding tactic in the Senate to delay or block votes on legislation by keeping the debate running. It requires 60 votes in a full Senate to overcome a filibuster, giving Democrats a check on the 53-seat Republican majority that led to the start of the 1 October shutdown when the new fiscal year began.

Trump’s call to terminate the filibuster could alter the ways the Senate and congressional deal-making operate, with the president saying in his post that he gave a “great deal” of thought to the choice on his flight back from Asia on Thursday.

Trump spent the past week with foreign leaders in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea, finishing his tour by meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.

In a separate post on Truth Social, Trump wrote about his meetings and said it “was a great honor” to “see that America is respected again”. He also claimed that “money is pouring into our Country because of Tariffs and, frankly, the Landslide Results of the 2024 Presidential Election”.

Switching back to the filibuster issue, Trump wrote:

It is now time for the Republicans to play their “TRUMP CARD,” and go for what is called the Nuclear Option – Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!

More on this in a moment. First here are some other key developments:

A (small) handful of US Senate Republicans issued a legislative rebuke to president Donald Trump’s world-rattling trade tariffs in a rare alignment with their Democratic counterparts. Four Republicans – Susan Collins of Maine, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska – joined the opposition party, voting 51-47 on a resolution to end the base-level tariffs on more than 100 nations that the president put into place via executive order.

The Trump administration is going to restrict the number of refugees it admits into the United States next year to the token level of just 7,500 – and those spots will mostly be filled by white South Africans. The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.

New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, on Thursday declared a state of emergency to free up funds so that she could issue $65m in assistance to food banks because federal funding for the national food stamp program is set to lapse on 1 November. Oregon and Virginia have also issued emergency declarations to release state cash to go towards emergency food assistance as the federal government shutdown imperils Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (Snap) benefits for nearly 42 million Americans.

More than half of Americans disapprove of Trump’s demolition of the White House’s East Wing and the construction of a new ballroom, according to a new poll from the Washington Post, ABC News and Ipsos. The survey was conducted between 24 and 28 October and indicates 56% of the respondents disagree with Trump’s recent move while 28% are in favor of it. Most of the survey’s respondents were white, one-third of them voted for Donald Trump and another third for Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.

JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has urged the Trump administration to suspend its immigration crackdown in his state from Friday to Sunday, to allow children to “spend Halloween weekend without fear”.

The Department of Homeland Security has issued new guidance requiring foreign nationals – including green card holders and other non-U.S. citizens living legally in the country, to be photographed when they enter or leave the United States.

CBP currently employs facial recognition at airport checkpoints, but the updated rule will broaden its use to cover every U.S. entry and exit point — by air, land and sea.

The change will broaden CBP’s biometric screening program to include more comprehensive image and data collection aimed at tightening verification procedures and preventing document fraud.

""This final rule amends Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations to provide that DHS may require all aliens to be photographed when entering or exiting the United States, and may require non-exempt aliens to provide other biometrics,"" a summary of the new policy in the Federal Register reads.

""The final rule also amends the regulations to remove the references to pilot programs and the port limitation to permit collection of biometrics from aliens departing from airports, land ports, seaports, or any other authorized point of departure. In addition, DHS is requesting comments on the specific collection process as well as costs and benefits for new transportation modalities,"" it continued.

The rule also lifts previous age exemptions, authorizing facial recognition scans for travelers younger than 14 and older than 79.

""The exemptions in the current regulations for biometric collection based on the age of the individual (i.e., under 14 and over 79) were based on technological limitations on collecting fingerprints from children and elderly persons, as well as traditional law enforcement policies and other policies, such as not running criminal history background checks on children,"" the policy stated.

""These exemptions are not applicable to CBP’s facial comparison-based biometric entry-exit program, as the use of biometrics has expanded beyond criminal history background checks and now plays a vital role in identity verification and management, and combatting the trafficking of children,"" it added. ""Furthermore, internal CBP studies of biometric facial match accuracy, historical matching data, examination of biometric matching of ages under 14 and over 79, and CBP standard operating procedures associated with these ages no longer support exempting facial biometric collection from these populations.

The report released by Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat from Georgia, is the second in a series of inquiries examining alleged human rights abuses in the immigration detention system. It builds on an August review that detailed mistreatment of children and pregnant women and draws from more than 500 reports of abuse and neglect collected between January and August.

The latest findings document more than 80 credible cases of medical neglect and widespread complaints of inadequate food and water. Senate investigators say that points to systemic failures in federal detention oversight.

The report cites accounts from detainees, attorneys, advocates, news reports and at least one Department of Homeland Security employee, describing delays in medical care that, in some cases, proved life-threatening. One detainee reportedly suffered a heart attack after complaining of chest pain for days without treatment. Others said inhalers and asthma medication were withheld, or that detainees waited weeks for prescriptions to be filled.

A Homeland Security staff member assigned to one detention site told investigators that “ambulances have to come almost every day,” according to the report.

Ossoff said the findings reflect a deeper failure of oversight within federal immigration detention.

“Americans overwhelmingly demand and deserve secure borders. Americans also overwhelmingly oppose the abuse and neglect of detainees,” Ossoff told The Associated Press. “Every human being is entitled to dignity and humane treatment. That is why I have for years investigated and exposed abuses in prisons, jails, and detention centers, and that is why this work will continue.”

The medical reports also detailed how a diabetic detainee went without glucose monitoring or insulin for two days and became delirious before medical attention was given and that it took months for another detainee to receive medication to treat gastrointestinal issues.

Expired milk, foul water, scant food are reported

The Senate investigation also identified persistent complaints about food and water, including evidence drawn from court filings, depositions and interviews. Detainees described meals too small for adults, milk that was sometimes expired, and water that smelled foul or appeared to make children sick. At one Texas facility, a teenager said adults were forced to compete with children for bottles of clean water when staff left out only a few at a time.

The Associated Press asked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment on the report’s findings multiple times Wednesday and Thursday, but the agency did not provide a response. The Homeland Security Department previously criticized Ossoff’s first report in August, saying the allegations of detainees being abused were false and accusing him of trying to “score political points.”

Attorneys for some of those detained at facilities across the country said they’ve seen some of the issues with medical care and food firsthand.

Stephanie Alvarez-Jones, a Southeast regional attorney for the National Immigration Project, said one of the organization’s clients was denied a prescribed medical device while being detained at Angola’s Camp J facility in Louisiana in the last two months. The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,” she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn’t able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he’s been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

The Baltimore field office is examined

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization’s clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it’s much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,” Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren’t always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”",https://www.wcia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/44/2025/10/6904930d755b93.57150014.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-31 13:04:08.496249

The man, in his 60s, experienced stroke-like symptoms, including partial paralysis, and was eventually taken to the hospital, where he was transferred to an intensive care unit for several days.

Doctors there prescribed him a walker to help him move during his recovery, but Alvarez-Jones said the detention staff would not let him have it when he first returned and placed him in a segregation cell.

“He still could not walk by himself,” she said. “He still had paralysis on his left side.” She added: “He was not able to get up and get his food, to shower by himself or to use the bathroom without assistance. So he had to lay in soiled bedsheets because he wasn’t able to get up.”

Alvarez-Jones said the guards had insinuated to the man that they believed he was faking his illness. He was eventually given the choice of staying in the segregation cell and being allowed a walker, or returning to the general detainee population. She said he’s been relying on the help of others in the general population to eat and use the bathroom as he recovers.

The Baltimore field office is examined

Amelia Dagen, a senior attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, is working on a lawsuit against the Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations Baltimore Field Office as well as officials in charge of national immigration enforcement efforts.

Dagen said several of the organization’s clients have had to fight for access to medication at the Baltimore holding facility. Through the lawsuit, she said the government agency had to admit in the court record that it does not have a food vendor to provide three meals a day or any onsite medical staff at the facility that was initially only supposed to hold detainees for about 12 hours.

But since January and the various immigration enforcement actions, it’s much more likely that detainees are held for as much as a week in the Baltimore Hold Room.

“What we started hearing very quickly, maybe in February, was that the food they were being fed three times a day was incredibly inadequate,” Dagen said. “We would hear sometimes it would be a protein bar or sometimes just bread and water. There is very little nutritional value and very little variety. I mean, sometimes it was a military ration component, but just the rice and beans, not a full meal.”

Dagen said the detainees also have to ask for bottles of water and they aren’t always given. The ICE office has taken the stance that the sinks attached to the cell toilets are a continuous supply of water. But Dagen said the detainees complained the sink water has a bad taste.

“This is 100% a problem of their own making,” she said of the authorities. “These hold rooms were not used in this way prior to 2025. They are setting themselves these quotas, removing discretion to release people and trying to arrest numbers of people that are just impractical … fully knowing they don’t have the ability to hold these people.”

On Thursday, two immigrant advocacy groups were denied a requested temporary restraining order (TRO) that would have guaranteed attorney access to detainees brought up on deportation-related charges in, but then removed from, the Beaver State.

In a six-page opinion and order, U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken, a Bill Clinton appointee, said the plaintiffs did not yet make a clear enough showing that such alleged behavior by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents is unconstitutional.

""Plaintiffs allege that ICE obstructs and delays attorneys from meeting with their detained clients before it transfers their clients out of state,"" the judge explains. ""Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO is DENIED.""

The litigation was filed earlier this month by the Innovation Law Lab, a Portland-based group of lawyers, activists, and tech professionals focused on immigration reform and upholding constitutional rights.

In a 35-page complaint and concomitant 21-page motion for a TRO, the plaintiffs allege various violations of the First Amendment, Fifth Amendment, and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the federal statute governing the behavior of administrative agencies like ICE.

""The U.S. Constitution requires that individuals subject to the government's unilateral power of detention, transfer, and extraordinary rendition must have the right to access counsel before any transfer or rendition,"" the lawsuit begins. ""Recent federal agency action, however, has undermined this sacrosanct safeguard.""

The complaint details the allegations:

[F]ederal agencies have commanded their vast resources and innumerable agents to assault the people—immigrants and non-immigrants alike. Undertaking the orders of the President ""to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,"" federal agencies—which are mere creatures of law with an ironclad obligation to always obey the law—have largely abandoned the law, especially the law on immigrant detention, and their constitutional, statutory, and regulatory obligations.

In this spirit, federal agencies have adopted officially sanctioned policies, patterns, and practices designed to achieve quota deportations at all costs—even if that means violating the right to access counsel that is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment…

In their request for emergency relief, the plaintiffs asked the court to ""immediately"" enter a TRO barring the government ""for three business days from transferring"" immigration detainees out of Oregon so as to give the detained individuals time to meet with counsel.

Painting a dire picture, the plaintiffs accused ICE of detaining ""citizen and immigrant"" alike in ""violent sweeps"" that then ""trap"" such detainees in the government's ""vast detention network: a network that spans from Tacoma, Washington, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to Sudan to Libya to CECOT—a notorious torture center in El Salvador.""

The plaintiffs' Kafkaesque recitation of ICE activity recalls a flashpoint in the second Trump administration's immigration control campaigns, the use of so-called ""third-country"" deportation flights. In fact, the plaintiffs clearly allege they think this is happening to Oregonians.

""Individuals arrested in immigration enforcement actions may not only be rapidly transferred outside of Oregon and far from their communities of support, but they can also be sent quickly to third countries—like South Sudan, Eswatini, El Salvador, or Libya—where they have never been before and where the government takes the position that they are beyond the reach of this Court's jurisdiction and ability to remedy any unlawful detention or transfer,"" the lawsuit goes on.

The government, in turn, said the plaintiffs were raising much ado about a very simple fact of ICE's operational capabilities.

""Plaintiffs' requested relief is overbroad, unworkable, potentially contrary to law, and otherwise improper,"" the 45-page opposition motion filed by the Department of Justice reads. ""As to the transfer prohibition in particular, ICE does not have any overnight detention facilities within Oregon. Any alien arrested in Oregon that ICE determines will remain in custody must be transferred out of state.""

To hear the DOJ tell it, ""[a]lmost all adult"" Oregon detainees are transferred to the ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington. Such detainees ""routinely"" access attorneys in ""several"" ways, the DOJ claims.

""The thrust of Plaintiffs' complaint is that detainees are not being given sufficient access to attorneys,"" the government's response reads. ""The way to remedy that harm would be to mandate increased access in some fashion. But there is absolutely no reason for the Court to restrict Defendants from detaining individuals in particular locations. Whether a detainee is held in Oregon or Washington does not impact his ability to interact with a lawyer; there is simply no connection between attorney access and whether an individual is transferred out of state.""

The DOJ also argued that ICE has ""clear statutory authority"" to make immigration-related arrests – even without a warrant – under two different prongs of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

And, for now, at least, the court sided with the government.

""At this preliminary stage, the Court finds that Plaintiffs declarations present evidence of Defendants' practices and policies that may violate a detainees' constitutional rights or conflict with Defendants' own rules and regulations,"" the brief bit of legal analysis supplied by the court reads. ""However, Defendants have presented evidence contradicting Plaintiffs' allegations and the testimony and evidence in the declarations does not show that the law would 'clearly favor' Plaintiffs.""

While giving a very terse explanation for her reasoning, the judge more or less suggests the plaintiffs have raised some general issues of constitutional concern while at the same time outright saying ""there is some doubt"" they are likely to succeed on the current set of facts. To that end, the court says the immigrant advocates need to show more – and at this moment have not shown enough.

""It may be that evidence from other witnesses, or the addition of a party is necessary to establish a more concrete connection between the injured party and the rights Plaintiffs seek to enforce,"" Aiken muses.

The judge gave the plaintiffs two weeks to file an improved motion for a TRO. The government will then have two weeks to respond. After that, the plaintiffs will have two weeks to reply to the government. A hearing on the next TRO request is slated for Dec. 12.",https://lawandcrime.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Memorial-Day-2025.jpg,N,,2025-10-31 10:57:22.262062

The difference between “Visa” versus “Status”

First things first: what is the difference between “visa” and “status?” The two terms are often used interchangeably.

Your visa is the foil or sticker placed in your passport by a U.S. consulate outside the U.S., granting you permission to travel to the U.S. and seek entry. You can find it inside your passport. See Figure 1 for details.

On the other hand, your immigration status (e.g., B-1/B-2, F-1, or H-1B) describes how long in the specific status you can lawfully remain in the U.S. Your immigration status is decided at the border, when you seek entry into the U.S., and is recorded on an I-94 (i.e., the Arrival/Departure Form), and you are able to seek an extension of your immigration status in the U.S. or change your status in the U.S.

Your visa can expire even if immigration status remains active. The reverse is also true: your immigration status can expire even if your visa remains active. In either case, you can face legal consequences — which means renewing your visa and respecting the rules of your immigration status is critical should you wish to remain in the U.S.

H-1B Visa Holders

There are an estimated 730,000 H-1B visa holders living in the U.S. Most of them are from Asian countries. In fact, Asian workers accounted for almost 90% of approved H-1B visa applications in 2024, with most applications coming from India (71%) and China (12%). However, recent changes could put the future of the H-1B program into question. Here’s what we know:

$100,000 fine on H-1B applicants and visa holders

The Trump White House announced a $100,000 fee for individuals filing first-time H-1B petitions on or after September 21, 2025, and who are not currently in the United States. This fee will not apply to those who submitted their H-1B petitions before September 21; those with a valid H-1B visa (travel in and out of the U.S. is still permitted); and those in H-1B status inside the U.S. who petition for amendment, change, or extension and are granted such amendment, change, or extension.

There is an exception to the $100,000 fee for individuals whose “presence in the United States as a H-1B worker is in the national interest” — but it’s up to the Department of Homeland Security to decide who satisfies this “high threshold.”

In short, the $100,000 fee targets H-1B applications from people who:

Are outside the U.S. and who do not hold a valid H-1B visa.

Are in the United States with a request for consular notification, port of entry notification, or pre-flight inspection.

Are in the United States with a request for amendment, change, or extension of H-1B status, and that request is denied.

What else you should know:

Petitioners should submit the required $100,000 payment using pay.gov according to the instructions available here. Petitioners must complete payment prior to filing a petition with USCIS and will be required to submit proof of payment from pay.gov — or proof of an exception from the Secretary of Homeland Security — in order to complete the filing process. Without proof of payment or proof of an exception, petitions subject to the $100,000 fee will be denied. Talk to an immigration attorney if you have questions about the payment.

Trump has instructed the State Department to warn B-1 and B-2 visa holders against misusing their current status to avoid the $100,000 fine. We are still waiting for more specific guidance — but in the meantime, B-1 and B-2 visa holders who anticipate filing an H-1B application should consult legal counsel.

📝 The American Immigration Lawyers’ Association has a helpful fact sheet with even more information about the new fine.

Proposed changes to the H-1B lottery system

On September 24, 2025, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to replace the current H-1B lottery system for H-1B cap-subject petitions with a weighted selection process, prioritizing higher-paid foreign workers. Here’s what we know:

Under the new system, each H-1B petition will be assigned to one of four wage levels, and each wage level will be given a specific number of entries into the selection pool. As a result, high-wage earners (Level 4) will be four times as likely to receive an H-1B visa in comparison to low-wage earners (Level 1).

➡️ Where do you fit in? To make a determination, the Department of Labor will look at your occupation, position requirements, and geographic location.

Please note: This is just a proposal and it still has to go through a one-month commenting period before the Trump administration makes a final decision. This could take months.

What can we expect in the coming months?

Under the Trump administration, it appears that the future of the $100,000 H-1B fee will be decided in the courts. In recent days, a national coalition of labor unions and immigrant justice organizations filed the first legal challenge to Trump’s proclamation. Not long afterwards, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced a lawsuit of its own. Where does this leave immigrant workers? The answer is unclear, and it could take months before a final decision is reached.

International Students

For international students, the path forward is uncertain. Those who have lost their status are forced to transfer schools and leave the country. Those who have lost their visas are effectively trapped in the U.S. — unable to return home for weddings, funerals, or cultural holidays without giving up their studies.

What about federal litigation? Students and immigration advocates filed more than 100 legal challenges against the Trump administration in response to its SEVIS termination policy. Many of them are still in process. Others have granted at least temporary relief to affected students.

All of this appears to have made a difference. In April 2025, ICE declared that it will cease the terminations of SEVIS records. Just a few weeks later, a federal district court judge in the Northern District of California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction, putting a stop to ICE’s arbitrary termination of the SEVIS records and calling for the restoration of all SEVIS records.

Continuous vetting and consular review

The Trump administration has also expanded screening and vetting for visa applicants. infrastructure for monitoring international students and other visa-holders.

The process is even more intensive for F-1 visa applicants. Starting on June 18, 2025, all FMJ applicants are expected to make their social media accounts public, to allow consular officers to review your entire online presence. Should you refuse, officials could reject your visa application on the grounds of “evasiveness.”

Other important considerations

Trump’s travel ban on 19 countries — including four Asian and Pacific Island nations — restricts people from around the world from traveling to the U.S. for business, tourism, or even tourism. Though it doesn’t revoke visas from current students, it does stop their families from visiting and attending their graduation ceremonies.

Secretary Rubio has announced plans to enhance screening for F-1 visa applicants from China or Hong Kong and revoke visas from Chinese students who are either connected to the Chinese Communist Party or majoring in “critical fields.” For the hundreds of thousands of Chinese international students at U.S. colleges and universities, the implications are profound.

ℹ️ What do Trump’s travel restrictions and screening policies mean for your travel plans? Read our blog post to find out.

A new proposal from Secretary Noem replaces F-1 “duration of status” — which lets international students remain in the U.S. so long as they are in school — with a “fixed period of stay” (e.g., four years). For students who change programs, or whose studies take longer than anticipated, this means leaving the country or going through the application process for a second time.

💡 Stop AAPI Hate submitted a public comment in opposition to this proposal for placing undue burden on international students.

Another proposal limits “third-country national” (TCN) visa processing, which allows international students to renew their visas in a country that isn’t their home country. Now, students will have to return to their home countries, which can be far more expensive and time-consuming than traveling to Canada or Mexico, for example. And for students from countries with long visa processing times or political conflict, this will make it even harder to continue their U.S. studies.

Around 70 white South Africans were relocated to the U.S. in two groups in May and June in what U.S. officials described as the start of the program.
Approximately 400 white South Africans in total have reportedly been moved to the U.S. already.
There are around 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa's population of 62 million, which is more than 80 per cent Black.
Guerline Jozef, director of immigration for Haitian Bridge Alliance, called the new cap ""white supremacy disguised as refugee policy.""","President Donald Trump is slashing the number of refugees allowed into the United States, and people fleeing war-torn countries, human rights abuses and catastrophes will now be of lower priority than white people from South Africa.

The Trump administration is cutting the number of refugee places to as few as 7,500, for the 2026 fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, down from a limit of 125,000 last year under the Biden administration.

The White House did not provide a reason for the drastically lower numbers, which were published in a notice on the Federal Register, but this new cap sets a historic low for refugees being admitted to the U.S. since the program's inception in 1980.

The notice was published on Sept. 30 but became official on Thursday.

It states admission will ""primarily be allocated"" to the Afrikaner white minority from South Africa, which Trump and some of his supporters allege face ""race-based"" discrimination and violence at home — even claiming, without reliable evidence, that they are at risk of ""genocide.""

But Afghans fleeing persecution under the Taliban, including women facing gender-based violence under the Islamist regime, people escaping the war in Sudan or gang violence in places like Haiti were not considered priorities under the new policy, only Afrikaners.

Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), says the U.S. government is ""politicizing a humanitarian program"" and giving special privilege to Afrikaners.

""It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,"" Aly said in a statement.

Trump policy follows unsubstantiated claims

Aly said this latest order shows ""how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world.""

IRAP is already suing the Trump administration after the president signed an executive order, on his first day in office earlier this year, indefinitely suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program until it ""aligns with the interests"" with the country.

But months later, Trump began opening the door to white South Africans, announcing a new program earlier this year to fast-track the relocation of Afrikaner farmers making unsubstantiated claims they were being subjected to systematic violence.

The South African government has strongly denied this.

Around 70 white South Africans were relocated to the U.S. in two groups in May and June in what U.S. officials described as the start of the program.

Approximately 400 white South Africans in total have reportedly been moved to the U.S. already.

The Washington Post, citing unnamed officials, reported that the U.S. State Department ""has set a goal of processing 2,000 Afrikaners for resettlement by the end of October and an additional 4,000 by the end of November.""

There are around 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa's population of 62 million, which is more than 80 per cent Black.

Afrikaners, who were at the heart of the country's apartheid system of racial segregation that lasted from 1948 until 1994, are today represented in every facet of South African life and are successful business leaders, some of the country's best-known athletes and also serve in government.

Lowering 'our moral standing'

By comparison, among the top countries of origin for the more than 100,000 refugees admitted into the U.S. in 2024 were the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan and Syria — countries that have endured years of horrific violence.

Putting the focus on one group ""undermines the [refugee] program's purpose as well as its credibility,"" said Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Global Refuge, a U.S.-based resettlement agency.

""This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" she said in a statement on the group's website.

The advocacy group Human Rights First called the policy ""blatantly racist.""

“Turning our back on hundreds of thousands of truly at-risk refugees fleeing religious, political, and other forms of persecution defies decades of bipartisan support for welcoming the vulnerable, from Vietnamese to Afghan allies,” Uzra Zeya, the organization's president and a former U.S. State Department official, said in a statement.

Guerline Jozef, director of immigration for Haitian Bridge Alliance, called the new cap ""white supremacy disguised as refugee policy.""

""At a time when Black refugees from Haiti, Sudan, the Congo and Cameroon are drowning at sea, languishing in detention or being deported to death, the U.S. government has decided to open its arms to those who already enjoy global privilege,"" she said, according to The Independent.

Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, which advocates for resettling at-risk Afghans, described the decision Thursday as a ""horrendous betrayal.""

""I think we need to face facts. This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,"" he said in a video posted on Instagram.

Kennedy Jr. encouraging the Trump administration to reinstate workers at the Office of Population Affairs (OPA), who were illegally fired on October 15.

OPA administers key programs like Title X, which provides essential family planning services to 2.8 million people, and which was first introduced in 1970 by then-Congressman George H.W. Bush of Texas’ Seventh Congressional District. OPA also administers the Teen Pregnancy Prevention program and provides resources to expand access to embryo donation and adoption as a family building option for families with fertility obstacles.

The letter can be found in its entirety below and here.

""We write to express our grave concern at the recent actions by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to terminate nearly the entire staff at the Office of Population Affairs (OPA). The OPA oversees the nation’s only federal program dedicated to family planning, the Title X program, among other vital reproductive health programs. These firings will severely undermine the functionality of the office, hindering the Title X program’s ability to operate effectively, and threatening the loss of health care for many of the millions of people that these programs support annually.

""On October 10, all but one of the 50 employees at the OPA lost access to their government email accounts. Five days later, they received confirmation from human resources that they were subject to a reduction in force (RIF).

""These RIFs are another example of this Administration’s ongoing assault on the Title X program, birth control, and reproductive health care access more broadly. Earlier this year, HHS illegally withheld $65 million in Congressionally appropriated funding for the Title X program from 16 grantees with grants in 23 states, threatening essential health care access for an estimated 842,000 people, or 30 percent of all Title X patients. Nine of the impacted Title X grantees have yet to have their funding restored seven months later. Many of these affected grantees struggle to sustain the financial burden caused by the extended delay in funding and the ongoing attacks on reproductive health care from this Administration and Congressional Republicans. As a result, they have been forced to close health centers, lay off staff, and reduce available services. As we pass week three of a government shutdown and as Republicans refuse to address the health care crisis they created, the President’s FY2026 budget proposal and House Republicans’ partisan spending bill would only make the situation worse by seeking to eliminate the Title X program entirely.

""For more than 50 years, Title X has served as a cornerstone of safety-net care. Title X-funded health centers are lifelines in their communities, providing high-quality family planning and sexual health care, including cancer screenings, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, HIV testing, contraceptive services and supplies, pregnancy testing, and other essential health care services.

""The bipartisan Title X program, championed by then-Congressman George H.W. Bush and signed into law by President Nixon, served 2.8 million people in 2023.

The RIFed OPA employees are essential to administering these grants, and without them clinics will be left without the needed support to continue to provide the Title X program’s critical services.

""Undermining the federal government’s ability to effectively administer the Title X program funds will unquestionably result in the loss of health care for patients who depend on it.

In a statement, the administration says it has deported 527,000 illegal migrants since President Trump took office in January.

""More than 2 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. including 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and over 527,000 deportations,” said Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “DHS, ICE and CBP, have not just closed the border, but made historic strides to carry out President Trump’s promise of arresting and deporting illegal aliens who have invaded our country.”

In addition, DHS points out that the US is offering illegal migrants $1,000 and a free flight if they self-deport, noting if they do so, they “reserve the chance to come back to the U.S. the right, legal way to live the American dream.”

However, the New Republic notes that the deportation number is “unverifiable, and almost certainly inaccurate, given that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not updated its arrest statistics since January.”

Border Patrol Set to Play Bigger Role in ICE Offices

There are also leadership shakeups in the pipeline.

According to reports, the Trump Administration plans to reassign 12 ICE field office directors and replace at least some of them with officials from U.S. Border Patrol. NewsNation says that the changes are being made in Denver, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Phoenix, and San Diego.

The move to give Border Patrol greater responsibility on immigration raids could mark a new phase in the Trump Administration’s deportation plan.

As NBC News notes, “Border Patrol’s approach to recent arrests in major U.S. cities has been more aggressive, making large sweeps that have sparked some of the sharpest backlash from protesters and prompted lawsuits.”

And Fox News reports that the leadership shakeup shows growing division inside the Department of Homeland Security on how to proceed with ramping up deportations.

On one side, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, senior adviser Corey Lewandowski, and Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino are pushing for a “broader and more aggressive approach, targeting anyone in the U.S. illegally to boost deportation numbers.”

On the other ICE Director Todd Lyons and Border Czar Tom Homan are focusing on removing “criminal aliens and those with final deportation orders.”

""ICE started off with the worst of the worst, knowing every target they are hitting, but since Border Patrol came to LA in June, we’ve lost our focus, going too hard, too fast, with limited prioritization,"" one senior DHS official told Fox News. ""It’s getting numbers, but at what cost?""

Chuong Dong came to the U.S. from Vietnam as a 12-year-old refugee in 1980 and received a green card shortly thereafter. He pleaded guilty to robbery for stealing two speakers as a teen, spent some time in prison and was ordered deported in 1999. But Vietnam would not take him or anyone else back as a matter of policy, so he was told to check in with ICE annually, doing so with no issue for 25 years.

This past summer, he filed a motion based on a 2017 California law allowing a conviction to be vacated if the defendant can prove they did not understand the immigration implications of their plea. But as Dong awaited a hearing in that matter, he went to his most recent check-in in August, where ICE agents took him into custody, placing him into handcuffs as he said goodbye to his wife.

“I was pretty traumatized,” Dong said Tuesday. “I was scared because I’ve been out for 26 years, never been in trouble, you know? And I don’t understand why.”

Dong was taken to the Otay Mesa Detention Center for a month and three weeks, he said, then transferred to a facility in Bakersfield, awaiting deportation.

“I came here when I was young, very young,” he said, “And I don’t have family back there, so, you know, I don’t know what to do.”

“Difficult” was how his wife Christy Huynh – an American citizen – described the months without him, breaking into tears. “I basically do everything by myself.”

Dong and Huynh work together inspecting hospital construction projects. She took on his work, paid their bills alone and fought his case.

“There’s a lot of times, like, I want to give up because I was under very, like – a lot, a lot of stress,” Huynh said. “But I just hide in some corner and then cry my stress out. Cry a whole lot and then, OK, continue: I'm not going to give up on him.”

Days after he was detained, a San Diego County judge vacated Dong’s old deportable conviction. Any other old, non-deportable convictions were vacated as well, and his immigration attorney then filed to stop his removal proceedings. On Oct. 22, they found out he was coming home with his green card restored.

“The first thing I do is hold his hand because that's what we normally do when we’re in the car driving,” Huynh said. “We were like, ‘I still can't believe this happening,’ you know? There's so much joy.”

“I’m given a second chance at life, you know, to finish what I started,” Dong said.

“We take this as a major victory in, you know, what is otherwise pretty challenging times right now for immigration,” Dong’s immigration attorney Derek Poulsen said.

Poulsen said he’s seen many others in the same position, urging anyone in a similar position to explore their pathways.

“There's a lot of people that I speak with who actually do have a way to become legal in the United States, but they're so scared from current policy and everything that they see going on in the news that they don't even look to see what their options are,” he said, adding, “To reopen that case and to get them their green card back, I mean – that’s why we do what we do.”

Dong said he was in the detention center alongside many people from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia with old convictions like him.

“The people that I was in with, everyone had a story. But it wasn’t the worst of the worst,” Dong said. “It seemed like everybody give up.”

Dong and Huynh said they got home to San Diego at around 2 a.m. and turned around at 6 a.m. to head straight back to work on the inspection of a new skilled nursing facility in La Mesa, slated to be completed by November.

“I think I make it just in time to help my wife get the project done so the patients can move in and they have a home,” Dong said.

“We didn't really have time to celebrate yet,” he continued. “Maybe this weekend we can do something. Just a small get together with family.”

But since Dong never had paperwork before to leave the country and return, Huynh said they’ve never taken a vacation, so she has bigger plans: a family trip to Europe or Asia.

“He would always say, ‘Oh, I can YouTube and see everything,’” Huynh said. “But now that thinking has changed. He says, “I would love to go with you.’”

The couple said they have spent more than $70,000 on attorneys and legal fees trying to fix his status for several years, even before he was detained – a price they said was worth every penny.

“It's like, better than winning $1 million. Better than winning a lottery,” Huynh said. ""Nothing can compare to his freedom.”

“He’s the love of my life, you know? So I would never give up on him,” she continued. “If I had to do it again, I would do it again.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/10/chuong-dong.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-31 11:22:49.950777

CHICAGO (AP) — A Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois has been accused of blocking a federal agent’s vehicle during September protests outside an immigration enforcement building in suburban Chicago, according to court documents unsealed Wednesday.

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court blocked the order before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”",https://firstamendmentwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025-09-26T193700Z_946293913_RC2NZGAUM92W_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-CHICAGO.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 23:56:45.574956

(KABC) -- An ICE operation in Ontario turned violent Thursday morning after a man was shot by an ICE agent and then fled the scene. ICE said he tried to intervene in enforcement action and that's why they opened fire.

The shooting happened at around 6:30 a.m. in the 2800 block of South Vineyard Avenue.

ICE said that the man who was shot wasn't their original target.

They said they tried to conduct a traffic stop of the driver of a gray sedan when the driver of a Lexus SUV tried to intervene.

ICE said he drove up, turned around, threw his car in reverse and tried to run them over.

That's when an ICE agent opened fire, shooting out of the passenger window.

Video from AIR7 showed a sedan boxed in by an unmarked SUV and a pickup truck on South Vineyard Avenue. The street was shut down at the scene as the investigation continued, but it has reopened.

Ontario police responded to a ""request for emergency assistance"" after Department of Homeland Security officers were involved in a shooting, authorities said.

The request was made at 6:33 a.m. in the 2800 block of South Vineyard Avenue, the Ontario Police Department said in a statement, adding that its officers were not involved in the initial incident.

The location is in a residential neighborhood west of the Whispering Lakes Golf Course.

""Several Ontario Police Officers responded to the scene to provide traffic control and scene security while DHS conducted their investigation,"" the police department said in a statement. Homeland Security and the FBI were investigating the shooting.

The brother of the man who was shot spoke to Eyewitness News. He said he lives in the nearby mobile park and his brother ran in screaming that he'd been shot in the shoulder.

Police tape surrounded one of the residences on the property of the mobile home park and the Lexus SUV with a shattered window was parked near the home.

Family drove the man to the hospital where they say he's been released, but they now have no idea where he is. They also said he is a U.S. citizen.

Immigrants rights groups were furious over what happened.

""You have federal agents coming in with masked faces, and not having to identify themselves, not having to provide a warrant,"" said Javier Hernandez, the executive director for the Inland Coalition for Immigrant Justice.

""The systems that are supposed to protect us are no longer there,"" said Hernandez. ""When the Supreme Court says you can racially profile people, now you have U.S. citizens who are being racially profiled, you have here possibly a U.S. citizen that was shot today.""

Even though the man who they shot is a U.S. citizen, he was not the original target.

ICE did not provide any information on why they were conducting the vehicle stop, nor are they releasing information about the person who allegedly tried to ram them with their vehicle.

Resident Jane Westmoreland says there has been an increase in ICE sweeps in the area in recent months.

""At one time they were keeping the gates closed, and I was told by people who lived at the mobile park that they were doing that because ICE had come in without permission,"" said Westmoreland.

In a statement, ICE said in part ""This is another example of the threats our ICE officers are facing day-in and day-out as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals. ICE officers now face a 1000% increase in assaults them including cars being used as weapons and death threats against our agents are up 8000%.

""This violence must end. Let me be clear: Anyone who assaults, impedes, obstructs, or threatens the lives of federal officers will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

Congresswoman Norma Torres also released a statement saying ICE has refused to provide her office with official information despite multiple requests.

""There must be a full, transparent investigation with immediate updates. As we've seen in numerous incidents over the past several months, statements from the Department cannot be taken at face value,"" the statement read.

""Witness statements, body-camera footage, security footage, and all relevant information must be released so the public can judge for themselves what really happened.

Restore a credible pathway for offshore wind and other clean-energy projects by rescinding the OCS wind-leasing withdrawal and rescinded WEAs, enabling science-based projects that support jobs and coastal economies.","Washington, D.C. — Today, Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi joined over 100 lawmakers in demanding(link is external) President Trump and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum immediately cease any plans to open new offshore oil and gas leases(link is external) in U.S. federal waters off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, in the Arctic Ocean and northern Bering Sea off of Alaska, and in the Eastern Gulf. The lawmakers warned that opening these untouched coastlines to new offshore drilling would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans’ health and safety at risk, hurting people across the political spectrum.

By reversing long-standing legal protections for vulnerable coastal waters, new offshore leases would cause significant environmental damage to communities already reeling from natural disasters and recent oil spills. Oil spills not only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies, and weaken coastal infrastructure. Already, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is forced to respond to over 150 oil and chemical spills each year. One disastrous spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs, and ecosystem restoration.

These threats of expanded oil drilling come as the Administration already dismantled(link is external) NOAA’s oil spill prevention and response programs, as almost 30 percent of the team in charge of addressing oil spills has been laid off or took early retirement. The Emergency Response Division team and the oil spill program are slated to lose half their funding(link is external) from the Administration’s proposed FY 2026 budget.

“This is a matter of national consequence for coastal communities across the country, regardless of political affiliation. It puts our economies, national security, and our most vulnerable ecosystems at severe risk,” wrote the lawmakers. “… Expanded oil and gas leasing poses risks to the health and livelihoods of our constituents, jeopardizes our tourism, fishing, and recreation economies, and threatens the marine life that inhabits our coastlines.”

“The United States already leads the world in oil and gas production. The industry currently holds more than 2,000 offshore leases covering over 12 million acres of federal waters — yet fewer than 500 of those leases are actively producing oil and gas,” continued the lawmakers. “There is no justification for opening vast swaths of our oceans to leasing when existing leases remain largely unused, while imposing mounting environmental and economic costs on coastal communities.”

Additionally, the Department of Defense (DOD) previously warned that oil and gas leases in portions of the Eastern Gulf would impact areas critical to our military readiness, including for military training and testing opportunities and assets. DOD has also signaled that parts of the Mid-Atlantic and South Atlantic Planning Areas are “not compatible with oil and gas activities and infrastructure.”

The lawmakers condemned the potential expansion of offshore drilling while the Administration simultaneously curtails offshore wind and clean energy development. This year, the Trump Administration has withdrawn(link is external) all outer continental offshore wind leases, rescinded all designated Wind Energy Areas(link is external), and eliminated $679 million(link is external) in offshore-wind-related port infrastructure funding, including over $426 million for Humboldt Bay offshore wind infrastructure.

Specifically, the lawmakers demanded that President Trump and Secretary Burgum:

Halt any steps toward new offshore oil and gas leasing in the Atlantic, Pacific, off the coast the Arctic and Bering Sea coasts of Alaska, and the Eastern Gulf.

Limit offshore drilling, consistent with previous statutory and agency protections.

Prioritize coastal resilience, including expanded storm-surge and flood protection, restoration of wetlands and sand dunes, and early-warning systems, so that communities in Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas, New Jersey, Alaska, and beyond are better protected.

Restore a credible pathway for offshore wind and other clean-energy projects by rescinding the OCS wind-leasing withdrawal and rescinded WEAs, enabling science-based projects that support jobs and coastal economies.

“Our coastal communities, fishermen, small business owners, Tribal Nations, tourism operators, and families cannot be sacrificed in the name of short-term drilling booms,” concluded the lawmakers. “Opening new offshore lease areas while cancelling clean energy progress is potentially illegal, a failure of leadership, and a dereliction of the public trust.”",http://pelosi.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/pelosi.house.gov/files/featured_image/Speaker%20Emerita%20Full%20Screen.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 23:56:49.008916

The admissions allocation focus on white Afrikaners expands on Trump’s commitment in an executive order this year to resettle what he described as “Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation,"" even as he paused refugee admissions.
The new refugee cap is a dramatic shift from the Biden administration's 125,000 target for refugees and a marked decline from the record low cap of 15,000 refugees in Trump's first administration.
The Trump administration in May welcomed dozens of white South Africans to the United States as part of its resettlement effort while it barred refugees from most other countries, including Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar.
""The Administration has brazenly ignored the statutory requirement to consult with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees before setting the annual refugee admissions ceiling.","The Trump administration dramatically slashed the refugee admissions cap for the new fiscal year starting this month at 7,500, the lowest on record, according to a Federal Register memo posted Thursday.

The memo, dated Sept. 30, said the admissions numbers “shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa,” a white ethnic minority group that controlled South Africa during apartheid, as well as ""other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.""

The admissions allocation focus on white Afrikaners expands on Trump’s commitment in an executive order this year to resettle what he described as “Afrikaner refugees escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination, including racially discriminatory property confiscation,"" even as he paused refugee admissions.

The new refugee cap is a dramatic shift from the Biden administration's 125,000 target for refugees and a marked decline from the record low cap of 15,000 refugees in Trump's first administration. The notice said the new ceiling ""is justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.""

The average ceiling for refugees for both Democratic and Republican administrations has historically hovered at 95,000.

The new action follows the South African-born Elon Musk's frequent criticism of the country's land ownership laws against white farmers when he was advising Trump this year in the Department of Government Efficiency.

In his criticism, Musk has highlighted the passage of President Cyril Ramaphosa's Expropriation Act, which allows the government to seize private property, at times without compensation, in certain circumstances ""for a public purpose or in the public interest.""

Trump’s executive order this year also ended U.S. aid to South Africa, much of which is funneled into the country’s HIV/AIDS program, accusing the South African officials of “confiscating land” from minority farmers “and treating certain classes of people very badly.”

Top Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary committees, including Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois and Alex Padilla of California, have criticized Trump for the move, saying the new cap was announced without consultation with Congress.

“This bizarre presidential determination is not only morally indefensible, it is illegal and invalid,"" they said in a statement Thursday. ""The Administration has brazenly ignored the statutory requirement to consult with the House and Senate Judiciary Committees before setting the annual refugee admissions ceiling. That process exists to ensure that decisions of such great consequence reflect our nation’s values, our humanitarian commitments, and the rule of law, not the racial preferences or political whims of any one president.""

This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,” he said in a video posted on Instagram.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is restricting the number of refugees admitted annually to the United States to 7,500 and they will mostly be white South Africans, a dramatic drop announced Thursday that effectively suspends America's traditional role as a haven for those fleeing war and persecution.

The move cements a major shift in policy toward refugees that aligns with the Republican administration’s broader goals of keeping out foreigners whom it deems a risk to the nation’s security or a threat to U.S. jobs. That shift has meant increased immigration enforcement, in cities and at borders and entry points, in what’s become a vastly changed landscape in a country long seen as a beacon for migrants.

No reason was given for the new numbers, which were published in a notice on the Federal Register and are a steep decrease from last year’s ceiling of 125,000 set under Democratic President Joe Biden. The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.

The notice said the admission of the 7,500 refugees during the 2026 budget year, which began Oct. 1, was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.” It made no mention of any other specific groups to be admitted besides the white South Africans, known also as Afrikaners.

""Other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands” will be considered as refugees, according to the notice, which gave no specifics on who that could entail.

The lower cap represents another blow for the long-standing refugee program that until recently enjoyed bipartisan support.

Groups denounce the historically low cap

Groups that work to resettle refugees said the announcement was an abdication of the country's historic role in welcoming refugees from around the world.

“This decision doesn’t just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, President and CEO of Global Refuge, one of the nationwide resettlement agencies. “To concentrate the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program’s purpose as well as its credibility.”

Trump suspended the refugee program on his first day in office and since then only a trickle have entered the country, mostly white South Africans. Some refugees have also been admitted as part of a court case seeking to allow entry to refugees who were overseas and in the process of coming to the U.S. when the program was suspended.

The International Refugee Assistance Project, which sued over the program's suspension, said in a statement that refugees waiting to be admitted to the U.S. have already gone through rigorous security checks and are stuck in dangerous conditions.

“By privileging Afrikaners while continuing to ban thousands of refugees who have already been vetted and approved, the administration is once again politicizing a humanitarian program,"" said the group's president, Sharif Aly.

Other nationalities, including Afghans, are left out

The administration announced the program for the Afrikaners in February, saying that white South African farmers faced discrimination and violence at home. The South African government strongly denied it.

Presidents have the authority to set the cap on refugee admissions as they see fit, often taking input from the State Department or consulting with the refugee resettlement agencies. This cap would set a historic low of refugees admitted to the U.S. since the program's inception in 1980.

During his first term, Trump progressively set the cap increasingly lower each year until it reach 15,000 in the last year of his administration.

The determinations usually lay out which regions of the world the refugees will come from over the upcoming year.

Left out from Thursday's notice were Afghans, many of whom have been trying to flee the Taliban after the U.S. withdrawal there in 2021.

A separate program for Afghans who worked closely with the U.S. government is still admitting Afghans into the country. But tens of thousands of others who also contributed to the U.S. mission there have been trying to emigrate to America via the refugee program and this year have been largely shut out.

Shawn VanDiver, president of #AfghanEvac, which advocates for resettling at-risk Afghans, described the decision Thursday as a “horrendous betrayal.”

“I think we need to face facts. This means that the president and the White House ... are not going to allow Afghan refugees to come here,” he said in a video posted on Instagram. “This is a really bad day.”

""PCUN condemns ICE and their racist, violent and arbitrary enforcement in our neighborhoods. From what we understand right now, our partners are working to support our community members,"" said a statement from the farmworker union and organization.

Lopez described the city as a ghost town because of ICE activity. The arrests are terrorizing the community, she said.

If they choose to undermine free elections, weaponize the justice system or dismantle the social contract, they will be held accountable through lawful political means.
Democrats must put the Trump administration on notice that the era of impunity will end soon — and no Supreme Court can protect them from that.","President Donald Trump keeps getting away with it. He’s survived two impeachments, multiple criminal charges (and one conviction) and several unlawful and unconstitutional actions in the first few months of his second term.

Thinking too much about that can lead to despair about the future of the country. How can we hope to repair the damage Trump is doing on a daily basis if we can’t hold him accountable?

But Trump isn’t doing these things alone. From billionaire supporters such as Elon Musk to top advisers such as Stephen Miller to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carrying out his deportations, the president is dependent on other people to carry out his agenda.

That points to a tactic that Democrats need to embrace: Put all of Trump’s happy helpers on notice. The Supreme Court may have decided that the president has broad immunity, but that’s not the case for Musk, Miller and the masked men terrorizing Chicago.

Democrats need to make it clear to every one of those underlings that they will be held accountable.

That’s why Democrats in Congress and in governors’ mansions and state legislatures need to make it clear to every one of those underlings that they will be held accountable — if not today, then one day soon.

Some Democrats realize this. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker created the Illinois Accountability Commission to document interactions between ICE agents and Chicagoans during Operation Midway Blitz and held them accountable. Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell told Federal Communications Chairman Brendan Carr and his staff to “get a lawyer and save your records” for a future hearing on their dealings when Democrats hope to hold the House majority in 2027.

The nation has endured a sustained shock to its democratic system. We are drowning in chaos, so much so that this week alone marks the fifth week of a government shutdown. Forty million people are at risk of losing food benefits and ICE agents are operating like Trump’s modern-day Gestapo. The abuses of power, the legal intimidation campaigns, the politicized prosecutions and the cruelty on display from immigration enforcement have piled up so relentlessly that many Americans have begun to treat the unacceptable as routine.

Authoritarian behavior has crept into everyday governance. It has been normalized. This normalization presents a profound and irreversible danger. Someone must break this trance and say what is obvious. And the only political entity with the legitimacy and structure to deliver that alarm is the Democratic Party.

Democratic senators and representatives have to create their own bullhorn of accountability — raging against not just the illiberal and unconstitutional behavior of a rogue president, but also making it very clear to everyone inside and outside the Trump administration that they will be held accountable for their actions. Period.

Democratic leadership must warn every official, every aide, every lawyer and every strategist that their decisions will not be forgotten.

Democratic leadership must directly and publicly warn every official, every aide, every lawyer and every strategist who participates in attacks on democratic institutions that their decisions will not be forgotten. Their conduct will be scrutinized. If they choose to undermine free elections, weaponize the justice system or dismantle the social contract, they will be held accountable through lawful political means.

The American people are waiting. They are looking to Democrats, expecting them to defend access to health care and a strong social safety net, yes; but also, the foundations of the republic: representative government and the rule of law. Republicans have abandoned these commitments, repeatedly promising to “fix” health care, only to repeatedly oppose expanding Medicaid and affordable coverage options, while offering no comprehensive alternative to rising medical costs or gaps in access. Republicans have also sat silently and often complicitly in the destruction of the symbols of our nation, the upending of constitutional norms, the erasure of our civil liberties and the efforts to steal congressional seats.

The question for Democratic leaders is simple: Are you ready to wage the kind of politics the moment demands? Are you prepared to impose accountability on those who would dismantle our democracy for their own gain? Are you prepared to show your fellow citizens that the days of consequence-free corruption in Washington are over?

Courts alone cannot protect our democratic institutions. A lone politician with a sharply worded letter cannot reverse institutional decay. Only a collective force, organized and relentless, can confront this assault on democracy and put accountability back on the table.

Democrats must put the Trump administration on notice that the era of impunity will end soon — and no Supreme Court can protect them from that.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251030-jb-pritzker-zz-a6d344.jpg",N,,2025-10-31 01:56:43.011431

UPDATE: This post was updated at 12:20 p.m. on October 30, 2025.

Two SUNY Upstate Medical University employees were detained by United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on Wednesday.

The men were taken into custody before entering immigration court hearings to finalize their legal status, the Civil Service Employees Association said in a release.

Both employees worked in the environmental services department at SUNY Upstate, a state-owned hospital in Syracuse. They have worked in New York state since 2022 and 2024, respectively, according to CSEA.

In a Thursday morning statement to The Daily Orange, a SUNY Upstate spokesperson said, to their knowledge, the employees had the legal authority to live and work in the U.S. and were “productive members of the community.”

“These hard-working employees are an integral part of our hospital’s Environmental Services team which we depend upon to maintain a safe environment for patient care,” the spokesperson said. “They are a respected part of the Upstate family, and we are working to support them.”

One employee is a CSEA member, while the other is represented by Upstate United University Professions.

In a Wednesday night statement to The D.O., UUP President Frederick Kowal said the union would “stand shoulder to shoulder” with its members, fighting for the right to due process.

“(The men) acted in good faith to finalize their legal status,” Kowal said. “But as we have seen over and over under the anti-immigrant regime in place in Washington D.C., they were met with handcuffs.”

In its statement, CSEA said it stands in solidarity with the workers and called the detainment of people following the legal process “unjust” and “inhumane.”

“They are part of our Upstate family, they are our co-workers, our neighbors, and valued contributors to the hospital and community,” CSEA President Mary Sullivan said in the statement. “No one should be punished for following the law. Our union members and all hospital employees deserve dignity, respect and the chance to live and work without fear.”

The reason ICE detained the employees is “unclear,” Kowal said, and they are currently being held in a federal detention facility in Batavia, awaiting potential deportation.

ICE did not immediately respond to The D.O.’s request for comment.

The current rule gives immigrants a period of 540 days for their permit to renew automatically while their documents are pending.

Now, the new process, which targets Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization, calls for stricter vetting. USCIS said the new rule is meant to ""deter fraud"" and ""detect aliens with potentially harmful intent so they can be processed for removal from the United States.""

“USCIS is placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting, eliminating policies the former administration implemented that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security,” said USCIS Director Joseph Edlow in a written statement. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended. All aliens must remember that working in the United States is a privilege, not a right.”

The USCIS is recommending that immigrants renew their work permits promptly, which includes filing for renewal 180 days before expiration.

“The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation,” USCIS said.

Any individual who filed to renew their Automatic Extension of Employment Authorization after Oct. 30 will not receive the automatic renewal. However, the new rule does not impact those who extended their permit before that date.

There are some exceptions to the new rule, according to the USCIS, which include extensions provided by law or through a Federal Register notice for TPS-related employment documentation.

DHS secretary grilled on housing children in unlicensed facilities by joint legislative committee

Maryland's Department of Human Services secretary was on the hot seat Wednesday before a joint legislative committee.DHS Secretary Rafael Lopez admitted to serious problems that he said the department is moving with urgency to fix, including housing children in unlicensed facilities, such as hotels.Members of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee expressed skepticism as DHS vowed to work on all of the problems with urgency. Lopez backed up that pledge by outlining steps that are already underway, as well as a strategy moving forward. Despite facing tough questions, Lopez seemed to cool the room temperature with his answers.""It is unacceptable when individuals who act as our caregivers don't have full background checks,"" Lopez said. ""System defects should not be barriers to delivering the highest standards of service and excellence.""Auditors discovered the administration was not aware of seven registered sex offenders who had the same address as an approved guardianship home housing 10 children. The review uncovered one person who was convicted of murder in 1990 who worked in the system. That conviction should have prohibited his employment there.""We found the (Social Services Administration) did not ensure that adults convicted of these crimes were not residing at homes approved for the guardianship program,"" said Ed Rubinstein, an auditor.Auditors also posed a question as Lopez waited for his turn to speak.""How can we affect change in a timely manner? In particular, in situations that impact the most vulnerable people of our society?"" said Brian Tanen, a legislative auditor.After the death of a 16-year-old foster child who was living in a Downtown Baltimore hotel, DHS adjusted its policy to prohibit stays at hotels, offices and unlicensed providers; hospitals will be added to the list later.A report revealed that four days after the directive, a child stayed overnight at a Baltimore City Department of Social Services office. House Republicans have since called on Gov.

Maryland's Department of Human Services secretary was on the hot seat Wednesday before a joint legislative committee.

DHS Secretary Rafael Lopez admitted to serious problems that he said the department is moving with urgency to fix, including housing children in unlicensed facilities, such as hotels.

Members of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee expressed skepticism as DHS vowed to work on all of the problems with urgency. Lopez backed up that pledge by outlining steps that are already underway, as well as a strategy moving forward. Despite facing tough questions, Lopez seemed to cool the room temperature with his answers.

""It is unacceptable when individuals who act as our caregivers don't have full background checks,"" Lopez said. ""System defects should not be barriers to delivering the highest standards of service and excellence.""

Auditors discovered the administration was not aware of seven registered sex offenders who had the same address as an approved guardianship home housing 10 children. The review uncovered one person who was convicted of murder in 1990 who worked in the system. That conviction should have prohibited his employment there.

""We found the (Social Services Administration) did not ensure that adults convicted of these crimes were not residing at homes approved for the guardianship program,"" said Ed Rubinstein, an auditor.

Auditors also posed a question as Lopez waited for his turn to speak.

""How can we affect change in a timely manner? In particular, in situations that impact the most vulnerable people of our society?"" said Brian Tanen, a legislative auditor.

After the death of a 16-year-old foster child who was living in a Downtown Baltimore hotel, DHS adjusted its policy to prohibit stays at hotels, offices and unlicensed providers; hospitals will be added to the list later.

A report revealed that four days after the directive, a child stayed overnight at a Baltimore City Department of Social Services office. House Republicans have since called on Gov. Wes Moore to fire Lopez.

The secretary responded, saying the new policy is working and there is now an emphasis on matching children with relatives.

""The kids who are no longer in hotels from the last couple of weeks, they are placed with Maryland-based providers,"" Lopez said. ""Part of that is how we engage with providers and set expectations. All that, as imperfect as it seems, is new for how we are approaching it in Maryland.""

Lopez said the agency inherited many of the problems upon taking over in 2023.

""We have moved with urgency to challenge the status quo by implementing systemic fixes both before and after the audit, but we are moving with urgency to try to resolve these,"" Lopez said.

In a statement, Eastern Shore Delegate Steve Arentz, R-District 36, the committee's only Republican House member, said, in part:

A group of 20 Democratic AGs and the Governor of Kentucky obtained a preliminary injunction barring the U.S. Department of Agriculture from withholding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding during ongoing litigation over USDA's demand that states disclose information from SNAP records about applicants and recipients. USDA had notified states that it would withhold significant SNAP funds from any state that failed to comply with its data-sharing requirement.

In its order granting the preliminary injunction, the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of California found that the plaintiff states had demonstrated: a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that USDA's data-sharing demand and threatened disallowance of funding violated the SNAP Act; that they were likely to incur irreparable harm if SNAP funds were withheld; and that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored injunctive relief.

We previously covered the filing of the complaint and the court's issuance of a temporary restraining order against USDA.

St. Louis County Sheriff Gordon Ramsay said agents with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Border Patrol joined members of the Lake Superior Violent Offenders Task Force during a drug bust at a Hibbing restaurant off East 18th Street and Third Avenue East just after noon.

Ramsay said one person was arrested for selling cocaine and illegal firearm possession as part of an ongoing investigation that began last month. The suspect was ""also in possession of several fake identification documents,"" according to Ramsay.

But after the arrest, a restaurant employee told Northern News Now ICE agents began detaining anyone without proper documents. It's unclear how many people were detained.

""The Sheriff's Office is aware that federal law enforcement took additional actions during this search warrant,"" Ramsay said. ""The federal investigation is independent of this case; therefore we have nothing further to add.""

Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem visited Minneapolis to discuss ICE operations in Minnesota, stating more than 4,300 people who were ""committing crimes and here illegally in this county"" have been arrested in the state since January. Noem said 3,316 of those arrestees have criminal histories.

Noem said ICE agents have been ""demonized"" in Minnesota, and more agents are headed to the state.

Earlier this month, an entire four-man roofing crew was arrested by ICE agents in a private backyard in St. Paul, Minnesota. An ICE spokesperson said three of the men had criminal records and were slated to be deported.

JB Pritzker has asked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to pause federal immigration enforcement operations around Halloween, after a neighborhood raid this week disrupted a children’s parade.

“No child should be forced to inhale tear gas or other chemical agents while trick or treating in their own neighborhood,” Pritzker wrote Wednesday in a letter to Noem, Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons and Border Patrol Commissioner Matthew Scott.

In the letter, Pritzker referenced the operation earlier this week on the northwest side of Chicago in which agents deployed tear gas as children were gathering for a costume parade.

The episode prompted a warning to ICE officials from a federal judge reviewing the actions of agents taking part in “Operation Midway Blitz,” the Trump administration’s surge of federal forces into the Chicago area, ostensibly to fight gangs.

In a Thursday news conference, Pritzker lambasted the crackdown, accusing agents of targeting innocent “Black and brown” people instead of “the worst of the worst” criminals, as Noem has previously said.

The IRS filed redacted emails and records requests as a part of the administrative record produced in a lawsuit brought by taxpayer advocacy groups including the Center for Taxpayer Rights and unions including the Communications Workers of America, AFL-CIO. The groups sought a preliminary injunction to halt IRS disclosure of taxpayer information to the Department of Government Efficiency.

The disclosures show IRS officials attempting to respond to a request the DOJ acknowledged was unprecedented, but also says falls within IRC Section 6103, the Tax Code provision intended to protect taxpayer information from unauthorized disclosure.

ICE requested the information pursuant to a carve-out in Section 6103 that allows information disclosures in the event an individual is under criminal investigation. This is one of several lawsuits challenging ICE’s requests for large data sets of taxpayer information at once.

The IRS responds to about 30,000 requests in a typical year. The requests have very specific rules, requiring the requesting agency provide the name, taxpayer number, and address of a person; the justification for seeking the record; and an agency head’s approval before the IRS responds.

ICE’s first request, for about 700,000 people who were under final orders of removal, came Feb. 18, according to an email from Guy Ficco, chief of the IRS’ criminal investigation division. A later email shows that information was requested by Caleb Vitello, who was acting director of ICE for several weeks.

An analysis sent back several days later by former IRS Deputy Commissioner Douglas W. O’Donnell, who has since retired, indicated the IRS “cannot provide information responsive to the request made,” citing Section 6103.

After a memorandum of understanding was signed in April, the agencies facilitated a secure large file transfer via Kiteworks. In June, ICE provided data for and requested the records of “the full alien population, which contains 7,615,279 records.” Acting IRS Chief Counsel Andrew De Mello determined there were several deficiencies and didn’t process the request.

After refinement, ICE officials came back with a set of 1,277,464 requests, sought by acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

A further request on June 27 returned just 3.7% matches; 93.7% didn’t match and 2.6% didn’t met specifications of the MOU. The IRS rejected the request if the record wasn’t at least 90 days old, according go an August 7 email from Lou Capece, coordinating director of infrastructure for the IRS.

The IRS indicated that about 47,000 records matched data in that request, depending on the date and time of the run. The messages don’t indicate how many were actually sent to ICE.

“There is no need for a press release or broad disclosure of the fact that this information is being provided and the MOU does not discuss any publicizing of the disclosure,” said Kenneth Kies, assistant secretary of the treasury for tax policy, in the last email in the record, which is dated Aug. 7.

The plaintiffs allege the disclosures violate the Tax Reform Act, the Privacy Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act.

“The dangers posed by these disclosures are real, imminent threats to core privacy rights,” Maddy Gitomer, counsel for the plaintiffs said. “The administration’s ongoing rush to execute this dangerous policy will have disastrous consequences if not stopped urgently.”

The IRS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

No one should be duped into thinking that charitable food programs can make up for the end of SNAP, which provides literally 10 times the dollar amount for food as does every charity in America.
Even before the shutdown, emergency food programs nationwide widely reported that they were unable to meet the current surging demand for food.","US elites tend to have a “normalcy bias” that allows them to believe our political leaders would never take actions so reckless, and so clearly detached from reality, that they would grievously harm the country.

Many elites simply couldn’t fathom that President George W. Bush would invade a sovereign nation based on false pretenses or that President Donald Trump would incite a violent riot to try to overturn democracy.

Likewise, elites were largely in denial about the grave threat to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)—formerly called the Food Stamp Program—during a showdown.

Prior to the shutdown, I warned some colleagues and elected officials that President Trump and congressional Republicans could use a shutdown as an excuse to deny up to 42 million SNAP recipients (and more than 260,000 neighborhood SNAP retailers) nationwide of $8 billion per month in grocery funds. Many assumed that I was exaggerating the threat and there was no way that our political system would allow something that disastrous to occur. But that is exactly what is playing out.

On the same day that Trump pledged to CNN that he would continue SNAP payments in November, his own Department of Agriculture (USDA) said the government wouldn’t. The next day, the USDA used its website to double down on the SNAP shutdown, using lies about immigrants and a false smear against transgender Americans in a partisan message that clearly violated the federal Hatch Act prohibition on using tax dollars for partisan purposes. Even if Trump or the GOP Congress or the Democratic attorneys general suing the government over the debacle succeed in ending the SNAP shutdown, there will still be a significant delay in the delivery of November’s SNAP benefits.

It wasn’t always this way. In the late 1960s and 1970s, prompted by Martin Luther King Jr.’s Poor People’s Campaign and widespread media coverage of the serious domestic hunger problem, a bipartisan coalition in Washington (including President Nixon, President Carter, conservative Republican Senator Robert Dole, and liberal Democratic Senator George McGovern) started the National School Breakfast Program and the Women, Infants, and Children Program for pregnant women and children under 5. Most significantly, they created the Food Stamp Program, which eventually enabled tens of millions of Americans to receive monthly benefits to help them afford groceries. Collectively, these programs worked spectacularly, almost entirely ending hunger in America.

But, starting in the 1980s, Ronald Reagan combined crushing unions and outsourcing middle-class jobs overseas with using racial dog whistles to demonize those receiving social safety net benefits. Building on the divisive but electorally successful rhetoric of George Wallace, Reagan decried “strapping young bucks” getting food stamps, and began to slash away at domestic food assistance.

The GOP intensified its racist rhetoric to undermine the social safety net during the time of the Obama administration, as Newt Gingrich called Obama the “food stamp president” and Senator Rick Santorum implied that non-white people were uniquely dependent upon food stamps (for the record, the plurality of SNAP recipients were then, and are today, white). Even the supposed moderate Republican Mitt Romney falsely accused Obama of eliminating work requirements for food stamps, which the GOP maintains are necessary into promote work for people in safety net programs even though data proves such requirements don’t increase employment and even though conservatives never impose such work requirements on programs that aid the wealthiest Americans.

The bipartisan anti-hunger coalition unraveled. In 2018, when the Paul Ryan–led US House voted to take billions of dollars’ worth of food from millions of SNAP recipients, not a single House Democrat voted for the bill, but 86 percent of House Republicans did.

Massive influxes of federal food and cash aid allotted by Democrats kept US hunger at bay during the economic recession caused by the pandemic. But after conservatives, including then–Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, allowed such assistance to expire, US hunger soared. The USDA found that the number Americans who lived in food-insecure households (meaning they were unable to afford a sufficient supply of food) jumped to 47 million people in 2023, a 40 percent increase over 2021. The number of food insecure Americans in 2023 exceeded the total populations of the states of Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and Virginia, combined.

Fully 17 percent of US children, 10 percent of employed adults, and 8 percent of older Americans lived in food-insecure households from 2021 to 2023, according to an analysis of USDA data from my organization, Hunger Free America.

The number of Americans who didn’t have enough to eat over two one-week periods increased by 55 percent between August/September 2021 and August/September 2024, according to our computation of Census Household Pulse Survey data.

Still, over this time period, many elites (even liberal ones) have celebrated the supposed overall health of the economy, ignoring that struggling Americans can’t eat a rising GDP. These same economic cheerleaders then scratched their heads when Americans voted against the Democratic administration, which they blamed (often incorrectly) for their troubles. With Trump back in the White House, advancing an openly racist agenda, it was only a matter of time before his administration took aim at the nutrition safety net.

We didn’t have to wait long. In their big ugly bill, Trump and his congressional GOP puppets slashed $186 billion out of SNAP, the deepest cut in history, citing the outrageously false charge that most SNAP spending is on “illegal aliens” and “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Not a single House or Senate Democrat voted for the bill, and of the tiny handful of GOP Members of Congress who voted against the bill, most did so because the SNAP cuts weren’t large enough. Contrary to their assertions, the vast majority of SNAP recipients harmed by the cuts are low-paid workers, children, people with disabilities, older Americans, and/or veterans. On top of all that, the Trump administration canceled more than 84 million pounds of food aid scheduled to be distributed by charities, many of which are faith-based.

Then, in an act of reality-denial fit for Noth Korea, the Trump administration ended USDA’s 27-year practice of collecting and publishing food insecurity data, citing variety of preposterous justifications for doing so. Its obvious that their real reason for eliminating this data is their desire to keep the public in the dark about how Trump’s failing tariff and other economic policies—combined with the massive food aid cuts—are causing US hunger to skyrocket even more exponentially. Obviously, the ostrich approach won’t end hunger.

Now nearly 42 million Americans nationwide may lose access to sufficient food. Not only would this create the greatest domestic hunger crises since the Great Depression; it would also wreak havoc on food retailers, perhaps even forcing some to lay off staff.

No one should be duped into thinking that charitable food programs can make up for the end of SNAP, which provides literally 10 times the dollar amount for food as does every charity in America. Even before the shutdown, emergency food programs nationwide widely reported that they were unable to meet the current surging demand for food.

The map below, complied by Hunger Free America using USDA and Census Bureau data, shows the percentage of each state’s population that relies on SNAP. In red states like Louisiana, Oklahoma, and West Virginia, more than 15 percent of the population relies on SNAP. More than 10 percent of residents receive SNAP in Alabama, Kentucky, North Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, Texas, South Carolina, and Missouri.

Ad Policy

Many SNAP recipients are Trump supporters and Republican voters. It’s no wonder that key GOP leaders and MAGA acolytes have starting pivoting away from lambasting SNAP to defending it as key to helping the “vulnerable,” incorrectly blaming Democrats for halting it.

So, where do we go from here?

While progressives should push governors and state legislatures to take emergency steps to ameliorate the impact of the shutdown, the only real solution is to pressure Trump and congressional Republicans to compromise with the Democrats on a plan that both reopens the federal government and prevents tens of millions of Americans from suffering from huge spikes in their healthcare premiums.

After all, if people have to spend hundreds of more dollars per month on healthcare, they will have far less to spend of food, so those premium hikes would also increase hunger. That’s why this healthcare fight is also an anti-hunger fight. We must all hang tough and win.

Beyond that, progressives should consistently and forcefully advocate for transforming our nation’s policies and programs in order to ensure an “Opportunity Society,” in which people who work hard don’t just get by but actually get ahead. We must build upon a reliance on means-tested programs aimed at mostly the impoverished in order to also focus more broadly on helping a wide array of Americans with universal programs, as well as comprehensive policies to help struggling Americans transition from owing debts and paying interest (and losing wealth) to owning assets—such as homes, small businesses, and savings—that earn interest (and accumulate wealth).

The most effective—and most political popular—policies need to restore the American dream for both the middle class and then tens of millions of American struggling to rise into the middle class. America can achieve normalcy again only when we have society that works for everyone.",https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1186596424.jpeg,N,,2025-10-30 21:04:08.230820

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the WRAP until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

""I think it's very problematic,"" Van Hollen told The Associated Press. ""They want to keep the public in the dark.""

The senators' letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people — sometimes for hours — on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, and six others.

The WRAP is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the WRAP's use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.

""When an organization like DHS doesn't want transparency, it's because they don't want people to know what they're doing,"" Van Hollen said, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency.

In addition to the letter, U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., told AP in a statement that she is working on a bill to rein in the agency's use of the WRAP.

""ICE's use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,"" Ramirez said.

DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the WRAP. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said that ICE's practices ""align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.""

The AP found that DHS has paid the manufacturer of the WRAP, Safe Restraints Inc., $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.

ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it's not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

In addition to reporting on ICE's use of the device, the AP identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined ""restraint"" played a role in the death.

Chanthila ""Shawn"" Souvannarath, 44, was deported on Friday, according to his attorneys, a day after a federal judge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, told U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to keep him in the country so that he could present what the judge called a ""substantial claim of U.S. citizenship.""

Souvannarath was born in a refugee camp in Thailand but has lived most of his life in the U.S. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the judge's order keeping him in the country ""was not served"" to ICE until after Souvannarath had been deported.

""To the media's chagrin, there was no mistake,"" McLaughlin said in a statement.

DHS and ICE did not respond to questions from The Associated Press seeking additional details on the timeline and how officials receive federal court orders.

The American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing Souvannarath, asked U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick to order his immediate return to the U.S., calling the deportation ""unlawful.""

""ICE has acted in direct opposition to a federal court order, which should disturb everyone,"" said Nora Ahmed, legal director of the ACLU of Louisiana.

The deportation comes as Trump administration officials have repeatedly clashed with the courts over their attempts to deport large numbers of immigrants. There have been previous cases of U.S. citizens being deported, including U.S.-born children.

Souvannarath most recently lived in Arab, Alabama. Court records show he was granted lawful permanent residence in the U.S. before his first birthday. His father, a native of Laos, is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and Souvannarath claims his citizenship derives from that status.

Souvannarath was taken into ICE custody in June following an annual check-in with immigration authorities. Two of his five children were with him when he was detained, his wife told the AP.

McLaughlin said Souvannarath ""lost his green card"" and was ordered to be deported in 2006 following convictions for ""heinous crimes"" — assault and unlawful possession of a firearm — and ""had no right to be in this country."" It was not clear why Souvannarath was not previously taken into ICE custody.

In 2004, Souvannarath was convicted of unlawful firearm possession and assault against his then-girlfriend in King County, Washington. He had also been convicted of a misdemeanor assault against the same woman several years before, court records show.

""20 years later, he tried a Hail Mary attempt to remain in our country by claiming he was a U.S. citizen,"" McLaughlin wrote in her statement. ""I know its shocking to the media — but criminal illegal aliens lie all the time.""

Souvannarath's wife, Beatrice, described him as a hard worker and loving father who stayed out of trouble since his run-ins with the law two decades ago. He's mostly worked installing air conditioners and heaters, she said. ""He doesn't even drink,"" she said.

His wife said she received word last week that he was being deported and, days later, that he was in custody in Laos, a country he had not previously visited.

Representing himself in court, Souvannarath filed an emergency motion seeking to halt his deportation. The judge, appointed by President Barack Obama, cited the ""irreparable harm that would be caused by immediate deportation"" in issuing a temporary restraining order pausing the deportation for 14 days.

The AP found ICE has used the device despite internal concerns voiced in a 2023 report by the civil rights division of its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in part due to reports of deaths involving use of the WRAP by local law enforcement.

Nana Regional Corp. is supposed to uphold Iñupiat values. Some shareholders say its role in the president’s deportation machinery makes a mockery of that. Through several presidential administrations, the company has turned itself into a large government contractor, with its biggest revenue generator run out of an office park in a suburb of Washington, DC. Nana’s largest contracts, worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year, are with the Department of Defense. But over the past decade, one of its fastest-growing lines of government business is with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Warships, Fighter Jets and the CIA – What is Trump’s Endgame in Venezuela?

For two months, the US military has been building up a force of warships, fighter jets, bombers, marines, drones and spy planes in the Caribbean Sea. It is the largest deployment there for decades. Long-range bomber planes, B-52s, have carried out “bomber attack demonstrations” off the coast of Venezuela. Trump has authorised the deployment of the CIA to Venezuela and the world’s largest aircraft carrier is being sent to the region. The US says it has killed dozens of people in strikes on small vessels from Venezuela which it alleges carry “narcotics” and “narco-terrorists”, without providing evidence or details about those on board. The strikes have drawn condemnation in the region and experts have questioned their legality. They are being sold by the US as a war on drug trafficking but all the signs suggest this is really an intimidation campaign that seeks to remove Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro from power.

Calls for transparency into the strikes from members of Congress, including allies of Trump, have grown in recent weeks.

Democrats do the same.” Meanwhile, the House Armed Services Committee held a bipartisan classified briefing on the strikes Thursday.","WASHINGTON — Lawmakers from both parties criticized the Trump administration after Democrats were not invited to a briefing Wednesday on U.S. military strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats.

Sen. Mark Warner, of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, told reporters at a news conference in the Capitol on Thursday that the partisan briefing was a ""new low"" for the administration.

""That is not how the system is supposed to work,"" he said.

The Trump administration has launched at least 14 strikes on vessels that it claims were involved with drug trafficking since early September. Calls for transparency into the strikes from members of Congress, including allies of Trump, have grown in recent weeks.

Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said Democrats have “been denied essential information about these airstrikes. From everything we have been told, there are very severe questions about the legality of these strikes.”

Several Republican senators told NBC News that Democrats should have been included in the meeting.

Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said that it was ""an unfortunate situation"" that Democrats were not briefed but that he believed they would be included in future briefings.

""I wish it wouldn’t have happened this way,"" he said. ""It did, but I’ve talked to a number of my colleagues already and told them that we still agree that this should be delivered on a bipartisan basis.""

Rounds also said that based on the briefing, he believes the strikes were legal.

Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., also said Democrats should have been briefed.

""I don’t think any administration should leave out any party from a briefing that level of importance,"" he said, adding, ""I think all of that should be available to people who oversee them.""

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a close ally of Trump’s, said that it “wouldn’t be appropriate” for Democrats not to be briefed and that “the goal is to brief everybody, not just Republicans.”

Warner said he was incensed to learn that the administration shared its legal justification for the strikes during the briefing, since Secretary of State Marco Rubio had “personally promised” him that information would be shared with the bipartisan Gang of 8, which still has not happened yet.

Asked by NBC News whether he got an explanation for why Democrats were excluded, Warner said: “We got a ham-handed ‘Oh, maybe you’re right.’ ... I say bulls---.”

The White House accused Democrats of ""pushing bogus claims about the administration’s efforts to kill narcoterrorists to distract from their decision to shut the government down and force federal employees and military servicemembers to work without pay.""

""The Department of War has held nine bipartisan briefings on narcoterrorist strikes, with additional bipartisan briefings scheduled, and individually works through requests from the Hill,"" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. ""It’s pathetic that these Democrats care more about running cover for foreign drug smugglers and illegal immigrants seeking taxpayer-funded health care than paying federal workers and protecting American citizens from deadly narcotics.”

Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, also said he disagrees with the premise that Democrats were left out because Democrats are “free to do whatever they want to do. They can ask for a briefing, just like we got.”

“Those of us that are on the Intelligence Committee, Republicans or Democrats, can get briefings anytime they want on these,” Risch said. “It’s not unusual for us to ask for briefings individually or as a group or, for that matter, as Republicans. Democrats do the same.”

Meanwhile, the House Armed Services Committee held a bipartisan classified briefing on the strikes Thursday. But Democratic committee member Jason Crow, of Colorado, told NBC News that Pentagon lawyers were pulled away from the briefing at the last minute, so members did not get any legal justifications for the strikes, leaving him “unsatisfied.”

Rep. Gregory Meeks, of New York, top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that Thursday's briefing was “incredible for how little information was shared, how little time the briefers stayed to answer questions, and how completely absent any credible legal rationale was for the administration’s unauthorized, ongoing expansion of these strikes.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-05/250514-capitol-building-se-1055a-fbbf98.jpg",N,,2025-10-30 21:04:12.307987

EAD renewal applicants filing on or after October 30 will no longer receive an automatic extension of employment authorization.
Adjust I-9 reverification tracking and HR compliance systems to avoid unintentional lapses in employment authorization.
For Employees and Individuals: File EAD renewal applications as early as possible—USCIS recommends up to 180 days before expiration.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) have announced a policy change that will end the automatic extension of employment authorization documents (EADs) for certain renewal applicants. The change will take effect on October 30, 2025.

Background

Under current regulations, certain EAD renewal applicants receive an automatic extension of their work authorization for up to 540 days if they timely file a renewal application before their existing EAD expires. This policy allows applicants to continue working after the expiration of their existing EAD, for up to 540 days, while the renewal application is pending. The automatic extension terminates once USCIS approves or denies the renewal application.

What Is Changing

Under an Interim Final Rule (IFR), which will be published and take effect on October 30, 2025, this automatic extension will no longer apply. EAD renewal applicants filing on or after October 30 will no longer receive an automatic extension of employment authorization. For these applicants, if processing of the renewal extends past the expiration of their existing EAD, they will lose work authorization upon the expiration of that EAD, and need to wait for USCIS to adjudicate the renewal application and produce a new EAD before accepting or resuming employment.

The IFR indicates that this is part of DHS’s broader effort to prioritize the screening and vetting of foreign nationals. How these attempts at increased vetting will affect EAD processing times is uncertain—but an increase in processing times, coupled with the elimination of the automatic extension, would likely result in substantial disruption for employers and employees. DHS notes in the IFR that it expects EAD filing rates and processing times to decline, thus reducing the need for automatic extensions to avoid lapses in employment authorization. However, EAD renewal applications can be filed no earlier than six months before an EAD expiration, and shorter processing times have yet to materialize. According to USCIS’s own data, at present, some EAD applications take well over a year to be processed.

Who Is Affected

This change primarily affects applicants who have received EADs based on humanitarian grounds, including asylum applicants, refugees, foreign nationals granted Withholding of Removal, and certain recipients of Temporary Protected Status (TPS), among others. The change also applies to spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders (H-4 dependents), as well as those whose EAD cards are based on pending Adjustment of Status applications, though the impact to these populations may be somewhat more limited, as explained below.

Exceptions

The change does not affect:

F-1 students applying for STEM OPT;

Spouses of L-1, E-1, E-2, and E-3 nonimmigrant visa holders (L-2S, E-1S, E-2S, and E-3S, respectively), who are authorized to work incident to status (i.e., they are authorized to work based on their status alone, even without an EAD);

Automatic extensions provided by law (e.g., certain TPS designations or automatic extensions announced through Federal Register notices);

DACA recipients, whose EADs have never been eligible for automatic extensions; or

Applicants who file EAD renewal applications before the change takes effect on October 30, 2025.

Limited Impact on Certain EAD Applicants

As a practical matter, the change will have a somewhat limited effect on:

Spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders (H-4 dependent spouses), who only benefit from the current 540-day automatic extension in limited circumstances, and only after overcoming significant logistical hurdles. That said, the change will certainly impact H-4 spouses who were previously willing and able to jump through the necessary hoops to avail themselves of the automatic extension; and

Applicants who receive an EAD based on a pending Adjustment of Status application (Form I-485). USCIS currently approves these EADs for a five-year period, and applicants generally receive their “green cards” well before an EAD needs to be renewed.

Practical Recommendations

For Employers:

Identify employees whose work authorization relies on EADs that expire after October 30, 2025, and consult with immigration counsel to determine the impact of this change (if any).

Adjust I-9 reverification tracking and HR compliance systems to avoid unintentional lapses in employment authorization.

Communicate with affected employees about renewal timing and potential employment gaps.

For Employees and Individuals:

File EAD renewal applications as early as possible—USCIS recommends up to 180 days before expiration.

Plan ahead to avoid interruptions in work authorization after October 30, 2025.

Explore alternative visa or work authorization options if continued employment is critical.

The teen said she tried to keep her diagnosis private for several months, but told ABC News she is speaking out to defend her father.

Torres said despite how her father was treated, she has “nothing but love” for the federal agents who arrested her father.","(CHICAGO) — Chicago immigration judge Eva Saltzman on Thursday set a $2,000 bond for Ruben Torres-Maldonado, whose 16-year-old daughter Ofelia Torres is battling stage 4 cancer. Torres-Maldonado will be released from immigration detention as early as Thursday.

During the hearing, the judge not only ruled for him to be released, but also said he is now eligible to apply for a cancellation of removal based on the hardship his family would endure if he’s forced to leave the country. If his application is denied, he could still face deportation.

Despite the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) earlier claiming Torres-Maldonado was a “criminal illegal alien” who has a history of driving offenses, Saltzman said she had no reason to believe that he posed a risk to the public.

“I see that you have very strong family ties and community ties in the United States and that you’ve hired an attorney which shows me that you take these proceedings very seriously,” the judge said. “And I see nothing in the record that would indicate to me that you pose a danger to the community.”

Torres-Maldonado also noted during the hearing that he has a valid license and insurance.

“I wish you much luck in the future, and I wish your daughter a full recovery,” the judge said.

DHS didn’t immediately respond to ABC News’ request for comment about the judge’s order.

In an interview with ABC News last week, 16-year-old Ofelia Torres recalled receiving a strange phone call on Oct. 18. She said her mom had just put on sterile gloves and was helping to drain the ascites — a buildup of fluid — in her abdomen when it came.

“The first call that came through was Walgreens, and so we just declined the call. It was probably just my medication,” Torres said. “Another call came through and it said prison slash jail and I was like ‘Why is the prison calling me?’ But in my head, I kind of knew, I think they got my dad.”

Since learning that federal immigration agents arrested Torres-Maldonado at a Home Depot in Niles, Illinois, on Oct. 18, Ofelia has made it her mission to continue fighting her stage 4 cancer diagnosis and her father’s possible deportation too.

ABC News interviewed the teen at her home in Chicago last week as part of a “Nightline” story on the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement mission in the state. Dubbed “Operation Midway Blitz” by the administration, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) campaign targeting undocumented people in Chicago and greater Illinois.

Torres-Maldonado is one of more than 2,800 undocumented immigrants that the Trump administration says it has apprehended in the Chicago area since they announced the operation in early September.

At a recent press conference, attorney Kalman Resnick, who is representing Torres-Maldonado, said federal agents surrounded his client’s vehicle, smashed the window of his truck and “dragged” him into a vehicle at gunpoint.

ICE is under the supervision of the DHS. In a statement sent to ABC News before the hearing, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin alleged that Torres-Maldonado backed into a government vehicle while attempting to flee.

“His criminal history shows he has a history of habitual driving offenses and has been charged multiple

times with driving without insurance, driving without a valid license, and speeding,” McLaughlin said.

Torres denied the government’s claims that her father is a criminal.

“I’ve gotten a parking ticket, am I a criminal?” she said. “Sometimes we break a law without even knowing, does that make us criminal? I don’t know.”

Torres was diagnosed with metastatic aviolar rhabdomyosarcoma — an aggressive form of cancer — last December. The teen said she tried to keep her diagnosis private for several months, but told ABC News she is speaking out to defend her father. She said Torres-Maldonado instilled in her a sense of gratitude for the country they call home.

“I need the world to know my dad’s story and if that means letting the world know I have cancer, so be it. I don’t care,” she said. “I need my dad.”

The immigration crackdown in Chicago has come under scrutiny from advocates and legal experts including Mark Fleming, associate director of Federal Litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center, who told ABC News that many of the arrests and detainments have been unlawful.

So far, the human rights organization National Immigrant Justice Center has presented over 800 cases that they claim were unlawful under a consent decree — a court-ordered agreement between parties that resolves a dispute — limiting DHS’ ability to hold someone who entered into the country unlawfully without a bond hearing.

Fleming told ABC News the organization has 280 more cases that his legal team will soon present before a judge.

“It’s truly unprecedented. We are lead counsel in a class action lawsuit that has a consent decree that dictates when and how DHS, Department of Homeland Security, whether it’s Border Patrol or Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, can stop and arrest people without warrants,” Fleming said.

“Regardless of what you feel about immigration or the levels of immigration or the level of enforcement — those are fair debates for us to have. What is deeply troubling here is the lawlessness, the violence, the cruelty, the carelessness with which they are doing this operation,” he later added.

Torres said despite how her father was treated, she has “nothing but love” for the federal agents who arrested her father.

“That’s all I have for everyone in this world. Love in my heart,” she said. “To the ICE agents who smashed my dad’s window, to the ICE agent who pointed a gun at my dad, I’m not mad at you … I just want you to know that that was not the right thing to do.”

Officers ordered the driver to leave the scene, but as the driver began to pull away, the car stopped and attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping, McLaughlin said in a statement. An ICE officer then fired defensive shots at the vehicle. The driver fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle, McLaughlin added.

The family of the man involved in the shooting identified him only as 24-year-old Carlos. Family spokesperson, Javier Hernandez, with the Inland Coalition of Immigrant Justice, said the man stopped his Lexus when he saw federal agents stopping a dark-colored Honda on Vineyard Avenue.

Carlos' family said he was shot in the shoulder, and they immediately drove him to a nearby hospital with federal agents behind them.

""We do know he was released from the hospital but the family doesn't know where he is at, they believe he is in custody of the federal government,"" Hernandez said. ""He was someone being basically surrounded by armed men with masks so he decided to see what was going on.""

The man in the vehicle that was originally stopped during the traffic stop was not injured in the shooting. He was taken into custody by agents. It's unclear why he was stopped.

What they're saying:

A statement from Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin read,

""Around 6:30AM on October 30, ICE officers in Los Angeles conducted a vehicle stop at the 2800 block of Vineyard Ave in Ontario, CA. During the stop, an unknown individual, not the target, in a vehicle pulled in front of the officers. Officers order the driver to leave the scene. As the driver began to pull away, the car stopped and attempted to run officers over by reversing directly at them without stopping. An ICE officer, fearing for his life, fired defensive shots at the vehicle. The subject fled the scene and abandoned his vehicle. This is another example of the threats our ICE officers are facing day-in and day-out as they risk their lives to enforce the law and arrest criminals. ICE officers now face a 1000% increase in assaults them including cars being used as weapons and death threats against our agents are up 8000%. This violence must end. Let me be clear: Anyone who assaults, impedes, obstructs, or threatens the lives of federal officers will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""",https://images.foxtv.com/static.foxla.com/www.foxla.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/dhs-operation-ontario-skyfox.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-30 22:56:44.969299

Alongside Abughazaleh, the DOJ indicted a Democratic candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman, a municipal board member and two other people.
The indictment was also revealed days after senior White House and DOJ officials vowed to go after those who attempt to hold federal immigration agents accountable.

The elected Democrats recently threatened by Trump officials with prosecution or investigation over the ICE accountability efforts include former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Illinois Gov.","The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed felony charges against a Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois and multiple other Chicago officials Wednesday, accusing them of conspiring to impede an officer.

In targeting Kat Abughazaleh, a progressive candidate for Congress in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, the DOJ’s new case raises stark constitutional and electoral concerns, as opposition to President Donald’s Trump aggressive immigration raids in Chicago has become a central issue in her campaign.

In a statement, Abughazaleh described the charges against her and others as a “political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment.”

“This case is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks against them. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges,” she said.

The grand jury indictment against Abughazaleh comes after federal agents have already arrested or detained multiple Democratic officials, including Sen. Alex Padilla (Calif.) and Rep. Lamonica McIver (N.J.), who participated in oversight efforts on or demonstrations against Trump’s large-scale mass deportation program.

Alongside Abughazaleh, the DOJ indicted a Democratic candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman, a municipal board member and two other people.

The indictment alleged that they conspired to impede a federal officer by being among a group of people who surrounded a government vehicle outside of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facility last month in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

A video accompanying the indictment showed a large group of people in front of and around a black SUV outside of the Broadview ICE facility. Members of the group threw stuffed animals at the vehicle and pounded on its windows while shouting chants.

The DOJ alleged that by participating in the demonstration, Abughazaleh and the five others attempted to “prevent by force, intimidation, and threat” a federal agent “from discharging the duties of his office, and to injure him in his person or property.”

All six were charged with conspiracy to impede a law enforcement officer and individual counts of impeding a law enforcement officer. If convicted, they could face several years in prison and large fines.

The indictment was also revealed days after senior White House and DOJ officials vowed to go after those who attempt to hold federal immigration agents accountable.

Trump officials made the threats largely in response to federal, state and local Democrats in several states announcing new initiatives to document — and potentially prosecute — federal agents who commit misconduct during immigration operations.

The elected Democrats recently threatened by Trump officials with prosecution or investigation over the ICE accountability efforts include former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Bob Bonta, the California attorney general.

Democrats around the country have announced accountability initiatives after countless videos this year — including some promoted by the federal government — have shown federal agents using aggressive tactics in carrying out Trump’s deportation agenda or cracking down on people protesting it.

In Chicago specifically, agents have been seen grabbing people by the throat, indiscriminately deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods, conducting mass raids on apartment complexes and shooting journalists and clergy members in the head with less-than-lethal projectiles.

Pritzker last week announced an independent commission that will create a public record of unlawful actions committed by federal agents in the state while also documenting the effects of the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration raids around Chicago.

Legal experts have noted that while citizens and elected officials have a constitutional right to document any potential misconduct by federal officers, prosecuting agents for state law violations is complicated because of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.",https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241649940-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 18:01:02.464889

But a section in the Internal Revenue Code, known as 6103, heavily limits taxpayer data sharing, except in specific circumstances. The exceptions include when the information is necessary for a non-tax federal criminal investigation or proceeding in which the United States or a federal agency is a party, and the agency has obtained approval from a court or a federal agency head. And the IRS generally bars agencies from accessing individual taxpayer return information

Douglas O’Donnell, the IRS’s then-acting commissioner, and other agency officials questioned the legality of ICE’s effort under 6103 during the project’s infancy in late February, following a legal analysis from the IRS’s Office of the Chief Counsel and Treasury’s Office of the General Counsel, the emails show.

“Our current understanding,” the analysis reads, “is that ICE’s request does not relate to a criminal investigation, because removal proceedings are generally civil in nature.”

“We cannot provide information responsive to the request made,” O’Donnell wrote in an email to another Treasury official.

Weeks later, Caleb Vitello, the acting director of ICE, asked the IRS to provide “all possible information” on “700 thousand criminal illegal aliens who have standing deportation orders.” The request included known home addresses, employers’ information, relatives, bank names, IP information, and Social Security or taxpayer identification numbers.

ICE spent weeks asking for this data, even as IRS staffers mulled over the legality and practicality of the information exchange, the records show.

O’Donnell, a 38-year veteran of the IRS, abruptly retired in February.

The immigration enforcement agency eventually found a workaround: It could slap a federal criminal penalty for failure to leave the country on the undocumented immigrants to spur a criminal investigation and get Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to sign off on the data sharing effort.

And they could tighten the scope of their data probe to only seek names, addresses and other qualifying information within a taxable period.

Bessent and Noem signed a memorandum of understanding in April, and the data was transferred through a system called Kiteworks this summer. Shortly after, acting IRS Commissioner Melanie Krause, who had replaced O’Donnell, accepted a deferred resignation offer.

The IRS and ICE — which continued to squabble over the minutiae of section 6103 over the summer — contend they’ve worked out the kinks, though it is unclear from the latest emails alone if that’s true.

WASHINGTON — Today, Secretary Kristi Noem announced that a successful 287(g) operation with the Indiana State Police has resulted in the arrest of 223 illegal aliens on Indiana highways near the Illinois state line—including 146 truck drivers. This operation took place in Northwest Indiana and is part of Chicago-based Operation Midway Blitz.

Criminal activity associated with the 223 illegal aliens arrested during this effort includes:

Driving Under the Influence

Drug Trafficking

Theft

Burglary

Assault

Child Abuse

Domestic Battery

Prostitution

Fraud

Over 40 drivers had been issued Commercial Drivers Licenses. The tops states that issued these Commercial Drivers Licenses to the illegal aliens were Illinois, California, and New York. Some of the Commercial Drivers Licenses of illegal aliens arrested in the operation are below:

“Far too many innocent Americans have been killed by illegal aliens driving semi-trucks and big rigs. And yet, sanctuary states around the country have been issuing illegal aliens commercial driver’s licenses. The Trump Administration is ending the chaos,” said Secretary Noem. “Thanks to President Trump, Operation Midway Blitz has already removed over 140 illegal alien truck drivers in Indiana. The brave men and women of ICE and the Indiana State Police are working nonstop to get criminal illegal aliens out of our communities and off our roads.""

“Indiana is the Crossroads of America, and that’s something we’re proud of — but it also means we must stay vigilant about those using our interstates for crime and thus endangering our communities,” said Governor Mike Braun. “The safety of our state is our top priority, and we’ll keep working with our federal partners to keep Hoosiers — and Americans — safe.”

“ICE launched operation Midway Blitz to remove illegal alien threats to public safety, which is exactly what we have done in Chicago. We recognized from the start that this must include protecting roadways carrying interstate traffic and cargo. Sanctuary policies like those in Illinois sadly don’t recognize borders, and ICE and the Indiana State Police have successfully arrested hundreds of illegal alien truck drivers who should not be operating on our highways,"" said ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons. ""In recent weeks, we have seen illegal semi-truck drivers responsible for significant loss of life across the country. This was preventable, and that is precisely why we are working to ensure this doesn’t happen in Indiana or Illinois.”

“This operation wouldn’t have been as successful as it was without our strong 287(g) partnership with the Indiana State Police. Protecting communities from criminal illegal aliens also includes those posing safety threats on our interstates,"" said ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan. ""When cities and states partner with us, communities are safer, and as this operation has proven, our efforts in Indiana extend protection to those living in the sanctuary state of Illinois as well.”

In recent months, we’ve seen a disturbing pattern of criminal illegal aliens driving commercial vehicles on American roads, directly threatening public safety and resulting in senseless loss of life.

In August, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for a criminal illegal alien—Harjinder Singh— following his arrest for three counts of vehicular homicide while driving a semi-truck in Florida.

Last week, ICE lodged an arrest detainer for a criminal illegal alien—Jashanpreet Singh—who killed three people in California while driving an 18-wheeler under the influence.

Give the children and the families of Illinois a break, Donald Trump and Kristi Noem,” Pritzker said.
During an interview on Thursday with Fox News, Noem was asked if she would pause immigration enforcement operations in Chicago.
In response, Noem said she wouldn’t be altering immigration enforcement operations this weekend.
They highlighted the trauma and toll that the intensified immigration enforcement has had on not only immigrant communities but every community across the state.","The day before Halloween, Gov. JB Pritzker urged the President Donald Trump administration to suspend its immigration enforcement operations this weekend so families and children can stay safe while celebrating the holiday.

Speaking from Springfield, Pritzker said he sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem asking them to pause all federal agent operations for the entirety of the Halloween weekend. Halloween is Friday, followed by Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) on Saturday and Sunday. The latter honors friends and family members who’ve passed away.

“I’m asking for basic human decency. I think their response will be revealing. They’ve disrupted everything for more than two months already. Give the children and the families of Illinois a break, Donald Trump and Kristi Noem,” Pritzker said. “This is about something other than you just causing mayhem on our streets and visiting cruelty upon our people.”

For nearly two months, DHS — which oversees federal agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) — has been carrying out its so-called “Operation Midway Blitz” throughout the Chicagoland area. The operation, according to Noem, is supposed to be targeting the “worst of the worst.”

However, Pritzker said today that’s not what’s happening across the state, and it’s far from the expressed goals of federal immigration authorities. He also noted that the militarized immigration enforcement is happening at “a pace and scale that is wider and more intense than in previous weeks.”

“They have targeted families and children, burrito vendors, landscapers, delivery drivers, nannies, U.S. citizens, legal residents and longtime Chicagoans, people who have never broken the law,” Pritzker said.

During an interview on Thursday with Fox News, Noem was asked if she would pause immigration enforcement operations in Chicago. In response, Noem said she wouldn’t be altering immigration enforcement operations this weekend.

“No, we’re going to be out on the streets in full force and increase our activities to make sure kids are safe. Every day in Chicago, we’re arresting murderers, child pedophiles, those who have perpetuated assault and pornography against children,” Noem said. “We’re going to be out there to make sure that they can be safe, enjoy the holiday, spend some time with their families, their neighbors and their communities, and they don’t have to be the victim of a crime because of these illegal aliens that are in our country, victimizing them.”

Earlier this month, DHS said it arrested more than 1,000 people since it started “Operation Midway Blitz” in September. The TRiiBE hasn’t verified those numbers; with the magnitude and sporadic tactics of detainments, it is challenging to track the number of people who have been taken and where exactly they have been taken to.

During today’s press conference, Pritzker highlighted multiple instances of what he refers to as the Trump administration’s “unlawful behavior and abuses of power.” On Oct. 25, federal agents tear-gassed residents in Old Irving Park who were there documenting enforcement actions. In total, three people were detained by federal agents, and two were U.S. citizens.

An annual children’s costume party in Old Irving Park was scheduled to take place on Oct. 25, but the parade was interrupted and later canceled, Pritzker said.

“This year, the parade was interrupted and then canceled, not because of rain, but because of tear gas. Federal agents swarmed into the neighborhood, not with a criminal target in their sights, but just because Old Irving Park was the next neighborhood on their list to terrorize,” Pritzker said.

Last Saturday was the fourth day in a row that federal agents deployed tear gas. They did so in Cicero, Little Village and in Lakeview, as well.

During his remarks, Pritzker also called out CBP Commander Gregory Bovino and said the operation has “sown fear, division and chaos.”

“If you are unwilling to cease operations and leave our city, can we at least agree that our children should not be victims, especially on Halloween?” Pritzker said. Can we agree that there is no imminent threat that should disrupt their holiday? No child in America should have to go trick-or-treating in fear that they might be confronted with armed federal agents and have to inhale tear gas.

This week, Bovino was called to testify in federal court about a video showing him throwing tear gas in Little Village, as well as other alleged violations of a temporary restraining order that U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued.

Also at the press conference were Illinois State Representative Norma Hernandez (D-77), Latino Policy Forum president and CEO Linda Xóchitl Tortolero, Principal of Lords Park Elementary School in Elgin Noe Velazquez, and a representative from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. They highlighted the trauma and toll that the intensified immigration enforcement has had on not only immigrant communities but every community across the state.

“These actions are not just traumatizing, but they are destabilizing our economy, hurting small businesses and even impacting school attendance and fear is not a policy solution,” Hernandez said. “Trauma is not public safety, and no level of government, local, state or federal, should be allowed to terrorize the very people they’re supposed to serve.”

Hernandez added that rapid responders, legal observers, journalists, elected officials and other volunteers are being arrested when they document federal agents’ misconduct and illegal tactics.

On Wednesday, half a dozen Chicago-area political figures were named in a felony indictment and are being charged with felony impeding and impeding conspiracy charges. The charges stem from a Sept. 26 protest outside the ICE processing center in Broadview. The six people include Democratic Illinois 9th District congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, Cook County Democratic committeeman Michael Rabbitt and Chicago Ald.

Many have been in the United States for years and have established deep roots in their communities.
Throwing such people out is a disservice to them, but also to the nation, Archbishop Wenski suggested.
“Home is here,” Archbishop Wenski said.
“The Biden administration gave humanitarian visas to about half a million people from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba,” Archbishop Wenski said.","Miami’s Archbishop Thomas Wenski understands in his bones the plight of today’s immigrants. He can draw on his own experience as the child of a Polish immigrant with family roots in the immigrant stronghold of Detroit as well as his unique perspective as a pastoral leader in a part of the country that has been powerfully redefined by the immigrant experience.

In an online forum sponsored by Jesuit Refugee Service USA on Oct. 28, Archbishop Wenski recalled how unwelcome Haitian immigrants had initially been in South Florida and when Cuban immigrants fell from grace following the infamous Mariel Boatlift in 1980.

“What the ’80s taught me…was that immigration was not a threat, but an opportunity because certainly South Florida, especially Miami, has benefited tremendously from immigration,” he said in a conversation with Don Kerwin, JRS vice president.

American dreamers

Like other immigrant groups that came to the United States, the Haitians and Cubans arriving in Miami, he said, were standouts in their homelands, people ready to work hard for their piece of the American dream. In their time, they contributed mightily to the transformation of South Florida—and now their children and grandchildren hold up the region’s health care, real estate and hospitality industries, pursuing advanced degrees and professions their immigrant parents and grandparents could only have dreamed about.

He sees many examples of immigrant success stories in these families. “You could say that immigrants in general—and this has been my experience with Haitians—are almost driven to succeed because they’re risk takers, they’re the decision makers,” Archbishop Wenski said.

“They decided, ‘I can’t take this anymore in Haiti,’ and they took the risk,” he said.

“And this American society of ours rewards people that can make decisions and take risks. So the Haitians, like other immigrant groups, have taken advantage of the opportunities that are provided by America and by freedom to succeed here.”

What a terrible mistake it would be to thwart a process that has been instrumental in the American success story, he suggested. “Originally they were going after the worst of the worst, but the numbers weren’t high enough,” Archbishop Wenski said of the Trump administration’s clampdown, “so they started picking up people that were sitting in the back of a pickup truck as they were leaving lawns that they were cutting in the suburbs.”

“We have to press Congress to change the laws, but we also have to approach the president” and tell him “that he should take a victory lap for having controlled the border” and removing the “worst of the worst” from U.S. communities, he said. Now, the president, he said, has the opportunity to “pivot” from a deportation campaign that has been sowing chaos and anxiety across the country.

There are signs that the Trump administration may be far from the reversal that the archbishop seeks. On Oct. 28, top leaders at Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices were abruptly deposed, replaced in many instances by Customs and Border Protection staff in a major shake-up that analysts said would mean even more aggressive deportation tactics. In May, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told Fox News the Trump administration’s hope is to make “a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day” with an annual goal of 1 million deportations.

That plan will only frustrate the administration’s other goals, Archbishop Wenski warned.

“The president has always said that he wants to have the biggest economy ever,” he said. “If you’re gonna have the biggest economy ever in the United States, you’re not going to do it without the labor force participation of the migrants.”

Catholics: Remember who you are, where you come from

According to Pew Research, more than 14 million people with irregular status are resident in the United States, the numbers spiking sharply during the Covid-19 pandemic. Pew researchers say a record 7.5 million U.S. households included unauthorized immigrants in 2023.

Almost 70 percent of these households are considered “mixed status,” meaning that they also contain U.S.-born residents or lawful immigrants. Most of the U.S.-born residents are children of unauthorized immigrants, Pew reports.

Over decades of inaction on immigration reform, the issue of residency has become muddled for generations of immigrants. Cut off from legal immigration channels by laws that have not adapted to changing conditions, millions have indeed been arriving irregularly. Many have been in the United States for years and have established deep roots in their communities. Throwing such people out is a disservice to them, but also to the nation, Archbishop Wenski suggested.

“Home is here,” Archbishop Wenski said. “There’s no ‘home’ [for deportees] to go back to, and that’s really where the inhumanity of a mass deportation comes up, because after being here all these years, you start forging connections with this host country: You get married; you have kids; you might have kids that are American citizens; you have a spouse that may be a legal permanent resident or American citizen. And all this is going to be thrown into chaos because of [our] antiquated laws.”

And many flippantly described as “illegal” by media commentators and actors in the Trump administration are nothing of the sort, Archbishop Wenski said. They have been residing and working in the United States under humanitarian parole, Temporary Protected Status or while asylum claims or residency applications have slowly made their way through an overwhelmed system.

“The Biden administration gave humanitarian visas to about half a million people from Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba,” Archbishop Wenski said. “You could argue about whether that was a smart move or not, but half a million people came here. They were sponsored by somebody in the United States. They had to pay their own transportation here, and they got work permits for two years.”

“Now, the administration is saying that [when] the two years are up; they’re not going to renew [protected status]. They’re going to have to go back. But none of those people were ever a day illegally here in this country.”

And how, he wonders, can any American seriously suggest returning those who have been legitimately offered a refuge in the United States to the chaos and oppression of the failing nations they have fled? “They’ve continued to deport people to Haiti, which is a stateless country right now,” the archbishop said. “They’re deporting people to Cuba, which is in an economic crisis, besides the politics of the whole place, and Nicaragua, which is a country that has deported priests and religious sisters and clamped down on the church there, a very repressive country.”

“They want to deport people there; it doesn’t make sense.”

The U.S. church should continue to keep the issue of comprehensive immigration reform and steps toward rationalizing immigration policy before the U.S. public and its political leadership, Archbishop Wenski said. He urged Congress to reassert its authority over immigration policy and finally address the inadequacies created by decades of inattention.

Simply harmonizing the immigration registry, last updated in 1986 with a cut-off date of Jan. 1, 1972, to current realities could address the status of the vast majority of unauthorized immigrants, he said. He recalled that his own father was able to formalize his residency in the United States through the registry when it was updated in 1929.

It is “Congress that makes the law, and Congress should change the laws,” he said. “We need to focus on Congress to address this issue because every time Congress had an opportunity to do something about immigration over the past 20, 25 years, they always decided to kick the can down the road when the pressure was taken off of them.”

He reminded contemporary Catholics that the history of the American church is intrinsically bound with the continuing phenomenon of immigration. Catholics “should remember where we come from,” he said, “who we are.”

There are few Catholics in this country that are not “maybe a generation removed from the immigration experience,” he said. Noting a surge of neo-nativist ideology and rhetoric, he added, “Catholics have to be careful that they’re not swept up by people who are masking their anti-Catholicism with an anti-immigration stance.”

In a presidential document published on Thursday but dated September 30, the Trump administration indicated that the US refugee system would remain largely closed to the millions of people around the world fleeing unsafe conditions.

Instead, priority for the 7,500 available slots would be given to white Afrikaners from South Africa.

“The admissions numbers shall primarily be allocated among Afrikaners from South Africa pursuant to Executive Order 14204 and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands,” the document said.

Trump has repeatedly said white South Africans are being persecuted in the Black-majority country, a claim rejected by South Africa’s government and top Afrikaner officials.

Thursday’s filings also indicated that the Trump administration would narrow the groups that handle refugee services moving forward.

Refugee resettlement grants and contracts that currently go to an array of public and private organisations will instead be rerouted to the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Department of Health and Human Services.

“The transfer ensures better alignment of resources, oversight, and accountability [of] resettlement activities that take place entirely within the United States,” a separate declaration said.

Trump’s refugee cap is the lowest since Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980, which codified a formal process for admitting and relocating refugees to the US.

Since then, at least two million refugees have arrived through the US Refugee Admissions Program or USRAP. Trump sought to suspend the programme upon taking office, prompting a successful legal challenge from immigrant rights groups.

Thursday’s cap of 7,500 is only a fraction of the 125,000 refugees allowed to enter under former President Joe Biden during his final year in office. The new, lower cap is set to last from October 2025 through September 2026.

According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently 42.7 million refugees globally.

The US Refugee Act allows presidents to set a cap on the number of annual refugee admissions, but there is no bottom limit. That has long sparked concerns that Trump, who slashed admissions during his first term, could effectively grind USRAP to a halt.

‘Downfall for a crown jewel’

In a post on the social media platform X, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, noted that Trump’s declaration appeared to shift the definition of whom Washington considers to be a refugee.

“Trump’s new refugee determination appears to call for admitting refugees who wouldn’t meet the definition of refugee — someone who faces persecution (not ‘discrimination’) on the basis of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” he wrote.

He added that, for decades, the US refugee programme has admitted “people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors”.

“Now it will be used as a pathway for White immigration,” he said. “What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”

The International Refugee Assistance Project, meanwhile, said that Trump did not appear to follow the required congressional consultation process before announcing the cap. The group dismissed the move as baldly political.

“Today’s announcement highlights just how far this administration has gone when it comes to abandoning its responsibilities to displaced people around the world,” the organisation’s president, Sharif Aly, said in a statement.

“America’s refugee program was built to reflect our values, and the thousands of individuals we’ve closed our doors to represent thousands of missed opportunities of people who could have strengthened a local community or economy,” the statement said.

Trump’s declaration did not give a reason for the massive cut in refugee admissions, saying only that the number was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.

The US president has led a massive crackdown on all forms of immigration since taking office, but some advocates had hoped that the refugee programme — which historically had broad bipartisan support — might be spared.

The cross-aisle support has been buoyed in recent years by the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, with many politicians supporting pathways to immigration for Afghans who worked alongside the US military or allied forces and companies.

Many Afghans have relied on the refugee programme while other specialised immigration programmes remain constricted or backlogged.

Since taking office for a second term, Trump, however, has focused heavily on white Afrikaners. In February, for instance, Trump issued Executive Order 14204 to cut aid to South Africa, on the basis that it demonstrated “shocking disregard” for Afrikaners.

That order also prioritised humanitarian relief, including refugee admissions, to white South Africans, on the basis that they were “victims of unjust racial discrimination”.

WASHINGTON – The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today released new statistics on violent threats against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) law enforcement officers who are now facing an 8,000% increase in death threats against them.

“Our ICE law enforcement is now facing an 8,000% increase in death threats against them while they risk their lives every single day to remove the worst of the worst,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “From bounties placed on their heads for their murders, threats to their families, stalking, and doxxing online, our officers are experiencing an unprecedented level of violence and threats against them and their families. Make no mistake, sanctuary politicians are contributing to the surge in violent threats and assaults of our officers through their repeated vilification and demonization tactics, including gross comparisons to the Nazi Gestapo. This violence against law enforcement must end.”

Disturbingly, in recent days, ICE officers’ family members have been doxed and threatened, and had bounties placed on their heads for their murders. Below are a handful of violent threats made against ICE law enforcement officers recently:

Earlier this month, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the arrest of Eduardo Aguilar, an illegal alien from Mexico residing in Dallas, Texas, after he posted on TikTok in Spanish soliciting the murder of ICE agents. Aguilar’s post from October 9, 2025, called for “10 dudes in Dallas with determination who aren’t afraid to [two skull emojis],” and offered “10K for each ICE agent.”

In Texas, an ICE officer’s spouse received a call saying, “I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F*** you, f*** your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F*** you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family.”

A separate voicemail left on an ICE employee’s phone was also discovered this month, where a caller states, “I hope every one of those lawless c**** you call ICE officers gets doxxed one by one.”

On October 24, 2025, ICE also became aware of a potential officer safety threat based on a Facebook post from a man named James Adrian Warren. On October 22, 2025, the individual shared posts that threatened ICE officers. The post specifically targets the Ferndale, Washington ICE office and he calls ICE “Nazi’s” and “The Gestapo.” The man also says he will begin observing, tailing, recording and reporting ICE employees to “make life harder for ICE here in Whatcom County.”

The judge has handled several high-profile disputes since President Donald Trump was sworn in to a second term in January.","Democratic attorneys general and governors from 25 states sued the Trump administration earlier this week over its decision not to tap emergency funds for SNAP.

“Because of USDA’s actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,” state officials wrote in the lawsuit. “Worse still, USDA suspended SNAP benefits even though, on information and belief, it has funds available to it that are sufficient to fund all, or at least a substantial portion, of November SNAP benefits.”

The Trump administration has insisted that the contingency fund is reserved for emergencies such as natural disasters and does not have enough money to supply the roughly $8 billion needed for benefits next month.

Partially funding SNAP would be “disastrous,” Jason Altabet, the Justice Department’s lawyer, argued Thursday. States would have to figure out how to administer partial benefits — potentially just to turn around and begin administering full benefits should Congress reach a government funding deal, he added.

But Talwani challenged that argument, saying she believed Congress’ intention in setting aside emergency funds for the program was to “protect the American people.”

Even if Congress agrees on a funding patch for the program, logistical and administrative delays will likely prevent the money from flowing immediately. While there is bipartisan support for standalone bills that would fund SNAP through the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has said he won’t bring them to a floor vote — an attempt to keep pressure high on Democrats for a full reopening of the government.

Without SNAP, food banks and other emergency feeding organizations have said they are unprepared to bridge the gap. Officials in states like Virginia, Maryland, Louisiana, Hawaii and Minnesota have announced plans to tap state and local funds to provide food aid and assist food banks in the interim.

Talwani acknowledged Thursday that, “absent a 100 percent win” for the plaintiffs, millions of SNAP recipients would lose their benefits on Nov. 1.

The judge has handled several high-profile disputes since President Donald Trump was sworn in to a second term in January.

In April, Talwani blocked a Trump administration effort to strip more than half a million Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan immigrants of immigration parole status granted during the Biden administration. The Supreme Court halted her order the next month, without explanation.

In July, Talwani blocked enforcement of a provision in a Trump-backed budget law that sought to end federal funding for Planned Parenthood. She said the move unconstitutionally targeted the organization. However, last month, an appeals court stayed her ruling, allowing the administration to enforce the funding ban for now.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd3%2F2e%2Fc01b881a43d69e0fd76c6cf91555%2Fgovernment-shutdown-food-aid-78738.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 15:56:54.356088

The change marks a substantial shift from the Biden administration’s EAD policy, which allowed many renewal applicants to continue working for up to 540 days after the expiration of the permit while their renewal application was pending with USCIS.

Some exceptions to this policy still apply. For example, automatic extension provisions tied to certain statutory requirements or Federal Register notices (such as those for Temporary Protected Status‐based EADs) may remain in force.

Employers and authorized workers must note that, under the new rules, merely filing a timely renewal application is no longer sufficient in some categories to continue working after the card’s expiration date. An authorized worker’s EAD renewal application must first be approved by USCIS to be actually extended or renewed. Employers must terminate the employment of workers whose EADs expire while renewals are pending.

USCIS emphasized that by requiring a full adjudication before extending work authorization or renewing the document, the agency is “placing a renewed emphasis on robust alien screening and vetting … [and] Eliminating policies … that prioritized aliens’ convenience ahead of Americans’ safety and security.”

Immigration Enforcement Implications

This regulation change may allow the Trump administration to more quickly enforce immigration laws, particularly with regard to those who entered the United States illegally but were given work permits via grants of parole or have received some form of prosecutorial discretion, like deferred action.

Aliens in other categories who become removable may also face more exposure to immigration officers if their EADs expire. While this policy change by itself does not create any new enforcement authorities, it removes a bureaucratic buffer that previously gave tens of thousands of aliens cover while their renewal applications were pending before USCIS. Their records, if their EAD validity period lapses, will show as “unauthorized” in DHS systems (such as SAVE, E-Verify, PCQS, and related systems) earlier and ICE will have fewer administrative obstacles in initiating or executing removals.

Categories – especially parole-based or deferred action EADs – could also now lose their protection from enforcement more quickly if USCIS does not automatically renew their EAD and decides to deny a renewal application, which has always been subject to USCIS discretion. When employment authorization lapses, it can also trigger status reviews or end discretionary parole or deferred action, especially if the status depends on continuing EAD eligibility. That, in turn, may allow DHS to issue Notices to Appear (NTAs) sooner given current U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) goals.

USCIS Director Joseph Edlow explained that the agency is rescinding the Biden administration’s automatic EAD renewal policy to allow the agency to properly verify the applicants’ eligibility and confirm the absence of fraud or other security concerns. “It’s a commonsense measure to ensure appropriate vetting and screening has been completed before an alien’s employment authorization or documentation is extended,” Director Edlow explained in the USCIS’s announcement. Moreover, the rule’s Federal Register notice explained:

The automatic extension of the validity of an EAD grants the benefit of extending an alien’s expired EAD and/or employment authorization merely by filing a timely renewal EAD application and without first completing adjudicative review and related vetting, including resolution of derogatory information identified during the vetting process. That is, it grants the benefit without an eligibility determination; without completing vetting and screening checks; without resolving potential hits of derogatory information; and, when applicable, without a determination that the employment authorization should be granted in the exercise of discretion. Without this IFR, aliens could still obtain an automatic extension despite derogatory information that could flag them as a national security or public safety risk. As described above, vetting and screening might not be completed and derogatory information reviewed and resolved before the alien’s EAD expires. The automatic extension, therefore, poses a security vulnerability that could allow bad actors to continue to work and generate income to potentially finance nefarious activities that pose an imminent threat to the American public. Granting benefits without proper vetting and full adjudication is contrary to the mission of DHS and poses a threat to the safety and security of the American people.

In its press release, USCIS recommended that eligible aliens seeking a timely renewal of their EAD should properly file a renewal application early, up to 180 days before their EAD expires. “The longer an alien waits to file an EAD renewal application, the more likely it is that they may experience a temporary lapse in their employment authorization or documentation.”

What Was in Place Before the IFR

The IFR was issued to repeal the December 2024 regulation, issued under the Biden administration, that increased the automatic extension period for certain employment authorization document renewal applicants for both employment authorization (for aliens who are authorized incident to status) and EADs (for aliens who must apply for work authorization documents) from up to 180 days to up to 540 days from the expiration date stated on expiring Form I-766 if they have a timely filed Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. As a result of that 2024 rulemaking, the 540-day automatic extension became available to:

Asylum applicants and grantees;

Refugees;

Parents or dependent children of lawful permanent residents (green card holders);

Aliens who have applied for, and aliens who have been granted, withholding of removal;

Certain TPS applicants;

TPS recipients;

Spouses of E-1/2/3 nonimmigrant visa holders;

Spouses of L-1 nonimmigrant visa holders; certain aliens who have filed lawful permanent resident (green card) applications;

Aliens who have filed applications for suspension of deportation, cancellation of removal, or special rule cancellation of removal; aliens who have filed applications for creation of record of lawful admission for permanent residence;

Aliens who have filed applications to legalize under section 210 or 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA);

Alien spouses of H-1B nonimmigrant visa holders; and

Aliens who are the principal beneficiaries or derivative children of approved VAWA self-petitioners.

The Biden administration’s stated justification for codifying the automatic extension as a regulation in 2024 was to address USCIS’s inability to keep up with its workload (indefinitely, rather than on an as-needed basis, which the agency had done previously in the form of issuing temporary rules). In addition to financial shortfalls caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and litigation, the Biden administration’s border policies, historic expansion of TPS, and abuse of parole played a significant role in limiting the agency’s ability to manage its finances and adjudicative capacity in recent years. These policies created “[a]n additional contributing factor… a substantial and sustained increase in initial and renewal EAD applications which significantly increased renewal EAD processing times.”

The agency stated then that processing times “increased to such a level that the 180-day automatic extension for certain pending renewal EAD applications under 8 CFR 274a.13(d) was insufficient to prevent many renewal applicants from experiencing a lapse in employment authorization and/or documentation while their renewal applications remained pending with USCIS”. At that time, the agency estimated that if the agency did not automatically extend EAD validity periods, “approximately 800,000 renewal applicants would have been in danger of losing their employment authorization and/or documentation in the period beginning May 2024 and ending March 2026”.

Processing times for EADs, however, have improved. For the month of September 2025, USCIS reported an average processing time of 3.7 months for the Form 765, Application for Employment Authorization.

Opportunity to comment

While DHS’s new policy will go into effect immediately, the agency is accepting comments on the interim final rule through the end of November (or 30 days after official publication in the Federal Register).

During the comment period, members of the public can submit feedback, including support, opposition, or relevant policy alternatives, through regulations.gov or directly on the federal register’s website. Generally, all comments are publicly available for review, and agencies must review and respond to all relevant comments before it can finalize the regulation. All comments must include the agency name (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) and the docket number (DHS Docket No. USCIS-USCIS-2025-0271) for this rulemaking.

Public comments give individuals, organizations, and experts the opportunity to provide the government with real-world perspectives, data, and feedback that agencies may not otherwise have considered. By highlighting potential impacts, gaps, or improvements, these comments can influence how final policies are written and implemented.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/EAD2.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 17:01:24.324249

(Warning: This video contains violence and strong language.)

Durango Police Chief Brice Current requested the investigation, CBI said in a statement.

CBI will investigate whether the agent violated state criminal law during the Tuesday incident during a protest over the arrest of a Colombian man, Fernando Jaramillo-Solano, and his 12-year-old daughter and 15-year-old son while on their way to school.

The family’s active asylum case is pending. Jaramillo-Solano has lived in Colorado for 18 months and has no criminal history, advocates with Compañeros Four Corners Immigrant Resource Center said.

Once the probe is completed, CBI’s findings will be presented to the 6th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.

The district attorney will decide whether to file criminal charges.

The woman the agent confronted, Franci Stagi, told The Colorado Sun on Thursday she is “incredibly sore” with pain in her upper back, neck and head.

Stagi was protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office early Tuesday when she saw an unmarked car pull up about 6:15 a.m.

She began recording on her phone and asked an officer, “You’re a good Christian, aren’t you?”

“Boy, did that piss him off,” Stagi told The Sun on Tuesday, shortly after it happened. The officer, who was wearing a black vest with “police” printed on it, knocked her phone out of her hands and she tried to grab it back.

Stagi said the officer then yelled, “She’s assaulting me!” before grabbing Stagi by her hair. He put her in a chokehold and pushed her to the ground over a grassy embankment, where she landed on her head, according to a video of the interaction.

It was not clear through the video which federal agency the officer worked for. The agent did not attempt to place Stagi under arrest and let her leave after the encounter.

Because the incident happened on federal property, the FBI is also looking into the incident, Durango city officials said Wednesday. An email to an FBI spokesperson in Denver was not immediately answered Wednesday.

“During the current lapse in appropriations, FBI operations are directed toward national security, violations of federal law, and essential public safety functions,” the agency said in an automated email.

ICE’s arrests of Jaramillo-Solano and his children Monday have drawn backlash from the local community and state officials.

Gov. Jared Polis said his office was not informed of the operation, nor was it provided any information about whether Jaramillo-Solano and his children were suspected of any crimes.

“The federal government’s lack of transparency about its immigration actions in Durango and in the free state of Colorado remains extremely maddening,” he said Wednesday in a post on social media. “The federal government should prioritize apprehending and prosecuting dangerous criminals, no matter where they come from, and keep our communities safe instead of snatching up children and breaking up families.”

A community meeting about the protests with Durango city officials is set for 4 p.m. today.

Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program.","The Trump administration is drastically cutting the number of refugees it will admit to the U.S., capping it at 7,500 for the current fiscal year. That's the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was established in 1980.

The U.S. wants to primarily admit Afrikaners from South Africa, according to a notification in the Federal Register filed on Thursday, and ""other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.""

The administration has largely paused the U.S. refugee resettlement program so far this year, with the exception of a streamlined process of resettlement for white South Africans. Several hundred from the group have been resettled across the U.S. since March.

In response, some resettlement groups have been quick to voice concern over the lack of resources and limits on admission of those from other countries. Others have shuttered their services, changing the landscape of the refugee resettlement process.

Thursday's notification, which covers the fiscal year that started October 1, does not provide a reason for the lower cap, beyond mentioning previous Trump administration policies on refugees, including pausing admissions overall and barring admissions from countries seen as threats to U.S. security and welfare.

Christopher Landau, the deputy secretary of state, previously told reporters that criteria for bringing in refugees included making sure that they did not pose a national security challenge and could be easily assimilated.

""This decision doesn't just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing,"" Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, president of Global Refuge, said in a statement. ""At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program's purpose as well as its credibility.""

The Biden administration had set the refugee cap at 125,000 for fiscal year 2025.

Push for higher caps

Refugee advocates have spent the year pushing for a broader range of admissions beyond Afrikaners, including admitting people from other countries who had already been vetted to arrive in the U.S.

""It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,"" said Sharif Aly, president of the International Refugee Assistance Project. He said that the number of those with confirmed travel plans to the U.S. is greater than the new refugee cap.

The admission of Afrikaners to the U.S. has drawn scrutiny from resettlement agencies in the U.S., who have faced sharp budget, resource, and personnel cuts since President Trump took office.

Among his first executive actions, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program. Various agencies including the State Department have also paused disbursing funding for critical services for other refugees, such as the home, job and school assistance the Afrikaners are poised to receive.

The pause also sent the refugee resettlement agencies into turmoil as refugees already cleared to arrive in the U.S. received notice their flights had been cancelled.

Among those left in limbo were Afghans who worked with the U.S. military, a move that some Republicans have criticized. A lower-court judge had ordered the government to at least resume the refugee program for those who had already been approved to travel, but an appeals court ruled in favor of the administration.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/8256x4644+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F00%2F61%2F1d0efa9c410f802018d3c4e40555%2Fgettyimages-2236362748.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 15:56:58.871270

PEN America said these deceptive information practices are eroding trust in government information that the public depends on and must end.

In response, Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at PEN America, issued the following statement:

“It is becoming starkly clear that under this administration, information provided by the government may be misleading or flat-out wrong, intended to build public support for policies not shaped on their merits, but through selective or manipulated content. Certainly, both Democratic and Republican administrations have routinely infused politics into their communications, but the deceptive messaging tactics seen in recent months stand in clear contrast to the past. Federal government data and information have long been a reliable source for credible information for journalists, researchers, and the public. But increasingly, public confidence and trust in these sources is being eroded. These practices must end — the administration should be honoring the public’s right to the truth, rather than peddling falsehoods.”

The Washington Post’s reporting coincides with a new Pew Research Center analysis that found about half of Americans say it’s difficult to determine what’s true and what’s not when they get news. It comes alongside the growth of generative AI to create content, and social media amplification for distribution. The misleading videos also follow earlier moves by the administration to restrict data and research on topics of public interest that don’t align with its agenda, often with a focus on topics such as health, gender, education, and climate.

The low number represents a dramatic drop after the US previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.

The administration published the news on Thursday in a notice on the Federal Registry.

No reason was given for the drop in numbers, which are a dramatic decrease from last year’s ceiling set under the Biden administration of 125,000.

The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.

The government memo said only that the admission of the 7,500 refugees during 2026 fiscal year was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest”.

The figure had previously been reported after documents about the plans were leaked.

The announcement swiftly drew criticism from refugee organizations, with the International Refugee Assistance Project saying: “This determination makes it painfully clear that the Trump administration values politics over protection.”

“By privileging Afrikaners while continuing to ban thousands of refugees who have already been vetted and approved, the administration is once again politicizing a humanitarian program. It is egregious to exclude refugees who completed years of rigorous security checks and are currently stuck in dangerous and precarious situations,” it added.

Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, CEO of the US-based Global Refuge, took issue with the ethics of the decision.

She said: “This decision doesn’t just lower the refugee admissions ceiling. It lowers our moral standing. For more than four decades, the US refugee program has been a lifeline for families fleeing war, persecution, and repression. At a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program’s purpose as well as its credibility.”

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council posted on X.

He wrote: “Since the US Refugee Program was created in 1980, it has admitted over two million people fleeing ethnic cleansing and other horrors. Now it will be used as a pathway for white immigration. What a downfall for a crown jewel of America’s international humanitarian programs.”

In February, Trump signed an executive order to cut financial aid to South Africa after he accused its Black-led government of “unjust racial discrimination” to white Afrikaners, a minority group who are descendants of Dutch and French colonial settlers.

The Trump administration has repeatedly claimed that the South African government is implementing anti-white policies through a new land expropriation law that allegedly targets Afrikaners’ land.

The South African government has pushed back, calling the claims false as well as denying US accusations that Afrikaners are being subjected to racially motivated violence in rural areas.

Across South Africa, 72% of farms and agricultural holdings are owned by white individuals, who make up 7.3% of the total population of the country, according to Action for Southern Africa. Meanwhile, Black Africans, who make up 81.4% of the country’s population, only own around 4% of the land.

The federal government acknowledges in court documents that although “some” warrantless arrests occur, Denver ICE agents usually conduct targeted operations to arrest undocumented immigrants with warrants.","A federal judge Thursday will hear arguments on whether undocumented immigrants in Colorado who have committed no crimes can be detained without warrants signed by judges.

The civil case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado against top officials at the Department of Homeland Security represents four immigrants who were, or still are, detained in Colorado while awaiting deportation hearings. They are seeking class action status.

At issue, the ACLU and other attorneys argue, is that under federal law immigration agents are not granted unfettered authority to make warrantless arrests. In order to detain someone without a warrant signed by a judge, an agent must have probable cause to believe the person being arrested is in the United States in violation of immigration laws and likely to flee and escape before a warrant can be obtained.

ACLU lawyers say their four plaintiffs’ stories, while all different, represent a pattern in the way Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents operate in Colorado.

The four people were arrested and detained without a warrant and without any public evaluation that they were likely to flee before a warrant could be obtained. The four have lived in their communities for years and have long histories of local employment or schooling, and present no likelihood of escape, let alone probable cause for a crime, their lawyers argued in the suit.

One of the plaintiffs is Caroline Dias Goncalves, a University of Utah student who was detained after being stopped on Interstate 70 in Mesa County. She was brought to the United States from Brazil as a child and was in the United States on an expired tourist visa. She had no criminal record when she was detained for more than two weeks. Goncalves has since been released.

The plaintiffs attorneys are seeking a preliminary injunction in a two-day scheduled hearing in front of U.S. District Court Judge R. Brooke Jackson.

Lawyers for the government said in filings that the preliminary injunction would enable the ACLU attorneys to assume control over certain ICE operations in Colorado relating to arrests, training and reporting and that would be inappropriate.

The federal government acknowledges in court documents that although “some” warrantless arrests occur, Denver ICE agents usually conduct targeted operations to arrest undocumented immigrants with warrants. These operations, the federal government said in a court filing, primarily focus on immigrants with final removal orders or serious criminal history.

They also told the court that the Department of Homeland Security agents are trained to assess flight risk of the people they’re detaining.

ICE leaders want to mask the agency’s detention flights for the same reason its officers want to mask their faces: Their behavior is inhumane and indefensible.
But the work of advocates and journalists like Wilson exposes much about the true face of ICE Air.","The perpetrators of federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration are allergic to transparency.

The most widely recognized symptom of this condition is their habit of masking up. The face-covering gaiter has quickly become a shameful icon for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who’ve terrorized countless communities across Colorado and the country.

But ICE and its partners in the lawless implementation of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program mask up in other ways. As Newsline reporter Sara Wilson recently discovered, the numerous daily flights that crisscross the country to transport immigrants are difficult to track.

That’s by design.

The flights are run by ICE, which transports people to immigration detention hubs and out of the country to deport them. The operation balloons the catastrophe of detention by putting whole states between family members and undercutting the ability of detainees to seek legal help.

Think of how a normal criminal prosecution works. A person is arrested on suspicion of violating the law by uniformed, identifiable police officers. That person is booked at a local facility and possibly jailed, but in many cases they have the opportunity to secure pre-trial release, and in all cases they’re given access to legal representation.

Compare that to how faceless, unaccountable immigration officers grab residents off the street and whisk them to locations unknown to family and friends. Most people whom ICE arrests in Colorado have no criminal conviction or charge, and that tracks with the national trend. Despite constitutional rights that are supposed to protect them, they have little expectation of due process or access to legal representation.

ICE flights are a major component of this injustice.

Wilson reported that Colorado-based Key Lime Air, which many customers know as Denver Air Connection, in mid-September started running daily flights of detainees for ICE. Key Lime is the first known Colorado-based company to participate in ICE Air, the agency’s program of removal and domestic transfer flights on charter and commercial airlines.

Key Lime aircraft shuttle detainees around the country, and they frequent ICE detention hubs, particularly El Paso and Harlingen in Texas, and Alexandria, Louisiana. As part of reporting the story, Newsline journalists observed dozens of detainees exit and enter Key Lime aircraft with their hands and feet shackled.

The reporting didn’t come easy. The Key Lime planes that perform ICE Air work are devoid of company logos. The company appears to have blocked the planes’ registration numbers from at least one popular flight tracking website. When they started ferrying detainees they stopped using the Key Lime flight communication call sign, “LYM.”

Federal authorities communicate very little about the flights. We don’t know the identity of the passengers. And Key Lime was no help. Wilson had a door shut in her face at Key Lime headquarters at Centennial Airport, and when she got CEO Cliff Honeycutt on the phone he quickly ended the conversation.

Much of what is known about ICE flights comes from independent trackers, like Washington-based La Resistencia, and immigration advocates. The New York Times relied on a flight database created by refugee advocate Tom Cartwright when it published an investigation into the Alexandria deportation hub. The Guardian‘s investigation into the hub, which features a detention center on the airport tarmac, found “a pattern of alleged due process violations … neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays.”

“There is almost no legal access to the center,” the Guardian reported.

ICE leaders want to mask the agency’s detention flights for the same reason its officers want to mask their faces: Their behavior is inhumane and indefensible. And the result is the same: Malign government agents defy transparency and accountability.

,Agencies,2025-10-30 17:32:03+00:00,ProPublica,DHS Agreement Reveals Risks of Using Social Security Data for Voter Citizenship Checks,"Jen Fifield, Diego Sorbara",,,,,https://www.propublica.org/article/dhs-social-security-data-voter-citizenship-trump,"Instead, experts say, the sweeping data-sharing agreement authorizing DHS to merge Social Security data into SAVE could threaten Americans’ privacy and lead to errors that disenfranchise legitimate voters.
Under the May 15 data-sharing agreement, which was posted recently on the Social Security Administration’s website, the system added information, including full Social Security numbers, on millions of Americans not in DHS databases.
That’s because multiple audits and analyses have shown that SSA’s citizenship information is often outdated or incomplete, especially for people who became naturalized citizens.
As of last month, Homeland Security officials had run more than 33 million voters through SAVE, USCIS told NPR.
Federal officials aren’t done adding data to SAVE.","This year, when states began using an expanded Department of Homeland Security system to check their voter rolls for noncitizens, it was supposed to validate the Trump administration’s push to harness data from across federal agencies to expose illicit voting and stiffen immigration enforcement.

DHS had recently incorporated confidential data from the Social Security Administration on hundreds of millions of additional people into the tool, known as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, system. The added information allowed the system to perform bulk searches using Social Security numbers for the first time.

The initial results, however, didn’t exactly back up President Donald Trump’s contention that noncitizen voting is widespread. Texas identified 2,724 “potential noncitizens” on its rolls, about 0.015% of the state’s 18 million registered voters. Louisiana found 390 among 2.8 million registered voters, a rate of about 0.014%.

Instead, experts say, the sweeping data-sharing agreement authorizing DHS to merge Social Security data into SAVE could threaten Americans’ privacy and lead to errors that disenfranchise legitimate voters.

The details of the agreement, which haven’t previously been reported, show it contains alarmingly few guardrails to ensure accuracy and scant specifics on how the data will be kept secure, election and privacy lawyers who have reviewed it say. Further, it explicitly does not bar DHS from deploying the SSA data for other purposes, including immigration enforcement.

Experts have raised similar concerns about other parts of the Trump administration’s data-pooling drive, which has sought to tap all sorts of traditionally tightly controlled federal information, even tax data.

Until this year, SAVE contained information only on immigrants who’d had contact with DHS, such as those with permanent resident status, and had been assigned immigrant identification numbers. State and local officials typically used the system to verify immigrants’ status when they applied for benefits such as SNAP or to check, one by one, whether individuals who were registering to vote were citizens.

Under the May 15 data-sharing agreement, which was posted recently on the Social Security Administration’s website, the system added information, including full Social Security numbers, on millions of Americans not in DHS databases. The combined dataset joins together this information with addresses, birth dates and criminal records, along with immigration histories.

The agreement allows the SSA’s data to be used for searches to check voters’ citizenship, along with “other authorized inquiries from Federal, State, territorial, tribal and local government agencies seeking to verify or ascertain the citizenship or immigration status of individuals within their jurisdiction.”

In doing these searches, SAVE stores not only the voter data that election officials upload but also the outcome of their queries, according to the data-sharing agreement and other documents from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the branch of DHS that oversees SAVE. The documents do not explain who can access this information or how it can be used.

Experts say adding Social Security data to SAVE could help election officials verify, en masse, if voters are U.S. citizens, but it shouldn’t be used to make final determinations that people aren’t citizens.

That’s because multiple audits and analyses have shown that SSA’s citizenship information is often outdated or incomplete, especially for people who became naturalized citizens. With the 2026 midterms about a year away, Caren Short, director of legal and research for the League of Women Voters of the United States, said she fears the expanded use of SAVE will lead to errors.

“The Trump administration is hunting people to try to purge people from the rolls who are lawfully registered, and they are doing it by looking at unreliable, outdated data,” Short said.

Several privacy lawyers said they believe it’s illegal for DHS to expand the use of SAVE without taking steps required in federal law, such as issuing a system of records notice to inform the public how the additional data will be collected, stored and used. Last month, advocacy groups sued the federal government, alleging that its expansion of SAVE and other data consolidation efforts violate the Privacy Act, a federal law that prohibits public agencies from misusing private information.

Officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services declined to answer questions from ProPublica.

In a filing responding to the advocacy groups’ lawsuit, federal officials said that another statute, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, explicitly allows information sharing to verify citizenship status and that agencies would exercise caution in determining whether voters are noncitizens.

“There is zero basis to assume that State officials have any interest in haphazardly and unlawfully removing large numbers of U.S. citizens from their voter rolls, and no credible evidence that any such thing has happened or is going to happen any time soon” the filing says.

Still, Leland Dudek, acting SSA commissioner until early May, told ProPublica he doesn’t trust that DHS will accurately flag noncitizens as officials try to cross-match data and files from multiple systems.

“They are probably going to make some massive mistakes,” he said.

This summer, the Justice Department started demanding access to state voter registration lists, saying this was necessary to ensure compliance with federal voter roll maintenance laws. The agency has filed lawsuits against a number of states that have refused to comply.

Some of the states that have refused to provide voters’ private information directly to the Justice Department have entered into agreements with DHS under which they upload that same information into the SAVE system.

According to a document obtained by the ACLU, which sued the administration for SAVE-related records, a growing number of states are signing agreements with DHS to use SAVE to vet voter rolls. Ten states had signed such agreements coming into 2025; as of July, another 10 had signed on, the document shows.

As counsel for Protect Democracy, a nonprofit voting rights group, Naomi Gilens specializes in issues related to privacy and technology. Gilens said it’s important for Americans to consider if they want the government — including future administrations, not just this one — to have so much consolidated information on them.

“That is a very invasive picture that starts to be painted, in one place, for every individual who lives here’s private lives,” she said.

As of last month, Homeland Security officials had run more than 33 million voters through SAVE, USCIS told NPR. So far, the agency has declined to say publicly what the outcome of these queries have been.

But the initial results are tucked into another document obtained by the ACLU.

As of late August, about 96.3% of the voters checked in the SAVE system were identified by the system as U.S. citizens. For an additional 3.1% of voters, the system either couldn’t find them or needed more information to determine their citizenship status. About 0.5% of voters checked had died, the system found. And 0.04% showed up as noncitizens.

According to copies of 12 state agreements with DHS obtained by the ACLU and reviewed by ProPublica, election officials are required to take additional steps to verify SAVE results for voters the system identifies as other than U.S. Citizens. Then, if SAVE still can’t verify citizenship, the election officials “must contact the registrant or registered voter to obtain proof of citizenship.”

Dudek and Kathleen Romig, a former Social Security official who now works at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, worry even those steps won’t be enough to prevent mismatches from happening.

People’s names can be misspelled or listed differently in the various datasets. Many states collect partial, not full, Social Security numbers from voters and matches using partial numbers will be even less accurate, since many people share the same names, Dudek and Romig said.

“If there’s Jane Smith that is a citizen, and a Jane Smith that isn’t, you don’t want to disenfranchise the citizen Jane Smith by accident,” Romig said.

Federal officials aren’t done adding data to SAVE. Next up, according to a recent USCIS presentation to election officials shared with ProPublica: passport information from the State Department. (The State Department referred ProPublica’s request for comment to DHS, which did not respond.)","https://www.propublica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/save-voting-data-FINAL_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_quality_95_embedColorProfile_true.jpg?resize=2000,1333",N,,2025-10-30 14:04:59.307960

Tracking and evaluating the evolution of immigration enforcement, however, will be increasingly difficult without regularly published and reliable data.
At a time when immigration enforcement has been deemed a high federal priority, it is in the national interest for the government to provide transparent, regular, reliable immigration enforcement data.","Unauthorized migration at the U.S.-Mexico border plunged dramatically during the just-ended fiscal year, as the Trump administration leveraged new border controls, further asylum restrictions, and the promise of mass deportations, reaching about 444,000 migrant encounters recorded in fiscal year (FY) 2025. This sharp drop from 2.1 million encounters the prior year was also marked by reversion to a pattern last experienced more than a decade ago: Flows primarily composed of Mexican single adults and Central American unaccompanied children.

The steep decrease in unauthorized arrivals at the border and return to nationalities that are easier to turn back because of existing repatriation agreements has permitted the administration to direct its focus to immigration enforcement in the U.S. interior—in fact deploying significant U.S. Border Patrol assets to cities such as Los Angeles and Chicago. To achieve its goal of mass deportations, the administration has increased coordination among federal agencies, elevated cooperation with state and local law enforcement agencies, rapidly accelerated the build-up of detention capacity, expanded the use of fast-track removal powers, tapped the U.S. military, and established new agreements to repatriate returnees to third countries. As a result, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recorded more deportations from within U.S. communities during FY 2025 than the Border Patrol apprehended people crossing the Southwest border illegally—the first time since at least FY 2014, according to available data.

While detailed FY 2025 data about ICE arrests and removals have not been released since January, there is no doubt that interior enforcement has risen. But it has become increasingly complicated to track results because only selective statistics have been made public. Returning to regular reporting of detailed data on immigration enforcement across the various Department of Homeland Security (DHS) immigration agencies could not only improve the public’s understanding of current immigration enforcement activities but also inform state and local stakeholders who want to collaborate or who are affected by enforcement.

Ramped-Up Interior Enforcement and Mass Deportations

While U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) continues to post border encounter statistics every month, DHS has inconsistently released immigration enforcement data and its last detailed tables of ICE and CBP actions ended with November 2024 activity. Based on the latest publicly available figures, however, the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) estimates that ICE conducted about 340,000 deportations in FY 2025, including noncitizens with a formal order of removal and immigration detainees who chose to end their detention with a voluntary departure. This would mark a level of activity 25 percent higher than the 271,000 deportations recorded by ICE in FY 2024. These fiscal year figures do not include deportations conducted by CBP, which DHS has yet to release.

The administration says it conducted more than 400,000 deportations overall between ICE and CBP in its first 250 days, and was on pace to reach nearly 600,000 by the end of its first year. This projection falls short of the 685,000 deportations recorded by the Biden administration in FY 2024—and is well off the Trump administration’s pledge of carrying out 1 million deportations per year.

Location Matters

Where the deportations are happening is significantly different under the Trump administration, with more occurring within the U.S. interior rather than at the border. This has significant operational impacts, given deportations in the interior are likely to be far more resource intensive and carry higher individual and societal costs with enforcement happening in U.S. cities and against people who, unlike many recent border crossers, often have significant years of U.S. residence and deep community ties.

Of the 400,000 deportations conducted by the Trump administration through its first 250 days, MPI estimates approximately 234,000 were conducted by ICE from the U.S. interior, with another 166,000 by CBP.

ICE daily deportations, in fact, doubled from 600 in January to 1,200 since June. ICE deportations have increased as the number of immigrants being placed in detention centers has surged. Since the start of the Trump administration, the average number of noncitizens in ICE detention centers has grown gradually, reaching about 60,000 by the end of FY 2025 (see Figure 1). And by March, most detainees had been arrested by ICE in the interior, not by CBP at the border or through CBP transfer to ICE, as was usually the case under the Biden administration.

Note: Data on immigrant detainees are through September 20, 2025.

Source: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), “FY 2025 ICE Statistics,” updated September 22, 2025.

Among detainees arrested by ICE, a shrinking share had a criminal conviction despite the administration’s pledge of targeting “dangerous criminals” and the “worst of the worst.” About 35 percent of detainees arrested by ICE had a criminal conviction in September 2025 compared to 65 percent in October 2024 (see Figure 2). Meanwhile, the share of detainees with immigration violations but no criminal charges increased from 6 percent in October 2024 to 35 percent in September 2025.

Figure 2. Detainees Arrested by ICE, by Month and Criminality, FY 2025

Note: Data on immigrant detainees are through September 20, 2025.

Source: ICE, “FY 2025 ICE Statistics.”

Once in detention, it is increasingly unlikely that immigrants will be released. The share who were released on bond or under parole or supervision fell from 26 percent in October 2024, at the end of the Biden administration, to 3 percent in September 2025. In fact, 90 percent of those in ICE detention in September 2025 were deported directly from detention, compared to 63 percent of those in an ICE facility in October 2024.

How long a noncitizen spends in ICE detention depends on whether they were arrested by CBP or ICE, as well as their criminal history. The average length of detention for detainees arrested by CBP was 63 days, compared to 44 days if they were arrested by ICE. Immigrants categorized as “other immigration violator” and who were arrested by ICE had a shorter length of detention (32 days) than those with criminal convictions or charges (47 days). It is possible the difference is due to delays in criminal proceedings and/or delays in deporting individuals with criminal convictions or pending charges to their countries of origin.

Trends at the U.S.-Mexico Border

CBP recorded 444,000 migrant encounters at and between ports of entry in FY 2025, down from 2.1 million encounters a year earlier. The 238,000 encounters by the Border Patrol of migrants crossing the border without authorization represent a 55-year low. (The remaining 206,000 were encountered at ports of entry by CBP’s Office of Field Operations.)

Notably, 75 percent of the FY 2025 encounters were recorded in the last four months of the Biden administration. Irregular arrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border fell sharply at the start of the Trump administration, continuing a trend that began in January 2024 and accelerated mid-year, and have remained consistently low since. Since February, the Southwest border has seen an average of 11,000 encounters a month. In fact, daily Border Patrol interdictions reached as low as 116 in July—a far cry from the 11,000 recorded on some days during the record arrivals experienced in December 2023.

The Border Patrol effectively ended the practice termed “catch and release,” with only about a dozen encountered migrants released into the United States with notices to appear (NTAs) in immigration court. From February through September, the Border Patrol processed more than 94 percent of migrants it encountered for expedited removal, reinstatement of removal, voluntary return, or ICE detention. As much as this was the result of policy change, it was also due to the Border Patrol’s capacity to more quickly process migrants and transfer them out of its custody given that arrivals fell sharply and returned to the pattern of originating from nearby countries with which the U.S. government has long had repatriation agreements.

While these measures have reduced irregular crossings of migrants of all nationalities and demographic groups, they appear to be especially effective in reducing encounters of families and migrants from countries other than Mexico. Mexicans accounted for 45 percent of Border Patrol encounters in October 2024, a share that rose to 69 percent by September 2025 (see Figure 3). Over the same period, the share of migrants from countries other than Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, Colombia, or Venezuela fell from 28 percent to 11 percent.

Source: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), “Nationwide Encounters,” updated October 24, 2025.

Similarly, as the share of “family unit” encounters (CBP’s term for an adult or minor child traveling with a family member) dropped from 27 percent to 12 percent, the share of single adults increased from 63 percent to 79 percent (see Figure 4).

Figure 4. Share of Encounters of Migrants Crossing the U.S-Mexico Border without Authorization, by Month and Demographic Group, FY 2025

This makes today’s migration patterns resemble those of 13 years ago, when most migrants arriving at the border were single adults from Mexico or unaccompanied children from Central America.

The Future of Immigration Enforcement

Whether the Trump administration reaches its goal of 1 million deportations annually or not, it has implemented a vast array of policy and operational changes that have reshaped the direction of immigration enforcement. The infusion of $45 billion from Congress to build new immigrant detention centers and $30 billion to expand enforcement and deportation operations provided under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act alone will transform ICE and further enhance cooperation with state and local law enforcement over the coming years.

Tracking and evaluating the evolution of immigration enforcement, however, will be increasingly difficult without regularly published and reliable data. Instead of releasing detailed tables on immigration enforcement each month, as done under prior administrations, the Trump administration has relied on issuing a constellation of individual statistics in press releases, tweets, and media interviews, which have conflated sources at times. This has made it difficult to verify the administration’s success against its policy objectives as well as the impacts on federal agencies, immigrants, and U.S. communities alike.

In the case of Cisco, the Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco’s activities involving China took place in the United States.
The plaintiffs’ lawyers make a similar case, citing Cisco marketing materials in China that promoted routers for use in tanks.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Two prominent Republicans on Capitol Hill want the Supreme Court to allow a lawsuit to proceed against tech giant Cisco over allegations that the company’s technology was used to persecute members of the Falun Gong spiritual movement in China.

In a Wednesday letter to the Trump administration’s top Supreme Court litigator, D. John Sauer, Reps. Chris Smith of New Jersey and John Moolenaar of Michigan urged the administration to side with the Falun Gong plaintiffs and press the court to allow the lawsuit to go to trial.

Smith co-chairs the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, while Moolenaar is the chairman of a special China committee set up in the House of Representatives — and both are prominent critics of Beijing’s human rights record. The letter cited an AP investigation last month that showed American tech companies to a large degree designed and built China’s surveillance state, saying it “underscore(s) the need to deter American firms from supplying technology to facilitate the CCP’s human rights abuses.”

The decision ultimately rests with the Supreme Court whether to hear the challenge brought by Cisco arguing that U.S. law does not permit such a suit. But as part of considering the case the court sought the views of the solicitor general, who represents the U.S. government’s position in oral arguments and proceedings.

The Trump administration’s view on the case will also be of interest to the court because Cisco has argued that the case involves U.S. foreign relations and should be dismissed on those grounds. The solicitor general is expected to file a brief later this year or early next year.

“The allegation that an American tech company custom-designed a tool to facilitate the violent persecution of a religious minority by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is a serious one,” the two lawmakers wrote in a letter to Sauer. “We believe the Plaintiffs deserve the chance to prove their claims.”

“We have a longstanding commitment to uphold and respect human rights for all people and if the 2023 ruling of the Ninth Circuit Court stands, it opens the floodgates for suits against U.S. corporations merely for legal exports of off-the-shelf goods and services,” said a spokesperson for Cisco.

The case has a long and winding history dating back more than a decade.

In 2008, documents leaked to the press showed Cisco saw the “Golden Shield” as a sales opportunity, quoting a Chinese official calling the Falun Gong an “evil cult.” A Cisco presentation reviewed by AP from the same year said its products could identify over 90% of Falun Gong material on the web.

Other presentations reviewed by AP show that Cisco represented Falun Gong material as a “threat” and built out a national information system to track Falun Gong believers. In 2011, Falun Gong members sued Cisco, alleging the company tailored technology for Beijing that they knew would be used to track, detain and torture believers.

The issue before the Supreme Court is whether an American company can be held liable under two separate laws for aiding and abetting human rights violations. Cisco argues it isn’t liable under those laws, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), but a federal appeals court rejected the company’s arguments in 2023, allowing the case to continue. Now Cisco is asking the Supreme Court to throw out that ruling and stop the lawsuit.

In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. In the case of Cisco, the Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco’s activities involving China took place in the United States.

An AP investigation this week found that the U.S. government across five Republican and Democratic administrations repeatedly allowed and even actively helped American firms to sell technology to Chinese police and surveillance companies, even as activists warned such tools were being used to quash dissent, persecute religious groups and target minorities.

Going into the long-heralded meeting Thursday between leaders Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, the sale of U.S. technology to China has been among the thorniest issues the U.S. faces, with billions of dollars and the future of tech dominance at stake. Trump said after the meeting that China will speak with Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia about purchasing their computer chips.

Debate over the sale of technology to China has grown heated, with some arguing for a harder stance.

American companies have pushed back against restrictions, arguing it will push China to develop its own domestic supply and strengthen its position in the global race for leadership in artificial intelligence.

But many national security experts say selling such technology could assist China’s military and intelligence services. The plaintiffs’ lawyers make a similar case, citing Cisco marketing materials in China that promoted routers for use in tanks.

If the Cisco suit is successful, it would signal that American companies can be held liable in some circumstances for abuse of their technologies overseas.

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, accuses Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the 1st Amendment. This case is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks out against them,” Abughazaleh said Wednesday in a video posted to BlueSky.

Protesters have been gathering outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations, beginning on Wednesday. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. A message left with her campaign wasn’t immediately returned. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle, the indictment said.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Abughazaleh is running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others have exercised our 1st Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors, and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” Abughazaleh says in the video.

“As scary as all of this is, I have spent my career fighting America’s backslide into fascism,” she says. “I’m not gonna stop now, and I hope you won’t either.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/853a42f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2e%2Fd2%2F5d4f87164f8ca12c90383d75cd55%2F4eddb6fc5b6a4702be7022c3bb390a76.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 14:04:54.917733

Initially, the Agriculture Department signaled in its own public guidance that it would indeed use this contingency money to prevent an interruption to food stamp benefits.
But the Trump administration abruptly reversed course this month, saying that it could not legally drain the available reserves, except in cases of natural disasters.
Late Wednesday, the Trump administration reaffirmed its opposition.
The administration added that it would be “operationally fraught” if the court sided with states, and forced the government to preserve SNAP benefits using emergency reserves.","The Trump administration staunchly defended its decision to stop paying food stamps during the government shutdown, insisting that a range of legal, technical and budgetary constraints would prevent it from providing a tranche of available funds to millions of poor Americans in November.

In a new set of court filings, submitted late Wednesday, administration officials acknowledged that they had billions of dollars left over across multiple federal accounts. The amounts appeared to total more than would be needed to cover the full costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for the next month.

But lawyers for the Justice Department signaled that the administration could not, or would not, use those funds, leaving 42 million food stamp recipients at risk of cuts to their benefits beginning on Nov. 1.

The Trump administration repeatedly argued that there were legal obstacles to transferring existing funds to SNAP, technical hurdles in remitting payments quickly and other budgetary constraints to consider at the Agriculture Department, where the money would originate.

The arguments set the stage for what is likely to be a tense, high-stakes hearing on Thursday morning in Massachusetts, where more than two dozen states have asked a judge to force the Trump administration to reprogram the budget and provision full aid for food stamps before Nov. 1.

In its filings, the Trump administration acknowledged that an interruption to food stamps would create a “difficult situation for millions of Americans,” but it insisted the court did not have the ability to prevent it.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment.

The administration’s refusal to act underscored its broader strategy over the course of a fiscal stalemate that is now in its fifth week. Throughout, President Trump has been willing to reprogram the federal budget, but only selectively, safeguarding programs at the heart of his political agenda while leaving some Americans to face the risk of real harm from the shutdown.

For the roughly one in eight Americans who participate in the food stamp program, the immediate threat is hunger and financial hardship, with SNAP benefits set to disappear starting on Nov. 1. The benefits average around $187 a month, costing the federal government about $8 billion monthly, which lawmakers replenish every year as part of the budget process.

SNAP also maintains a reserve in case of emergencies or shortfalls, and many Democrats and Republicans had encouraged the Trump administration to tap that fund — totaling about $5 billion — in the event the shutdown entered November. Initially, the Agriculture Department signaled in its own public guidance that it would indeed use this contingency money to prevent an interruption to food stamp benefits.

But the Trump administration abruptly reversed course this month, saying that it could not legally drain the available reserves, except in cases of natural disasters. The decision caused broad panic and outcry, and prompted 25 states and the District of Columbia to sue, arguing that the federal government had a legal and moral obligation to provision food aid.

Late Wednesday, the Trump administration reaffirmed its opposition.

Officials told the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts that the law did not allow them to transfer or spend money that Congress had not appropriated, or in ways that lawmakers did not intend. That, they said, precluded many of the avenues that states have suggested for funding SNAP during the shutdown.

The administration added that it would be “operationally fraught” if the court sided with states, and forced the government to preserve SNAP benefits using emergency reserves. Officials said that it could take weeks, in some cases, to provision food stamps this way — and that doing so may leave beneficiaries with only less than half the amount they would normally receive in a month under SNAP.

“Such a partial payment has never been made — and for good reason,” the government said in its filing.

The Trump administration also argued against using a second tranche of funds — roughly $16.8 billion in leftover money for nutrition programs, financed partly by customs collections — to sustain SNAP in November. That same pot of funds had allowed the White House only weeks earlier to prevent an interruption to another low-income federal food assistance program, known as WIC, during the shutdown.

Officials acknowledged this week that there were “several differences” that precluded them from taking the same approach with SNAP. At one point, they argued that it would cut into funds that should be available for child nutrition, forcing Congress to replenish the program later.

“In short, there was no option to simply fund the SNAP program fully without an appropriation,” the government said, adding that the states’ request “portended its own costs and damaging consequences.”

The government’s assertions offered a stark contrast with Mr. Trump’s other actions during the shutdown, which has seen the administration move around billions of dollars to continue paying troops and law enforcement agents, including those assisting the administration’s mass deportations.

Unlike those functions of government, however, SNAP is a program that Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans have long sought to cut. They sharply restricted the program as part of their recent package of tax cuts, arguing that it was plagued by waste, fraud and abuse.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/30/multimedia/30dc-snap-htkw/30dc-snap-htkw-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 13:01:19.855593

A woman faces the same felony charge and is considered a fugitive.

U.S. Homeland Security swept into Oxnard the morning of Oct. 29 with a tactical vehicle, tear gas and dozens of federal agents to arrest two people accused of interfering with the immigration raid at Glass House Farms in July.

According to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, agents arrested Isai Carrillo, 31, of Oxnard. He is charged with conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer, stemming from his involvement in protests against the July 10 raid of Glass House, a licensed cannabis grower in Camarillo. Federal agents arrested more than 300 people that day at two Glass House facilities for suspected immigration violations.

Virginia Reyes, 32, also of Oxnard, faces the same felony charge. She was not arrested on Oct. 29 and ""is considered a fugitive,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office stated.

Reyes and Carrillo are siblings, according to the criminal complaint against the two of them, which was filed in federal court on Oct. 28.

The deployment of federal agents on Wednesday drew dozens of protesters. The agents used chemical agents, flash bangs and an armored tactical vehicle to control the crowd.

""It felt like they escalated it,"" said Oxnard City Councilman Gabe Teran, questioning the level of force used. ""It certainly felt like a lot of people to go after a young lady and a young man.”

Siblings accused of obstructing, assaulting officers

According to the criminal complaint against them, Reyes and Carrillo are both affiliated with VC Defensa, a local organization that monitors federal immigration enforcement activity and posts about immigration raids on social media.

On July 10, as federal agents were headed to Glass House Farms in Camarillo, VC Defensa members were on their way, too, and posting alerts to social media about the impending raid before it began.

The criminal complaint against Reyes and Carrillo states that members of VC Defensa gathered farm equipment and barricaded the main entrance to Glass House Farms, forcing federal agents to use a different exit.

According to the complaint, Reyes stopped her car in front of one of the exits to the farm, partially blocking federal agents’ vehicles and slowing them down as they left the site. Other protesters, including Carrillo, then threw rocks at the government vehicles, the complaint states. At least four of the vehicles were damaged and one federal contract employee was injured by shards of glass.

The complaint includes photos from July 10 that show protesters throwing large rocks at the agents’ vehicles from close range. One of the people throwing rocks is identified in the complaint as Carrillo, and one photo shows him getting into the back seat of a car that the complaint says was driven by Reyes.

The complaint states that at least 10 people “acted in concert to impede and assault federal officers and damage government property,” though only Reyes and Carrillo have been charged with any crimes.

“Although not every member or associate of VC Defensa is involved in violations of federal law, several VC Defensa members are involved in conspiracies to impede and assault federal officers during the commission of their duties,” a special agent who investigated the case wrote in an affidavit included in the criminal complaint.

In a statement posted to Instagram on Oct. 29, VC Defensa called the allegations against the group “completely false.”

“This is part of a witch hunt against anyone who uses their First Amendment rights to organize and speak out against ICE’s campaign of terror on immigrant communities,” VC Defensa’s statement says.

Arrest involved 'out of the ordinary' resources

Homeland security notified the Oxnard Police Department at 5:49 a.m. on Oct. 29 that federal agents were serving a warrant in the area of Palm Drive and A Street, near Wilson Park, said Oxnard Police Chief Jason Benites.

Homeland security came with several dozen agents. Oxnard police were ""not involved in this thing,"" Benites said.

Federal agents formed a perimeter around the neighborhood for the operation and brought in an armored rescue vehicle, the chief said.

""That's out of the ordinary,"" he said of the vehicle.

Benites said he and other officers monitored the situation by watching television broadcasts where they saw agents deploy crowd-control measures. The operation ended shortly before 9 a.m., he said.

""We stayed clear of it,"" Benites said. ""Obviously, it's not our operation. We don't have jurisdiction over them.""

People at the scene later in the morning said agents deployed chemical agents on crowds that formed around the perimeter. Some were wiping the chemicals from their faces and others were treating minor wounds suffered in the scuffle.

""The agents used gas as they prepared to depart, reportedly because demonstrators were attempting to block them and impeded their efforts,"" Oxnard Mayor Luis Mc Arthur said in an Instagram post. In an interview, he said the agents' actions created chaos and could have been handled in a way that lessened the impact on the community.

It appeared at least four people and at least one minor were placed in zip ties during the action, said Primitiva Hernandez, executive director of the 805 UndocuFund group that operates a response network to immigration enforcement actions.

""The fact that children were placed in zip ties is alarming,"" Hernandez said. She questioned the tactics and the number of agents depoyed to A Street.

""This wasn't about detaining two people,"" she said. ""This was about terrorizing the community, and no one should stand by this level of violence.""

Oxnard Union High School District officials said a Pacifica High School student was detained in the action and later released. The student is a U.S. citizen, they said.

“This incident did not occur on campus or near any Oxnard Union High School District school,” they said in a email to families.

The arrest happened near the downtown Oxnard offices of The Arc of Ventura County, a nonprofit that provides services to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

Esther Anaya, The Arc's executive director, said she got a call at 7 a.m. from a program manager with the organization, who told her federal agents had taped off the street and blocked access to The Arc's building.

About 70 disabled people were expected at The Arc at around 8 a.m. Anaya called the organization's transportation provider and rerouted everyone to The Arc's location in Ventura.

""We were making sure the people we support and the people we employ are safe,"" she said.

Anaya said she was tear-gassed later as federal agents deployed chemical agents against protesters.

""We have masks because of COVID, so I asked the staff that were here to get me as many boxes as they could so we could hand them out to the people who were here, protesting, peacefully, legally, as is their right under the Constitution,"" she said.

Teran, the Oxnard city council member, said he came to the north perimeter of the action at about 6:30 a.m., part of a crowd that grew to about 60 people. He said he saw agents taking photos and videos of the crowd and exhibiting what he called unprofessionalism and poor conduct.

He plans to express his concerns to ICE’s Office of Professional Responsibility. The councilman, who also came to the Glass House scene on July 10, said he also worries about the future.

“I don’t see a pathway that is going to have things get any better,” he said. “I only see further escalation of tactics and how they approach this as a federal agency.”","https://www.vcstar.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/10/29/PVCS/86967529007-raid.jpg?crop=827,465,x0,y143&width=827&height=465&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-10-30 17:01:32.251737

We must never forget that when we say, “never again,” that means today as well.","Protests have broken out across the country against this administration’s immigration enforcement policies. We have seen images of protesters getting arrested, hurt, and pepper sprayed. One image that has struck a chord with Presbyterians was the images of Rev. David Black (First Presbyterian of Chicago, IL) being shot in the head by a pepper ball. The Office of Immigration Issues and Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA) are working together to support Rev. Black and other congregations in the Chicago area. PDA has sent an emergency grant to the Presbytery of Chicago to help them support families who have been impacted by recent immigration enforcement.

The current dismantling of the refugee, asylum, and other immigration status that protect persecuted immigrants contrasts with the lessons we learned from history.

The need for a global refugee framework started at the end of World War II. As Allied troops started entering parts of Europe that were occupied by Nazi Germany, American soldiers ran into the first concentration camps. Soldiers in Asia would run into aftermath of massacres and slavery imposed by the Imperial Japanese. Soldiers would describe the gruesome scenes in their diaries, letters, and over the next decades, speak about it through documentaries. Jewish people and other persecuted people would add to that voice over the years.

One of the most infamous cases of apathy was the case of the MS St. Louis. In 1939, Jewish Europeans went on a cruise ship and tried to obtain protection from persecution in Cuba. The Cuban government turned them away before they could land. They then tried to get protection from the American and Canadian government, but they also denied them. With no choice, the MS St. Louis was forced to turn around back to Europe. Some people were given protection by some European countries not aligned with Nazi Germany, but by the end of the war, 254 of the 937 (27%) passengers were murdered.

For Asian immigrants it was no different. At the time, the Chinese Exclusion Act, alongside the Johnson-Reed Act, banned most Asian people from entering the United States. In one example of the world failing to protect people, millions of Chinese people were massacred, and human rights violation were committed against them at the Battle of Nanjing. Despite this massacre and other atrocities, the United States did not repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act until 1943, and even when it was repealed, only 105 visas were issued to Chinese immigrants every year. It wouldn’t be until the 1965 with the passage of the Immigrant and National Act that Asian migrants were finally allowed to come in without a quota limit.

After the end of WWII, millions of refugees were scattered throughout the world. The world agreed that we would not repeat the mistakes of the war. One of the largest mistakes was the world’s apathy towards refugees trying to escape persecution by the Axis Powers in Europe and Asia. Millions across the world were murdered because of who they were. Yet when they sought protection in other countries, they were turned away.

It was during this time that Presbyterian Disaster Assistance (PDA) began as a response to the refugee crisis as a result of WWII. At that time, PDA was known as Presbyterian World Service. On top of creating PDA, the General Assembly in 1947 passed an overture asking the government to take in 100,000 refugees.

In 1951, the Convention on the Status of Refugees was created. For the first time, the world recognized a global right to petition for protection from persecution in a second country. Since the creation of the U.S. refugee program in 1981, over 3 million people have been successfully resettled. The U.S. now has the largest refugee resettlement program in the world! The U.S. has traditionally resettled the most vulnerable refugee cases including women and children at risk, women heads of households, the elderly, survivors of violence and torture and those with acute medical needs. In 2024, 125,000 refugees were resettled.

There are over 100 million people displaced around the world today. Now more than ever, we should not shrink from our responsibility to protect people who are being persecuted.

The President is expected to announce that the new refugee admissions ceiling will be only 7,500 with most of those slots going to white South Africa Afrikaners. This reduction in refugee numbers will put many in danger who are being persecuted, and it is unjust to the refugees who have been in the years-long refugee background check process. Those refugees on the waitlist now must wait longer to hopefully be resettled with a welcoming administration. This is not to mention that the administration has effectively ended people’s right to petition for asylum at the border a clear violation of the Convention on the Status of Refugees.

Although the refugee and asylum process has been effectively closed, PDA has shifted our work to support congregations and mid-councils protecting people who have sought safety in the U.S. This includes Know Your Rights trainings across many presbyteries, offering technical assistance, offering opportunities to learn more about immigration, supporting advocacy efforts by congregations and individual Presbyterians, and offering grants to programs that are working with migrants.

As Presbyterians, we have been here before. In the 1980 General Assembly, the church voted to approve an overture recommending all congregations to sponsor one or two individuals. In the 1980s, many refugees showed up at the border escaping the civil wars in Central America. When the government refused to give these refugees protections from being deported to their war-torn countries, The Presbyterian Church and other denominations and faiths started the Sanctuary movement. During this time, churches offered protection to migrants at their churches. Although this strategy does not work in today’s world, the spirit of protecting refugees has been a cornerstone of the Presbyterian faith. In 2022, the General Assembly declared that the Presbyterian Church is a Sanctuary and Accompaniment Church.

In the Bible we see many stories of people seeking refuge. Jesus and his family left to seek protection in Egypt from Herod’s tyranny. Ruth left her homeland to go with her mother-in-law, Naomi, after losing her husband. Moses guided the former enslaved Hebrews through the desert. The Hebrews forced to leave their homes during the Babylonian Exile. And of course, let’s remember that God directly commands us to protect our foreigner neighbors: “""When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat them. Treat the foreigner who resides with you as the native-born among you, and love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the Lord your God"" (Leviticus 19:33-34 NIV)

We must understand as Presbyterians that the time to act is now, not later. Rev. Black and other Presbyterians across the country are acting now through protests in solidarity with migrants and accompanying them to their court appearances. In cooperation with other denominations, the Stated Clerk has released a letter that condemns the administration for having a low refugee admissions ceiling. PDA is acting now. You can act today by looking for organizations in your community already doing the immigrant accompaniment work in your community. If there is not one, it may be God’s call to you to start one.

The law at issue lets a president deploy state National Guard troops to suppress a rebellion or if he is ""unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.""

The Justice Department asked the court in an emergency filing on October 17 to lift Chicago-based U.S. District Judge April Perry's decision to block the Guard deployment while litigation in the challenge continues.

Perry ruled that Trump likely violated the law establishing preconditions for federalizing Guard troops, as well as the state's rights under the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment.

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces answering to state governors except when called into federal service by the president.

The case has been characterized by starkly different portrayals of the protests against the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement in and around Chicago.

The administration has said that the words ""regular forces"" mean that the president can call up the National Guard if non-military federal agents who regularly enforce federal laws cannot properly do so.

In an October 10 written ruling, Perry said that historical sources indicate that ""regular forces"" means only members regularly enlisted in the military, including the Army and Navy, as opposed to the National Guard.

Perry wrote that ""in order for the President to call forth the militia to execute the laws, the President must be incapable with the regular forces - that is, lacking the power and force with the military alone - to execute the law.""

Advt

Trump's administration ""made no attempt to rely on the regular forces before resorting to federalization of the National Guard,"" Perry said, adding that there are other limits on the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

The Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld Perry's decision. Noting the debate over the meaning of ""regular forces,"" the three-judge panel said that the administration had not met its burden under either standard.

""Even applying great deference to the administration's view of the facts ... there is insufficient evidence that protest activity in Illinois has significantly impeded the ability of federal officers to execute federal immigration laws,"" the appeals court said.

Sporadic disruptions during protests ""have been quickly contained by local, state, and federal authorities. At the same time, immigration arrests and deportations have proceeded apace,"" the appeals court added. (Reporting by Andrew Chung; editing by Diane Craft)

The felony indictment, filed last week by a special grand jury, charges Kat Abughazaleh and five others of conspiring to impede an officer.

""This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court blocked the order before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She's running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

""I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,"" she said. “I hope you won’t either.”

Paula Schwan, the police chief, explained the city's stance on resident interactions at the meeting.

""When our officers interact with residents or visitors, we do not ask for immigration status,"" Schwan said. ""If someone is arrested, we do not contact ICE to inform them any undocumented person is in custody, and when someone is released, we provide no information beyond what is already publicly available.""

Congress enacted explicit limitations by adding a sunset clause requiring new legislation and enacted implicit limitations by linking the law to an underlying embargo statute that included a sunset clause.
Besides embargo statutes, the delegations with limited locations fit within two subcategories: trade-reciprocity statutes and treaty-implementation measures.","On Nov. 5, the Supreme Court will hear argument in Trump v. V.O.S. Selections. The Court will address two questions: whether President Trump had authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to issue tariffs against Canada, China, and Mexico on Feb. 1, and “reciprocal tariffs” against nearly all U.S. trading partners on April 2; and, if so, whether IEEPA constitutes an unlawful delegation of legislative authority.

The case turns on whether IEEPA, enacted shortly after the National Emergencies Act of 1976 (NEA), confers tariff authority on the president and, if so, what the president’s scope of action is under the statute and the Constitution. In the absence of any intelligible bounds in the statute itself—and any realistic way to check the president following the Court’s decision to strike down the legislative veto (present in the NEA and applicable to IEEPA emergencies) in Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Chadha—IEEPA violates the Constitution’s nondelegation doctrine. As we have suggested in previous articles and one of us has argued in an amicus brief in the V.O.S. Selections case, the Court should address the delegation issues inherent to IEEPA.

Here, we address an important position shared by several noted academic commentators—sometimes called “foreign affairs exceptionalism”—that nondelegation strictures have little to say about congressional grants of authority in the foreign affairs context. This view is based in part on functional considerations that presidents have access to superior intelligence on the underlying issues, need flexibility to deal with unforeseeable events, and must act under the shield of confidentiality. It also, however, draws essential and continuing sustenance from Justice George Sutherland’s opinion for the Court (Justice James McReynolds dissented without opinion and Justice Harlan Stone did not participate) in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.

In that opinion, the Court declared that when the president acts in matters of “external affairs,” especially with congressional authorization, the history of congressional delegations in this arena would have to be wholly disregarded to find a constitutional defect in the delegation involved in the statute before it. The Court’s language may, technically, have been dicta as the statute in Curtiss-Wright easily satisfied the conditional-legislation test upheld in Field v. Clark. It nevertheless has been, and remains, highly influential.

We write here to unpack this “historical gloss” argument in Curtiss-Wright. Justice Sutherland’s opinion catalogued a number of statutes that “either leave the exercise of the power to his unrestricted judgment or provide a standard far more general than that which has always been considered requisite with regard to domestic affairs.” Despite this assertion, these laws involved fairly narrow delegations, particularly when compared to IEEPA. The laws identified by Sutherland indeed exemplify defined limits on foreign affairs delegation—namely, limits on the duration of the delegations or the goods or locations that could be targeted. Consequently, the Supreme Court should not take the Curtiss-Wright case as upholding the kind of unbounded delegation authority claimed by Trump’s invocation of IEEPA.

Sutherland discussed nine statutes in the text of the Curtiss-Wright opinion, and another 24 statutes in a footnote, all of which we have separated into categories based on the kinds of limits they impose; Sutherland did not address the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA; IEEPA’s predecessor statute) even though a version of the TWEA was in operation at the time of the case. Consequently, we do not address the TWEA here. Instead, we note that the original version of the TWEA was limited to use during wars and consequently may not raise the same concerns as later amendments to the TWEA or those present in IEEPA.

Time-Limited Delegations

The early foreign affairs delegations concerned embargoes enacted by Congress. All of these delegations involved a durational limitation; Congress used a mixture of explicit and implicit time limitations when enacting these statutes. Congress enacted explicit limitations by adding a sunset clause requiring new legislation and enacted implicit limitations by linking the law to an underlying embargo statute that included a sunset clause. Additionally, many of the delegations in these time-limited laws permitted the president to suspend portions of the statutes under specified conditions.

Explicit Time Limitations

The Act of June 4, 1794 is the earliest example of an express time-limited delegation. Although the statute itself is short and sometimes characterized as a “delegation of remarkable power” because the statute authorized the president to “lay an embargo on all ships and vessels … under such regulations as the circumstances of the case may require, and to continue or revoke the same, whenever he shall think proper,” the powers delegated by the statute could “not be exercised, while the Congress of the United States [was] in session” and any embargo laid would “cease and determine in fifteen days from the actual meeting of Congress.” In practice, this meant the delegation operated for only a little over 5 months, since Congress started its second session on Nov. 3, 1794.

Similar time limitations were present in the Act of June 13, 1798, which created a “partial restriction” on trade with France rather than a “general embargo” in the lead-up to the Quasi-War (1798-1800) and authorized the president “to remit and discontinue the prohibitions and restraints” on commerce with France under certain conditions. This statute was scheduled to terminate at “the end of the next session of Congress,” which resulted in an approximately 10-month-long delegation. Likewise, the Act of Feb. 9, 1799—another partial embargo of France that granted the president authority to “remit and discontinue” the embargo provisions under certain conditions—was scheduled to expire on “the third day of March, in the year one thousand eight hundred” resulting in a delegation of approximately 13 months in duration. The Act of Feb. 27, 1800 enacted further restrictions on commerce with France with similar authority for the president to “remit and discontinue” the provisions. This statute was scheduled to expire on “the third day of March, one thousand eight hundred and one,” resulting in a delegation operative for approximately one year. The Act of Feb. 28, 1806 placed a partial embargo on “the island of St. Domingo,” with similar “remit and discontinue” provisions for the president, and was scheduled to last for only “one year, and no longer.” Of similar import, see the Act of Dec. 19, 1806 (a bit more than 5 months); the Act of April 22, 1808, which authorized the president to suspend the Embargo Act of 1807 “during the recess of Congress”; and the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809, which embargoed both Great Britain and France and authorized the president to suspend the embargo as to whichever country “shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States” (a little over a year).

Even though the Act of March 3, 1805 involved a narrower subject matter than countrywide embargoes, the statute still had a durational limit and was scheduled to last “for the term of two years, and from thence to the end of the next session of Congress, and no longer.” Another similarly narrow statute was the Act of March 3, 1817, which prohibited the importation, using “any foreign vessel” of “plaster of Paris … [from] any country, or its dependencies, from which the vessels of the United States are not permitted to bring the same article.” This measure authorized the president to suspend this prohibition as to any country that “shall discontinue such regulations” of its own. This statute was scheduled to “continue and be in force [for] five years.”

Implicit Time Limitations

Several statutes included implicit time limitations, though this was less common. These limits were implicit because the delegation was based on a separate statute that included a time limit. The Resolution of May 7, 1794 is one such statute. This resolution authorized the president to grant clearances “to any ship or vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, which are now loaded, bound from any port in the United States, for any port beyond the Cape of Good Hope.” Although the resolution itself did not have any time limitation, it provided an exception to the embargo imposed by the Resolution of March 26, 1794, thus containing an implicit time limit. That embargo was scheduled to expire on May 25, 1794. Consequently, the delegation afforded by the Resolution of May 7, 1794 was operative for only 18 days. Likewise, the Act of March 3, 1795, which authorized the president “to permit the exportation of arms, cannon and military stores, the law prohibiting the exportation of the same to the contrary notwithstanding,” lacked an explicit time limitation. The “law … to the contrary” mentioned by this statute, however, did contain an explicit time limitation and was scheduled to expire after “the term of one year.” That term ended on May 22, 1795, and consequently, the delegation afforded the president by the Act of March 3, 1795 was operative for a little less than 3 months.

Suspensions

Finally, the Act of May 1, 1810 authorized the president to suspend certain portions of the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 with either France or Great Britain should either of them “cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States.” This statute lacked an expiration clause; however, the president’s power to suspend portions of the Non-Intercourse Act of 1809 required France or Great Britain to cease violating the United States’s neutral commerce prior to “the third day of March next,” creating an implicit time limitation of approximately 10 months for this delegation.

Location-Limited Delegations

The second limitation category is limited or targeted locations. Several of the statutes discussed in the previous section had location limitations by virtue of being embargoes against specified locations. Besides embargo statutes, the delegations with limited locations fit within two subcategories: trade-reciprocity statutes and treaty-implementation measures.

The trade-reciprocity statutes follow one of two formats. The first format repealed specified tariff statutes with the caveat that the repeal becomes effective on a country-by-country basis only when foreign countries repeal similar tariffs on the United States. The second format authorized the president to exempt countries from certain tariffs (without repealing the tariff itself) should other countries repeal equivalent tariffs they have on the United States, or in some cases to raise tariffs to meet foreign tariff rates. The statutes that fit the first format are the Act of March 3, 1815, the Act of Jan. 27, 1824, the Act of May 24, 1828, and the Act of May 31, 1830. The statutes that fit the second format are the Act of July 13, 1832, the Act of June 26, 1884, the Act of June 19, 1886, the Act of July 24, 1897, and the Act of June 17, 1930. One minor exception to these formats is the Act of March 3, 1851. which followed the second format but dealt with international postage rates rather than tariffs.

The treaty-implementing statutes all follow the same general pattern. The statute authorized the president to determine when the partner(s) to the underlying treaty had enacted laws to implement the treaty on their end. After such a determination, the president was to issue a proclamation stating such a determination was made, at which point the treaty-implementing statute would automatically come into force.

The one variation on this pattern are treaty-framework statutes. These statutes lack an underlying treaty and instead contemplate a future treaty or treaties that will cover a certain issue or meet certain criteria. The statutes following the standard pattern are the Act of Aug. 5, 1854 (implementing the Elgin-Marcy Treaty), the Act of March 1, 1873 (implementing the Treaty of Washington), the Act of Aug. 15, 1876 (implementing the U.S.-Hawaii Reciprocity Treaty of 1875), the Act of Dec. 17, 1903 (implementing the Commercial Convention of 1902 [between the United States and Cuba]). The statutes following the treaty-framework pattern are the Act of June 11, 1864 (framework for treaties governing jurisdiction of maritime controversies) and the Act of Feb. 21, 1893 (framework for treaties protecting fur seals in the Pacific Ocean).

Toward the end of the 19th century, Congress returned to embargo-style delegations, but without the durational limits of the earlier period. Instead of time limitations, these statutes included more detailed conditions and restraints on the circumstances under which the delegated authority could be exercised. The Act of March 3, 1887 effectively granted a limited embargo power to the president to use against “the British dominions of North America,” providing three specific situations in which the president could exercise this power. Similarly, the Act of July 26, 1892 granted a limited embargo power to the president “to suspend … for such time and to such extent (including absolute prohibition) as he shall deem just, the right of free passage through the Saint Marys Falls Canal” whenever “the passage through any canal or lock connected with the navigation of the Saint Lawrence River, the Great Lakes, or the water ways connecting the same … is prohibited or is made difficult or burdensome by the imposition of tolls or otherwise.” The embargo would apply only to the Dominion of Canada, the country burdening the navigation of these bodies of water. The Act of Sept. 8, 1916 (besides implementing an income tax) provided several circumstances under which the president can effectively issue an embargo. The statute described the conditions in detail, including reciprocal trade prohibitions and whenever during a foreign war one of the belligerent countries subjected U.S. trade to “unreasonable prejudice, disadvantage, injury, or discrimination.”

One statute substantively does not fit well into any of the above subcategories but shares similarities with several of them. The Act of March 23, 1874 authorized the president “to suspend the operations” of the Act of June 22, 1860 (providing for judicial functions in certain countries where U.S. citizens resided or conducted business), whenever he “shall receive satisfactory information that the Ottoman government, or that of Egypt, has organized other tribunals on a basis likely to secure to citizens of the United States, in their dominions, the same impartial justice which they now enjoy there under the judicial functions exercised by the minister, consuls, and other functionaries of the United States.” Like other measures previously discussed, this law permitted the president to suspend the operation of an underlying statute if specific countries took specific actions. Although there is no underlying treaty, this statute was limited to specific countries and involved a narrow issue (judicial functions or tribunals).

Limited or Targeted Goods Delegations

The third and final limitations category is limited or targeted goods. Although some delegations in the previous categories included limitations as the goods impacted, this category did not come to the fore until the end of the 19th century. These statutes dealt exclusively with the exportation of war materials to countries actively or soon to be engaged in war. These statutes were the Resolution of April 22, 1898, the Resolution of March 14, 1912, and the Resolution of Jan. 31, 1922.

The earliest foreign affairs delegations uniformly contained a durational limit, either explicitly or implicitly, and dealt almost exclusively with embargoes. The mid and late 1800s saw a pattern of enacting delegations without a time limitation for the purposes of decreasing tariff and trade barriers on a bilateral basis with other countries. The president’s role in such schemes was to determine when foreign nations eliminated their barriers to U.S. commerce, at which point the U.S. barriers toward that country would also be eliminated by operation of statute. Congress gave further factfinding roles to the president regarding treaty implementation, with several statutes in the mid to late 1800s authorizing the president to determine when various treaty partners had put treaties into effect, at which point the treaty would automatically go into effect and be implemented in the U.S. by operation of statute. Toward the end of the 1800s, there was a return to more embargo-oriented statutes, but without explicit time limitations. The most broadly worded of these statutes was the Resolution of April 22, 1898, yet even this statute was limited to “coal or other material used in war.” Consequently, it is clear that even though the strictness of regulations on foreign affairs delegations may have waxed and waned between the early 1800s and the early 1900s, a limitation as to goods, location, or duration was always present in these foreign affairs delegations.

***

If the statutes discussed or cited in Curtiss-Wright are any guide, the view—embraced by many academics—that congressional delegations in the foreign affairs arena are essentially free of constitutional nondelegation strictures should be reexamined; the history of congressional delegations does not support this view. Moreover, with respect to the Trump tariff litigation now facing the Supreme Court, IEEPA emerges as far and away the outlier among such delegations and should be recognized as a violation of the Constitution’s nondelegation principles.",https://www.lawfaremedia.org/assets/icons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-10-30 14:05:07.337494

In their letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, the Senators raised concerns with the “near-total secrecy” under which IAO operates in light of a series of troubling immigration enforcement actions that this Administration has taken – pointing to examples and credible reports of violations of detainees’ rights and inhumane treatment while in ICE custody. They pressed Secretary Noem and acting Director Lyons for responses to a series of questions in the interest of providing much-needed transparency for Congress and the American public on these issues, including around the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

“We write to express our concerns regarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Air Operations’ (IAO) severe lack of transparency. IAO has been at the center of troubling actions ICE has taken under this administration but provides no public data on its operations,” the Senators began.

“IAO has been centrally involved in facilitating several concerning immigration enforcement actions under the second Trump Administration,” they wrote, pointing to the wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the relocation of university student Rumeysa Ozturk before a judge could rule on her case, and the attempted deportation of unaccompanied minors to Guatemala without due process. “These cases paint a troubling picture of IAO attempting to shortcut due process rights and avoid or defy judicial authority.

“IAO operates in near-total secrecy. ICE does not provide any publicly accessible data on its flights, destinations, costs to taxpayers, or passengers,” they continued. “The ICE Flight Monitor August 2025 report finds that flight volume is also trending upward, as the number of IAO flights has steadily increased throughout the year, with the months of May through August reaching higher figures than ever previously recorded.”

“Additionally, the conditions on board IAO flights have been described as ‘dehumanizing’ and even ‘dangerous,’” they added. “A recent lawsuit alleges that ICE put several detainees on a military cargo plane wearing straitjackets for 16 hours and did not tell them where they were going. […] Detainees have reportedly made hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and even sexual abuse by IAO personnel since 2010. In addition, numerous public accounts report medical emergencies and systemic limitations on access to critical care on board deportation flights. These reported conditions raise serious human rights concerns.”

“Given the complete opacity of IAO, the troubling actions the division has taken under this Administration, and the impending escalation of activities as ICE implements its newly-inflated budget and requests ever-more resources from Congress, ICE must provide greater transparency,” they concluded, going on to list a series of questions for response by Secretary Noem and acting Director Lyons regarding the costs of operations, treatment of deportees, fleet and operations, carriers and contracting, flight data and destinations, and voluntary returns.

Text of the letter, including the questions that the Senators pose to the Administration officials, can be viewed here and below.

Dear Secretary Noem and Acting Director Lyons,

We write to express our concerns regarding Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Air Operations’ (IAO) severe lack of transparency. IAO has been at the center of troubling actions ICE has taken under this administration but provides no public data on its operations. The only public data shared on its website is that “IAO stages a total of 12 aircraft at its operational locations in Arizona, Texas, Louisiana, and Florida” which has not been updated since August 8, 2023.

According to ICE’s website, IAO is the agency’s primary air transportation division, responsible for conducting the removal of noncitizens with final orders of removal to their countries of origin, as well as the transfer of detained noncitizens domestically to ICE-managed detention facilities. IAO also conducts “Special High Risk Charter flights” to deport noncitizens subject to final orders of removal to third countries. Notably, ICE does not own any planes—it uses contracted or chartered planes or purchases seats on commercial flights.

IAO has been centrally involved in facilitating several concerning immigration enforcement actions under the second Trump Administration. It transported Kilmar Abrego Garcia from Maryland to Louisiana to Texas, before illegally deporting him to El Salvador’s infamous CECOT prison over a period of just three days. The same day Kilmar was unlawfully deported, IAO took hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador without due process despite a judge’s order that the planes not take off, or if they had taken off, to return to the United States. IAO also swiftly flew students being targeted by ICE for exercising their free speech rights, such as Rumeysa Ozturk, out of their local court’s jurisdiction in what has appeared to be an attempt to remove them before their local judge can issue an order in their case. Additionally, ICE attempted to deport at least 76 unaccompanied minors to Guatemala in the middle of the night, requiring a judge to issue a temporary restraining order at approximately four a.m. preventing their deportation without due process. By the time the temporary restraining order was put in place, several of the children had already boarded planes. These cases paint a troubling picture of IAO attempting to shortcut due process rights and avoid or defy judicial authority.

IAO operates in near-total secrecy. ICE does not provide any publicly accessible data on its flights, destinations, costs to taxpayers, or passengers. Human Rights First’s ICE Flight Monitor project, which uses publicly available aviation data to monitor IAO’s flights, estimates that between January 20, 2025, and the end of August 2025, IAO has flown at least 7,454 total immigration enforcement flights to at least 66 different countries—a 34 percent increase over the same time period last year and the highest since tracking began in 2020. Public reporting notes that at least 180,000 people have been deported since January 20, 2025. The ICE Flight Monitor August 2025 report finds that flight volume is also trending upward, as the number of IAO flights has steadily increased throughout the year, with the months of May through August reaching higher figures than ever previously recorded.

In August 2025 alone, the ICE Flight Monitor tracked the highest monthly total of at least 1,393 U.S. immigration enforcement flights—averaging 45 flights a day. This tracks with reporting that earlier this year ICE modified its contract with CSI Aviation, its primary air charter company, to increase the number of flights and has been expanding its network of airline partners—including budget retail airline, Avelo, which appears to be the first retail airline to sign a long-term contract flying for ICE.

The Trump Administration has also been using U.S. military planes to carry out deportation flights, for which there is even less transparency, including logistical and financial coordination between ICE and the Department of Defense (DOD). Military flights can fly where no other planes can and provide less public information to protect operational security. The ICE Flight Monitor reports that the Trump Administration has used military planes to carry out at least 85 deportation flights since January 2025. They have primarily used C-17 and C-130 Air Force cargo planes, which are significantly more expensive than standard IAO charter flights, with the C-17 flights reportedly costing $28,500 an hour.

Additionally, the conditions on board IAO flights have been described as “dehumanizing” and even “dangerous.” According to the “ICE Air Operations Handbook,” dated February 2024, which was released as part of a Freedom of Information Act request, IAO requires that every detainee “be fully restrained by the use of… handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons” during their flight. Under “special circumstances,” IAO may restrain detainees with “spit masks, mittens, leg braces, cargo straps, the WRAP,” or other such restraint. The “WRAP” is a full-body restraint device used to completely immobilize a person, and its use by local law enforcement has reportedly contributed to at least a dozen deaths in the last decade. Multi-country flights have reportedly left some individuals shackled for as long as 50 hours.

A recent lawsuit alleges that ICE put several detainees on a military cargo plane wearing straitjackets for 16 hours and did not tell them where they were going. Once the detainees landed outside of the U.S. they reported that U.S. officials told local officials of the third-party country to send the detainees to their countries of origin, circumventing court orders against deportation to those countries. Additionally, recent filings in another lawsuit allege that ICE officials beat detainees in an effort to forcibly remove them from one of the planes that landed in El Salvador back in March. Detainees have reportedly made hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and even sexual abuse by IAO personnel since 2010. In addition, numerous public accounts report medical emergencies and systemic limitations on access to critical care on board deportation flights. These reported conditions raise serious human rights concerns.

The Trump Administration reportedly intends to significantly increase the volume of deportations with the $75 billion provided for ICE in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act over the next four years. DHS has also requested nearly $11 billion for ICE in discretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2026.

Given the complete opacity of IAO, the troubling actions the division has taken under this Administration, and the impending escalation of activities as ICE implements its newly-inflated budget and requests ever-more resources from Congress, ICE must provide greater transparency. We request the following documents and information by November 12, 2025:

Costs of Operations

How much taxpayer money has been spent on IAO flights since January 20, 2025? Please provide the total cost.

What has been the total cost of each of these three categories: domestic flights, removal flights, and military flights since January 20, 2025?

Does DHS reimburse DOD for all costs when military flights are used?

What has been the total cost incurred by DHS and DOD, respectively, since January 20, 2025?

Treatment of Deportees

Are all of the processes, procedures, and rules in the IAO Handbook applicable and followed for deportations on military planes, including, but not limited to, medical support, meals, restraints, and hygiene accommodations?

If not, what are the variances?

What procedures does ICE have in place to document, track, and publicly report any serious medical events or fatalities involving noncitizens that may occur during in-transit domestic or removal flights?

When there are violations of the guidelines in the IAO Handbook, how are they reported and adjudicated?

If so, what is the rationale for this change?

Are any extra accommodations made with respect to meals and restraints on the longer flights, which have been as long as 50-hour journeys? For example, is there a meal at least every 8 hours and are restraints removed at some times?

DHS’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties stated in its FY2023 annual report that “ICE does not have sufficient policies or operational guidance governing its use of the WRAP, contributing to concerns in the way it was used” and issued a recommendation that ICE develop “a policy governing use of the WRAP, documentation, and new expanded and specific training.”

Has ICE fulfilled this recommendation?

Please provide the policy governing the use of the WRAP, the training requirements, and the training documents for DHS employees and contractors who may use it.

Which ICE employees and contractors are trained to use the WRAP? Are all ICE employees and contractors who have used or can use the WRAP trained to do so?

Is ICE tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force?

Please provide records documenting ICE’s use of the WRAP.

Do you plan to increase the size of the IAO charter and reserve fleets, and if so, by how much?

Which domestic airports are being used by ICE for these flights? Please provide a list of the airports and the number of domestic and removal flights, respectively, to and from each.

How is it determined if a deportation mission will use traditional IAO planes or military planes?

Which agency makes that decision?

Are Military Police, or any other DoD service members, providing security or other services on ICE Air commercial charter flights?

Do you anticipate a higher or lower percentage of future deportations will be carried out on military planes with anticipated volume changes and funding availability?

How do you make the determination to use commercial flights?

What percentage of people deported by air are via commercial flights?

What percent of these returns include escorts and what percent are not escorted returns?

Are people in restraints on escorted flights?

Carriers and Contracting

Please provide any requests for proposal and resulting executed contracts with any brokers or carriers, including CSI Aviation.

Are you actively in contract discussions with CSI or other carriers, even if exploratory, about augmenting contract carriers and planes for daily and high-risk flights?

Flight Data and Destinations

Please provide a list of destination countries, number of deportees, nationalities of deportees, and whether the flight was on a military plane or other IAO-chartered plane by domestic or removal flight since January 20, 2025.

For removal flights, please also list whether the flight was removing the deportees to their countries of origin or to a third country.

If the flight was to a third country, please list the percentage of the deportees who were considered security risks or other rationale for their being removed to a third country.

If the flight was to a third country, please clarify if that country was directed or authorized to deport the individuals to their countries of origin.

Voluntary Returns

If an individual in ICE custody agrees to voluntary removal, must the individual then await scheduling for a return flight arranged by ICE?

Are individuals in ICE custody, who have previously agreed to voluntary departure, permitted to arrange and pay for their own travel out of the U.S.?

ICE reportedly has a $950 million contract with Salus Worldwide to effectuate voluntary returns.

What services will they provide?

Please detail the bidding process for this contract, including any deviations from prior bidding processes for flight contracts.

TOP TALKER

ILLINOIS WAS SWEPT UP Wednesday by a wave of dramatic legal and political developments over immigration enforcement: Political figures were indicted for protests, “Midway Blitz” leader Gregory Bovino won a reprieve from daily court check-ins, and Springfield lawmakers may expand constitutional protections for residents.

About the indictment: Kat Abughazaleh, a progressive Democrat running for Congress, was among six demonstrators who were charged with surrounding a government vehicle, banging on its hood and windows and scratching the surface — including etching the word “PIG.” More here on POLITICO’s homepage

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent,” Abughazaleh said in a statement, adding, “I’m going to fight these unjust charges.”

Others indicted include Catherine Sharp, chief of staff to Chicago Ald. Andre Vasquez and a candidate for the Cook County Board; Chicago Democratic Ward Committeeman Michael Rabbitt; and Oak Park Village Board Trustee Brian Straw.

The Justice Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Some background: Abughazaleh is a regular protester at the Broadview site and has used videos of the encounters to promote her campaign for Congress in the 9th Congressional District.

Other candidates in the IL-09 race condemned the Justice Department’s action. “The Trump administration is targeting protestors, including political candidates, in an effort to silence dissent and scare residents into submission. It won’t work,” said Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss. State Sen. Laura Fine said “Today, it’s Kat. Tomorrow, it could be any one of us.” Democratic Committeeman Bruce Leon called it a “blatant abuse of power.” State Sen. Mike Simmons called it “a blatant attempt to suppress free speech.” And former prosecutor and candidate Nick Pyati called the charges “weaponized and manufactured.”

And Congresswoman Delia Ramirez issued a statement, saying: “If it sounds like authoritarianism, moves like authoritarianism and looks like authoritarianism, IT IS AUTHORITARIANISM.”

In a separate legal development, a federal appeals court ruled that Bovino — who is leading the immigration-enforcement effort in Illinois — does not have to report daily to U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis. Earlier this week, the judge had ordered the 6 p.m. briefings amid concerns that Bovino’s team had used tear gas and pepper balls inappropriately.

The Justice Department asked the appellate court for a “writ of mandamus,” which tells a lower court judge to stop doing something that’s seen as out of bounds. In this case, the government says Bovino showing up at the same place every day puts him in danger.

Though daily meetings were blocked, Bovino still must sit for a private deposition today, according to The Associated Press.

And amid mounting concern over federal enforcement tactics, the Illinois Senate Democratic Caucus led by Senate President Don Harmon introduced legislation that would allow Illinois residents to bring civil actions against any person who deprives them of their constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution under the Illinois Constitution. The measure calls for allowing courts to award punitive damages based on the severity of the defendant’s conduct, according to a statement.

THE BUZZ

FIRST IN PLAYBOOK: Technology entrepreneur Junaid Ahmed has been endorsed by businessman Christ Kallas, who was also running for the seat but has since suspended his campaign.

The move narrows the Democratic primary candidates in the competitive race for the seat now held by Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi, who’s running for Senate.

“I’m proud to endorse Junaid Ahmed for Congress and know he will be the progressive leader working families deserve in Washington,” Kallas said in a statement.

How they line up: Ahmed, who ran against Krishnamoorthi in 2024 and is positioning himself as the progressive alternative to other candidates — mainly former Congresswoman Melissa Bean, who served from 2005 to 2011 as a “Blue Dog” Democrat.

Meanwhile, Yasmeen Bankole, a Hanover Park trustee, is also securing progressive credentials. She’s been endorsed by former Congressman Bobby Rush.

And Cook County Commissioner Kevin Morrison, has the support of the National Restaurant Association. “As the son of a local restaurant owner, Kevin Morrison knows firsthand the struggles mom-and-pop operators in Illinois face, and he is committed to fighting for them every day,” Illinois Restaurant Association President Sam Toia said in a statement and referring to the Morrison family’s Dino’s Pizza & Italian Restaurant in Chicago.

The other Democratic players in the race include Army veteran and attorney Dan Tully, entrepreneur and CEO Neil Khot, Hanover Park community leader Joseph Wentzel and entrepreneur Sanjyot Dunung, who served on the National Small Business Association.

TAKING NAMES

— OH, CANADA: Former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau headlined the Chicago Council on Global Affairs leadership awards program Wednesday night and brought the house down as soon as he took the stage.

“I’m really touched that you would honor a Canadian,” he said, noting, with his tongue in cheek, the “terrible conflict” between Canada and the United States. The line drew a burst of laughter from the friendly crowd that included former U.S. Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman and his wife, Vicki Heyman.

Then Trudeau got serious, talking about the “moment of challenge” between the two countries.

About the tariffs: Trudeau, who was honored at the event, said the tariff dispute between the U.S. and Canada “feels personal because it makes absolutely no economic sense at a time of tremendous pressures — geopolitically — that the American administration would choose to turn its back on the ally and friend that’s been there for you for decades, generations and centuries, fighting side by side with you … because we believe in the same values.”

Reflecting on past cooperation, Trudeau reminded the audience that “it’s not irretrievable, but it is real. And I would ask you to be patient and understanding towards Canadians and to remember what we were able to do in my first term and President Trump’s first term, when there was a very, very real threat of ripping up the North American Free Trade Agreement, the most successful free trade agreement ever signed anywhere in the world.”

Also honored at the Four Seasons Hotel event were Invenergy CEO Michael Polsky and his wife, Polsky Foundation President Tanya Polsky, and businesswoman Regina Cross.

In the room: Former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, Cook County Commissioner Bridget Gainer, Cook County Assessor Fritz Kaegi, World Business Chicago CEO Philip Clement, former Ambassador Fay Hartog-Levin, United Airlines President Brett Hart, business leader Raj Fernando, Goldman Sachs’ Ron Levin, University of Chicago Business School’s Mark Tebbe, The Chicago Community Trust CEO Andrea Sáenz, Big Shoulders Fund CEO Josh Hale, Openlands CEO Michael Davidson and St. James Church Pastor Chris Harris.

— SNAP ORDER: With the federal government halting SNAP benefits for more than 1.9 million Illinoisans starting Saturday, Gov. JB Pritzker plans to sign an executive order launching a statewide response to protect food access and invest $20 million in food banks across Illinois — with $10 million coming from the Budget Reserve for Immediate Disbursements and Governmental Emergencies Fund and $10 million from the Illinois Department of Human Services.

The funding will help stock shelves at more than 2,600 pantries while state agencies, grocers, and community groups coordinate efforts to keep families fed. “No one should go hungry because of politics,” Pritzker said in a statement. Residents who want to help can support local food banks by donating at Feeding Illinois.

Reader Digest

We asked whether the shape of a congressional district matters.

Denise Barreto: “Absolutely yes, shape matters. It’s all imaginary lines and when we overstretch or shorten to meet an agenda, no one wins.”

Mimi Cowan: “If the shape is a result of gerrymandering and people can tell, that undermines the public’s belief in fair elections.”

Peter Creticos: “Having drawn many fluky districts, including congressional ones, in my early days: Good is achieved when the shape enables communities of people to exercise their voting franchise effectively.”

Brent Pruim: “District shape can matter when it distorts overall representation, but not every oddly shaped district is unfair. Impact depends on context, not just appearance.”

Alex Sutton: “If it looks like earmuffs, a rabbit on a skateboard or Goofy kicking Donald Duck, then I don’t want it.”

Van Hollen was joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and six others.
The Wrap is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture.
“When an organization like DHS doesn’t want transparency, it’s because they don’t want people to know what they’re doing,” Van Hollen said, referring to the US Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency.
“ICE’s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.","A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns”, a group of 11 Democratic US senators wrote in a letter on Thursday to top immigration officials.

Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the Wrap until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

“I think it’s very problematic,” Van Hollen told the Associated Press. “They want to keep the public in the dark.”

The senators’ letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people – sometimes for hours – on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and six others.

The Wrap is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the Wrap’s use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.

“When an organization like DHS doesn’t want transparency, it’s because they don’t want people to know what they’re doing,” Van Hollen said, referring to the US Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency.

In addition to the letter, Representative Delia Ramirez told AP in a statement that she was working on a bill to rein in the agency’s use of the Wrap.

“ICE’s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.

The DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the Wrap. The DHS spokesperson, Tricia McLaughlin, previously said that ICE’s practices “align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards”.

The AP found that the DHS has paid the manufacturer of the Wrap, Safe Restraints Inc, $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.

ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the Wrap despite multiple requests, and it is not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

In addition to reporting on ICE’s use of the device, the AP identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the US used the Wrap and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

“The brutal, inhumane tactics of ICE continue to jeopardize people’s lives across the country,” Ramirez said. “ICE is acting outside of oversight or accountability. That can’t go on.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6632283b0e3a64c22813f18a9f3035399d084e80/234_0_2338_1870/master/2338.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0f1f92d5ec199c8f713f908af54d6839",N,,2025-10-30 10:17:07.778172

Oct. 30, 2025, WASHINGTON, D.C. —Today, the American Immigration Council launched a platform analyzing new records about the U.S. government’s chaotic implementation of family separations during the zero-tolerance period and its aftermath.

The transparency project details how the first Trump administration carried out one of the most shameful immigration policies in modern history. The project also sheds light on how certain stakeholders responded to the crisis, providing important lessons on how the public resisted one of the most egregious and harmful policies of the first Trump administration.

Explore the data here.

Drawing on thousands of internal government emails, memos, and never-before-seen datasets obtained through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests and litigation, the project shows how the first Trump administration’s “zero tolerance” policy was a calculated system designed to deter migrants from coming to the United States by punishing families and obscuring accountability.

“Thanks to these records, we can more clearly see the inner workings of how this atrocity was carried out and the public’s struggle to obtain transparency and accountability,” said Raul Pinto, deputy legal director for transparency at the American Immigration Council. “The same disregard for oversight and human consequences that made family separation possible is now re-emerging in the ongoing mass detention and deportation efforts.”

The family separation project features interactive visualizations and declassified documents that reveal how families were literally erased from government databases, how officials misled the public, and how congressional oversight and media exposure helped end the policy. The project includes audio recordings of actor Corey Stoll reading key internal government emails that reveal the confusion and callousness behind the policy’s implementation. (Listen here).

Key findings from the archive include:

Officials knew their data on separated families was “corrupt.” Internal emails show ICE leaders admitting they had “not very much” confidence in their own data on children taken from their parents, even as they publicly denied wrongdoing.

Oversight from Congress, the press, and regulatory agencies played a key role in ending family separation. However, since then, as of 2025 key oversight bodies like the DHS Inspector General and the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties have been sidelined or defunded.

Family separation was built around intentional chaos. The records show how confusion was weaponized: ensuring significant delays in reunifying children with their parents.

“The records don’t just show government officials’ egregiousness and cruelty. They serve as a warning for our current moment of mass detention and deportation that is still seeing families separated,” said Pinto. “These records show how data manipulation and secrecy enabled systemic human rights violations during the first Trump administration. Without transparency and oversight, history will repeat itself.”

Set to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organizations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.
“Illegal activity by its very nature runs contrary to the public good,” the Education Department wrote in a fact sheet.
In completing the rule, the department dismissed concerns from many who said the standard of evidence is too low.
The American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law.","WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is forging ahead with plans to eject some nonprofits from a popular student loan forgiveness program if their work is deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose” — a move that could cut off some teachers, doctors and other public workers from federal loan cancellation.

New rules finalized Thursday give the Education Department expanded power to ban organizations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Trump administration calls it necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the program into a tool of political retribution.

Set to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organizations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.

It grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or “chemical castration” of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organizations. “Chemical castration” is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty — gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.

It amounts to a major reworking of a program that has canceled loans for more than 1 million Americans and was created by Congress in 2007 to steer more college graduates into lower-paying public sector jobs. The Trump administration has yet to identify specific groups it intends to target, but it estimates fewer than 10 would be barred per year.

“Illegal activity by its very nature runs contrary to the public good,” the Education Department wrote in a fact sheet. “Congress focuses on public service, and the Trump Administration will not direct taxpayer dollars from hardworking Americans to organizations that are breaking the law.”

The program promises to cancel federal student loans for government employees and many nonprofit workers after they have made 10 years of payments. It has long been open to government workers, teachers, firefighters and employees of public hospitals. Eligibility rules laid out by Congress focus mostly on nonprofits’ tax status and their field of work.

The benefit has gone to workers at organizations across the political spectrum. Yet in a March action demanding new limits, President Donald Trump said it has “misdirected tax dollars into activist organizations that not only fail to serve the public interest, but actually harm our national security and American values, sometimes through criminal means.”

A central concern of critics is the wide latitude the department is giving itself to determine if an organization's work should be considered to have a “substantial illegal purpose.”

Employers across state and local government as well as nonprofits can be expelled from the program if a state or federal court rules against them or if they agree to a legal settlement that includes admission of guilt. It appears that performing gender-affirming care in the 27 states that outlaw it, for example, could be grounds for expulsion.

Even without a legal finding, the education secretary will be able to independently determine that an organization should be barred. The secretary would weigh whether the “preponderance of the evidence” leans against the employer.

In completing the rule, the department dismissed concerns from many who said the standard of evidence is too low.

“It ensures decisions are grounded in fact, not speculation, and allows the Department to act promptly to protect both borrowers and taxpayers,” federal officials wrote.

Among those opposing the proposal were prominent associations in higher education, health care and legal professions. In public comments submitted to the department, many called it an illegal overstep and said it would undermine an incentive that has helped address work shortages in high-demand fields.

The American Bar Association said it could decrease the ranks of public defenders and those in public interest law. Thousands of people will lose access to representation, the association said, “simply because those attorneys’ jobs were deemed politically unfavorable by the Secretary.”

The National Council of Nonprofits said the policy would allow future administrations from any political party to change eligibility rules “based on their own priorities or ideology.”

Rep. Tim Walberg, R-Mich., chair of the House Education and Workforce Committee, said the overhaul will prevent taxpayers from covering loan relief for employees at “radical organizations that violate state and federal laws.” “Aiding illegal immigration, supporting terrorism, or promoting child abuse through gender transitions is not ‘public service,'” Walberg said in a statement.

According to the new rules, employers can only be sanctioned for activities that take place on or after July 1, 2026. They would be notified and given a chance to review the evidence and respond to the department's findings. Those barred from the program can reapply for eligibility after 10 years or rejoin sooner if they follow a “corrective action plan” approved by the secretary.

Documents from the department indicate that a single violation of the law may or may not be enough to get an employer barred, depending on the circumstances. Not all organizations that break the law have a “substantial illegal purpose,” the agency said, and it ultimately comes down to the secretary's analysis of the evidence.

National Guard in Chicago The Trump administration seems to have somewhat pulled back on deploying additional National Guard troops to Chicago, Illinois, at least for now.","A group of U.S. Senate Democrats have sent a letter to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) seeking a cost analysis of the Trump administration’s deployment of National Guard troops to multiple cities nationwide.

President Donald Trump’s orders to send federal personnel into Democrat-run cities and districts including Los Angeles, Chicago, Portland, Memphis and Washington D.C. have drawn pushback from critics who have referred to it as fear mongering and politically motivated. Trump suggested Tuesday while in Japan that he may go a step further to ensure “safe cities” remain, according to reports.

The back-and-forth has resulted in legal battles still playing out in courts, with a three-judge appellate panel ruling last week in a 2-1 decision to stay a temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut to bar ""the federalization and deployment of Oregon National Guard service members.""

On Monday, Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee, led colleagues in their CBO request to analyze the costs of activating, deploying and compensating National Guard personnel, as well as the cost to sustain and maintain these deployments.

The letter, addressed to CBO Director Phillip Swagel, cites “serious fiscal, legal and constitutional concerns"" that warrant ""close congressional scrutiny.”

“Deploying federalized National Guard units for domestic security operations marks a significant departure from long-standing practice,” the letter reads. “It also carries substantial cost implications that have not been publicly disclosed or formally justified to Congress.

“The American people deserve full transparency regarding how their tax dollars are being used, especially as it pertains to the deployment of military personnel for missions on U.S. soil without a declared emergency or state request.”

The letter was signed by Merkley and Democratic Sens. Angela Alsobrooks (MD), Richard Blumenthal (CT), Cory Booker (NJ), Tammy Duckworth (IL), Dick Durbin (IL), Andy Kim (NJ), Alex Padilla (CA), Chris Van Hollen (MD), Elizabeth Warren (MA) and Ron Wyden (OR).

A CBO spokesperson said in an automated message that due to the ongoing government shutdown, CBO has been instructed by House and Senate Budget Committees to provide support to address the immediate needs of Congress.

""The agency will continue to publish cost estimates and other publications the Congress requires on its public website,"" they added.

“President Trump wants every city across the country to be safe, which is why he has generously offered additional resources—the National Guard—to state and local officials,"" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Military.com. ""Americans are thankful for the National Guard’s dedication and service to protecting our cities and the federal officers who are located there, as they are doing in our nation’s capital.”

'Cities Are Troubled'

On Tuesday in Japan, as part of his trip to Asia to meet with world leaders, Trump maintained a strong affinity towards deploying additional National Guard troops to other U.S. cities should his administration find it necessary.

“We have cities that are troubled, we can’t have cities that are troubled,” Trump said aboard an aircraft carrier, speaking to troops on the USS George Washington at the Yokosuka Naval Base. “And we’re sending in our National Guard, and if we need more than the National Guard, we’ll send more than the National Guard, because we’re going to have safe cities.”

Trump has exerted his assumed authority to deploy said troops in response to what he and administration officials have claimed are a response for protection for federal agents working for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The president, in an Aug. 11 memorandum explaining the motives for mobilizing the Washington D.C. National Guard, called the area “under siege from violent crime,” adding that “[i]t is a point of national disgrace that Washington, D.C., has a violent crime rate that is higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world.”

Although District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser has criticized the administration for its deployment, a Joint Task Force (JTF) D.C. spokesperson told Military.com earlier this month that National Guard troops will stay in the district and remain “resolute” in its mission.

National Guard in Chicago

The Trump administration seems to have somewhat pulled back on deploying additional National Guard troops to Chicago, Illinois, at least for now.

That’s according to Alderman Andre Vasquez, who represents Chicago’s 40th ward, who told Military.com that he’s more so seen federal agents (ICE) “masked up” in residential communities.

“I think it’s still a bunch of guys with masks kidnapping people off the street,” Vasquez said. “What’s concerning is, you got tear gas being thrown on residential streets. So, at what point does the escalation lead to them justifying larger military action? That’s something we’re all concerned about.

“We’re all doing our best to make sure we’re training people to do things constitutionally, safely, to record information and work through the court systems to make sure we’re holding this government accountable.”

Democrats' portrayal of ICE has been disputed by Republicans and the Trump administration.

“Our officers are facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them as they put their lives on the line to arrest murderers, rapists, abusers and gang members. [DHS] Secretary [Kristi] Noem’s message to the rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE and our federal law enforcement partners will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin previously told Military.com about troops and civilians at odds in Chicago this past weekend.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR – CEASEFIRE

The Israeli military said yesterday that it conducted a “targeted strike” in the area of Beit Lahia in northern Gaza, adding that it was targeting a site where weapons were stored. The strikes killed at least two people, according to al-Shifa Hospital. Ahmed Elimam reports for Reuters; Stephen Quillen reports for Al Jazeera.

Israel released a 15-minute drone video on Tuesday, allegedly showing Hamas members staging the discovery of a deceased Israeli hostage on Monday. The New York Times confirmed that the video was filmed in the Tuffah neighbourhood of Gaza City, and satellite imagery confirmed that dirt was moved from that area between Monday and Tuesday. It is unclear why the bag with the body inside was reburied and unearthed as shown in the video, or how that was explained to Red Cross representatives. Aric Toler, Arijeta Lajka, Monika Cvorak, and Liam Stack report for the New York Times.

WEST BANK VIOLENCE

Israel has erected nearly 1,000 barriers in cities and towns across the occupied West Bank since the beginning of the war in Gaza, according to an official Palestinian governmental body. The barriers include metal gates stationed at village and town entrances, which block access in and out, with the Israeli military sometimes stationed at them. The U.N. documented the installation of 18 gates in the West Bank at the beginning of September. Israel says the gates are to “manage and monitor.” Sam Mednick and Jalal Bwaitel report for AP News.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed yesterday that Russian troops have surrounded Ukrainian forces in Pokrovsk and Kupiansk. Putin offered to negotiate a deal for their surrender, adding that Russia was ready to open safe corridors for Western journalists to “let them see with their own eyes what’s going on.” Ukrainian armed forces said that Moscow’s claims about Kupiansk are “fabrications and fantasies, while the situation in Pokrovsk is “hard but under control,” a spokesperson for Ukraine’s eastern forces told AP News. Independent verification of the claims was not possible. Illia Novikov reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Israeli troops overnight killed a municipal employee who was sleeping in the town hall in Blida, southern Lebanon, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency. The Israeli military confirmed the incident, saying that “during the procedures, an immediate threat against the troops was identified, and they fired to remove it.” Lebanese President Joseph Aoun instructed the army commander to confront any Israeli incursion into southern Lebanon. Prime Minister Nawaf Salam called the incursion “a blatant attack on the institutions and sovereignty of the Lebanese state.” Maya Gebeily reports for Reuters.

Putin said yesterday that Russia had successfully tested Poseidon, a nuclear-powered super torpedo. The Poseidon is a new weapon that breaks most of the traditional nuclear deterrence and classification rules, according to arms control experts. There are few confirmed details about the new weapon. Guy Falconbridge and Maxim Rodionov report for Reuters.

The Ta’ang National Liberation Army, a major ethnic rebel group in Myanmar, announced yesterday that it signed a ceasefire deal with Myanmar’s military following two days of China-mediated talks earlier this week. The military government did not immediately comment on the ceasefire. AP News reports.

The World Health Organization said yesterday that more than 450 patients and companions were massacred on Tuesday in the last operating hospital in El Fasher, Sudan. WHO did not confirm who was responsible for the killings. Gen. Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary, announced an investigation into violations committed by his soldiers during the capture of El Fasher. Declan Walsh reports for the New York Times; Barbara Plett Usher reports for BBC News.

Between December 2024 and July 2025, over 430,000 people in Syria were newly displaced, according to the United Nations. The biggest displacements were in the southern province of Sweida, where sectarian violence broke out in the summer. Decades-old property disputes and the Israeli occupation of land in southern Syria have also led to the displacement of people. Raja Abdulrahim and Reham Mourshed report for the New York Times.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Israel demanded that Google and Amazon include a “winking mechanism” in their 2021 Project Nimbus contracts, which would alert the Israeli government, through a coded payment system, when Israeli data had been disclosed to foreign courts or investigators, according to leaked documents seen by the Guardian, as part of a joint investigation with Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call. Google and Amazon have both denied evading any legal obligations. Harry Davies and Yuval Abraham report for The Guardian.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Immigration authorities did not receive notice of a court order blocking the removal of Chanthila Souvannarath until after he had been deported to Laos, the Homeland Security Department said yesterday. The American Civil Liberties Union asked the federal judge to order Souvannarath’s immediate return to the United States, calling his deportation “unlawful.” Jim Mustian and Jack Brook report for AP News.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) yesterday said the state’s colleges and universities should “pull the plug” on the use of H-1B visas, adding that the jobs should go to U.S. citizens. Further details for the plan remain unclear. Vimal Patel and Alan Blinder report for the New York Times.

ICE allegedly furloughed most of its congressional relations team during the government shutdown, according to a letter sent to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons from 15 House Democrats. “ICE continues to conduct raids, make arrests, deny bonds, and execute removal orders, but the staff who would answer inquiries from congressional offices […] are furloughed, the letter says. Eric Bazil-Eimil reports for POLITICO.

U.S. CARIBBEAN AND PACIFIC OPERATIONS

The U.S. military yesterday killed another four people in a strike against a boat allegedly operated by a “designated terrorist organization” in the eastern Pacific Ocean, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said yesterday. Helene Cooper and Robert Jimison report for the New York Times.

The House Armed Services Committee will be briefed this morning by Pentagon officials and Joint Chiefs of Staff on “counternarcotics operations in the Caribbean and Pacific,” Axios learned. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), who confirmed that the meeting today was going ahead, said yesterday that so far “zero evidence has been presented [to him] to justify the strikes that have taken place.” Andrew Solender and Kate Santaliz report.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

President Donald Trump said yesterday that the United States will share technology with South Korea to build a nuclear-powered submarine. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told Trump in their meeting that South Korea’s current diesel-powered submarines have limits in tracking other countries’ submarine activities and that they have to resurface regularly to recharge. Chris Megerian and Josh Boak report for AP News.

700 U.S. troops, deployed in Romania, Germany, and Poland, will be withdrawn from Eastern Europe, U.S. and Romanian officials said yesterday. The U.S. Army command in Europe said that the 2nd Brigade Team will not be replaced after its scheduled rotation out of Eastern Europe, adding, “this is not an American withdrawal from Europe […] Rather this is a positive sign of increased European capability and responsibility.” Lynsey Chutel reports for the New York Times.

The U.S. government, across five Republican and Democratic administrations, has repeatedly allowed U.S. firms to sell technology to Chinese police, government agencies, and surveillance companies, an AP News investigation has found. Lawmakers have repeatedly failed to close loopholes that allow China to circumvent export bans by using cloud services, third-party resellers, and holes in sanctions. Despite U.S. export rules around advanced AI chips, China bought $20.7 billion worth of chipmaking equipment from U.S. companies in 2024, according to a congressional committee report. Garance Burke, Dake Kang, and Byron Tau report for AP News.

“It was an amazing meeting,” Trump said today following his meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, “12 out of 10.” Trump said that he had agreed to reduce tariffs on China from 57% to 47% in exchange for Beijing taking action on illicit fentanyl trade and resuming U.S. soybean purchases. China also agreed to pause export controls on rare earths for a year, according to a statement from China’s commerce ministry. Trevor Hunnicutt reports for Reuters.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

Around 160 Republicans were reportedly investigated in the FBI’s Arctic Frost probe into Trump’s alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election, newly released documents show.

A federal grand jury in Chicago indicted six people, including Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, on charges unsealed yesterday of interfering with a federal agent during a protest. Mitch Smith reports for the New York Times.

Two federal prosecutors have been put on administrative leave after referring to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack as being committed by “thousands of people comprising mob rioters,” according to two sources. The description is found in a sentencing recommendation for Taylor Taranto, who was pardoned by Trump for his role in the riot but is awaiting sentencing this Friday for unrelated threats and firearms crimes. Yesterday evening, a revised memo was filed by a new set of prosecutors that had removed all references to the attack on the Capitol. Kyle Cheney reports for POLITICO.

FEDERALIZATION OF POLICING

The National Guard plans to train hundreds of troops in each state to be part of a rapid-response force focused on civil disturbance, two U.S. officials said yesterday. The sources said that states would be required to have a rapid-response force by the start of next year, with most states required to have 500 troops in the force. It is unclear how the force would be different from existing quick-reaction forces. Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart report for Reuters.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump today ordered the U.S. military to resume nuclear weapons testing. “Because of other countries’ testing programs, I have instructed the Department of War to start testing our nuclear weapons on an equal basis,” Trump said on social media. Trevor Hunnicutt, Ismail Shakil, and Kanishka Singh report for Reuters.

Hegseth is expected to announce significant changes that could reshape how the Pentagon sends weapons to allies on November 7 at a meeting of defense industry executives, according to seven sources. The plan aims to accelerate weapons production and government-led arms purchases. Joe Gould and Paul McLeary report for POLITICO.

Three-star general Lt. Gen. Joe McGee, the director for Strategy, Plans, and Policy on the Joint Staff, was pushed out of his role earlier this month following tensions with Hegseth, according to sources. The sources said that McGee frequently “pushed back” against Hegseth on issues such as Russia-Ukraine to operations in the Caribbean. “He has had a target on his back for a while now, “ one source said. A Pentagon spokesperson said, “General McGee is retiring, and the War Department is grateful for his service.” Natasha Bertrand, Zachary Cohen, and Haley Britzky report for CNN.

“I think it’s very problematic,” Van Hollen told The Associated Press.
Van Hollen was joined by U.S. Sens.
The WRAP is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture.
“ICE’s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.","WASHINGTON -- A “near-total secrecy” surrounding deportation flights and the use of full-body restraints onboard is raising “serious human rights concerns,” a group of 11 Democratic U.S. senators wrote in a letter Thursday to top immigration officials.

U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland called upon U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to provide a full accounting of its air operations and to stop using the black and yellow restraints known as the WRAP until the agency explains its policies for the device and resolves other questions about its use on immigration detainees.

“I think it’s very problematic,” Van Hollen told The Associated Press. “They want to keep the public in the dark.”

The senators' letter cites an AP investigation this month that revealed several examples of ICE using the device on people — sometimes for hours — on deportation flights dating to 2020. Van Hollen was joined by U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Alex Padilla of California, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, and six others.

The WRAP is the subject of several federal lawsuits likening incorrect usage of the device to punishment and even torture. Advocates have expressed concern that ICE is not tracking the WRAP’s use as required by federal law when officers use force, making it difficult to discern exactly how many people are being subjected to the restraints.

“When an organization like DHS doesn’t want transparency, it’s because they don’t want people to know what they’re doing,” Van Hollen said, referring to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ICE's parent agency.

In addition to the letter, U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill., told AP in a statement that she is working on a bill to rein in the agency's use of the WRAP.

“ICE’s use of full-body restraints to immobilize detained individuals raises serious concerns about the safety, dignity, and human rights of those under their jurisdiction,” Ramirez said.

DHS has not answered detailed questions from the AP about the use of the WRAP. DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin previously said that ICE's practices “align with those followed by other relevant authorities and is fully in line with established legal standards.”

The AP found that DHS has paid the manufacturer of the WRAP, Safe Restraints Inc., $268,523 since it started purchasing the devices in late 2015, during the Obama administration. Government purchasing records show the two Trump administrations have been responsible for about 91% of that spending.

ICE would not provide AP with records documenting its use of the WRAP despite multiple requests, and it’s not clear how frequently it has been used in the current and prior administrations.

In addition to reporting on ICE's use of the device, the AP identified a dozen fatal cases in the last decade where local police or jailers around the U.S. used the WRAP and autopsies determined “restraint” played a role in the death.

“The brutal, inhumane tactics of ICE continue to jeopardize people’s lives across the country,” Ramirez said. “ICE is acting outside of oversight or accountability. That can’t go on.”

The suburban Chicago facility has been a flashpoint since U.S. President Donald Trump launched a stepped-up immigration enforcement operation in the area on September 8. Agents have responded to protests on multiple occasions by deploying tear gas and shooting pepper balls at demonstrators.

In the indictment, prosecutors allege that on September 26, Kat Abughazaleh – a former journalist who is running for a U.S. House seat as a Democrat – and five other activists protesting at the Broadview site crowded around a government vehicle driven by a federal agent, intentionally hindering its progress as the agent tried to drive into the facility.

According to prosecutors, the activists – Abughazaleh and Andre Martin, Michael Rabbitt, Catherine Sharp, Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh – banged and pushed on the vehicle, scratched the word “pig” into its body, and broke a rear windshield wiper.

Attorneys Deny Accusations

Several attorneys for the protesters denied the accusations on Wednesday.

Molly Armour, an attorney for Sharp, who is the chief of staff for Chicago alderperson Andre Vasquez, said the charges against Sharp are an “effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Attorneys for Rabbitt and Walsh said their clients would plead not guilty to the charges. Abughazaleh told Reuters she would also plead not guilty.

Straw, a member of the Village Board for Chicago suburb Oak Park, said in a statement the charges would not “deter me from fulfilling my oath of office.”

The September 26 protest came weeks after the Trump administration announced the start of “Operation Midway Blitz,” an immigration enforcement campaign it said was needed because of city and state “sanctuary” laws that limit local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

Law enforcement officers have been using the Broadview facility to process detainees, and protests at the site intensified after the Trump administration’s announcement.

Federal agents have shot pepper balls and deployed tear gas at protesters, leading to a lawsuit by journalists, activists and clergy members. U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis earlier this month ordered agents involved in the Chicago crackdown to wear visible identification and limit their use of anti-riot weapons such as pepper balls and tear gas.

Chicago U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros said in a statement that federal officials “must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation, or threats.”

The case will appear before U.S. District Judge April Perry, who earlier this month blocked Trump from deploying hundreds of National Guard troops in Chicago.

Previous federal restrictions on immigration enforcement in or near sensitive areas, including health care establishments, were rescinded by the Trump administration in January.
The department did not respond to a request for comment on the state's new rules for health care facilities, which went into immediate effect.
Tanya Broder, a senior counsel with the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration arrests at health care facilities appear to be relatively rare.
Many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have been in California, largely involving detained patients brought in for care.","In recent months, federal agents have camped out in the lobby of a Southern California hospital, guarded detained patients — sometimes shackled — in hospital rooms, and chased an immigrant landscaper into a surgical center.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have also shown up at community clinics. Health providers say that officers have tried to enter a parking lot hosting a mobile clinic, waved a machine gun in the faces of clinicians serving the homeless, and hauled a passerby into an unmarked car outside a community health center.

In response to such immigration enforcement activity in and around clinics and hospitals, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom last month signed SB 81, which prohibits medical establishments from allowing federal agents without a valid search warrant or court order into private areas, including places where patients receive treatment or discuss health matters.

But while the bill received broad support from medical groups, health care workers, and immigrant rights advocates, legal experts say California can't stop federal authorities from carrying out duties in public places, which include hospital lobbies and general waiting areas, health facility parking lots, and surrounding neighborhoods — places where recent ICE activities have sparked outrage and fear. Previous federal restrictions on immigration enforcement in or near sensitive areas, including health care establishments, were rescinded by the Trump administration in January.

""The issue that states encounter is the supremacy clause,"" said Sophia Genovese, a supervising attorney and clinical teaching fellow at Georgetown Law. She said the federal government does have the right to conduct enforcement activities, and there are limits to what the state can do to stop them.

California's law designates a patient's immigration status and birthplace as protected information, which like medical records cannot be disclosed to law enforcement without a warrant or court order. And it requires health care facilities to have clear procedures for handling requests from immigration authorities, including training staff to immediately notify a designated administrator or legal counsel if agents ask to enter a private area or review patient records.

Several other Democratic-led states have also taken up legislation to protect patients at hospitals and health centers. In May, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the Protect Civil Rights Immigration Status bill, which penalizes hospitals for unauthorized sharing of information about people in the country illegally and bars ICE agents from entering private areas of health care facilities without a judicial warrant. In Maryland, a law requiring the attorney general to create guidance on keeping ICE out of health care facilities went into effect in June. New Mexico has instituted new patient data protections, and Rhode Island has prohibited health care facilities from asking patients about their immigration status.

Republican-led states have aligned with federal efforts to prevent health care spending on immigrants without legal authorization. Such immigrants are not eligible for comprehensive Medicaid coverage, but states do bill the federal government for emergency care in certain cases. Under a law that took effect in 2023, Florida requires hospitals that accept Medicaid to ask about a patient's legal status. In Texas, hospitals now have to report how much they spend on care for immigrants without legal authorization.

""Texans should not have to shoulder the burden of financially supporting medical care for illegal immigrants,"" Gov. Greg Abbott said in issuing his executive order last year.

California's efforts to rein in federal enforcement come as the state, where more than a quarter of residents are foreign-born, has become a target of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. Newsom signed SB 81 as part of a bill package prohibiting immigration agents from entering schools without a warrant, requiring law enforcement officers to identify themselves, and banning officers from wearing masks. SB 81 was passed on a party-line vote with no formal opposition.

""We're not North Korea,"" Newsom said during a September bill-signing ceremony. ""We're pushing back against these authoritarian tendencies and actions of this administration.""

Some supporters of the bill and legal experts said California's law can prevent ICE from violating existing patient privacy rights. Those include the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits searches without a warrant in places where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Valid warrants must be issued by a court and signed by a judge. But ICE agents frequently use administrative warrants to try to gain access to private areas they don't have the authority to enter, Genovese said.

""People don't always understand the difference between an administrative warrant, which is a meaningless piece of paper, versus a judicial warrant that is enforceable,"" Genovese said. Judicial warrants are rarely issued in immigration cases, she added.

The Department of Homeland Security has said it won't abide by California's mask ban or identification requirements for law enforcement officers, slamming them as unconstitutional. The department did not respond to a request for comment on the state's new rules for health care facilities, which went into immediate effect.

Tanya Broder, a senior counsel with the National Immigration Law Center, said immigration arrests at health care facilities appear to be relatively rare. But the federal decision to rescind protections around sensitive areas, she said, ""has generated fear and uncertainty across the country."" Many of the most high-profile news reports of immigration agents at health care facilities have been in California, largely involving detained patients brought in for care.

The California Nurses Association, the state's largest nurses union, was a co-sponsor of the bill and raised concerns about the treatment of Milagro Solis-Portillo, a 36-year-old Salvadoran woman who was under round-the-clock ICE surveillance at Glendale Memorial Hospital over the summer.

Union leaders also condemned the presence of agents at California Hospital Medical Center south of downtown Los Angeles. According to Anne Caputo-Pearl, a labor and delivery nurse and the chief union representative at the hospital, agents brought in a patient on Oct. 21 and remained in the patient's room for almost a week. The Los Angeles Times reported that a TikTok streamer, Carlitos Ricardo Parias, was taken to the hospital that day after he was wounded during an immigration enforcement operation in South Los Angeles.

The presence of ICE was intimidating for nurses and patients, Caputo-Pearl said, and prompted visitor restrictions at the hospital. ""We want better clarification,"" she said. ""Why is it that these agents are allowed to be in the room?""

Hospital and clinic representatives, however, said they are already following the law's requirements, which largely reinforce extensive guidance put out by state Attorney General Rob Bonta in December.

Community clinics throughout Los Angeles County, which serve over 2 million patients a year, including a large portion of immigrants, have been implementing the attorney general's guidelines for months, said Louise McCarthy, president and CEO of the Community Clinic Association of Los Angeles County. But she said the law should help ensure uniform standards across health facilities that clinics refer out to and reassure patients that procedures are in place to protect them.

Still, it can't prevent immigration raids from happening in the broader community, which have made some patients and even health workers afraid to venture outside, McCarthy said. Some incidents have occurred near clinics, including an arrest of a passerby outside a clinic in East Los Angeles, which a security guard caught on video, she said.

""We've had clinic staff say, 'Is it safe for me to go out?'"" she said.

At St. John's Community Health, a network of 24 community health centers and five mobile clinics in South Los Angeles and the Inland Empire, CEO Jim Mangia agreed that the new law can't prevent all immigration enforcement activity, but he said it does give clinics a tool to push back if agents show up, something his staff has already had to do.

Mangia said St. John's staff had two encounters with immigration agents over the summer. In one, he said, staff stopped armed officers from entering a gated parking lot at a drug and alcohol recovery center where doctors and nurses were seeing patients at a mobile health clinic.

Another occurred in July, when immigration agents descended upon MacArthur Park on horses and in armored vehicles, in a show of force by the Trump administration. Mangia said masked officers in full tactical gear surrounded a street medicine tent where St. John's providers were tending to homeless patients, screamed at staff to get out, and pointed a gun at them. The providers were so shaken by the episode, Mangia said, that he had to bring in mental health professionals to help them feel safe going back out on the street.

A DHS spokesperson told CalMatters that in the rare instance where agents enter certain sensitive locations, officers would need ""secondary supervisor approval.""

Since then, St. John's has doubled down on providing support and training to staff and has offered patients afraid to go out the option of home medical visits and grocery deliveries. Patient fears and ICE activity have decreased since the summer, Mangia said, but with DHS planning to hire an additional 10,000 ICE agents, he doubts that will last.",https://www.news-medical.net/images/tags/TagImage-1295-45841047278807879412-620x480.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 10:17:11.261212

The automatic extension policy has since been periodically maintained and expanded—most recently from 180 days to 540 days—specifically to stabilize employment during prolonged adjudication backlogs.","Beginning October 30, 2025, noncitizens who file to renew their EADs will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization or EAD validity while USCIS adjudicates their renewal application.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), through U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), has issued an interim final rule eliminating the automatic extension of employment authorization documents (EADs) for most noncitizens who timely file renewal applications. This policy change will apply to EAD renewal applications filed on or after October 30, 2025.

Key Change

Beginning October 30, 2025, noncitizens who file to renew their EADs will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization or EAD validity while USCIS adjudicates their renewal application. Limited exceptions will remain, including extensions required by federal statute and those issued through Federal Register notices for temporary protected status (TPS) beneficiaries.

EADs that already received an automatic extension prior to October 30, 2025, will not be affected by this rule.

DHS Rationale

DHS states that the policy is intended to enhance screening and vetting by requiring USCIS to affirmatively reevaluate an individual’s eligibility before extending work authorization. USCIS leadership emphasized a return to stricter review standards, noting that authorization to work in the United States is a “privilege, not a right.”

Impact on Employers and Foreign National Employees

This rule is expected to have significant compliance and operational consequences, including:

Increased risk of gaps in work authorization during renewal processing.

Heightened I-9 compliance exposure if internal tracking systems are not proactively updated.

Greater urgency to file renewal applications up to 180 days before expiration (as recommended by USCIS).

Business continuity risk, particularly for employers with EAD-dependent workforce populations.

Foreign nationals whose employment authorization is incident to their status will continue to have work authorization if their status is valid, even if their EAD is expired. For example, individuals in L-2S with an expired EAD but valid L-2 status will continue to hold work authorization. These employees can present a valid I-797 or I-94 to their employers upon expiration of their EAD.

Recommended Employer Action Items

To reduce risk, employers should:

Identify and audit current employees holding EADs as early as possible.

Update I-9 and immigration compliance protocols—reverification must occur by the current EAD expiration date; post-October 30, 2025, I-797C receipt notices can no longer be relied upon to extend work authorization.

Train HR and onboarding teams on the rule and revised timelines.

Encourage employees to file renewal applications at the earliest permissible window (180 days before expiration).

Coordinate with immigration counsel immediately if relying on TPS-related or statute-based automatic extensions.

EAD Categories Impacted (for Renewal Filings on or After October 30, 2025)

The following categories were previously eligible for automatic extensions and will now be affected:

A03: Refugees

Historical Background

The automatic EAD extension was originally created to prevent gaps in work authorization for individuals with pending, timely filed renewal applications due to USCIS case processing delays—an issue that had triggered extensive employer advocacy and litigation, including Edakunni v. Mayorkas (2022). In response, DHS first issued a temporary 540-day automatic extension in 2022 to provide immediate relief and workforce continuity. That framework was made permanent in January 2025, with DHS citing the need to support the U.S. economy, protect employers from workforce disruption and reduce uncertainty and anxiety for foreign national employees. The automatic extension policy has since been periodically maintained and expanded—most recently from 180 days to 540 days—specifically to stabilize employment during prolonged adjudication backlogs.

Next Steps

We are closely monitoring implementation guidance and any further clarification from USCIS. Employers should immediately begin reviewing workforce planning and compliance processes to prevent future authorization lapses once the rule takes effect.

For case-specific guidance or assistance in updating compliance protocols, seek immigration counsel.

""We have seen how they try to intimidate people that are alerting the community by saying that they're obstructing, by saying that they're impeding,"" Little Village Community Council President Baltazar Enriquez said.

Enriquez has witnessed in his community federal agents claiming obstruction against protesters with less than physical interference, which Schwinn says can be interpreted as legal.

""A person can interfere with a federal officer doing their job through things like even intimidation or some kind of other interference that is short of actual physical involvement,"" Schwinn said.

But, in his legal opinion, Schwinn says the Trump administration has stretched the limits of what obstruction means when they have prosecuted protesters.

""If the Department of Justice seeks to lodge a charge, they very well may do it, but then it's a different question entirely, whether that'll survive the legal system,"" Schwinn said.

Schwinn says charges likely won't survive, if it is proved federal agents were acting unlawfully while doing their jobs.

In the meantime, Enriquez is not taking any chances. He advises his volunteers who look out for ICE to no longer follow the agents in caravans, stay six feet away and don't engage.

He criticized former President Joe Biden’s immigration policies, which he said allowed too many people into the country and threatened the social fabric of the United States.
“We cannot be afraid to do something because the left might do it in the future,” Vance said.
“The left is already going to do it regardless of whether we do it.” Vance was introduced by Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, in one of her first public appearances since she took over her husband’s role leading Turning Point.

Vance took questions from students at the University of Mississippi at an event organized by Turning Point USA, stepping into the role of debater that was so often performed by the organization’s slain founder, Charlie Kirk.

Vance said the optimal number of legal immigrants to admit is “far less than what we’ve been accepting,” but he did not offer a firm number when pressed by a woman who questioned his stance. He criticized former President Joe Biden’s immigration policies, which he said allowed too many people into the country and threatened the social fabric of the United States.

“When something like that happens, you’ve got to allow your own society to cohere a little bit, to build a sense of common identity, for all the newcomers — the ones who are going to stay — to assimilate into American culture,” Vance said. “Until you do that, you’ve got to be careful about any additional immigration, in my view.”

Vance also spoke forcefully about avoiding American deaths in “unnecessary foreign conflicts,” touting President Donald Trump’s Middle East diplomacy and the strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, even as the U.S. steps up military pressure on Venezuela and strikes boats that the Trump administrations says are transporting drugs.

Asked whether Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to Democratic-led cities will lead to a future president using that government power against conservatives, he said his allies shouldn’t be worried about Trump’s exercise of executive power. He justified Trump’s targeting of his political enemies by pointing to his arrest during Biden’s administration. He was charged with illegally keeping classified documents after his first term and attempting to subvert the 2020 election he lost, but the charges were dismissed after he was elected to his second term a year ago.

“We cannot be afraid to do something because the left might do it in the future,” Vance said. “The left is already going to do it regardless of whether we do it.”

Vance was introduced by Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, in one of her first public appearances since she took over her husband’s role leading Turning Point.

“Being on campus right now, for me, is a spiritual reclaiming of territory,” she said, reflecting on Kirk’s love of visiting universities and his mission to move campuses to the right.

Wearing a white “freedom” shirt like the one her husband wore when he was shot, Erika Kirk urged young Christian conservatives to courageously fight for their beliefs and not fear the social consequences.

“If you’re worried about losing a friend—I lost my friend,” she said. “I lost my best friend.”

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by US District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations. But an appeals court blocked the order before he was scheduled to appear Wednesday while it considers an appeal from the Justice Department.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on September 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on September 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring US Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-26t193700z-946293913-rc2nzgaum92w-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-30 04:16:43.922760

The Economist/YouGov poll is published weekly and asks respondents whether they approve or disapprove of whichever president is in office. In its latest findings, which were published on Tuesday, the poll found that only 39 percent of Americans currently approve of Trump’s job as president, while a staggering 58 percent say they disapprove.

With a net rate of -19 points, Trump’s approval rating has never been worse during his second term as president, the polling outfit reported. In fact, Trump has only polled worse during one point in his first term in office, making this his second-worst approval rating in both of his terms combined.

The survey noted that Trump is getting negative marks on nearly every major issue. Trump polls negatively on immigration, for example, attaining a -10-point net approval rating. He also polls in the negatives on abortion (-17 points), education (-19 points), jobs/the economy (-22 points), climate change/environment (-22 points), and inflation/consumer prices (-31 points).

His recent executive actions are also viewed poorly by the American public — he receives a net-31-point approval rating on his decision to cancel trade talks with Canada, a -36-point rating on his demolition of the East Wing of the White House to build a new ballroom, a -44-point rating for his choice to commute the sentence of George Santos, and -44-point rating on his demands to be compensated over past federal investigations into his actions.

Meanwhile, movements against Trump are viewed positively by a plurality of respondents in the poll. Asked about how they view the nationwide “No Kings” protests, 49 percent of Americans said they approved of the demonstrations, while only 33 percent said they disapproved. (Eighteen percent said they weren’t sure how they felt.) Close to 1 in 10 Americans (8 percent) also said they themselves participated in the protests.

That number is significant because of a concept called the “3.5 percent rule.” According to research at Harvard Kennedy School’s Carr-Ryan Center for Human Rights, nonviolent protests that engage at least 3.5 percent of the population have a higher likelihood of accomplishing their aims — indeed, worldwide movements that reach that threshold “have never failed to bring about change,” researchers said.

Despite his dismal approval ratings, Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier this week that he has “the best Polling Numbers that I have ever received.” He further claimed that “Radical Left Losers are taking fake ads, not showing REAL Polls, but rather saying that I’m Polling at low levels,” and that such ads “should not be allowed to run.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_1029-trump-polls.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 06:01:56.049951

(AP) — A federal trial over whether President Donald Trump can deploy the National Guard to Portland, Oregon, was underway Wednesday, with police officials expected to testify that federal agents at the city’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building have inflamed protests in recent weeks through excessive force.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, will preside over the trial in Portland. The trial stems from a lawsuit filed by the city and state against the Trump administration in a bid to block the troop deployment.

Immergut has already issued two temporary restraining orders in the case blocking the troops pending further litigation. She found that Trump had failed to show he had met the conditions set out by Congress for using the military domestically. She described his assessment of the situation in Portland, which Trump called “war ravaged,” as “simply untethered to the facts.”

One of Immergut’s orders was paused last week by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals. But late Tuesday the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the case before an 11-judge panel.

The complex case comes as Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement — including Chicago, which has filed a separate lawsuit on the issue — are pushing back. They argue the president has not met the legal requirements to deploy troops and doing so would violate states’ sovereignty. The administration argues that it needs the troops because protests have impeded law enforcement operations.

Portland’s ICE building outside downtown has been the site of nightly protests that peaked in June when police declared one demonstration a riot. Smaller clashes have also occurred since then, and federal officers have fired tear gas to clear crowds, which at times have included counterprotesters and livestreamers.

During the trial, witnesses are expected to take the stand for both sides and face cross-examination. The federal defendants will call officials from ICE, the Department of Defense and the Federal Protective Service, the agency that provides security for federal buildings.

The administration argues that it has had to shuffle Department of Homeland Security agents from elsewhere around the country to respond to the Portland protests, showing that the city has been unable to enforce the law with regular forces — one of the conditions set by Congress for calling out the National Guard. It has also characterized the protests as a “rebellion” or “danger of rebellion” — another of the conditions.

The state and city argue that federal officers have at times used force that appears to be “needless and arbitrary.”

“They have deployed tear gas and pepper balls on small numbers of nonviolent protesters outside of the ICE building repeatedly, in some cases without apparent need or provocation, and without first exhausting de-escalation or other less-aggressive options,” the plaintiffs wrote in a trial brief.

Portland police have also been “gassed by federal law enforcement” and, on at least one occasion, hit with a crowd-control projectile, the brief said.

The Trump administration says the Portland Police Bureau has been unwilling to help control the protests, describing authorities in a trial brief as “unhelpful and at times hostile.”

“The record is replete with evidence of the PPB failing to provide assistance when federal officials have requested it,” Justice Department attorneys wrote.

The police say they have made arrests when crimes have been committed, but that they also must respect protesters’ First Amendment rights.

Communication between local and federal authorities worsened as federal agents surged to the building “without a clear command and control structure,” the state and city said.

“To list just one illustrative example, at one point pepper balls were shot in the direction of a PPB officer,” the trial brief said. “When confronted, federal officials responded, ‘help or get out of the way.’”

In Chicago, police officers have similarly been exposed to tear gas deployed by federal officials against protesters.

The Portland trial is expected to last three days.

Defendants enmeshed in the wave of online wiretapping litigation scored a victory on October 17, 2025, when Judge Vince Chhabria invoked the rule of lenity and granted summary judgment for the defendant on California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA) claims in Jane Doe v. Eating Recovery Center (ERC) LLC, case no. 3:23-cv-05561-VC (N.D. Cal.), Dkt. 167. While it remains to be seen whether other courts will follow suit, Judge Chhabria’s order will doubtlessly be useful for defendants advancing similar lenity-based arguments in wiretapping cases going forward.

Background

California enacted the CIPA in 1967 to regulate wiretapping and eavesdropping on confidential communications. CIPA is primarily a criminal statute, but it also includes a civil private right of action with a statutory damages provision that has provoked waves of litigation since the early 2000s, first as to companies’ call recording practices, and then as to various internet technologies. See Cal. Penal Code. § 637.2. The most recent wave of litigation has focused on consumer-facing websites that use commonplace advertising technologies like cookies, pixels, and similar tracking software. The ensuing wave of litigation has overwhelmed website operators over the last two years, with many facing multiple demand letters and cases across both state and federal courts in California. And it has obliged courts to grapple with how to apply a nearly sixty-year-old statute to internet technologies that did not exist when it was drafted. Given the challenges inherent in such an exercise, federal and state courts remain split on a number of important legal issues, and uncertainty continues.

The rule of lenity can be an attractive defense for defendants in wiretapping cases. That rule, which is grounded in core due process principles, instructs courts to interpret criminal statutes like CIPA narrowly and construe ambiguities in the defendant’s favor. Given CIPA’s age and opaque language, the rule of lenity defense is an important defense to CIPA wiretapping cases. But so far, court rulings have been mixed: several federal courts have decided not to apply the rule of lenity in these cases.

Judge Chhabria’s Order in Doe v. Eating Recovery Center LLC

A positive legal development occurred last week for defendants facing the recent tsunami of CIPA litigation when, in Doe v. Eating Recovery Center LLC, Judge Chhabria of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California applied the rule of lenity in a CIPA case—noting that “courts are issuing conflicting rulings, and companies have no way of telling whether their online business activities will subject them to liability”—and granted summary judgment to a company offering an eating disorders website.

Doe v. ERC was a run-of-the-mill wiretapping case. ERC used the Meta Pixel on its website from 2019-2024 to improve outreach for treatment services. The Pixel’s default configuration sent Meta page URLs, time-on-page, referrer paths, and certain button clicks. The plaintiff alleged that ERC violated Section 631 of CIPA by sharing that data with Meta. Section 631(a) of CIPA imposes liability on anyone who:

“intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable, or instrument”;

“willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same is in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or is being sent from, or received at any place within this state”;

“uses, or attempts to use, in any manner, or for any purpose, or to communicate in any way, any information so obtained”; or

“aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons to unlawfully do, or permit, or cause to be done any of the acts or things mentioned above in this section.”

Cal. Penal Code § 631(a).

In Doe v. ERC, the plaintiff alleged that Meta violated the second clause of CIPA because it read, attempted to read, or attempted to learn the contents of her communications with ERC while they were in transit, and ERC in turn violated the fourth clause by aiding or conspiring with Meta. On summary judgment, ERC challenged that theory as deficient in two respects: (1) the data that Meta received was not the “contents” of the plaintiff’s communications with ERC; and (2) even if it was, Meta did not attempt to read the contents of the communications while they were in transit.

Judge Chhabria ruled for the plaintiff on the first issue but for ERC on the second issue. He found that the undisputed evidence established that Meta did not read, attempt to read, or attempt to learn the “contents” of a communication while they were “in transit” as required by Section 631(a). In doing so, he rejected the plaintiff’s theory that merely intercepting data with the intent to analyze it later is an “attempt to learn” while in transit, cautioning that this reading would collapse Section 631(a) into Section 632 (CIPA’s “recording device” provision).

But the heart of the court’s analysis concerned the rule of lenity, which Judge Chhabria cited as a key reason for not adopting the plaintiff’s broader interpretation of CIPA’s “in transit” language. He began by lamenting CIPA’s “badly drafted” text and the current state of litigation under it. Order at 6. He also noted that, when courts are called upon to apply CIPA’s “obtuse language” to “new technologies,” “it’s often borderline impossible to determine whether a defendant’s online conduct fits within the language of the statute.” Order at 1; see also id. at 9 (“[T]he statutory language was drafted with very different technology in mind, and it does not map properly onto the internet.”). Because CIPA contains ambiguous language and is a criminal statute, Judge Chhabria agreed with ERC that CIPA should be interpreted narrowly and that any ambiguity should be resolved in the defendants’ favor. Applying that rule, Judge Chhabria granted ERC’s motion for summary judgment, holding that “it would not be appropriate to interpret the ‘in-transit’ requirement of Section 631(a) so broadly as to cover [ERC’s] conduct.” Order at 12.

Judge Chhabria closed with an appeal to the California legislature: he urged it “to step up” and “bring CIPA into the modern age and to speak clearly about how the kinds of activities at issue in this case should be treated.” Order at 2. But until that happens, he concluded that “courts should generally resolve CIPA’s many ambiguities in favor of” defendants. Id.

***

Judge Chhabria’s invocation of the rule of lenity is a positive result for defendants in website tracking and Pixel cases. The opinion may serve as a template for other courts in employing the rule of lenity to help stem the tide of wiretapping cases filling court dockets and may exert further pressure on the California legislature to clarify their decades-old wiretapping statute.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.14376_4544.jpg,N,,2025-10-30 03:56:37.718773

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations, beginning on Wednesday. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She’s running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,” she said. “I hope you won’t either.”

“We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump’s ‘America First’ policies,” they said.","Progressive Democratic congressional candidate and former journalist Kat Abughazaleh was indicted by the Justice Department Wednesday for allegedly preventing a federal officer from “discharging the duties of his office” at the Broadview ICE detention center near Chicago.

Abughazaleh and five others are accused of blocking a Department of Homeland Security vehicle from carrying out deportations, banging and scratching on the window.

“It was further part of the conspiracy that Abughazaleh joined the crowd at the front of the Government Vehicle, and with her hands on the hood braced her body and hands against the vehicle while remaining directly in the path of the vehicle, hindering and impeding Agent A and the vehicle from proceeding to the BSSA,” the court documents read. “[Abughazaleh] forcibly impeded, intimidated, and interfered with an officer of the United States.”

Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old Palestinian American House candidate in Illinois’s 9th congressional district, condemned the indictment.

“This is a political prosecution, and a gross attempt to silence dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment,” she said in a video posted to social media Wednesday afternoon. “This is a major push by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish anyone who speaks out against them. That’s why I’m gonna fight these unjust charges.”

Federal forces have been particularly violent and confrontational in Chicago, where the Trump administration is carrying out its “Operation Midway Blitz” crackdown on immigration, resulting in shows of dissent from local residents. Abughazaleh herself was body-slammed and beaten by ICE at a previous protest in September. Other protesters in Chicago, such as Reverend David Black and United Methodist Reverend Hannah Kardon, have also been shot at with pepper balls.

“ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and tear-gassed hundreds of protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors, and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

“This case targets our right to protest, speak freely, and associate with anyone who disagrees with the government,” Abughazaleh added. “We cannot diminish ourselves in the face of these attacks. That’s why we have to unite and stand up for humanity, our rights, and everyone terrorized by Trump’s lawless secret police.”

Abughazaleh and the other five protesters face charges carrying up to eight years in prison if convicted.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. admitted Wednesday that he doesn’t have “sufficient” evidence that pregnant people’s use of Tylenol can cause autism in their children.

While speaking about President Donald Trump’s controversial TrumpRx program, Kennedy made a crucial clarification about the administration’s recent claims linking autism to Tylenol, the number one drug prescribed to pregnant patients for pain relief and fever reduction.

“The causative association between Tylenol given in pregnancy and perinatal periods is not sufficient to say it definitely causes autism, but it is very suggestive,” Kennedy said.

Kennedy’s comment came just one day after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against Kenvue, Tylenol’s parent company, alleging that it failed to alert consumers that using its product during pregnancy posed a “significantly increased risk of autism” and ADHD. But that claim isn’t true by Kennedy’s own admission.

Several large studies have found “associations” between substantial use of acetaminophen during pregnancy and higher rates of neurodevelopmental disorders in children, but experts have stressed that these studies are not conclusive. During a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Kennedy cited a number of studies that allegedly support his suspicions about Tylenol but said the existing evidence was “not proof.”

“We’re doing the studies to make the proof,” he admitted—which made the whole thing sound more like a hunch than anything else.

Speaking on Wednesday, Kennedy suggested that pregnant women should consult with their doctors before taking Tylenol, but generally, the Trump administration hasn’t been quite that diplomatic with its recommendations.

In September, Trump seemed to suggest that all Americans should stop taking acetaminophen (though he could hardly pronounce it), especially pregnant women and young children.

“You’ll take a Tylenol, but it’ll be very sparingly. Can be something that’s very dangerous to the woman’s health, in other words a fever that’s very, very dangerous and ideally a doctor’s decision because I think you shouldn’t take it,” he said.

And as recently as Sunday, Trump was still urging people, “DON’T USE TYLENOL UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

“DON’T GIVE TYLENOL TO YOUR YOUNG CHILD FOR VIRTUALLY ANY REASON,” the president, who has no medical training, wrote on Truth Social.

Toyota has denied President Trump’s recent claim that the company recently pledged to invest $10 billion in the United States.

Trump bragged about the $10 billion figure at least twice during his trip to Asia this week, visiting an American naval base in Yokosuka, Japan, and meeting with the country’s newly minted right-wing Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi on Tuesday.

“Yesterday I was with Mr. Toyoda in Japan, and he’s just announced he’s gonna spend, uh, they’re gonna spend $10 billion, and they’re gonna build new car plants,” Trump said Tuesday, referring to the company’s CEO, Akio Toyoda. “And they’re gonna build ’em in numerous states, about six or seven different states.”

No such deal has been made, as Toyota made sure to clarify. On Wednesday, company executive Hiroyuki Ueda basically confirmed that Trump was either making it up or mixing it up with a deal from his first term nearly eight years ago.

“During the first Trump administration, I think the figure was roughly around $10 billion, so while we didn’t say the same scale, we did explain that we’ll keep investing and providing employment as before,” Ueda told reporters. “So, probably because of that context, the figure of about $10 billion came up. Therefore, we didn’t specifically say that we’ll invest $10 billion over the next few years.”

More on Trump’s Japan visit:

It seems that acting U.S. Attorney Bilal “Bill” Essayli couldn’t care less whether he was illegally appointed by President Donald Trump—or maybe he just didn’t read a judge’s order closely enough.

U.S. District Judge J. Michael Seabright ruled Tuesday night that Essayli had been “unlawfully serving” as the U.S. attorney for the Central District of California and was “disqualified” from serving in that role. Essayli was, however, properly appointed as a special attorney and could serve as “First Assistant United States Attorney.”

Essayli took to X soon after to assure his followers that everything would remain the same.

“For those who didn’t read the entire order, nothing is changing. I continue serving as the top federal prosecutor in the Central District of California. It’s an honor and privilege to serve President Trump and Attorney General Bondi, and I look forward to advancing their agenda for the American People,” he wrote on X, posting a screenshot of the judge’s order.

Incidentally, the excerpt he shared relayed that he was “never lawfully serving as Acting United States Attorney.”

Journalist Adam Klasfield pointed out the admission on X, adding: “If he’s claiming First Assistant US Attorney is the same thing (it isn’t), he shouldn’t mind identifying himself accurately.”

While the positions are functionally similar, some requests require the signature of the U.S. attorney specifically.

The Trump administration has attempted to stretch the 120-day limits on interim appointments to avoid embarrassing Senate confirmation votes. Trump’s appointments of Alina Habba in New Jersey and Lindsey Halligan in Virginia have both summoned legal challenges.

While illegally serving as acting U.S. attorney, Essayli provided cover for the Trump administration’s federal law enforcement crackdown in Los Angeles and pursued dozens of (mostly failed) cases against protesters opposing immigration raids earlier this year. Seabright declined to toss the cases Essayli had been prosecuting because they had been “lawfully signed by other attorneys,” and there was no evidence of due process violations.

The speaker of the House is apparently in favor of totalitarian rule, so long as Donald Trump is in charge.

The government has been shut down for more than 27 days now. But instead of working to bridge the partisan gulf and restore critical social services to millions of Americans and paychecks to thousands of federal workers, House Speaker Mike Johnson is still hyperfixated on the nationwide No Kings protest that occurred two weekends ago.

Delivering what he clearly believed was a very clever “gotcha,” Johnson told reporters Wednesday that the country would be better off if Trump were king.

“They had a rally a couple weeks ago, they tried to portray President Trump as a king. We pointed out again, the obvious truth, that if Trump was a king then the government would be open,” Johnson smirked. “He’s been trying to do that.”

Johnson then appealed to low-income Americans with his pro-monarchy pitch, arguing that if Trump had singular authority, then he would have already advanced funding for SNAP benefits, which are set to expire November 1. (A coalition of 22 states sued the Trump administration Tuesday for allegedly withholding federal funds set aside specifically to continue the program through the month of November.)

The lower chamber leader has been complaining about the No Kings protests since before they even took place on October 18, trying every which way to leverage the movement to redirect attention away from his failures at the dais. He has falsely claimed that the peaceful, anti-authoritarian protest series—which produced the largest single-day protest in U.S. history—was actually advocating for violence against political officials.

By and large, the multi-month protest series has advocated for Americans’ First Amendment rights and rejected Trump’s agenda. Signage related to the event has emphasized the fight for democracy and against dictatorships. In the same political vein, No Kings participants have used their enormous visual footprint to fight against Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s unchecked authority, turn out for universal health care, condemn the release of disgraced former Representative George Santos, and raise national awareness on the rise of American fascism.

Meanwhile, Johnson appears to be doing everything in his power to keep the government closed. Week after week, he has sent representatives home instead of bringing them in to try to come up with a solution to the shutdown. When asked Wednesday if he would bring lawmakers back to negotiate government funding past November 1, he described doing so as a “futile exercise.” He then blamed Democrats for refusing to pass a continuing resolution that would strip health care away from millions of Americans.

House Speaker Mike Johnson is pretending that he’s never even heard about an ICE agent firing at a faith leader’s face—even though he was first asked about it two weeks ago.

During a press conference Wednesday, Religion News Service’s Jack Jenkins asked Johnson whether an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shooting a pepper ball at a Presbyterian minister outside an ICE facility in Broadview, a suburb of Chicago, had infringed on the faith leader’s freedom of religion.*

“I can’t comment on any of those instances. I haven’t seen or heard any of those videos,” Johnson replied.

But the House speaker had already used that line earlier this month. “I’ve not seen [ICE] cross the line yet,” Johnson said when he was first asked about the widely publicized incident.

Jenkins immediately caught the lie Wednesday. “I asked this question, and you’ll hear me say ‘yes you have’ here—because Johnson was already *directly asked* about one of these instances in one of earlier shutdown press conferences,” he wrote on X.

It’s not clear what’s worse: the idea that Johnson would hear a report about the use of excessive force against a faith leader and never think about it again—or that he actually expects Americans to believe he never heard about it in the first place.

But Johnson wasn’t done. For a guy who won’t comment on a video he claims not to have seen, the Louisiana Republican sure said a lot.

“Religious freedom does not extend and give you the right to get in the face of an ICE officer and assault them, if indeed that was what happened there,” Johnson continued Wednesday.

Crucially, video of the incident shows that the agent was standing on the facility’s roof firing at a clearly unarmed priest standing on the ground. But Johnson is so adamant about the alleged abuse of law enforcement by radical activists that he’s willing to take some creative liberties.

In his daily propaganda press conferences, the House speaker has embraced a sort of strategic blindness when it comes to the misdeeds of Donald Trump’s administration. Johnson even played dumb when asked about a report that ICE had detained scores of U.S. citizens, including children.

President Donald Trump has cleared the way for his multiple large-scale construction projects by demolishing the commission that would oversee them.

All six members of the Commission on Fine Arts received an email from the White House presidential personnel office Tuesday night notifying them that they had been terminated, effective immediately, The Washington Post reported.

An official told the Post that Trump planned to replace the members. “We are preparing to appoint a new slate of members to the commission that are more aligned with President Trump’s ‘America First’ policies,” they said.

The official’s statement seems to suggest that Trump is seeking a slate of MAGA commissioners to green-light his every whim, as he attempts to unilaterally transform the nation’s capital into a shrine to his own triumph. The previous commissioners had been appointed to four-year terms by President Joe Biden.

The commission was established by Congress in 1910 to advise the federal government on the art, design, and architectural development of Washington, including major projects at the White House. It’s not clear whether Trump intends to run his plans for a $300 million ballroom or his ridiculous “Arc de Trump” monument past the new commission.

The latest shake-ups come as Trump lays waste to the White House’s East Wing, after promising his grand designs for a space to host diplomats would leave the original building untouched.

It also seems that Trump has allowed his “builder in chief” status to eclipse his actual duties. The president has reportedly become consumed by his large-scale remodeling at the White House, wandering away from his work to survey renovations.

California is rapidly turning its education system, from K-12 schools to colleges, into a benefit for illegal aliens. A slew of recent state laws limit cooperation with federal immigration officials undermining enforcement, placing foreign nationals above American students, and increasing taxpayer costs.

Senate Bill (SB) 580, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, forces schools, libraries, courthouses, health facilities, and shelters to develop and implement policies that actively restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities. This law violates 8 U.S. Code § 1373 by prohibiting these institutions from sharing immigration status information with federal officials. Beyond the legal concerns, SB 580 adds layers of bureaucracy and compliance costs that California taxpayers will ultimately bear.

In addition to SB 580, an additional four bills were recently enacted that establish new protections to prioritize illegal aliens over American students and lawful residents.

SB 98, signed by Governor Newsom on September 20, 2025, requires colleges and universities to alert students about immigration enforcement activities on campus, maintain strict confidentiality regarding students’ national origin or immigration status, and provide legal assistance and resources for immigration matters. California’s public universities are now expected to function as early warning systems and legal aid centers for those sought by federal law enforcement.

SB 307, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, requires the California State University and University of California systems to implement measures to ensure that foreign nationals retain their academic status even if they cannot attend classes due to immigration enforcement actions. Additionally, it creates taxpayer-funded “Dreamer Resource Liaisons” that guarantees assistance and eligibility for illegal aliens seeking financial aid or non-resident tuition exemptions. American students already face fierce competition for limited financial aid and university resources; now, they must compete against foreign nationals who receive state-sponsored advocacy and support.

Assembly Bill (AB) 419, signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, prohibits local educational agencies from collecting national origin and immigration status information. The law requires schools to report any immigration enforcement inquiries and mandates multilingual communications that inform all students about their educational “rights” regardless of legal status. This measure effectively prevents schools from cooperating with federal authorities while simultaneously advertising California’s education system as a safe haven for illegal immigration.

AB 495, also signed by Governor Newsom on October 12, 2025, bars daycare centers and state preschool programs from inquiring about citizenship or immigration status and requires these facilities to establish policies that severely restrict cooperation with immigration enforcement efforts.",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/Migrants%2C%20Money%2C%20Cracked%20Flag%2C%20School%20Bus.jpg.webp?itok=4Qm0Fglx,N,,2025-10-29 23:56:35.975173

In an essay published this week, Bhattacharyya outlined a solution for the justice department to handle Trump’s claim: do nothing.","Donald Trump’s effort to get his justice department to pay him hundreds of millions of dollars is based on specious legal claims that would likely be rejected if he were any other American, according to a legal expert and a former Department of Justice official who handled damages claims against the government.

Trump has asked the justice department to pay him $230m in damages, the New York Times reported last week. The amount is the total of two separate claims in which Trump argues he is entitled to compensation because of investigations into the links between Russia and his 2016 campaign as well as the 2022 search for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago and subsequent criminal prosecution.

In the Mar-a-Lago complaint, Trump argues he was subject to invasion of privacy, malicious prosecution and abuse of process related to the case.

The effort has set off alarm bells and seen as a staggering act of corruption because the two justice department officials with power to sign off on the claims are Trump appointees and allies. House Democrats sent a letter to the justice department this week calling the effort “blatantly illegal and unconstitutional”.

Trump is seeking compensation under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), a law that allows people to seek damages from the federal government. The law requires claimants to first file an administrative claim for damages; the government then has six months to either settle the claim or deny it. After six months, or if the claim is denied, the claimant can file a lawsuit. The government has not responded to either of Trump’s claims, but Trump has not filed a lawsuit. It is extremely difficult for a claimant to successfully recover damages under the law.

The New York Times published the form Trump used to make the claim about the Mar-a-Lago raid – the only claim that has become public so far. Trump requested the government pay him $100m in compensation. Additionally, a memo attached to the claim requested $100m in punitive damages and says the president suffered $15m in actual harm due to legal costs connected to the case. It is not clear why the claim cover sheet seeks $100m in damages while the memo outlines $115m in requested damages.

Trump’s legal costs in the case were covered by his Super Pac, Save America. Trump retained six lawyers for himself in the classified documents case, including Todd Blanche, who is now the deputy attorney general.

Trump told reporters last week he would donate any money from a possible settlement to charity. The president has a history of making charitable promises that never materialize.

The amount Trump is demanding far exceeds the amount typically paid out by the justice department in administrative settlements under the FTCA. A Guardian review of FTCA claims filed against the federal government that were administratively settled from 2020 to 2024 shows the average settlement amount to be about $51,684. The largest administrative settlement during that time period was for $3.55m. The 139 administrative settlements the justice department reached last year with victims of Larry Nassar, the doctor who abused Olympic gymnasts and many others, totalled $138.7m.

Those seeking a settlement usually aim high because their initial request sets a ceiling on what they can recover, said Gregory Sisk, a law professor at the University of St Thomas in Minnesota. Still, he said, the amount Trump is requesting was difficult to take seriously.

“Typically, someone who was asking for this amount of money, it would be very quickly rejected, because it would be thought of as absurd to request that amount,” he said. “I cannot think of any prior claim, at least at this early stage, that has been settled that involves money approaching that level.”

Cases including a request for more than $4m typically have involved children who had been injured and had a lifetime of medical expenses and lost earnings capacity, according to Rupa Bhattacharyya, a former justice department attorney who worked on FTCA claims, adding that it was also extremely rare for the government to agree to such a big settlement without litigating it.

“A lot of the cases that get settled are small potatoes. If someone slips and falls in the Smithsonian and breaks their arm, they might settle that claim because it’s just not worth it to litigate it,” she said. “But big-money cases, it’s pretty rare for claims to be settled at the administrative stage because before the government pays out taxpayer funds, it wants to ensure that it in fact has a reason to do so.”

Normally, it would be easy for justice department lawyers to reject the overwhelming majority of the money Trump is requesting. The FTCA does not allow for punitive damages.

“It is a frivolous claim to ask for punitive damages under the FTCA. The statute is explicit,” said Sisk.

A key provision of the FTCA immunizes government officials when they are exercising their discretion within the bounds of a policy set by the government. The search warrants of Mar-a-Lago were approved by a magistrate judge.

“Since it was pursued pursuant to a warrant that had been issued by a judge who found that there was probable cause, that would be a pretty high hill to climb for the typical individual who claimed that they had been subjected to trespass by a search, even if the government ultimately concluded we’re not going to bring charges. Or charges were brought and you were acquitted,” Sisk said.

He added he would be surprised if there were many previous cases where anyone who was the subject of a search conducted after obtaining proper probable cause was able to obtain a settlement from the government.

Experts also questioned whether Trump would be able to recover attorneys’ fees in the case. The FTCA caps what an attorney gets paid as a portion of the plaintiff’s recovery, Bhattacharyya said.

Outside of the FTCA, when litigants try to get adversaries to pay their cases in court, judges typically investigate whether the amount billed was reasonable.

None of that may matter. The deputy attorney general and the associate attorney general both have the authority to require FTCA claims above $4m. Both positions are currently held by men who are Trump allies. Blanche, the deputy attorney general, defended Trump in the criminal cases against him. Save America also paid legal fees for Stanley Woodward, the associate attorney general who leads the department’s civil division, and who defended Trump’s valet, Walt Nauta, in the classified documents case. Both men have final authority on sign-offs for the settlements.

This has raised alarm and created serious legal ethics problems, said Joseph Tirrell, who was the top ethics official at the justice department until he was fired earlier this year. He is suing the department for wrongful termination.

“There’s just nobody that can make this decision, career or political appointee, who’s not going to be chock-full of ethical conundrums here,” he said. “In this case, there’s nobody to kick it up to. The attorney general has just as significant conflicts, if not more so than Mr Woodward and Mr Blanche. And, frankly, the risk of any or all of them being fired if they don’t make a decision that comports with the president’s wishes is just as significant and applies to every employee in the department of justice, if not every employee in the executive branch.”

“In any circumstance, all officials at the Department of Justice follow the guidance of career ethics officials,” said Chad Gilmartin, a justice department spokesperson. That was of little reassurance to Tirrell.

“Can you imagine an ethics official, a career official, making this decision without thinking, ‘Well, if I don’t tell them what they want to hear, I’m going to lose my job’?” he said.

There also may be little information provided to the public once a settlement is reached. Details of administrative settlements are not typically disclosed to the public, though some basic details are included in a year-end report to Congress.

In an essay published this week, Bhattacharyya outlined a solution for the justice department to handle Trump’s claim: do nothing.

The FTCA does not require the department to respond to Trump’s request for a settlement, and the president can pursue it in court, where he would have to more fully flesh out his arguments before a judge and offer evidence in the public eye.

“If President Trump wants to press his legal claims in a court of law, let him try, as thousands of tort claimants do every year,” she wrote.

“Settling President Trump’s administrative claims before there has been any opportunity to test or defend those claims should be a non-starter for the justice department if it is to retain any integrity, a commitment to doing justice, and a sense of responsibility for the US taxpayer dollars with which they have been entrusted.”

A Democratic congressional candidate in Illinois has been indicted on federal charges relating to an incident in which protesters allegedly attacked an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) vehicle outside a Chicago suburb facility last month.

Katherine ""Kat"" Abughazaleh, 26, who has branded herself a ""Gen Z influencer"" running for Congress in Illinois’s 9th District, is accused of conspiracy to impede or injure an ICE officer while on duty in Broadview, Illinois, Sept. 26, according to an indictment unsealed Wednesday.

Abughazaleh had been expected to win the Democratic nomination to succeed Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., 81, who is retiring.

Five other protesters were also indicted with Abughazaleh, including one of her associates and two other political candidates.

The defendants include Andre Martin, described in the indictment as an associate who worked for or with her; Michael Rabbit, a Democratic committee person in Chicago’s 45th Ward; Catherine Sharp, a candidate for the Cook County Board of Commissioners; and Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh, who are listed as Illinois residents.

According to the indictment, a group of individuals surrounded a government vehicle with ""intent to hinder or impede"" operations by ""aggressively"" banging and pushing the car. The protesters allegedly etched derogatory messages including the word ""PIG"" into the car, broke a side mirror and damaged a rear windshield wiper.

The indictment also alleges that Abughazaleh moved to the front of the government vehicle during the confrontation, pressing her hands against the hood and using her body to block its path.

""No one is above the law, and no one has the right to obstruct it,"" Todd Blanche, deputy attorney general, said in a statement Wednesday. ""The Department of Justice will never tolerate such conduct and will continue to hold accountable anyone who seeks to impede lawful federal operations.""

""All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation or threats,"" Andrew S. Boutros, United States attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, added in a statement Wednesday.

""As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder or impede the due administration of Justice.""

Abughazaleh responded to the charges in a post on X Wednesday, claiming she is being targeted for exercising her First Amendment rights.

""This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment,"" Abughazaleh said. ""This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges.""

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge April Perry, who is also presiding over a separate case involving President Donald Trump’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to Chicago. Perry had previously blocked the deployment of troops, saying there was no evidence of a ""danger of rebellion"" in the state after the Trump administration had requested an emergency stay.

Protests at the ICE facility have recently thrust Abughazaleh into the spotlight, including an incident last month when an agent reportedly threw her to the ground, a moment that went viral on social media.

The ""Gen Z influencer"" is a former video producer at the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America, which has developed a large TikTok following.

Reports, photos and videos from several community members show that federal agents were active in multiple locations on Oct. 29 afternoon in Wilmette.

Wilmette Village Manager Michael Braiman, speaking for the Village, said the resident accounts of federal law enforcement activity Wednesday are credible; though, local police did not witness any such activity.

Braiman added that police took calls on Wednesday describing multiple incidents involving federal agents in Wilmette. He could not immediately confirm, though, if agents apprehended any individuals.

Resident Chad Boomgaarden told The Record that he spoke with at least one border patrol agent around 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday in an alley between Park and Prairie avenues near his home. Boomgaarden, who shared photos supporting the encounter, said he inquired about federal jurisdiction on and near private property, among other topics.

He was walking his dog and was not pleased to see men in “face masks, camo, tactical gear and long rifle weapons” just feet from his backyard.

“You know, I’m a pretty chill dad/husband/person,” he wrote to The Record via text message, “but I’ve always had a soft spot and protective instinct for people or animals being bullied … so I have to say I was really pissed off.”

Boomgaarden did not see the agents make any arrests; however, Patrick Hanley, a Winnetka resident and local politician, who followed the agents’ vehicles into the alley reportedly witnessed up to seven armed and masked agents in fatigues detain and drive away with two individuals.

Hanley shared a video taken Wednesday with The Record that shows two vehicles in an alley and at least six uniformed and masked members of law enforcement.

“With no disrespect to sharks, it was like seeing sharks in open water. You know these people are dangerous and don’t know what they are going to do,” said Hanley, the leader of the New Trier Democrats and candidate for Illinois senate.

Hanley and dozens of community members use a group chat to track the local presence and activity of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal officials.

Erinn Martin, of Winnetka, is also in that group chat and said when she saw messages saying ICE agents were in Wilmette, she parked her car near the Wilmette library.

When she saw a possible federal vehicle — as described in the group chat — pass by, she and a handful of other cars driven by community members in that same group chat followed it.

The car stopped at one point and agents got out, she said.

“They open the door and are standing there in tactical gear, like it’s Afghanistan, here in Wilmette,” said Martin, who grew up in Wilmette. “… They are bringing unnecessary trauma and chaos into our neighborhoods.”

Martin said she began blowing a whistle, a growing resistance measure to alert communities of federal agents in the area. She was not alone.

Boomgaarden said six people came to the alley within 30 seconds and were blowing whistles and documenting the agents via photo and video.

Martin and others continued following the alleged federal vehicles out of Wilmette, through Glenview and to the Home Depot in Niles.

Martin said the group chat has a segment they call a rapid response team, of which she is a part, and the team’s goal is to respond to the scene of an ICE sighting and warn community members while also letting the agents know they are unwanted.

“Because this is wrong,” she said. “You can have a conversation about whether immigrants need to be deported, but that’s not what this is about. If you’ve seen footage of them arresting U.S. citizens, breaking windows — there is no responsibility. Nothing is going to stop them except for us. So we have to stop them.”

She added, “There is fear in the air, and everybody should stand up. Nobody should feel that way.”

Wednesday’s incidents come on the heels of an emotional discussion during Wilmette’s Village Board meeting on Tuesday night, Oct. 28, when a large contingent of residents packed board chambers urging Village officials to respond to local ICE activity.

To address the topic, the Village Board directed staffers to prepare possible policy changes the board could approve to “help keep community members safe,” according to a community email sent by the Village on Wednesday.

The board also wants staff to prepare communication material to educate residents and better promote resources available to immigrants in the community.

On July 10, immigration agents executed a search warrant at a cannabis farm in Camarillo. There was a clash with demonstrators, and some threw rocks at agents. Federal officials announced that a number of those people are in custody.

""During the summer we were very clear that anyone who engages in criminal conduct, who assaults our agents or damages government property - we're going to find you, and we're going to arrest you and we're going to charge you,"" acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said at a press conference.

Ten people were arrested. Charges include civil disorder against law enforcement officers.

Authorities are searching for more protesters who allegedly engaged in violence.

AIR7 captured one person who allegedly fired a gun toward federal agents during the Camarillo confrontation. The FBI is offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to a conviction.

""And while the First Amendment protects the freedom of speech and the freedom to peacefully assemble, it does not provide for a right to assault federal officers,"" said Eddy Wang, Homeland Security Investigations Los Angeles special agent in charge.

The announcement comes as a U.S. district judge ruled that Essayli has stayed in the temporary job longer than allowed by law. The decision represents another setback to the Trump administration's effort to extend handpicked acting U.S. attorneys beyond the 120-day limit set by federal law.

Attorney General Pam Bondi now named Essayli first assistant U.S. attorney.

""The question will be, what's the difference between acting as an acting U.S. attorney and a deputy U.S. attorney, and are there things now that he cannot do?

Essayli responded to the ruling during Wednesday's press conference.

""The judge waded through it,"" Essayli said. ""He says whether or not I qualify as the acting, there's no question that I'm the first assistant, which makes me the top federal prosecutor in this office.""

But the troops, a military document indicates, remained at the until early Oct. 5—more than 8 hours after the restraining order was issued.
“This case is about a simple proposition, as this court well knows,” said Caroline Turco for the city of Portland.
Under the relevant federal law, the president can federalize the national guard under certain conditions, including when he could not executive the laws or there was a danger of rebellion.
Franz Schoening, a Commander with Portland Police Bureau was there—he was a team commander during the protests in 2020.","A federal judge has again been forced to consider whether the Trump administration had directly disobeyed her in its response to her Oct. 4 order temporarily blocking the deployment of federalized Oregon National Guard members in the city.

The judge, Karin J. Immergut, first wondered this on Oct. 5 when the administration, in what she said appeared to be in direct contravention of the previous day’s order, mobilized National Guard members from other states to the city, prompting her to issue a broader restraining order.

But the Trump administration admitted Wednesday morning to yet another instance in which it may have disobeyed the judge’s order, several hours after it was first published.

Asked about the matter, a spokesperson for U.S. Northern Command said, “We cannot comment on ongoing litigation.”

On the morning of Saturday Oct. 4, Portlanders were awaiting Immergut’s ruling on whether to issue an emergency block on the deployment of Oregon National Guard members to the city.

Meanwhile, behind the scenes, the federalized guard members were in motion, preparing for the mission. Some were converging on local military bases. And around 11:30 a.m. Oct. 4, according to a military document turned up in subsequent litigation, and reviewed by WW, a small advance group of 9 soldiers had arrived in the U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement facility itself.

By around noon that day, the document says, those troops “assumed their first support mission.”

A few hours later, at 3:40 pm, Immergut would issue a temporary restraining order blocking that mission.

But the troops, a military document indicates, remained at the until early Oct. 5—more than 8 hours after the restraining order was issued.

A government lawyer admitted as much to Immergut Wednesday morning, as a trial got under way to help the judge determine whether to issue a more durable block on the deployment.

The government lawyer explained to the judge that it took time for the feds to issue the information about the temporary restraining order to the people on the ground.

Whether the lingering presence of the troops constituted contempt of court or was in direct violation of her temporary restraining order, Immergut responded, would be discussed later: She had a trial to proceed with.

After opening statements, lawyers for the city and the feds jumped into opening statements.

“This case is about a simple proposition, as this court well knows,” said Caroline Turco for the city of Portland. “This is a nation of constitutional law.” She added that her team was confident that at the end of this case, “the court will find that the city does not need the National Guard and the federal government does not need the National Guard.”

Eric Hamilton offered the rejoinder for the Trump administration. “For months, agitators have used violence and threatened violence against the men and women who serve their country by working for the departments of Homeland Security here in Oregon,” he said. Under the relevant federal law, the president can federalize the national guard under certain conditions, including when he could not executive the laws or there was a danger of rebellion.

Hamilton says both of these things were true. And yet, he added, it is not for the court to determine whether these things were “actually” true; Congress, he argued, left such a judgement to the president.

Instead, Hamilton said, it is for the court to decide whether the president has made a plausible “assessment of the facts and law within a range of honest judgment.”

If the testimony from local law enforcement officers that formed the bulk of the first day at trial was meant to provide the factual basis on which the judge could make that call, the discussion also served as a referendum on the quality of the police work that local and federal officers have been doing during the protests outside the ICE facility in South Portland.

The feds contend that local law enforcement has provided inadequate help, failing to intervene to clear protesters from their driveway, for example—claims they said bolstered the argument that the troops need to come in to do the job.

From the stand though, local law enforcement officer made a consistent case: the protests they have been observing and occasionally intervening in outside the ICE building have been relatively tame and lawful. They also contended that the federal counterparts have not infrequently escalated tensions unnecessarily, at times even deploying munitions in a manner that is disproportionate to the “crime or violence” of the assembled demonstrators.

The testimonies tracked how protests grew intense in June, and then became tamer into late September, when tensions rose again after Trump announced he would call in the troops.

But the relevant history clearly went back farther. Portland’s history of protests and riots following the murder of George Floyd in 2020 shaped the image of a city in the minds of many around the nation—including the president himself.

Franz Schoening, a Commander with Portland Police Bureau was there—he was a team commander during the protests in 2020.

From the stand Wednesday, he was asked how he would compare the protests at ICE from June until today to the downtown unrest then.

“I’d say there is no comparison,” he said. “The level of violence, criminal conduct that we saw in 2020 was markedly different.”",https://www.wweek.com/resizer/v2/7VYCYEQCQJCNVN5HV4GZ7OKT6A.jpg?smart=true&auth=d71b18d03e25f8e55b0b30c6ea6fa1d7695732491e91cc41fb2ec190aabefc42&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-29 22:56:50.327682

The one-page suspension by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came before Greg Bovino’s first late-afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the courthouse in downtown Chicago.

Ellis ordered the meetings Tuesday after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by government agents working Operation Midway Blitz, which has resulted in more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Bovino told Fox News that he was eager to talk to Ellis. But government lawyers were appealing her decision at the same time, calling it “extraordinarily disruptive.”

“The order significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.

Judge troubled by tear gas

Lawyers for news outlets and activists whose lawsuit alleging excessive force by agents in and around Chicago prompted the judge to order the briefings from Bovino have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond in the appeals court.

Ellis’ order followed the use of tear gas in a neighborhood where children gathered for a Halloween parade last weekend on Chicago’s Northwest Side. Neighbors joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” the judge said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

Bovino defended agents’ actions.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino told Fox News. “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Related cases in many courts

Meanwhile prosecutors filed charges against Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate, and five other people over protests at an immigration enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago. The indictment unsealed Wednesday accuses them of illegally blocking an agent’s car on Sept. 26.

READ MORE: Democratic congressional candidate Abughazaleh indicted over ICE protests in Illinois

Abughazaleh called the prosecution an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

President Donald Trump’s administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated that they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration’s emergency appeal to overturn a lower-court ruling blocking the deployments.

In Portland, Oregon, a federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

Judge wants real-time updates

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for daily 5:45 p.m. briefings to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins would prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges and has banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

Lawyers for the government have repeatedly defended the actions of agents, including those from ICE, and told the judge that videos and other portrayals of enforcement actions have been one-sided.

“Every single day within one mile of the house where I was born and raised, 15 to 20 immigrants are snatched up by masked federal agents with no warrants and no due process,” said Tanya Golash-Boza, a professor of sociology at the University of California who studies immigration law enforcement.

“Our neighbors are being attacked. Families are living in terror. Children are losing their parents. And people are scared to leave their houses,” she said. “If we allow it to continue here, in the nation’s capital, what happens next?”

WTOP has reached out to Nadeau’s office about the residents’ concerns. Her office did not comment on the issue.

Residents said D.C. police are arresting undocumented immigrants for minor infractions. Then, minutes later, ICE agents will arrive on the scene to arrest them.

“On the way to grab my morning coffee, about a dozen masked ICE agents were staging in the firehouse parking lot on the corner of 14th and Newton Street,” said D.C. resident Dante O’Hara. “The workers … on the same corner of the firehouse are absolutely terrified. One of their workers told me that she was afraid to walk her daughter to school in fear of being kidnapped in front of her daughter.”

O’Hara called for the city to follow the lead of Chicago, which recently set up “ICE-free zones.” It bans federal immigration agents from using city property and private businesses as staging areas to scope out suspected undocumented immigrants.

Residents are also asking the city for more legal services for immigrants and more data collected during arrests to track which agencies are on the scene.

Nadeau’s committee invited the D.C. Office of Human Rights, which handles cases involving human rights violations, to attend the meeting. She said the office turned down her request to join.

“If actions by our own agencies do not comply with D.C. law and human rights, we need to know and we need to make demands of the executive to put an end to those actions,” Nadeau said.

The 11-page indictment, which was filed on October 23 and unsealed Wednesday, accuses Abughazaleh and the other protesters of using “force, intimidation and threat” as part of a conspiracy to prevent an unnamed ICE agent from “discharging his duties” and to “injure him in his person or property.”

The conspiracy, as the charging document describes it, involves allegations that the protesters “banged aggressively” on a federal agent’s car, “crowded together in the front and side of the Government Vehicle and pushed against the vehicle to hinder and impede its movement,” and “scratched the body of the Government Vehicle, including etching a message into the body of the vehicle, specifically the word ‘PIG.’”

“This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment,” wrote Abughazaleh, in a statement to The Intercept. “This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges.”

The indictment alleges that Abughazaleh, a former journalist and candidate in the Democratic primary for Illinois’s 9th Congressional District, put her hands on the hood of the car and “braced her body and hands against the vehicle while remaining directly in the path of the vehicle.”

The disruption, according to the indictment, forced the federal agent “to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators.”

If convicted, the protesters could face up to six years in prison for the conspiracy charges and eight years in prison for the intimidation charge. Conspiracy charges are a common tool for prosecutors to use against protesters.

Abughazaleh — who went viral earlier this year after video emerged of ICE agents slamming the 26-year-old Democratic candidate to the ground at the same facility — pointed to the irony of the Trump administration accusing protesters of violence.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” she wrote.

The Broadview ICE processing center has been noted for its violent clashes between federal agents and protesters — with ICE agents deploying aggressive tactics at demonstrators — including an infamous incident where agents shot a pastor in the back of the head with a pepper ball.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to The Intercept’s request for comment.

U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order against federal agents in the Chicago area earlier this month, requiring them to wear a body camera and give at least two advanced warnings before deploying tear gas.

Abughazaleh, who is running in a crowded field to replace Rep.

To federalize the Illinois Guard members, Trump invoked 10 U.S.C.
Barrett asked the full court to consider whether the term “regular forces” in the statute refers to the regular forces of the U.S. military — such as members of the Army, Navy and Air Force.
If the Supreme Court agrees with Lederman that “regular forces” refers to the U.S. military, it could upset almost all of Trump’s domestic military deployments so far.
With exception to Los Angeles, Trump hasn’t sent regular military forces to any city in which he’s attempted to deploy National Guard troops.","A district court block to President Donald Trump’s attempted military deployment in Chicago will stand for at least the next few weeks as the Supreme Court takes up a key question over the president’s ability to federalize the state National Guard.

In response to Trump’s emergency appeal of the lower court block, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett Wednesday referred a question to the full court on the language of the statute the president invoked in calling up to 300 members of the Illinois Guard into federal service for deployment in Chicago earlier this month.

To federalize the Illinois Guard members, Trump invoked 10 U.S.C. 12406 (Title 10), an archaic and rarely used statute that allows the president to federalize state Guard troops when the country faces foreign invasion, when the U.S. government faces rebellion or when the president is unable to execute laws with “regular forces.”

In addition to the Illinois Guard, Trump also attempted to send federalized members of the Texas Guard to Chicago.

Barrett asked the full court to consider whether the term “regular forces” in the statute refers to the regular forces of the U.S. military — such as members of the Army, Navy and Air Force.

Barrett’s referral of the question was unexpected, as the states and cities challenging Trump’s domestic military deployments, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) attorneys defending them, generally haven’t broached whether the normal armed forces should be considered part of the “regular forces” referred to in the statute.

Parties involved in the lawsuits, including the Trump administration, have instead largely interpreted that to refer to federal law enforcement personnel executing federal law, such as the FBI or Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) agents.

The question appears to stem from an amicus brief filed to the Supreme Court by Martin Lederman, a former DOJ deputy assistant attorney general who’s now a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center.

Rather than referring to federal law enforcement, “regular forces” instead must refer to members of the formal armed forces within the Department of Defense, Lederman argued in the brief.

Lederman noted that throughout U.S. history, and specific legal history of 10 U.S.C. 12406, “regular” was often used as a shorthand for the Army — “the regulars” — as opposed to the state militias that evolved into today’s National Guard.

“It is highly uncommon, however, to refer to such civilian officials and employees as any kind of ‘forces’ at all; and they certainly are not ‘the regular forces’ to which [Title 10] refers,” Lederman wrote.

Because Trump never sent members of the armed forces to assist ICE in Chicago, Trump could not determine that he was unable to execute federal law with “regular forces” as required by Title 10 and therefore lacked the authority to federalize members of the Illinois Guard, Lederman asserted.

However, he stopped short of arguing that the president has the authority to execute federal law with members of the armed forces. That’s an authority regulated by several other laws — most prominently the statutes that make up the Insurrection Act, one of the president’s most expansive emergency powers.

“Amicus does not mean to suggest that this Court should opine on the scope of the President’s powers to use the military pursuant to the Insurrection Act,” Lederman wrote.

If the Supreme Court agrees with Lederman that “regular forces” refers to the U.S. military, it could upset almost all of Trump’s domestic military deployments so far. With exception to Los Angeles, Trump hasn’t sent regular military forces to any city in which he’s attempted to deploy National Guard troops.

When he sent troops to Los Angeles earlier this year, Trump simultaneously deployed hundreds of the Marines and federalized members of the California Guard.

U.S. Department of Justice attorney Jean Lin on Wednesday admitted to Judge Karin Immergut that Oregon National Guard troops were briefly sent to Portland despite Immergut’s order blocking such a deployment.

The revelation came shortly before the opening of Oregon’s three-day trial against President Donald Trump and the federal government over Trump’s attempts to deploy troops to federal property in the city.

Before opening arguments, Immergut asked Lin whether her order had been defied. Lin told Immergut that between 11 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 4 and 2 a.m. Sunday Oct. 5, about six hours after Immergut issued the first of two temporary restraining orders blocking Guard deployment, members of the Oregon National Guard were sent to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland where protests were ongoing.

Lin did not share how many guard troops were sent or who ordered them.

“We’ll discuss later whether that’s contempt and a direct violation of my TRO,” Immergut told Lin.

In their lawsuit, lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland allege Trump, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, as well as the agencies Noem and Hegseth lead, violated several laws and the 10th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution by attempting to deploy Guard troops to Portland over the objections of state and local elected leaders.

Each of these issues deals with the balance of state and federal power — particularly related to authority over policing within states — and the extent of presidential power over the U.S. military.

The state of California is also a party to the lawsuit, and lawyers for California asked Immergut that she determine in her final order that the roughly 200 California Guard that have been federalized and sent to Oregon, but blocked from deployment, be sent home. Those troops are waiting at Camp Withycombe in Happy Valley.

Trump federalized and attempted to deploy National Guard Oregon, then California, then Texas National Guard troops to protect the Portland ICE facility in late September claiming in a social media post that the city was “war ravaged” and that they were needed to protect federal property from protestors.

Second federal admission

The potential violation of Immergut’s court order is the second misstep federal lawyers have admitted to in recent days.

Late last week, the state of Oregon asked a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to throw out a decision they made granting Trump the power to deploy Guard to Portland because they found testimony submitted by federal lawyers painting a picture of law enforcement woes at the ICE facility were inaccurate.

Federal lawyers had previously told the 9th Circuit judges that a “surge” of 115 Federal Protective Service officers were sent to work 24/7 since June to protect the Portland ICE facility from what Trump administration officials have tried to characterize as chaos and violence by protestors at the building.

But data that Oregon’s lawyers received as part of requests for evidence showed that no more than 31 federal police were present at the facility during any one-month period since June, and that during the three weeks around Trump’s orders to federalize National Guard troops, a low of 20 federal police officers were at the Portland ICE facility.

The charges are contained in an 11-page federal indictment made public Wednesday accusing the group of conspiring to “interrupt, hinder, and impede” the agent from the “discharge of his official duties” on the morning of Sept. 26. The confrontation marked the height of protests outside the ICE processing facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview in the weeks after the Trump administration launched “Operation Midway Blitz,” a still-ongoing immigration enforcement campaign that has so far resulted in the arrests of more than 3,000 people.

Others charged include Cook County Board candidate Catherine “Cat” Sharp, 45th Ward Democratic Committeeman Michael Rabbitt, and Oak Park Village Board Trustee Brian Straw, all Democrats. They are set for arraignment next week.

During the episode, Abughazaleh and the other defendants — along with roughly two dozen others — surrounded a government vehicle the agent was attempting to drive inside the ICE facility’s perimeter and “banged aggressively” on its hood and windows. The vehicle’s side mirror and windshield wiper were broken during the confrontation, and the word “PIG” was etched into its side, according to the indictment.

Video of the incident, posted to the social media accounts Abughazaleh developed as a progressive activist and conservative media critic before launching her congressional campaign, shows the candidate in front of the vehicle as the agent drove slowly through the crowd.

In addition to the felony conspiracy charge, Abughazaleh and her co-defendants are each charged with misdemeanor simple assault of a federal officer, which does not require physical contact.

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge April Perry, who has blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Chicago, which the White House claims is necessary due to “violent” protests. But Perry said the feds’ narrative of the protests has been “unreliable.”

Responding to the unsealed indictment Wednesday, Abughazaleh called it “a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent” by “weaponizing the federal justice system.”

“As I and others have exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls and tear gassed hundreds protesters, simply because we had the gall to say that masked men coming into our communities, abducting our neighbors and terrorizing us cannot be our new normal,” she said in a video posted to social media.

A federal judge earlier this month issued a temporary restraining order restricting agents’ use of riot control weapons like tear gas after protesters, journalists and clergy filed a lawsuit over the deployment of tear gas, pepper balls and other crowd-control tactics outside the Broadview facility.

But even as protests outside the ICE facility have calmed, clashes between U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agents and civilians in Chicago neighborhoods have resulted in multiple deployments of tear gas in the last week. To account for the alleged violations of her order, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis summoned Border Patrol Commander Greg Bovino into her courtroom Tuesday and ordered him to report for daily check-ins for the next week. But the U.S. 7th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday stayed the order requiring Bovino to appear daily.

Abughazaleh isn’t the only congressional candidate who’s had a run-in with immigration agents since Operation Midway Blitz began. Earlier this month, state Rep. Hoan Huynh, D-Chicago, who is also running for the 9th District, said a Border Patrol agent pointed a gun at him while he warned residents of Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood of immigration enforcement activity nearby. Yet another 9th District candidate, Evanston Mayor Dan Biss, was tear gassed while protesting in Broadview last month. In a statement Wednesday, Biss called the charges against his opponent “frivolous” and said they should be “dropped immediately.”

Straw, the charged Oak Park trustee, said the Trump administration made a “decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies.” Through his attorney, he said he would “fight these baseless charges.”

State Rep. Lisa Hernandez, chair of the Democratic Party of Illinois, said the indictment was representative of “a hypocritical, tear-gas-loving Administration run on violence, political punishment and suffocating the First Amendment.”

“In this country, protesters are allowed to tell their government, ‘No, we will not stand by and just watch while you disappear our neighbors,'” she said.

“This political prosecution is an attack on all of our First Amendment rights,” Abughazaleh, a progressive influencer and journalist, said in the post. “I’m not backing down, and we’re going to win.”

Currently, Abughazelah is running for an open seat representing Illinois’s ninth congressional district, to the north of Chicago. She is slated to appear on the Democratic primary ballot in March.

Federal prosecutors, however, have accused her and her co-defendants of having “physically hindered and impeded” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers at a detention facility in Broadview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

The indictment said they surrounded a government vehicle, “banged aggressively”, stopped the agent from driving forward, and etched “PIG” on the body of the vehicle. It further alleged that the group broke the vehicle’s side mirrors and a windshield wiper.

Abughazaleh was charged with “conspiracy to impede or injure an officer” and “assaulting, resisting or impeding” a federal agent for the September 23 incident.

Those charged alongside Abughazelah include Michael Rabbitt, a Democratic politician in Chicago’s 45th Ward, and Catherine Sharp, a Democrat running for a seat on the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

The charges come as the administration of President Donald Trump surges federal agents to Democrat-run cities as part of a large-scale deportation drive.

Several Democratic lawmakers have been charged after participating in counterprotests, including Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, New Jersey, and US Representative LaMonica McIver. Baraka has since seen the charges against him dropped.

Trump has also sought to deploy the National Guard to several cities, including Chicago, but has been repeatedly blocked by the courts. The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling in the Chicago case, which could have wide-ranging implications for the future of such deployments.

A federal appeals court was also set to hear a Trump administration challenge on Wednesday to a lower court’s ruling barring the National Guard deployment to Portland, Oregon.

As part of those cases, the Trump administration has faced scrutiny over its treatment of immigrants and protesters alike.

The administration has also been criticised for comparing protesters to “terrorists” and pursuing disproportionate charges in court.

Even Abughazelah’s opponent in the 2026 Democratic primary, Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, was among those condemning Wednesday’s indictment.

“The only people engaged in violent and dangerous behavior at Broadview have been ICE,” Biss said in a statement carried by the local news site Evanston Now.

Biss noted he had also protested the “kidnapping of our neighbours” at the facility multiple times.

“Now, the Trump Administration is targeting protestors, including political candidates, in an effort to silence dissent and scare residents into submission,” Biss said. “It won’t work.”",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/afp_690277c13c3e-1761769409.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-10-29 19:02:03.900332

Ellis' order for Bovino to appear in person came after she questioned the Border Patrol Chief for more than an hour Tuesday.
Attorneys representing the Trump administration asked Ellis to stay her requests in open court on Tuesday.
The appeals court has also asked that attorneys representing the protesters, clergy and journalists to weigh in by 5 p.m. Thursday.
In an interview with the Telemundo network last Thursday, Bovino said this when asked about Ellis' order:""Did Judge Ellis get hit in the head with a rock like i did this morning?","In a late afternoon call-and-response, a federal appeals court has placed a temporary pause on a federal judge's order that required Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino to appear in court every day before her.

This afternoon, attorneys representing the Trump administration appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals for a stay on federal judge Sara Ellis' Tuesday order which - in part - required Bovino to show up in federal court every day at 5:45 p.m. to discuss use-of-force related encounters with protesters or bystanders who object to the increased immigration enforcement operations in Chicago and surrounding suburbs.

Ellis' order for Bovino to appear in person came after she questioned the Border Patrol Chief for more than an hour Tuesday.

Ellis had previously issued a temporary restraining order back on October 9 barring federal immigration agents from using crowd control agents like tear gas or pepper spray on protesters unless there is a threat.

Her TRO came in response to a lawsuit brought by a group of protesters, clergy and journalists who sued the Trump administration alleging that the use of chemical irritants on them have been unnecessary and violated their constitutional rights to gather.

On Tuesday, Ellis ordered that Bovino appear in person after raising concerns about a number of incidents in which protesters, bystanders or their attorneys have alleged that they were tear gassed unnecessarily - and in violation of Ellis' TRO.

The judge has also asked for all use of force reports since ""Operation Midway Blitz"" began in early September and the accompanying body camera footage by the end of business Friday. Bovino will be required to wear a body camera as well.

Attorneys representing the Trump administration asked Ellis to stay her requests in open court on Tuesday.

She denied their requests.

In their appeal to the Seventh Circuit on Wednesday afternoon, attorneys representing the Trump administration wrote that Ellis' order:

...significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis. The court’s order is also untethered to the plaintiffs’ underlying claims and goes substantially beyond what is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the court’s prior orders.""

And later that:

""... Absent a stay, the government will be irreparably harmed because Chief Bovino will be required to prepare and sit for questioning in open court today and every weekday thereafter, with no stated endpoint in sight. Every occasion that Chief Bovino is required to prepare and appear for those daily court sessions is time that he would otherwise spend carrying out the important law-enforcement functions he has been assigned...""

In their ruling late Wednesday afternoon, the appeals court temporarily stayed Ellis' order that Bovino have to appear daily in court - for now - writing:

""IT IS ORDERED that the government’s request for an administrative stay is GRANTED. Pending a decision on the petition for a writ of mandamus, the district court’s October 28, 2025 order is temporarily STAYED only to the extent it required Gregory Bovino to appear in court, in person, each weekday at 5:45 PM.""

The appeals court has also asked that attorneys representing the protesters, clergy and journalists to weigh in by 5 p.m. Thursday.

NBC 5 Chicago has reached out to Department of Justice attorneys asking for clarity on Wednesday's ruling.

It comes as a deposition for Bovino is set for Thursday - ahead of a preliminary junction hearing set for November 5th where attorneys representing the protesters are trying to prohibit further use of chemical agents.

Top deputy officials with Border Patrol and ICE testified last week that the use of chemical agents in at least two cases were justified because protesters either blocked the path of agents trying to leave during an immigration arrest or threw objects at agents.

Bovino himself has been accused by the plaintiffs' attorneys of violating Ellis' temporary restraining order by using tear gas on a crowd that gathered last Thursday in Little Village where agents were conducting more arrests.

Bovino and the Department of Homeland Security said the use of tear gas was necessary because Bovino had been hit in the head by an object. Bovino said it was a rock.

In an interview with the Telemundo network last Thursday, Bovino said this when asked about Ellis' order:""Did Judge Ellis get hit in the head with a rock like i did this morning? I had to apply gas this morning against people. Was she hit in the head with a rock? Maybe she needs to see what that's like before issuing an order like that,"" Bovino said. The Telemundo reporter followed up: ""But have you followed her orders?""

Bovino replied: ""We have always followed orders...""",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/IMG_5384.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-29 19:57:44.984891

Some Illinois Democrats accused the Justice Department of singling out President Trump’s political opponents for prosecution with the indictment, which was unsealed on Wednesday. The top federal prosecutor in Chicago defended the charges as upholding the rule of law.

For nearly two months, federal agents have flooded the Chicago area as part of the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration, making more than 3,000 arrests and clashing repeatedly with protesters and residents.

The charges unsealed on Wednesday related to a Sept. 26 protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the suburb of Broadview, Ill. Demonstrators have gathered repeatedly at the Broadview site, sometimes blocking access to the driveway and engaging in physical confrontations with federal agents. Those agents have at times used tear gas, pepper balls and physical force against protesters.

The charging document asserts that the defendants were part of a larger group that tried to block a federal agent from driving to the ICE facility that morning. The indictment said members of the group banged on the vehicle, stood in front of it, pushed against it and damaged a side mirror and a windshield wiper. Someone in the group etched the word “PIG” into the vehicle, the charging document said.

All six defendants were charged with interfering with a federal agent and conspiring with one another to interfere with an agent. Both charges can carry multiyear prison sentences.

“All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation or threats,” said Andrew S. Boutros, the U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, in a statement. “As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder or impede the due administration of Justice.”

Those indicted included Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic candidate for Congress; Brian Straw, an Oak Park, Ill., village trustee; and Cat Sharp, a candidate for the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Ms. Abughazaleh, who is running for an open seat in Illinois’s solidly Democratic Ninth Congressional District, said in a video posted online that “this is a political prosecution and a gross attempt to silence dissent.” That seat, which includes part of the North Side of Chicago and several suburbs, is now held by Representative Jan Schakowsky, a Democrat who is not seeking another term.

Ms. Sharp said in a statement that “I am confident that a jury of my peers will see these charges for exactly what they are — another effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Mr. Straw said in a statement that “the Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office.” He added that “I will fight these baseless charges, and I will continue to stand with and protect our immigrant neighbors.”

The unsealing of the indictment in Illinois came on the same day that federal prosecutors in California announced the arrests of 10 people accused of breaking the law during protests of immigration enforcement in that state. The officials said that an 11th defendant was in state custody and was expected to be transferred to the federal authorities, while they declared a 12th person a fugitive.

Nine of the defendants in California were accused of obstructing, impeding and interfering with law enforcement during a large demonstration in downtown Los Angeles on June 8. The protest, which grew chaotic at times, occurred the day after President Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard troops to Southern California.

In Illinois, the tactics of federal officers have come under repeated scrutiny in recent weeks as agents have been filmed using tear gas on protesters and bystanders while making arrests. Federal officials have said force has been used appropriately after agents have come under direct threats. A federal judge, Sara L. Ellis, placed restrictions on agents’ actions after a lawsuit accused them of indiscriminately deploying tear gas and using force.

During a hearing this week, Judge Ellis, an Obama appointee, voiced concern that agents had not always followed her restrictions. She ordered a senior Border Patrol official, Gregory Bovino, to appear in her courtroom each weeknight to discuss that day’s enforcement activities. Mr. Bovino had been expected to make his first such trip to court on Wednesday evening, but a federal appellate court temporarily blocked that requirement shortly before the hearing was set to begin.

The court intervened on Wednesday before Greg Bovino’s first late afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis.

Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening.

Foreign nationals who may be eligible to renew their EADs under premium processing, may wish to do so.

Such foreign nationals will need a formal approval of their renewal application and receipt of a new physical EAD.

Under the automatic extension practice, foreign nationals who had timely filed an application to renew their EAD in certain categories would receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization validity anywhere between 180 days through 540 days from the expiration date of their current EAD, while their renewal application are pending.

DHS states that ending this practice will better allow the “proper screening and vetting” of foreign nationals, as well as fraud detection.

Under the new interim final rule, as of Oct. 30, 2025, foreign nationals who file to renew their EAD will no longer receive an automatic extension of their employment authorization. Rather, they would need to wait for a formal approval of their renewal application and receipt of a new physical EAD to extend their employment authorization.

DHS has identified limited exceptions to the interim final rule, including extensions provided by law or through a Federal Register notice for Temporary Protected Status-related employment documentation. Further, DHS has confirmed that the interim final rule does not affect EADs automatically extended prior to Oct. 30, 2025.

In light of these changes, USCIS advises that foreign nationals should apply to renew their EADs as soon as possible, up to 180 days before their current EAD expires. Foreign nationals who may be eligible to renew their EADs under premium processing, may wish to do so. These actions can help minimize any potential lapse in their employment authorization.

However, due to the unpredictable fluctuations in EAD processing times and the limited availability of premium processing or expedited review in most employment authorization categories, temporary lapses in employment authorization may occur, even for foreign nationals who file an EAD renewal application at the earliest possible instance.

The one-page suspension by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals came before Greg Bovino’s first late-afternoon meeting with U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis at the courthouse in downtown Chicago.

Ellis ordered the meetings Tuesday after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by government agents working Operation Midway Blitz, which has resulted in more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Bovino told Fox News that he was eager to talk to Ellis. But government lawyers were appealing her decision at the same time, calling it “extraordinarily disruptive.”

“The order significantly interferes with the quintessentially executive function of ensuring the Nation’s immigration laws are properly enforced by waylaying a senior executive official critical to that mission on a daily basis,” the Justice Department argued.

“We are thrilled this act of judicial overreach has been paused,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Attorneys still met with Ellis in the evening to discuss logistics in the evidence-gathering phase of the case. They agreed to a 9 p.m. deadline to submit body camera recordings of federal agents using tear gas on people in the predominantly Mexican American neighborhood of Little Village last week.

Judge troubled by tear gas

Lawyers for news outlets and activists whose lawsuit alleging excessive force by agents in and around Chicago prompted the judge to order the briefings from Bovino have until 5 p.m. Thursday to respond in the appeals court.

Ellis’ order followed the use of tear gas in a neighborhood where children gathered for a Halloween parade last weekend on Chicago’s Northwest Side. Neighbors joined in the street as someone was arrested.

“Halloween is on Friday,” the judge said Tuesday. “I do not want to get violation reports from the plaintiffs that show that agents are out and about on Halloween, where kids are present and tear gas is being deployed.”

Bovino defended agents’ actions.

“If she wants to meet with me every day, then she’s going to see, she’s going to have a very good firsthand look at just how bad things really are on the streets of Chicago,” Bovino told Fox News. “I look forward to meeting with that judge to show her exactly what’s happening and the extreme amount of violence perpetrated against law enforcement here.”

Related cases in many courts

Meanwhile prosecutors filed charges against Kat Abughazaleh, a Democratic congressional candidate, and five other people over protests at an immigration enforcement building in Broadview, outside Chicago. The indictment unsealed Wednesday accuses them of illegally blocking an agent’s car on Sept. 26.

Abughazaleh called the prosecution an “attempt to silence dissent.”

The Chicago court actions came as groups and officials across the country have filed lawsuits aimed at restricting federal deployments of National Guard troops.

President Donald Trump’s administration will remain blocked from deploying troops in the Chicago area until at least the latter half of November, following a U.S. Supreme Court order Wednesday calling on the parties to file additional legal briefs.

The justices indicated that they would not act before Nov. 17 on the administration’s emergency appeal to overturn a lower-court ruling blocking the deployments.

In Portland, Oregon, a federal trial seeking to block a troop deployment got underway Wednesday morning with a police commander describing on the witness stand how federal agents at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building repeatedly fired tear gas at nonviolent protesters.

Judge wants real-time updates

In Chicago, Bovino, who is chief of the Border Patrol sector in El Centro, California, was to sit for daily 5:45 p.m. briefings to report how his agents are enforcing the law and whether they are staying within constitutional bounds, Ellis said. The check-ins were to take place until a Nov. 5 hearing.

Ellis also demanded that Bovino produce all use-of-force reports since Sept. 2 from agents involved in Operation Midway Blitz.

The judge expressed confidence Tuesday that the check-ins would prevent excessive use of force in Chicago neighborhoods.

Ellis previously ordered agents to wear badges and has banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists. She subsequently required body cameras after the use of tear gas raised concerns that agents were not following her initial order.

Ellis set a Friday deadline for Bovino to get a camera and to complete training.

Lawyers for the government have repeatedly defended the actions of agents, including those from ICE, and told the judge that videos and other portrayals of enforcement actions have been one-sided.

That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.","Border Patrol agents have carried out more arrests in the Chicago area than their counterparts at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, illustrating the expanded role they are playing far away from U.S. borders under the Trump administration, internal federal government data obtained by CBS News indicates.

This week, arrests by Customs and Border Protection in the Chicago-area ""Midway Blitz"" operation surpassed those recorded by ICE, the agency that is, on paper, responsible for enforcing federal immigration laws in the interior of the country.

Since Sept. 16, agents at CBP have recorded roughly 1,500 arrests in the Chicago region, compared to over 1,400 arrests carried out by ICE officers, according to the internal Department of Homeland Security figures. In mid-October, ICE's arrest tally in the Chicago operation was higher, totaling around 1,000, compared to roughly 800 arrests recorded by CBP at the time.

The government figures underscore the unprecedented way the second Trump administration has used Border Patrol agents, whose work has been historically limited to intercepting the illicit movement of people and drugs along the borders with Canada and Mexico, as well as some coastal sectors.

As part of its nationwide mass deportation campaign, the Trump administration has dispatched teams of green-uniformed Border Patrol agents across the country, instructing them to arrest suspected unauthorized immigrants in major Democratic-led cities.

That effort has been spearheaded by Gregory Bovino, an outspoken Border Patrol sector chief who has personally led arrest operations, first in Los Angeles and Sacramento over the summer, and most recently in Chicago. He has gained infamy among critics who denounce his agents' tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate, as well as support among those who view him as an effective, no-nonsense enforcer of President Trump's aggressive clampdown on illegal immigration.

Over the summer, sweeping ""roving patrols"" by Border Patrol agents in the Los Angeles area targeted day laborers at Home Depot parking lots and worksites like car washes, triggering widespread local backlash, including accusations of racial profiling that federal officials have strongly denied.

Nearly identical scenes have played out in the Chicago area in recent weeks, where the Border Patrol teams led by Bovino have conducted similarly aggressive operations, prompting protests and confrontations with local residents and activists. Videos posted on social media have depicted cases of Border Patrol agents chasing individuals in densely populated areas or being confronted by angry residents. Bovino has joined agents on some of those Chicago-area operations, as well as outside an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, where protesters have gathered for weeks.

On Tuesday, Bovino was summoned before a federal judge in Chicago who has ordered his agents to limit their use of force against protesters and to generally give them two warnings before deploying chemical agents. The judge told Bovino to ensure his agents comply with the order, citing several cases of them deploying tear gas, including one incident she said affected children getting ready for a Halloween parade.

Federal officials have said they've deployed tear gas in volatile situations and to protect agents. In an interview with CBS News earlier this month, Bovino said, ""the use of force that I've seen has been exemplary — the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission.""

Border Patrol's actions have caused tensions inside DHS, where some ICE leaders feel their counterparts' operations have become too aggressive and controversial, undermining public support for Mr. Trump's mass deportation pledge, two U.S. officials told CBS News, requesting anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters.

Though anyone found to be in the U.S. illegally is eligible to be arrested under the Trump administration, routine ICE operations are typically targeted in nature, informed by previous intelligence gathering and surveillance and aimed at arresting people in the country unlawfully who also have criminal records. ICE officials have privately argued the focus should be on arresting those with criminal records, not undertaking more indiscriminate and visible sweeps in locations like Home Depot parking lots, sources familiar with the internal deliberations told CBS News.

But in a sign that top Trump administration officials think Border Patrol's aggressive style can help boost deportation levels, CBS News reported earlier this week that officials made plans to reassign roughly half of ICE's 25 field office directors and, in many cases, replace them with CBP officials.

DHS, which oversees both ICE and CBP, said in a statement to CBS News Wednesday the department ""is one team and we have one fight, to secure the homeland.""

""DHS has arrested more than 3,000 illegal aliens, including rapists, murderers, and gang members, as part of DHS's Operation Midway Blitz,"" the department added.

The vast majority of CBP personnel deployed to Chicago are Border Patrol agents, though some officers from its Office of Field Operations branch are also there. As federal immigration officers, Border Patrol agents, like ICE officers, have the authority to stop people they suspect are in the U.S. illegally anywhere in the country, though they have heightened search and seizure powers near border areas.

Matt Hudak, who started at the Border Patrol in the late 1990s until retiring as deputy chief in 2023, said the way the Trump administration has deployed Border Patrol agents to U.S. cities is ""unique,"" though he emphasized their nationwide immigration authorities.

Hudak said the administration is increasingly turning to Border Patrol for interior immigration enforcement because the agency has roughly 20,000 agents — significantly more than ICE's team of fewer than 6,000 deportation officers. Border Patrol is also no longer facing a crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border, where government figures show illegal crossings have plummeted to a 55-year low after soaring to record highs under the Biden administration.

But Hudak said Border Patrol agents can also operate in a ""faster-paced"" and more ""forward-leaning"" way compared to ICE officers, whose approach to arrests is ""methodical"" and slower. That distinction, he said, could give them an edge in an administration heavily invested in increasing the number of immigration arrests and deportations.

""It's just like a baseball game, right?"" Hudak said. ""If you're not getting the scoring, the game's not going the way you want, you look at another head coach, or you change pitchers during the game to get that different result.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/29/04af6a81-60bf-4832-89c0-3028d375f127/thumbnail/1200x630/ed57edd01f68d208127a77669b7eac84/gettyimages-2243444780.jpg,N,,2025-10-29 21:00:46.002942

Key Takeaways:

No Automatic Extensions Starting October 30, 2025: Previously, as long as renewal applications were filed timely before the EAD’s expiration date, applicants were eligible for an automatic extension until their renewal was approved. Under the new rule, individuals filing renewal applications on or after October 30, 2025, will not receive this automatic extension.

Limited Exceptions: Certain extensions, such as those mandated by law or through specific Federal Register notices (e.g., for TPS), remain unaffected.

Prior EADs Are Not Affected: The rule does not impact EADs that were automatically extended before October 30, 2025.

USCIS recommends individuals seek a timely renewal of their EAD by properly filing a renewal application up to 180 days before their EAD expires.

The Trump administration has seen historic lows for illegal border crossings, and roughly 60,000 migrants are currently in ICE detention, a major increase since the president took office.
“That is the fundamental challenge,” said a person close to the Trump administration, also granted anonymity to speak candidly.
But there is significant friction among the Trump administration’s top immigration officials.
“Border Patrol, as a general matter, is more equipped and better skilled at playing the political game,” said the administration official.","“Border Patrol just wants to go out and arrest every person in the world, and it’s easy for them to do that because they go out and arrest them and they turn them over to ICE,” said an administration official, granted anonymity to speak candidly. “You’re giving ICE all of these cases that aren’t ready to be removed. And that creates a challenge for ICE.”

The dynamic highlights a tension at the center of the president’s second term immigration agenda. Trump officials are eager to ramp up arrests and removals, but continually run up against resource and operational challenges amid an overloaded deportation system.

The Trump administration has seen historic lows for illegal border crossings, and roughly 60,000 migrants are currently in ICE detention, a major increase since the president took office. The number of daily arrests peaked at more than 2,000 but typically hover around 1,000 — far less than the 3,000-a-day target floated earlier this year by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. But even Trump allies continue to question the administration’s deportation figures — citing limited data transparency — and say removals can’t keep up with the pace of arrests, a problem that’s bound to expand.

“That is the fundamental challenge,” said a person close to the Trump administration, also granted anonymity to speak candidly. “The real backlog is with the removal process.”

The GOP megabill, signed by Trump in July, provided DHS with billions of dollars in fresh funding to bolster ICE’s ranks and expand detention capacity, but the build-out process has been slow and ICE has struggled with its hiring. The money has helped, but it hasn’t yet been able to square the mismatch between the White House’s large appetite for better numbers and ICE’s expanding but still limited capabilities.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration’s progress and said the president’s “entire team is working in lockstep to implement the president’s policy agenda.”

“The tremendous results from securing the border to deporting criminal illegal aliens speak for themselves,” she said.

But there is significant friction among the Trump administration’s top immigration officials. Even as they share the same goal, they differ on the best way to accomplish the president’s promises to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, said the administration official and others close to the administration.

Border czar Tom Homan and acting ICE director Todd Lyons, two career immigration enforcement officials, are more cognizant of the agency’s limitations as it expands and are focused on apprehending criminals and immigrants who already have a final order of removal from an immigration judge and can be deported quickly, said an administration official and the two people close to the administration.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and Corey Lewandowski, a chief adviser to Noem and a special governmental employee, want to ramp up numbers and are eager to use aggressive tactics to arrest all unauthorized immigrants, the people said.

“It seems to me that [Lewandowski’s] thinking in political terms, whereas, Tom and Todd, I know they’re thinking in operational terms — the operational benefits to doing this, and public safety benefits and safety of ICE officers,” said the person close to the administration. “They didn’t get where they are without understanding the political aspect of it, but that’s not their primary concern.”

DHS did not specifically respond to the notion that there are differing opinions inside the administration, but DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, responding to reports of internal tensions, said it’s “one team, one fight,” led by Noem. In a separate statement to POLITICO, she said the administration is working at “turbospeed on cost-effective and innovative ways” to deliver on mass deportations, citing the megabill that provided DHS funding to hire more ICE officers and expand detention capacity.

“The Trump Administration is on pace to shatter historic records and deport nearly 600,000 illegal aliens by the end of President Donald Trump’s first year since returning to office,” she said. “More than 2 million illegal aliens have left the U.S. including 1.6 million who have voluntarily self-deported and over 527,000 deportations.”

The administration’s latest shift is connected to Greg Bovino, the Border Patrol commander who has led a series of aggressive raids across Chicago and its suburbs, said the official and one of the people close to the administration. Noem and her inner circle are impressed with Bovino’s approach. He has emerged as the key face of the Trump administration’s immigration blitz in sanctuary cities and was ordered by a federal judge this week to report to her daily after reports of combative enforcement in Chicago, including the use of tear gas.

“Border Patrol, as a general matter, is more equipped and better skilled at playing the political game,” said the administration official. “This very much shows how Border Patrol can get in front of DHS leadership and get them to do things that benefit the Border Patrol.”

The efforts build on the Trump administration’s expanded use of CBP agents and Border Patrol officers, as well as law enforcement officials from across the federal government to support ICE’s operations in recent months. Border Patrol, in particular, is a more aggressive agency, and its expanded role will help the administration stoke fear in its targeting of blue cities, said Deborah Fleischaker, who served as ICE chief of staff under the Biden administration.

“Border Patrol and ICE have different missions, and this appears to be part of the effort of trying to import the Border Patrol mission, which is much more militarized, much less constrained and a little more Wild West, and bring that into an agency that historically has been very focused on identifying and enforcing against specific targets,” she said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F48%2Ff4%2Fafca33bb486984a92381bf1e7af5%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2235818079,N,,2025-10-29 17:57:21.626713

Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela told commissioners during a 10-minute meeting Wednesday in Estancia that the ongoing government shutdown might be behind the delay, and said it’s unclear what will happen if the county does not receive a contract extension by Saturday.

Immigrant advocates: NM ICE detention ban should have been on special session agenda

In recent years, Torrance County and ICE have renewed the contract with repeated months-long contract extensions, most recently with a six-month extension enacted in April that expires Friday.

While ICE has not yet provided a new contract, “There have been some discussions back and forth,” Barela told commissioners Wednesday. “It’s my understanding that they are currently working on a 30-day contract amendment. I don’t know to what degree that the government shutdown has any implications with that.”

The commission approved delegating authority to Barela to approve an extension if he receives an amended contract from ICE in the next two days.

If ICE takes until Nov. 1 or later to provide an amended contract, Barela will have to take the matter back to the commission. In the meantime, “I imagine if there’s a lapse in the contract term, that revenue would not be coming into the county and could not be distributed to Core Civic [which operates the jail] for providing the services,” he said.

The brief meeting did not allow for public comment, though about a dozen members of immigration advocacy groups tuned in to the livestream, including some whose profile pictures were quotes from current or former Torrance County ICE detainees alleging mistreatment.

NM advisers to US Civil Rights Commission call for closure of ICE detention facilities

The groups have cited poor conditions at Torrance, including whistleblower accounts from former jail staff and violations from the Office of the Inspector General. They are calling on the commission to cease its contract, and also on state lawmakers to pass legislation that would ban local governments from contracting with ICE.

Commissioners have pointed to the jobs that could be lost in the rural county without the funding from ICE to house detainees. Barela recently testified before a local Civil Rights commission that the detention center employs approximately 93 Torrance County residents, paying them “millions of dollars a year” in salaries and benefits in an “economically depressed area with few substitute sectors of the economy.”

Shortly before Wednesday’s vote, Torrance County Commissioner Linda Jaramillo asked Barela whether detainees would still receive services if the contract lapses.

“I have had discussions with the facility,” he said. “I can’t definitively speak for them, though they do think that for at least a period of time, the services will continue.”

Barela’s answer did not satisfy Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, one of the groups seeking to cancel the contract. He maintains ICE detainees don’t receive the services they need now, even while the contract is in effect.

“We appreciate her concern about people still getting the services,” he said. “But we would also like to remind the commissioner and the public of the ongoing failures of service provision, both from a due process and a human rights standpoint that occur every single day.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-29-at-9.02.58-AM-2048x1104.png,N,,2025-10-29 17:02:25.328600

The indictment, filed last week, alleges that the 26-year old Palestinian American candidate and five other individuals “physically hindered and impeded” a federal agent who was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators”.

Abughazaleh, who is running for Illinois’s ninth congressional district to replace the outgoing Democrat Jan Schakowsky, was charged with conspiracy to forcibly impede or injure a federal agent, and assaulting or impeding the agent while they were performing official duties.

According to the indictment, the group “conspired with one another and others, known and unknown, to prevent by force, intimidation, and threat, Agent A, a United States law enforcement officer, from discharging the duties of his office”.

It alleged that Abughazaleh, along with the other individuals, “banged aggressively” on the agent’s vehicle, “crowded together in the front and side” of the vehicle and “pushed against the vehicle to hinder and impede its movement”.

According to the indictment, the group etched the word “pig” on to the vehicle and broke a side mirror and a rear windshield wiper. It also alleged that Abughazaleh specifically “joined the crowd at the front of the government vehicle, and with her hands on the hood braced her body and hands against the vehicle while remaining directly in the path of the vehicle, hindering and impeding” the agent.

Following the indictment, Abughazaleh, who is known for her large social media platform on which she frequently criticizes Donald Trump’s immigration crackdowns, called the indictment “political prosecution”.

“This is a … gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the first amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up. That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges,” she said.

Abughazaleh added: “As I and others exercised our first amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal.

Abughazaleh, Michael Rabbitt, Andre Martin, Catherine Sharp, Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh are each being charged with conspiracy to impede or injure federal officers, according to a federal grand jury indictment that was returned under seal on Oct. 23. Some of those indicted protesters also face individual counts of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers as they protested outside the Broadview ICE facility last month.

Sharp is a Cook County board candidate and currently the chief of staff for Ald. Andre Vasquez (40th), and Rabbitt is a 45th Ward Democratic committeeperson. Martin is Abughazaleh’s campaign field director, and he declined to comment Wednesday.

Straw has served on the Village of Oak Park’s board of trustees in 2023 and also practices as an attorney for a Chicago-based law firm. According to his firm’s web site, Straw has done pro bono work and provided legal support for non-profit organizations with a focus on “immigration, asylum, discrimination and constitutionality issues.”

The indictment focuses on a Sept. 26 protest and accuses the six people charged of surrounding a government vehicle as it approached the Broadview building “with the intent to hinder and impede” an agent from proceeding. According to the indictment, those six, and others, “banged aggressively” on the vehicle, crowded together and pushed against the vehicle.

Someone scratched the word “PIG” on the vehicle and broke a side mirror and windshield wiper, the indictment said. Abughezaleh and others are accused of putting their hands on the hood of the vehicle and remaining “directly” in its path.

“All federal officials must be able to discharge the duties of their office without confronting force, intimidation, or threats,” U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros said in a statement Wednesday. “As we have warned repeatedly, we will seek to hold accountable those who cross the line from peaceful protests to unlawful actions or conspiracies that interrupt, hinder, or impede the due administration of Justice. The rule of law must always be upheld.”

In a post on social media, Abughazaleh on Wednesday described the case as “yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up.”

“That’s why I’m going to fight these unjust charges, but I need your help to do it,” Abughazaleh wrote to her followers alongside a fundraising plea. “We cannot diminish ourselves in the face of these tactics; it’s time to unite and show up for humanity, for our rights, for everyone terrorized by Trump’s lawless secret police.”

Abughazaleh has been a regular presence at protests outside the Broadview processing facility, sharing videos on social media of federal agents throwing her to the ground at one point last month.

‘The Charges … Are Ludicrous’

The charges were viewed as an attempt at stiffing protest and dissent against Trump’s government, said some of those facing charges.

“The charges brought against Ms. Sharp are ludicrous,” Molly Armour, attorney for Sharp, said in a statement. “We are confident that a jury of Ms. Sharp’s peers will see them for exactly what they are: an effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

Vasquez, who has worked with Sharp for years, said the charges won’t have the effect the Trump administration intends for them to have.

“They want to scare us into submission. It won’t work,” Vasquez said. “With these charges, they’re acting with the same lack of regard for the constitution that we’ve seen from them every day on the streets of Chicago. All we need to say is ‘see you in court.'”

In a statement Wednesday, Straw said he joined the protests at Broadview “because of what is happening to our immigrant neighbors: children zip-tied and shoved into vans, mothers pulled from cars on the way to school, neighbors afraid to go to church or work.”

“The Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office,” Straw said. “I will fight these baseless charges, and I will continue to stand with and protect our immigrant neighbors.”

Brad Thomson, an attorney representing Walsh, called the indictment “an egregious attack on First Amendment protected activity” and said that Walsh would be “pleading not guilty to these outrageous charges.”

The Protest At The Heart Of The Indictments

A Sept. 26 social media post by Abughazaleh depicts what appears to be the encounter at the center of the conspiracy indictment.

“At the Broadview ICE facility, an ICE agent tried to run dozens of protesters over with an SUV as we walked on a public crosswalk,” Abughazaleh wrote in the post, which published just before 8 a.m. that day. “He kept driving for about a full football field until ICE barraged us with pepper balls.”

In the 21-second clip, Abughazaleh and about a half dozen others are at the front of a group of protesters crowding around the government vehicle. The crowd chants, “up up with liberation, down down with deportation” as the vehicle slowly pushes forward while Abughazaleh and others hold on to its hood and each other. Multiple people can be seen banging on the vehicle’s hood while others toss stuffed animals at it as the video ends.

The Sept. 26 protest at the heart of the indictment featured hours of conflict between federal agents and demonstrators. Agents deployed rubber bullets, pepper spray balls and pepper spray against protesters — at one point doing so for an hour and a half as outraged protesters crowded in a narrow parking lot adjacent to the facility. The riot-control weapons hit organizers, journalists and photographers who were also at the scene and, at one point, a sniper on the building’s roof fired projectiles that shattered the windows of a nearby business.

Organizers were forced to move locations during that day’s protest because federal officials had erected a fence in the street near the processing center. Earlier this month, a federal judge ordered the removal of that fence after the Village of Broadview filed a lawsuit that said it was put up illegally.

The Justice Department has now charged two dozen people with either assaulting or impeding federal immigration officers in the past month, coinciding with its Operation Midway Blitz effort aimed at enforcing federal immigration laws, according to records reviewed by Block Club.

Five cases were quickly dismissed by prosecutors, including one in which a grand jury refused to return an indictment.

When U.S. District Judge April Perry issued a ruling that temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard in Illinois, she pointed to some of those dismissals when questioning the Department of Homeland Security’s “credibility and assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago.”

""This is a political prosecution and a gross attempt at silencing dissent, a right protected under the First Amendment. This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said in a statement Wednesday.

Protesters have gathered outside the immigration center to oppose enforcement operations in the Chicago area that have led to more than 1,800 arrests and complaints of excessive force.

Greg Bovino, who is leading Border Patrol efforts in Chicago, was ordered this week by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis to brief her every evening about the operations, beginning on Wednesday. It is an unprecedented bid to impose real-time oversight on the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown in the city after weeks of tense encounters and increasingly aggressive tactics by agents.

Federal prosecutors accuse Abughazaleh and others of surrounding a vehicle driven by a federal agent on Sept. 26 and attempting to stop it from entering the facility.

Among the others named in the indictment are a candidate for the Cook County Board, a Democratic ward committeeman and a trustee in suburban Oak Park. The charges accuse all six of conspiring to impede an officer.

Abughazaleh is scheduled to make an initial court appearance next week. Her attorney called the charges “unjust.”

The indictment said the group banged on the car, pushed against it, broke a mirror and scratched the text “PIG” on the vehicle.

Abughazaleh at one point put her hands on the vehicle’s hood and braced her body against it while staying in its way, the indictment says. The agent was “forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators,” it says.

Just a week before that alleged confrontation, she told The Associated Press that during a protest on Sept. 19 she was thrown on the ground by federal agents and hit with tear gas as she stood arm-in-arm with others in front of a driveway, blocking a car. A video of that incident was widely circulated.

A liberal journalist with a big social media following, Abughazaleh announced her run in March, saying most Democrats “work from an outdated playbook.”

She's running in a crowded Democratic primary to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Jan Schawkosky.

Protesting the immigration crackdown around Chicago has emerged as a top issue on campaigns in Illinois’ March primary. Elected officials and candidates in the Democratic stronghold have often showed up for demonstrations outside the Broadview federal facility.

“As I and others exercised our First Amendment rights, ICE has hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included. Simply because we had the gall to say masked men abducting our neighbors and terrorizing our community cannot be the new normal,” Abughazaleh said.

""I’ve spent my career fighting America’s backwards slide towards fascism, and I’m not going to give up now,"" she said. “I hope you won’t either.”

Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a social media influencer and former journalist running for Congress in Illinois’s 9th District, was hit with two counts: conspiracy to impede or injure an ICE officer and assaulting or impeding them while they engaged in their official duties.

She’s charged alongside five others, including Michael Rabbitt, a Democratic committeeperson in Chicago’s 45th Ward, and Catherine Sharp, who is running to sit on the Cook County Board of Commissioners.

Their arraignment has been scheduled for Nov. 5.

Court records show the indictment was handed up by a grand jury last week but unsealed by a federal judge on Wednesday.

The indictment says Abughazaleh and her co-defendants “surrounded” an ICE officer’s vehicle on Sept. 26 as he attempted to reach the immigration enforcement facility in Broadview, Ill., which has become the focus of protests in the area.

The group allegedly “banged aggressively” on the government vehicle and crowded together on the front and side of the car, pushing against it to impede its movement. They also etched the message “PIG” into the body of the car and broke both a mirror and a windshield wiper, prosecutors say.

“It was further part of the conspiracy that the co-conspirators … physically hindered and impeded Agent A and the Government Vehicle such that Agent A was forced to drive at an extremely slow rate of speed to avoid injuring any of the conspirators and in doing so slowly progressed towards the BSSA to discharge the duties of his office,” the indictment reads.

In a statement posted to Instagram, Abughazaleh said she was charged for exercising her First Amendment rights over ICE tactics in Chicago, while federal agents have “hit, dragged, thrown, shot with pepper balls, and teargassed hundreds of protesters, myself included.”

“Because Chicago doesn’t back down from bullies in masks who teargas our neighborhoods, this administration is resorting to weaponizing the federal legal system to scare us into silence,” the congressional candidate wrote. “But we are not going to be silent.”

If convicted, the conspiracy count carries a sentence of up to six years in prison, and the assault count carries up to an eight-year sentence.

The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge April Perry, who is also overseeing the case regarding President Trump’s efforts to deploy the National Guard to Chicago — in part to help protect the Broadview ICE facility, according to federal officials.

The others charged are Andre Martin, Brian Straw and Joselyn Walsh.

Abughazaleh’s lawyer, Joshua Herman, called the case a “political prosecution that tries to turn dissent and First Amendment opposition to the Trump administration’s cruel policies into a conspiracy.”

“Kat has steadfastly opposed those policies and she will fight these charges with the same principled determination,” he said.

Sharp said in a statement that she’s confident a jury of her peers will “see these charges for exactly what they are — another effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.” Her attorney, Molly Armour, called the charges “ludicrous.”

Straw, a member of the Village Board in suburban Oak Park, called the charges “baseless” and said he would fight them while continuing to stand with immigrants.

“The Trump Justice Department’s decision to seemingly hand-pick public officials like me for standing up against these inhumane policies will not deter me from fulfilling my oath of office,” he said.

Brad Thomsen, who represents Walsh, called the indictment an “egregious attack on First Amendment protected activity” and said Walsh would plead not guilty.

The court docket did not immediately show defense attorneys listed for Rabbitt and Martin.

Abughazaleh is a former video producer at the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America who has also garnered a TikTok following of more than 289,000 people.

The congressional candidate is running to replace Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who announced in May she would not seek another term, in the northern Chicago suburbs.

The Post reported Wednesday that an August DHS post, in which a department staffer says that federal officers were on the job “day and night to arrest, detain and deport vicious criminals from our nation’s capital,” featured multiple clips from operations months prior and outside the District of Columbia.

“What a dishonest, slanted, and fundamentally inaccurate piece from @WashingtonPost,” the DHS wrote in a post Wednesday on social platform X, featuring a screenshot of a report from the Post.

”Brutal assaults, and attacks by antifa terrorists have surged against our officers for months now, and the Washington Post has completely ignored them,” the department added.

Clips of operations, such as those used in the DHS video in question, have been used by administration officials in a minimum of six pro-President Trump immigration agenda videos put out within the last three months, according to the Post.

“Here’s the actual story, laying out detailed reporting with receipts,” Lamothe added, featuring a link to the report.

Since Trump’s return to office in January, the administration has heavily cracked down on immigration, increasing raids across the country.

Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons said New York City would experience a higher rate of immigration arrests in the wake of protesters confronting officers amid an operation.

“You will see an increase in ICE arrests because there are so many criminals and illegal aliens that have been released in New York, specifically,” Lyons said on Fox News.

Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., among other cities, have also been targeted by the administration.

A willful and knowing violation of the ordinance by a law enforcement officer or agency can result in a civil violation and penalty of $5,000.
The second order reaffirms that the City has no role in civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.
This is intended to prevent federal immigration enforcement from using parking lots and similar spaces for staging, which has occurred in other cities like Chicago.","New ordinance will also require officers to clearly display badges or emblems of agency, increasing transparency and accountability

Seattle – Today, Mayor Bruce Harrell proposed a new ordinance to prohibit the use of face coverings by law enforcement, with limited exceptions, and require all law enforcement officials to have visible emblems and badges that identify their agency while performing enforcement duties in Seattle.

This legislation puts Seattle on track to be the first city in Washington and one of the first major cities in the country to adopt a mask ban to increase transparency and accountability around federal law enforcement activity, including immigration enforcement operations.

“Federal law enforcement officials operating in Seattle are not above the laws of our city,” said Mayor Harrell. “The Trump administration’s tactic of using masked, unidentified agents to carry out their inhumane deportation agenda with impunity not only erodes accountability but also sows fear in our communities and creates a dangerous possibility for copycat actors. In the face of Trump’s tyrannical militarization of American cities, this ordinance is a concrete step we can take to uphold our local values and protect our immigrant and refugee communities from these unjust actions. My administration remains committed to using every tool at our disposal to protect the safety and dignity of our residents from federal overreach.”

Face coverings include any mask, garment, helmet, headgear, or other item that conceals or obscures the facial identity of an individual, including a balaclava, tactical mask, gator, and ski mask. The ordinance includes exemptions, including medical or surgical masks to protect against transmission of disease, and respirators to protect against toxins or other environmental hazards.

A willful and knowing violation of the ordinance by a law enforcement officer or agency can result in a civil violation and penalty of $5,000. The ordinance will be enforced by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR).

“Accountability is not punishment, it is a promise kept,” said Derrick Wheeler-Smith, Director of the Seattle Office for Civil Rights. “This legislation strengthens civil rights by ensuring that masked or unidentified federal agents, and those pretending to be, are seen, documented, and addressed rather than swept aside. By holding every officer and agency to the same standard, we protect the rights of our immigrant and refugee neighbors and affirm a simple truth: justice is not selective, it is shared.”

The legislation follows the two Executive Orders the mayor signed earlier this month on preparedness and coordination in the event of unilateral troop deployment to Seattle and protecting immigrant and refugee communities from unjust immigration enforcement actions. The second order reaffirms that the City has no role in civil immigration enforcement, which is solely the responsibility of the federal government.

Additionally, the Seattle Police Department (SPD) is currently developing guidance for officers responding to emergency calls where masked or unidentified individuals are detaining people. The increased use of masks and plainclothes officers has led to multiple arrests across the country of civilians impersonating federal immigration enforcement officials, posing a real public safety threat to communities.

“Our officers’ appearance will be consistent when someone calls 9-1-1 for help and Seattle police officers are dispatched. They will show up ready to serve the public with their faces uncovered and their SPD badge and name proudly displayed,” said Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes. “At our core, we are peace officers, and our goal is to protect people and keep the peace.”

“For our client communities to truly feel welcome, it is essential to have protections in place that promote trust and safety for all,” said Malou Chavez, Executive Director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. “This legislation is an example of the City of Seattle’s leadership seeking to protect all communities, and we hope that other jurisdictions follow suit.”

The City is also developing an ordinance to prohibit staging and operations of federal immigration activities on City-owned properties. This is intended to prevent federal immigration enforcement from using parking lots and similar spaces for staging, which has occurred in other cities like Chicago.

Since the beginning of Trump’s second term, Seattle has advanced multiple legal and legislative steps to protect residents from his administration’s unlawful actions and funding cuts.

American culture is all cultures.""","If you were to base your entire knowledge of American current events solely on the social media feeds of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), you could easily conclude that the U.S. is at war. Earlier this month, a recruitment video featured on the agency's social media platforms urged viewers to join ICE, stating: ""under the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, we've reclaimed our border, secured our nation, and have begun to deport these foreign invaders. Equally important as the task of securing our borders is the task of defending our culture - and what it means to be an American.""

The video is part of a social media and advertising blitz to build public support for the current crackdown, and recruit new immigration agents. Homeland Security's stated mission is law enforcement, immigration, travel security and cybersecurity. Its campaign calling for the protection of American culture from invaders has raised eyebrows, and prompted accusations by the Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch Project, of promoting a White, Christian nationalist agenda.

Consider the agency's Instagram, which has nearly half a million followers: it's a potpourri of pop culture memes, action film quality videos of ICE raids, and paintings of white settlers expanding West as Native Americans flee into the shadows. There's also a lot of re-imagined vintage World War II style posters, often featuring Uncle Sam calling on Americans to join ICE.

Julio Anta, a graphic novelist, says the vintage quality evokes ""the good old days of America, back when America was great."" The World War II themes, he says, are a call to arms, ""trying to inspire this newer generation to see this fight against immigrants as something in line with the greatest generation [who fought in the second World War].""

There's a long history of illustrations demonizing immigrants in America. In the late 1800's and early 1900's, editorial cartoons regularly attacked Irish, Italian, Chinese and Jewish immigrants. There's an infamous 19th century newspaper cartoon of Uncle Sam hovering angrily over a melting pot, the caption reads: ""we can't digest the scum."" In another illustration from 1911, a burly immigrant shines a shoe, the caption is a racial slur for Italians and how much garlic they eat.

Anta notes that DHS's social media artwork today almost entirely features White Americans and a romanticized past. ""When I look at these images, I see predominantly white people in it. This is all about a time when society was great for white people, and trying to bring it back to that time again.""

NPR reached out multiple times to DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin with detailed questions about their social media campaign. She did not respond.

Anta, the son of Cuban and Colombian immigrants, says he's disheartened by the images. He says the rhetoric, combined with the mass arrests of undocumented immigrants, at times with little or no due process, has made him feel unsafe right now as a Latino man. He carries a picture of his passport with him in case he gets stopped. He's taken aback by the recent DHS's recruitment ad which affirms that ""we know what it means to be an American. Everyone knows what an American is.""

""I think when I was growing up I might have felt included by that statement,"" says Anta. ""I was raised to see America as this place that was made up of immigrants, and that the cultures that we all brought made this country a better place. And now we don't even get that.""

42 percent of Latino voters elected Trump, a historic number for a Republican presidential candidate. But about a year into his presidency, polls show a changing picture: a recent New York Times/Sienna poll show 69% of Hispanics disapprove of the President.

The same poll shows 26 percent of Latinos do support Trump.

Among them, Peter Gonzalez, a 66 year old who lives in Tallahassee, Florida. He says he voted for President Trump in large part because he says he wanted illegal immigration controlled. His own parents are Cuban immigrants, but he emphasizes - they came to the U.S. legally.

""I have no problem with immigrants coming into this country,"" Gonzalez says. ""We are all immigrants. But there's a process, there's procedures, there's background checks. All that stuff needs to be done.""

Gonzalez, a retired Coast Guardsman, supports the ongoing immigration enforcement campaign. Gonzalez identifies as Hispanic and white, but says he's no stranger to anti-Latino racism—he faced it growing up. Still, he insists the DHS rhetoric isn't about race. It's about enforcing immigration law. ""I don't feel targeted. I mean, everybody knows my last name. They know that I'm bilingual. I don't feel that the administration is targeting Latinos.""

Gonzalez rarely uses social media. In fact, our interview marked the first time he'd seen DHS's Instagram recruitment posts. Scrolling through them, his discomfort becomes evident. ""Protect your homeland, defend your culture,"" he repeats aloud. ""Why? I'm ok with 'protect your homeland', meaning illegal criminals coming in. But the second part…"" He stops. ""'Defend your culture'? I don't agree with that. American culture is all cultures.""

Gonzalez says he still supports President Trump's immigration crackdown.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1170x658+0+402/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbb%2Fda%2Fc4fa1da6476cbeb0ca963236b99f%2Fprotectdefend-jpg.jpeg,N,,2025-10-29 17:02:29.076984

Abughazaleh is one of the more than a dozen Democratic candidates running for Congress to fill the seat now held by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who announced earlier this year that she won’t seek reelection in 2026.

In a statement, Abughazaleh called the charges “political prosecution” and a “gross attempt to silence dissent.”

“This case is yet another attempt by the Trump administration to criminalize protest and punish those who dare to speak up,” Abughazaleh said, adding that the charges are “unjust.”

Other political figures named in the indictment include Catherine Sharp, a chief of staff to a Chicago alderman and a candidate for Cook County Board; Michael Rabbitt, a Chicago Democratic ward committeeman; and Brian Straw, a member of the suburban Oak Park Village board.

Sharp’s attorney, Molly Armour, called the charges “ludicrous,” saying, “we are confident that a jury of Ms. Sharp’s peers will see them for exactly what they are: an effort by the Trump administration to frighten people out of participating in protest and exercising their First Amendment rights.”

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
