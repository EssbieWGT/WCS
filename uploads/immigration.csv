In the latest development, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it is accepting new (initial) DACA applications once again—but under current court orders, it cannot process or approve those applications at this time.

This announcement comes as many applicants seek clarity on their options and turn to trusted legal professionals for help. Working with an experienced immigration lawyer Los Angeles, CA can provide much-needed insight into how these developments may affect both pending and future filings.

While this may sound like a small technical step, it signals a potentially significant turning point in the ongoing litigation surrounding DACA and the government's intent to keep the program alive for so-called ""Dreamers.""

Background: The Legal Battle Over DACA

DACA was first established in 2012 to provide certain undocumented individuals who arrived in the U.S. as children with protection from deportation and the ability to obtain work authorization.

However, a series of court challenges—most notably in the Southern District of Texas (Judge Andrew Hanen) and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals—have found that DACA was not lawfully implemented.

In January 2025, the Fifth Circuit issued a decision striking down key portions of the Biden Administration's DACA regulation but stopped short of completely ending the program. The court sent the case back to Judge Hanen to determine how the program should operate moving forward.

The Current Status: Acceptance Without Adjudication

As of October 2025, USCIS confirms the following:

- Renewal applications for current and prior DACA recipients continue to be accepted and - processed nationwide.

- Initial (first-time) applications are being accepted but placed on hold.

- USCIS will receive and store the filings but will not review, adjudicate, or issue work authorization until further court direction is given.

- Advance Parole (for travel) remains available to current DACA holders on a case-by-case basis.

This ""accept but don't process"" approach stems directly from the injunction still in place under the Texas court order. Until that order is modified or lifted, no new DACA grants can be approved—even if applications are submitted.

For those pursuing long-term legal status or naturalization, consulting a knowledgeable citizenship lawyer Los Angeles, CA may help identify alternative immigration pathways while the courts continue to deliberate.

What Might Come Next

The Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have asked the court to allow adjudication of new DACA applications outside Texas, arguing that Dreamers nationwide should not be penalized by a geographically limited ruling. That proposal remains pending before Judge Hanen.

Legal analysts expect that whichever way the Texas court rules next, the case is likely to head back to the U.S. Supreme Court for a final decision on DACA's future in 2026.

“ICE was once again a presence in Evanston and Rogers Park this AM, with masked men taking multiple members of our community off the street,” he said.

At about 10:30 a.m, ICIRR’s Rapid Response Network also “verified that federal agents abducted two people at the Home Depot on Oakton.”

Following that alert, Evanston’s youth soccer program, AYSO, sent an email to participants allowing coaches to cancel or postpone games scheduled for Sunday.

“James Park is directly across from Home Depot,” the email from AYSO Evanston said. “If you do not feel safe playing your soccer game today, do not go!”

“I am not officially canceling all games today, as many of them are in areas where there is no reported [ICE] activity,” the email continued. “If you feel the need to cancel your game today, please do so. Safety of our players, parents, coaches, referees, and all volunteers is our top priority!”

Sunday’s detention of two people comes on the heels of heightened ICE activity on the North Side of Chicago in recent days, according to ICIRR.

“We were not notified of any pending ICE operation,” said Evanston Police Department Cmdr. Ryan Glew. “We did receive a call about ICE operations on Oakton, but whatever occurred was wrapped up before we responded to assess.”

Under the Welcoming City Ordinance, Evanston is a sanctuary city, meaning that the city and EPD do not collaborate with federal immigration authorities.

It was just after 8:30 a.m. when a woman named Julie looked out her Rogers Park window to see Border patrol agents interrogating a man stopped right in front of St. Jerome Catholic Church.

""I think they've been casing the church... the mass times are down,"" Julie said. ""I think they've been casing the church. There was somebody up there the other day who got picked up. They're in this neighborhood for a reason.""

With a Spanish-language mass going on at that hour, Julie and her partner alerted the priest, along with several others in the neighborhood who took it upon themselves to make sure people were able to leave the church safely.

""I felt really badly for them,"" Julie said. ""They were inside, scared to come out. I can understand why.""

She and others were back again for Sunday evening's bilingual mass.

""The goal here is not to create any conflict, but actually to create a safe space,"" volunteer Angie Guinn said.

Parishioners said they're unnerved, and not just because of what happened Sunday.

""Right now, nobody wants to come out, because they don't want to be deported,"" parishioner Jorge Quiroz said.

The Archdiocese of Chicago did not comment on the incident, but on CNN, Cardinal Blase Cupich spoke on the ongoing raids.

""Yes, we surely have the need for a state to provide safety for people and also secure its borders, but let's not forget that human dignity also has to be preserved,"" Cupich said. ""Many of these people who don't have documents have been here for a long time and contributing to society.""

The Refugee Council has consistently warned that people seeking asylum are being locked out of essential services and pushed into poverty by design.
Frontline organisations working with people seeking asylum, including health, housing and emergency relief services, are stretched to breaking point as demand continues to rise.
Elijah Buol, CEO of Asylum Seekers Centre, says “The systemic lack of a safety net for people seeking asylum has created a growing poverty crisis in our communities.","As we mark Anti-Poverty Week today, the Refugee Council of Australia (RCOA) and Asylum Seekers Centre (ASC) are urging the Australian Government to take immediate action to ensure that people have the right to work to support themselves and to end the systemic exclusion of people seeking asylum from basic services, which is driving thousands into poverty and homelessness.

This exclusion forces individuals and families into cycles of destitution, homelessness, ill health and labour exploitation with devastating long-term impacts, including exposure to modern slavery.

Adama Kamara Deputy CEO of RCOA says “Australia has both the capacity and the responsibility to provide a safety net for all, not just some. People seeking asylum want to contribute, to work, study and build a life, but they continue to be left behind by policies that deny them basic support, putting them at risk.”

“These issues must be addressed as part of broader anti-poverty measures and the Government’s commitment to tackling modern slavery and migrant worker exploitation in Australia.”

Ali* who applied for asylum in 2016 but lost his work rights, continues to struggle without any government support as he awaits the outcome of his case.

“It is very difficult for me, my wife and my daughter who was born here. Since I lost work rights, we all eat less food and we are struggling. We can’t pay the rent and have had to borrow money from friends. This has been the case for over 5 years now.

“If I had work rights and was able to do work, I could help my wife and feed my daughter.”

These experiences are not isolated. The Refugee Council has consistently warned that people seeking asylum are being locked out of essential services and pushed into poverty by design. The same concerns were also raised in Australia’s 2025 NGO Report to the UN Human Rights Council, which was endorsed by over 100 civil society organisations and calls for a restoration of basic support.

Frontline organisations working with people seeking asylum, including health, housing and emergency relief services, are stretched to breaking point as demand continues to rise.

Elijah Buol, CEO of Asylum Seekers Centre, says “The systemic lack of a safety net for people seeking asylum has created a growing poverty crisis in our communities. On the frontlines, we see the devastating consequences every day – families facing homelessness, women escaping domestic violence left with nowhere to turn, people skipping meals or going without essential medical care.

“This is not just a policy failure – it’s a test of our national character. Australians believe in fairness for all. That principle must extend to people in crisis, regardless of their visa status. The government must act to ensure no one is left behind.”

Together with a growing number of sector leaders, peak bodies and community groups, the Refugee Council and Asylum Seekers Centre call on the Federal government to restore a basic safety net for people seeking asylum. This includes access to income support, housing and healthcare, the right to work and study while asylum claims are being assessed, and urgent expansion of the Status Resolution Support Services program so it reaches those in real crisis. Greater investment is also needed in frontline services, and a pathway to permanency for those who have been living in limbo for years.

These solutions are clear, practical and entirely within reach. What is needed now is the political will to act — to save lives, prevent hardship and ensure people seeking protection in Australia are treated with dignity, inclusion and the chance to belong.",https://www.refugeecouncil.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/SafetyNetHeroImage2.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 20:57:12.720438

Whether or not Roan’s words will lead to lasting change is uncertain, but they have undeniably added fuel to an already raging debate.","At the heart of a heated national debate over immigration enforcement, pop singer Chappell Roan found herself in the political spotlight after a bold statement at her recent concert in Pasadena. On October 10, 2025, during a performance at the iconic Rose Bowl, Roan paused between her energetic hits to deliver a message that reverberated far beyond the stadium’s walls. With passion, she shouted, “F*** ICE forever,” repeating the phrase to a chorus of cheers from her California audience, as reported by NME and LADbible.

Videos of the moment quickly spread across social media platforms, capturing not just Roan’s words but the electric response from her fans. The scene was one of jubilation, with some attendees later sharing their emotional reactions online. One fan wrote, “We were there and she was spectacular. She certainly didn’t mince her words!!” Another, visibly moved, posted, “I'm getting misty eyed. I have not heard so many people in one place cheer. It makes my heart beat a bit stronger. Seeing all the hate against my people, has been so devastating to me. Seeing this, makes my heart thank you!!”

Roan’s comments were a clear critique of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an agency frequently at the center of controversy for its handling of immigration enforcement and the detention of individuals, many of whom have no criminal record. According to NME, Roan not only criticized ICE’s treatment of immigrants but also encouraged her fans to stay informed and involved in advocating for more humane immigration policies that respect human rights.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE, wasted no time in responding. Just two days later, on October 12, 2025, DHS issued a statement that was as brusque as it was dismissive. In a comment to TMZ, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, “Pink Pony Club is good. Pedophiles are bad. That’s who we’re getting off of our streets. Get a grip.” The reference to “Pink Pony Club” nodded to Roan’s popular song, but the message was clear: DHS was standing firm behind its agency and its mission, brushing off the singer’s critique.

This exchange didn’t just highlight the growing friction between artists who use their platforms for activism and the federal agencies they criticize—it also underscored the ongoing, deeply polarized debate over U.S. immigration enforcement. ICE, established in 2003 as part of the post-9/11 reorganization of federal security agencies, has long been a lightning rod for controversy. Critics argue the agency has overreached, detaining individuals without criminal records and sometimes separating families, while supporters maintain that ICE plays a crucial role in keeping dangerous individuals off the streets.

The public’s reaction to Roan’s outburst was swift and divided. Many fans lauded her courage and willingness to speak out, especially in an industry where taking a political stand can alienate segments of the audience. “People screamed louder after that line than they did for the chorus of Pink Pony Club,” one attendee noted on social media. Another joked, “Y'all know how many birds she's gonna anger by this? I love it and I don't even listen to her.”

Yet, not everyone was impressed. Some critics, including Roan’s own fans, questioned the timing and sincerity of her activism. On social media, one user asked, “Where was this energy earlier with Trump/elections?” Another pointed out, “She refused to endorse any Democrat candidate last election but wants to speak up now that she sees real people pushing back.” A third, more cynical voice commented, “I'm sorry, but rich people saying things means nothing to me at this point. I agree with her sentiment, but I'm not going to worship someone who's able to sit in their mansion or go on a stage and say something that people are getting beat on the street for saying.”

This backlash reflects a broader skepticism about celebrity activism—especially when it comes to issues as contentious as immigration. While some see artists like Roan as champions for the marginalized, others view their statements as performative or disconnected from the realities faced by those directly impacted by ICE actions.

The Department of Homeland Security’s response was notable not just for its bluntness but for its attempt to redirect the conversation. By stating, “That’s who we’re getting off of our streets,” DHS sought to frame ICE’s mission as one focused on removing dangerous individuals, specifically mentioning “pedophiles.” This rhetorical move is common in debates about law enforcement, where agencies often highlight their work against the most reviled criminals to justify broader, sometimes controversial, enforcement tactics.

But the exchange also shines a light on the difficulties of public discourse around immigration. As NME observed, the rapid response from DHS demonstrates how controversial these discussions have become, and how challenging it is for public figures to engage with political issues without encountering pushback. The complexities of immigration policy—balancing national security, humanitarian concerns, and the rights of immigrants—make it a minefield for anyone who enters the fray.

The Roan-DHS episode also illustrates the enduring challenge of holding federal agencies accountable and ensuring transparency in their actions. Critics of ICE have long demanded greater oversight, citing cases of abuse and the psychological toll of detention on families and children. Supporters, meanwhile, argue that robust enforcement is necessary to maintain the rule of law and public safety.

For policymakers and citizens alike, the debate remains fraught. Immigration is a perennial issue in American politics, shaping elections and fueling passionate arguments on all sides. The 2024 presidential election saw immigration as a central topic, with candidates offering starkly different visions for the future of agencies like ICE. As the country heads into another election cycle, moments like Roan’s outburst—and the reactions they provoke—are likely to become even more common.

Ultimately, the incident at the Rose Bowl is a microcosm of a larger national conversation. It raises questions not just about immigration enforcement, but about the role of artists in political life, the responsibilities of federal agencies, and the power of public protest. Whether or not Roan’s words will lead to lasting change is uncertain, but they have undeniably added fuel to an already raging debate.

As the music faded and the stadium emptied, the echoes of Roan’s message lingered—reminding everyone that in America’s ongoing struggle over immigration, the battle for hearts and minds is being fought not just in courtrooms and Congress, but also on the nation’s stages.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/6kIfnYbj3Bf0Cw1AS7CYCdua4Hg=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2F8c94fe4d-a291-416a-bdfa-50d54cb8dd58.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 20:57:34.854903

But after approaching Illinois State Police officers standing outside the facility, the group’s communion request was rebuffed.

The processing facility has been at the center of ongoing demonstrations in recent weeks. About 11 a.m., protesters marched down Lexington Street toward the center, praying and singing.

Illinois State Police Lt. Col. Jason Bradley called the facility with the religious leaders’ request to give communion. Bradley said ICE denied the request.

Bradley said no reason was given for the denial.

ICE didn’t immediately return a request for comment on why the request was denied.

About 1,000 members of Chicago-area parishes and of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership were part of the delegation.

When the leaders announced to the group that ICE had declined the request, people started yelling “Shame! Shame!”

The group had communion among themselves in the parking lot and street before dispersing to either walk home or board yellow school buses the organizers had rented to take people home.

The Rev. Larry Dowling, one of the priests holding the communion elements, said, “We’re just very disappointed because we simply wanted to bring the love of God and the presence of the Eucharist to these prisoners, which we had been allowed to do before all this stuff happened. So they’re basically rejecting us bringing the presence of Christ and the love of God.”

A spokesperson for the coalition pointed to the 2008 Access to Religious Ministry Act, which allows religious workers “reasonable access” to jails and people in immigration detention facilities to meet with those who wish to “consult about their spiritual needs.”

“ICE has completely shut down and [is] not allowing any ministers inside to provide communion and religious support for many weeks now,” said spokesperson Sarah Rand of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership. Rand was unsure whether any attempts by other groups had been successful.

Chuck Fitzsimmons led the singing during the procession along Lexington Street to the ICE facility.

“In one sense [the music] keeps up your spirits, but also it focuses us on the message that we are here as one, brothers and sisters all,” he said.

He said he was sad to not be able to share communion with the detainees. “However, these are the times and these are the morals, and I think we were prepared to be denied,” he said.

On Saturday, crews put up barricades in front of the fence that a judge ordered removed by Tuesday per state police orders, according to a crew person on site.

U.S. District Judge LaShonda A. Hunt issued a temporary restraining order Thursday ordering the removal of the fence outside the processing facility to be taken down immediately.

The fence, erected in September, was still up as of Saturday afternoon. Officials have until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday to take it down.

Before the clergy arrived, dozens of protesters had already gathered at Harvard Street and 25th Avenue.

About 30 minutes ahead of Broadview’s 6 p.m. protest curfew, some protesters went onto 25th Avenue to heckle a vehicle full of federal agents. Police then declared an unlawful assembly and pushed protesters down the street. State and sheriff’s confirmed 15 arrests throughout the day. Protesters arrested earlier Saturday face charges including destruction of government property, aggravated battery to a police officer, mob action and resisting or obstructing an officer.

About 7 p.m. Illinois State Police retreated and protesters cleared the roadway as Illinois Department of Transportation made small adjustments to the barriers around the designated free speech zones along 25th Avenue and demonstrators largely dispersed.

The ICE facility is the site of ongoing and often tense demonstrations, with agents deploying chemical irritants and rubber pellets, since President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively ramped up a deportation campaign in the Chicago area last month under the name “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Since then, protesters have arrived at the facility in the early morning hours, sometimes as early as 5 a.m. and have clashed with federal authorities into the late night hours.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d21b62f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7712x4402+0+371/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2Fa8%2F6fb987c244eb9fa51696a552be7f%2Fbroadview-101225-035.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 19:57:04.156810

We at Migration Watch have watched and listened closely. Here’s a brief summary of the Labour, Conservative and Reform proposals.

Labour Party

Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood promised to stop small-boat crossings, crack down on smuggling gangs (again), and end hotel use for those awaiting the outcome of asylum applications. The focus was, in the main, illegal migration. She would extend the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) for those who have arrived on visas from five to ten years and require applicants to be working, paying taxes, be able to speak English and have clean criminal records.

Conservative Party

Chris Philp, Shadow Home Secretary, unveiled the Borders Plan. This includes leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, a ban on asylum claims by people who have entered the UK without permission, or those who make a claim at the point of being required to leave having been here for prolonged periods, deport illegal small boat arrivals to safe countries, abolish immigration tribunals and legal aid for those entering, deport foreign criminals and establish a Removals Force to deport 150,000 people per year, including those already in the UK illegally and future illegal arrivals and foreign nationals convicted of serious offences.

Reform UK

Reform UK’s plan, announced by Nigel Farage, would scrap indefinite leave to remain. Migrants would instead have five-year work visas with higher salary requirements and no welfare access; existing ILR holders would reapply and would be able to apply for British citizenship seven years following granting of ILR. Before the conference Reform pledged to detain illegal small-boat arrivals, leave the ECHR, repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act and deport 600,000 migrants with no right to be here over five years, focusing on the ‘Boriswave’.

Migration Watch view

We have no expectation that the Liberal Democrats, the Greens or ‘Your Party’ will embrace the policies needed to control and reduce immigration. While Rupert Lowe (Restore Britain) and Ben Habib (Advance UK) both advocate policies which resonate with many people, according to the polls, they are unlikely to be involved in forming the next government.

What Reform and the Conservatives had to say about illegal immigration and asylum was welcome, if expected. However, we were disappointed that their focus was confined largely to this aspect of the immigration problem, with scant attention given to overall immigration, which is more than 20 times the number who have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year.

There was no mention of the fact that net migration added more than 2.5million to our population in the five years to mid-2024, or that our population grew by 755,000 in the year to mid-2024 – 98 per cent of that increase due to immigration – with every local authority in England bar one seeing growth. The Labour Party, for its part, also largely avoided addressing this wider issue.

Like the majority of the British public, we want illegal immigration brought to an end, but we also want to hear how the parties propose to deal with the catastrophic levels of legal migration that are driving such profound demographic change – levels which could lead to the white British population becoming a minority by the early 2060s. It was precisely this scenario that prompted Sir Keir Starmer to warn of the risk of Britain becoming an ‘island of strangers’. What a pity that the courage he showed in May appears since to have deserted him.

Migration Watch UK, and the millions who share our concerns, now want to hear from the parties most likely to form or join the next government how they intend to tackle this existential challenge. We would be pleased to share our proposals for how this can be achieved.",https://www.conservativewoman.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ukborder.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 19:56:48.737263

“Of course, we were denied access,” Coulter said.","Three Evanston ministers drove to the Broadview Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility on Friday to pray and share a Communion outside the detention facility, but were denied access to the facility.

The Rev. Jason W. Coulter, senior pastor at First Congregational Church of Evanston; the Rev. Britt Cox, executive pastor at United Methodist Church of Evanston; and the Rev. Eileen Wiviott, senior minister at Unitarian Church of Evanston, joined dozens of clergy members representing several religions from across the Chicago area.

“I came to witness this unfolding tragedy that is happening in our community,” said Coulter, as he looked at the two-story detention facility behind high fences about a block away.

The faith leaders organized the Communion service to share what they view as the body of Christ. They wanted to offer it to fellow protesters gathered in Broadview, along with police officers and detainees inside the facility, too.

“Of course, we were denied access,” Coulter said. “But this meal that we understand to be available to all people is being denied to the detainees simply because of their status.”

First visit

Friday was his first time visiting the Broadview facility, about 25 miles southwest of Evanston.

“The treatment that we’re seeing here before our very eyes is heartbreaking, and it really needs to end, and it needs to end now,” he said. “The scene is so very militarized. It is like an occupation — the walls, the barriers, the over-the-top police presence. It’s clear that they’re here not to keep us safe, but to keep us in our place.”

It was Cox’s first visit, too.

“People said it felt a little bit less chaotic and violent as some of the other days before … but it still felt very heightened and controlled,” she said. “It felt that there was a force managing our space, wanting to manage our movement. It was scary having helicopters and federal agents take pictures.”

Wiviott had attended a demonstration in Broadview in early September, before the area was fenced off and before federal agents used tear gas and pepper spray on demonstrators.

“It was clear immediately just how different it was from five weeks ago,” she said. “Now, the road is blocked off by police, and you feel the heavy, heavy presence of ICE officers and police.”

Wiviott’s Unitarian Church does not practice the Christian Holy Communion, “but I found that attempting to offer Communion to those who are being caged was really powerful,” she said. “And as somebody who doesn’t explicitly identify as Christian, I still found grace.”

First Congregational Church’s Coulter said he plans to talk to his congregation about what he saw. The trip to Broadview from Evanston takes about an hour. He said he parked on village streets about two blocks from the protest area.

“I want to tell them what is happening in our backyards and let them know that we’re all called in whatever way we can to resist this, to defend our neighbors, to support those that are in trouble and to speak out to say this is not right and it has to stop,” he said.

‘It matters’

“Everybody can come to Broadview to be witness to what is happening, to see the different forms of resistance that are on display here, and to say that you were there. It matters.”

Wiviott added that she would be careful before telling parishioners to come to Broadview.

“I do think it’s dangerous, and I would not ask anybody to do it,” she said. “I have relied on my clergy symbols to give me a measure of safety, although the last several weeks have made me feel much less secure. … I really encourage people to find what ways they can show up.”

One way, she said, is to attend immigration-policy protests called “Shine the Light” in Evanston at 6:30 every Thursday night at one of three intersections: Dempster Street and Ridge Avenue, Chicago Avenue and Main Street, and Lincolnwood Drive and Central Street.

“This is a way of saying we won’t be silent and we won’t be complicit,” Wiviott said. “We want to be beacons of light and show there is another way.”

Said Cox: “This is not going to be a one-time protest. This is going to be a long haul, and it’s going to take all of us. It’s going to take those of us who aren’t used to showing up to events like that, to come out in number.”

Coulter said he was worried before driving to Broadview. “I certainly didn’t want to be tear gassed or struck with a baton or pushed to the ground like some of my colleagues have,” he said. But that did not deter him. “There was a chance that I would face arrest, but that’s not a reason to stay home. I really wanted to be here with all my heart.”

He plans to return. “I’m imagining extending invitations to my family, my friends, my parishioners. I’ll say: ‘If you want to be witness to this with me, we’ll drive down together.’ And I think it’d be good thing to do.”",https://evanstonroundtable.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC1773-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 18:58:33.348267

One topic on the agenda concerns the deportation of migrants to centres in third countries.
Under its rules, refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.
However, he is also concerned about potential human rights violations, particularly regarding restrictions on movement in secondary facilities and return centres in third countries.
Italy, for instance, sought to host migrants in asylum centres in Albania, but the plan met legal resistance because the facilities were effectively detention centres.","A row erupted in Germany's Bundestag on Thursday over the new European asylum system CEAS.

Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt wants tougher measures to control illegal migration. One topic on the agenda concerns the deportation of migrants to centres in third countries.

""Balancing humanity and order,"" that is Dobrindt's guiding principle. In other words: not all burdens should fall on the shoulders of just one state, but they must be equally distributed across Europe.

Up to now, the Dublin Regulation was meant to ensure fair distribution. Under its rules, refugees must apply for asylum in the first EU country they enter.

In practice, however, the system did not always function as intended. Deadlines have been missed, member states have not fully cooperated, and migrants bypassed the procedures altogether. The result has been secondary migration and an overburdened system.

Dobrindt: No right to a country of choice for the asylum procedure

There is a right to an asylum procedure, but no right to a country of choice for the asylum procedure in Europe, Dobrindt believes, proposing the deportation of migrants who have committed criminal offences to Afghanistan, as well as establishing secondary centres and return hubs in third countries.

""We are making concrete progress on this,"" Alexander Throm, the CDU/CSU's domestic policy spokesperson, said to Euronews.

In addition to repatriation centres, Throm is calling for the creation of new detention criteria to make deportations ""more feasible"".

""These are people who have come to Europe illegally and have no right to protection, no right to stay here,"" Throm said. ""They should be returned to their home country or, if this is not possible, to another safe third country.""

A 'great idea' but will it fail due to implementation?

AfD's Bernd Baumann considers the idea a fundamentally good one, but has questioned the SPD's ability to implement it

Speaking on repatriation centres, Baumann told Euronews that ""it's a great idea, and it comes from us. We've been doing it for years.""

""But anyone who wants to implement this cannot form a coalition with the SPD,"" Baumann said, adding that ""it won't work with the EU either.""

Baumann believes that implementation can only succeed with national policies.

""The CEAS is anything but effective, because anyone can continue to come in across European borders. Illegal migration would not be stopped, only redistributed because of the 'compulsory quotas',"" he told Euronews.

Can human rights be safeguarded?

Green Party MP Claudia Roth said the concept runs counter to the principle of asylum enshrined in Germany's constitution.

""This permanent reduction to criminalisation of people on the run is really wrong,"" Roth told Euronews.

Roth also emphasised Germany's historical responsibility, ""Nobody leaves their home country without a reason,"" she said.

Left Party MP Clara Bünger pointed out that third countries are not guaranteed to be safe.

""The new CEAS reform will ensure that hardly any people arriving in the EU, in Germany, will receive protection here,"" Bünger warned. ""In the future, the vast majority of people will be sent to detention centres and then shipped to third countries that are not safe.""

The Left Party MP expressed concerns regarding human rights ""Every human being has human rights, fundamental rights, and these are being taken away from them,"" she said, ""They are being moved, put into some kind of camp, and the procedures are being increasingly undermined, and the right to asylum is unrecognisable; it effectively no longer exists"".

Meanwhile, SPD remains divided.

""There are many points in the CEAS that point in the right direction, Hakan Demir, SPD MP, told Euronews. However, he is also concerned about potential human rights violations, particularly regarding restrictions on movement in secondary facilities and return centres in third countries.

In principle, repatriation centres are legally possible, says the SPD MEP. ""But whenever I ask: 'Name me a country that makes this possible now and where the legal conditions are right', I never get an answer,"" Demir said.

In fact, there have already been unsuccesful attempts in the past. Not because of the concept itself, but due to its surrounding conditions.

Italy, for instance, sought to host migrants in asylum centres in Albania, but the plan met legal resistance because the facilities were effectively detention centres. An Italian court later ruled the project as unlawful. However, granting freedom of movement in Albania would have allowed rejected asylum seekers to travel back to the EU via Serbia, rendering the plan ineffective.

The UK's attempt to deport migrants to Rwanda also failed. In this case too, it was not because of the idea of return centres itself. The original plan involved outsourcing asylum procedures directly to the third country, but British courts rejected this approach.

The Conservative Party then proposed handling asylum procedures within the UK instead, but the plan never materialized after Labour blocked it.

The Foreign Ministry in Bamako announced the reciprocal measures on Sunday after the US began requiring Malian nationals seeking business or tourist visas to post hefty bonds of between $5,000 and $10,000 starting on October 23.

Mali said the US programme breaches a 2005 accord guaranteeing long-term visa access between the two nations, and vowed to apply the same financial barriers to US passport holders under the principle of reciprocity.

In a statement released by its Foreign Ministry, Mali said it “has always collaborated with the United States of America in the fight against irregular immigration, with respect for law and human dignity”.

The dispute highlights escalating tensions as the administration of US President Donald Trump deploys visa restrictions as diplomatic leverage to pressure African governments on immigration enforcement and deportation cooperation.

Mali is among seven African countries facing the bond requirements under a year-long pilot scheme that the US State Department says targets nations with high visa overstay rates.

Mauritania, Sao Tome and Principe, and Tanzania were also added to the programme alongside Mali in late October, while Gambia, Malawi and Zambia were added earlier.

Trump immigration moves

Travellers subject to the bonds must pay up front through a US Treasury Department portal, and can only enter and exit the US through three designated airports.

The money is refunded if visitors depart on time, but forfeited for overstays or asylum applications. Consular officers determine individual bond amounts based on applicants’ circumstances.

The US justified the pilot by citing national security concerns and US Department of Homeland Security data showing more than 300,000 business and tourist visa holders overstayed their authorised periods in 2023.

Critics warn the fees – imposed atop standard $185 visa costs – could deter legitimate travel and harm the US tourism economy ahead of the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Mali said it was interested in “fruitful cooperative relations”, but was introducing the measure against US citizens attempting to travel there in the spirit of reciprocity.

The visa bonds are the latest immigration measure following months of efforts by the Trump administration to pressure African nations into accepting deportees, including those not from their own countries.

Several governments have received expelled migrants in exchange for payments or political favours, while others faced swift punishment for refusal.

Burkina Faso had all visa services suspended at its US Embassy after rejecting demands to accept third-country deportees, forcing residents to travel to neighbouring Togo for applications.

South Sudan initially had visas for all passport holders revoked following a deportation dispute, though it later accepted eight people from Asian and Latin American countries.

Federal judges have repeatedly said no.

In the detention-without-bail case, Judge Brianna Fuller Mircheff said that if the deportation apparatus is still running during the shutdown, an immigration-related challenge should continue too.

“Despite the government shutdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to remove noncitizens from the community; noncitizens continue to be detained under the policy that is challenged in this case; and immigration courts continue to process cases involving detained respondents,” the court’s order states.

“Given that individuals are continuing to be detained subject to the challenged policy, the Court declines to indefinitely stay adjudication of whether such individuals are lawfully detained,” it states.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the class action lawsuit in California against a July 8 policy change ending bond eligibility for people who have lived in the country for years but are in detention centers while their immigration cases continue.

It’s one of at least nine legal challenges to the Trump administration’s immigration policies that the Department of Justice has sought to pause during the shutdown, which is now in its second week with no progress toward an end.

Most judges are insisting on keeping their scheduled deadlines, pointing to continued immigration enforcement and urgency of the lawsuits, which also include challenges against the end of temporary deportation protections for Venezuelans, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s deportation and federal funding freezes for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

Starting Oct. 1, the first day of the government shutdown, DOJ attorneys began approaching courts with requests to delay immigration-related proceedings as part of the department’s plan to limit civil litigation during the lapse in federal funding.

The DOJ shutdown contingency plan states that it will continue to deal with cases where the safety of human life or protection of property would be compromised significantly by a delay. It also states attorneys have to keep working if judges deny the department’s requests.

Some groups suing the government over immigration matters argue that there would be serious impacts to putting the cases on hold.

The case over whether the Department of Homeland Security can end temporary protected status for Venezuelans, for example, affects about 600,000 people directly and could have repercussions for others with these protections.

“It is important because it’s one of the only hopes with little possibility of continuing the protection for people with TPS,” said Jose Palma, a national coordinator for the National TPS Alliance, which is suing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over ending TPS for Venezuelans.

Palma said moving ahead with the legal challenge is particularly vital in light of a recent Supreme Court decision that allows the government to cut off deportation protections and work authorization for Venezuelans while the ultimate fate of TPS for the population is determined in lower courts.

The case is set to move forward in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel denied the federal government’s request to pause the case because of the government shutdown. However, a federal judge agreed to pause a similar case out of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts until the end of the shutdown.

Despite DOJ’s efforts to pause proceedings in the lawsuit seeking to stop the second deportation of Abrego Garcia, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland is requiring the DOJ to bring to a Friday hearing witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the steps the government has taken to deport him to Eswatini, Costa Rica or any other country.

During a hearing on Monday, Xinis lost her patience with the government attorneys’ inability to provide information about the administration’s plan to once again deport Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.

DOJ also failed to secure an indefinite pause in the lawsuit filed in February by several cities and counties over the Trump administration’s attempts to withhold funding for “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Santa Clara and San Francisco, along with multiple other counties and cities, have been granted preliminary injunctions by District Judge William Orrick twice, as the lawsuit has grown to include other counties, most recently at the end of August.

Following the most recent ruling, the Trump administration’s attorneys had a deadline of Oct. 16 by which they could respond, but on Oct. 1, they filed for a motion to stay, similarly citing the government shutdown as the reason for the need for an extended deadline.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the DOJ motion states.

Attorneys representing Santa Clara cited the DOJ’s own contingency plan in response, noting “the Department’s (contingency) plan assumes that the judicial branch will continue to operate, though possibly at a reduced level, through the lapse.”

Orrick promptly denied the motion to stay, and the administration has until the original deadline to reply to the ruling.

The judge’s motion “helps ensure that accountability doesn’t stop when it’s inconvenient for those in power,” said Jonathan Miller, the chief programs officer at Public Rights Project, which is representing some of the cities in the lawsuit.

“The federal government can’t use a shutdown as an excuse to halt oversight while continuing to pursue the policies we’re challenging,” he said.

The latest legal bid to stop anti-migrant groups from violating the rights of migrants has failed after the KwaZulu-Natal Division of the High Court in Durban ruled against the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on Friday, 10 October.

Since June this year, the anti-migrant group turned political party, Operation Dudula, and NGO March and March have focused attention on blocking migrants from accessing healthcare at public hospitals and clinics across Gauteng and pockets of KwaZulu-Natal.

This targeted campaign has continued for months, even though it violates Section 27 of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to access healthcare regardless of immigration status or nationality.

On Friday, the SAHRC turned to the Durban high court to interdict Operation Dudula and March and March from refusing migrants access to medical care outside hospitals and clinics in Durban.

The ministers of police, home affairs, health and the MEC for health in KwaZulu-Natal were added as respondents in the urgent application for failing to fulfil their constitutional obligations to protect the healthcare rights of migrants.

According to the SAHRC, the addition of the government officials came after multiple engagements over the disruptions, with both the Department of Health and the office of the National Commissioner of Police, failed to result in tangible action.

“These state organs, through their engagements with the SAHRC and in the media, indicated that steps would be taken to prevent the denial of access to public healthcare facilities by vigilante groups and individuals. The conduct of Operation Dudula and March and March continues unabated, and no steps appear to be taken to assist the affected patients seeking medical services,” the commission said.

However, Acting Judge David Saks struck the SAHRC’s urgent application from the roll, stating that it was not urgent enough to give the respondents only two days to respond to the 260-page founding affidavit, as they were notified only on Monday, 6 October, three days before the application was set to be heard.

In its founding affidavit, the SAHRC detailed how the commission and several people, including South African citizens, permanent residents and asylum seekers, were denied access to Addington Hospital in July.

Commissioner Chris Nissen said the hospital’s security personnel were increasingly refusing to intervene and allegedly ignoring the actions of March and March and Operation Dudula at the medical facility’s gates.

Advocate Vishalan Naidoo, representing the ministers and KZN health MEC, argued that the incidents outlined in the answering affidavit happened in July, and the SAHRC did not provide evidence of recent incidents, which meant there was no urgency regarding the application.

However, several civil society organisations have reported that the disruptions continue. This was echoed by the SAHRC’s legal representative, advocate Muhammad Zakaria Suleman, who told the court that incidents had been ongoing since July.

Acting Judge Saks agreed with the respondents and struck the urgent application off the roll, with costs.

Dudula sets sights on schools

While another legal bid to interdict the violation of migrant rights has faltered, Operation Dudula, which has set its sights on contesting the local government elections next year, is expanding its focus to public schools with an announcement that it would bar the children of migrants from accessing education when the new academic year starts in 2026.

Dudula’s announcement was more than just empty words. On 22 September, the group took to the streets of Soweto, Johannesburg, to call for the schools to “put South Africans first” and deny migrant children placement.

The organisation claims that migrant children take school placements from South African children, and says that this compounds overcrowding in the South African school system. The group has not provided evidence to support this claim.

EWN reported that Gauteng Department of Education spokesperson Steve Mabona met Operation Dudula during the disruptions in Soweto and told the group that schools were not immigration centres and their only role was to provide education.

“We have a constitutional obligation to make sure that we teach all children. Constitutionally, all children of school-going age must be at school. Now it’s even worse – there is an introduction of (mandatory) Grade R and law dictates that those children must be taught,” Mabona said.

Dudula’s disruption of schools and the group’s plans also evoked the ire of Basic Education Minister Siviwe Gwarube, who said Operation Dudula would face the full might of the law if it disrupted schools.

According to the Department of Basic Education, Gwarube had met the Acting Minister of Police and requested that the joint operations structures between the Department of Basic Education, the South African Police Service (SAPS) and Provincial Education Departments be activated to monitor and manage these disruptions.

Strong statements have been issued condemning the group’s actions. The government has been criticised for not taking tangible action to protect the rights of migrants.

Daily Maverick sent questions to both SAPS in Gauteng and the Gauteng DBE to find out how the departments planned to stop Dudula’s continued disruptions.

The questions included:

What steps are being taken to address these disruptions and protect the rights of those affected?

What are the plans to prevent future disruptions and ensure that all residents—regardless of nationality or legal status—can safely access healthcare and education?

Responding to the questions, Gauteng SAPS spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo said:

“The South African Police Service in Gauteng, Johannesburg Metro Police, as well as Gauteng traffic wardens, deploy officials to restore calm and maintain law and order at health facilities where protests have been reported. These deployments are as and when needed.”

Masondo said officials were not passive at the affected health facilities. Gauteng law enforcement agencies worked closely with the departments of health and education to prevent, combat and investigate crimes affecting them.

Daily Maverick had not received a response from the Department of Basic Education by the time of publication.

EFF, NGOs step in

In the meantime, several non-government entities have taken it upon themselves to protect the interests of targeted migrant groups by taking action in the courts.

In September, the Economic Freedom Fighters filed a murder case against Operation Dudula. This followed the death of a one-year-old Malawian child in July, after Operation Dudula allegedly barred the baby and mother from accessing medical care at the Alexandra Community Health Centre in Johannesburg.

Operation Dudula has since denied the allegations, stating that none of its members were at the clinic on that day, News24 reported.

Several organisations have had Operation Dudula in their crosshairs even before the group’s latest target campaign.

In June, Daily Maverick reported on migrant rights group Kopanang Africa Against Xenophobia (KAAX), the South African Informal Traders Forum, the Inner City Federation, and Abahlali baseMjondolo’s legal bid to have the Gauteng Division of the High Court in Johannesburg interdict Operation Dudula from assaulting, harassing or intimidating migrants and to stop Operation Dudula from impeding access by the children of migrants to healthcare services and schools.

The Department of Home Affairs and the SAPS were added as respondents to the application for what the civil society organisations called “state-enabled xenophobia”. Home Affairs and the SAPS were accused of collusion for failing to protect migrant communities from Operation Dudula’s targeted harassment and assault since the political party’s inception in 2021.

Judgment was reserved on 11 June, and not much has been heard since.

Speaking to Daily Maverick on behalf of KAAX, Dale McKinley said that Operation Dudula’s continued harassment of migrants indicated its disregard for the rule of law. “They are thumbing their nose at our law, at any kind of judicial oversight,” he said.

“The reason we took the legal case was precisely to prevent these kinds of things – so that we could get a court injunction and interdict to prevent Operation Dudula from harassing … violating other international migrant rights.

The measure, signed into law this past week by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, comes on the heels of other recently enacted state laws meant to shield students in schools and patients at health care facilities from the reach of President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement actions.

Democratic-led states are adding laws resisting Trump even as he intensifies his deportation campaign by seeking to deploy National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities to reinforce U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who are arresting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally.

By contrast, some Republican-led states are requiring local law enforcement agencies to cooperate with ICE agents.

“The actions of the states really reflect the polarization of the country on this issue,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports immigration restrictions. “We have seen some states move to cooperate to the greatest extent that they possibly can” with Trump’s administration and others “doing what they can to try to thwart immigration enforcement in their state.”

Across the U.S, state lawmakers this year have passed more than 100 bills relating to immigration, according to an Associated Press analysis aided by the bill tracking software Plural. The measures are divided almost evenly between those providing and denying protections to immigrants.

California is shielding immigrant information

Immigrants comprise a significant portion of California's urban sidewalk vendors. Some have been swept up in immigration enforcement actions, in part, because their outdoor work in public places makes them easier targets than people behind closed doors.

California's street vendors typically need permits from cities or counties. The new law prohibits local governments from inquiring about vendors' immigration status, requiring fingerprinting or disclosing personal information — name, address, birth date, social media identifiers and telephone, driver's license and Social Security numbers, among other things — without a judicial subpoena.

The law, which will take effect Jan. 1, was prompted by concerns that vendor databases kept by local governments could be accessed by federal immigration agents to target people for detention and deportation.

“We’re talking about really security –- security for businesses, security for human beings, security for people who have gone through so much,"" said Sergio Jimenez, a street vending organizer with the nonprofit Community Power Collective in Los Angeles.

Additional laws recently signed by Newsom add immigration status to a list of protected medical information and prohibit schools from granting access to immigration enforcement officials without a court warrant. Another new California law directs schools and higher education institutions to immediately notify staff and students or parents when immigration officials are on campus.

Democratic states create safe places for immigrants

Upon taking office, Trump reversed a policy restricting federal immigration agents from arresting people at sensitive locations such as schools, churches and hospitals. Like California, other Democratic-led states responded with laws attempting to create safe places for immigrants.

A Maryland law enacted earlier this year requires public schools, libraries and health care facilities to restrict access for immigration enforcement officials unless presented with a court warrant. Nevada's Republican governor vetoed a similar measure for schools that had been passed by the Democratic-led Legislature.

Meanwhile, a new Colorado law allows civil penalties of up to $50,000 for public child care centers, schools, colleges, health care facilities and libraries that collect information about people’s immigration status, with some exceptions. New laws in Rhode Island prohibit health care providers and landlords from inquiring about people's immigration status. Oregon also enacted a similar law for landlords.

States split on aiding federal immigration agents

By contrast, Republican-led states have passed numerous laws intended to bolster Trump’s immigration policies.

New laws in Texas, Florida and Arkansas require sheriffs who run jails to enter into federal agreements for their officers to be trained to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. State and local participation in the federal 287(g) immigration enforcement program — named after the section of law that created it — has exploded from 135 agreements in 21 states before Trump took office in January to more than 1,000 agreements presently in place in 40 states.

But some Democratic-led states have refused to take part. A new Delaware law prohibits participation in the program, similar to statutes already in place in California and Illinois. Democratic-led Vermont also tightened its restrictions on participating in federal immigration enforcement programs, repealing an exemption that had allow it during emergencies.

A Connecticut law that took effect in October allows people to sue local governments that cooperate with federal immigration authorities in violation of the state’s “Trust Act.”

Public benefits are a point of contention

In Washington, new state laws allow workers to take paid leave to attend immigration proceedings for themselves or family members and prohibit employers from using immigration status to coerce their employees.

But some Republican-led states have enacted laws limiting benefits for people in the country illegally.

A new Idaho law prohibits immigrants without legal status from receiving some publicly funded health benefits, including vaccinations, crisis counseling and prenatal and postnatal care for women. A new Louisiana law requires applicants for public benefits to be screened for legal immigration status and, if lacking it, reported to federal immigration authorities

Several Republican-led states — including Florida, Louisiana, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Wyoming — have adopted laws invalidating certain driver’s licenses issued to immigrants in the U.S. illegally.

College tuition discounts are diminishing

Entering into this year, nearly half the states provided in-state tuition to public colleges and universities for residents living in the U.S. illegally. But that number has dwindled since Trump took office and the U.S. Department of Justice began suing states. The federal lawsuits assert states are violating the Constitution by providing in-state tuition for people without legal status while not offering the same benefit to out-of-state U.S. citizens.

Florida repealed its decade-old law allowing in-state tuition for students lacking legal status, effective July 1. Republican-led Texas and Oklahoma both ended similar tuition policies after getting sued by the Justice Department. Kentucky, which has a Democratic governor, also has taken steps to halt its policy after getting sued.

California lawmakers attempted to enhance tuition benefits for immigrants with a first-of-its kind measure allowing community college students who get deported or voluntarily leave the U.S. to continue receiving in-state tuition while taking online courses from afar. But Newsom vetoed the measure earlier this month, citing “significant constitutional concerns” that the tuition break was offered only to students who left the country and not also to residents of other U.S. states.

A bill passed by New Mexico's Democratic-led Legislature this year would have expanded in-state tuition breaks to immigrants who earned income in New Mexico during the previous two years or who attended at least two semesters of adult education courses. But Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham let the bill die without her signature.",https://images.wral.com/bcd78a81-bb10-54f1-ad41-f2ec0be91e14?w=1200&h=630,N,,2025-10-12 16:56:43.603353

The shutdown came as Democrats were looking to regain their footing with voters, who re-elected Trump last year and relegated them to the minority in both chambers of Congress.
An estimated 750,000 federal employees have also been furloughed.
As the Hill reported, however, federal workers are generally paid once a shutdown ends, whether they are furloughed or working.
After the last shutdown in 2018, Congress wrote into law that federal workers must be paid once the government reopens.","Donald Trump claimed on Saturday that he had found a way to pay US military troops despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, saying he had instructed his defence secretary, Pete Hegseth, to release funds.

Posting on his Truth Social platform, Trump wrote: “I am using my authority, as commander-in-chief, to direct our secretary of war, Pete Hegseth, to use all available funds to get our troops PAID on October 15.”

Trump said he had identified the funds to make the payments happen, adding: “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our military, and the entire security of our nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous government shutdown. The radical left Democrats should OPEN THE GOVERNMENT.”

The recent federal government shutdown began on 1 October and is the first since a 35-day closure that happened in December 2018 and extended into the new year during Trump’s first presidential term. The shutdown came as Democrats were looking to regain their footing with voters, who re-elected Trump last year and relegated them to the minority in both chambers of Congress.

More than 1.3 million military personnel across the country would not have received their first post-shutdown paychecks this month, only getting paid for the 21-30 September period. An estimated 750,000 federal employees have also been furloughed.

As the Hill reported, however, federal workers are generally paid once a shutdown ends, whether they are furloughed or working. After the last shutdown in 2018, Congress wrote into law that federal workers must be paid once the government reopens.

On Thursday, the US Senate remained deadlocked on legislation to end the shutdown, even as Trump repeated his threat to make Democrats pay for the funding lapse that has closed federal agencies and furloughed employees across the nation.

Speaking to Punchbowl News, the Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, expressed confidence in the strategy, saying: “Every day gets better for us.”

The White House announced the layoffs of federal workers on Friday, following through with a threat it made to initiate the mass firings of government employees.

A document filed with a federal court on Friday evening revealed that hundreds of layoffs took place across the executive branch, including about 315 at the Department of Commerce, 466 at the Department of Education and 187 at the Department of Energy.

Union leaders warned the layoffs would have “devastating effects” on services relied upon by millions of Americans, and pledged to challenge the moves in court.

“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, national president of the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), which represents 800,000 federal and DC government workers.

After Russell Vought, the director of the White House office of management and budget, wrote on social media that “RIFs have begun”, referring to the government’s reduction-in-force procedure to let employees go, the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, responded, saying: “America’s unions will see you in court.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee44816f3936ce5e6f2f15fcd261554e2048c339/683_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=54f4a4ff3250c65c182c24c643e51c21",N,,2025-10-12 13:57:10.605767

Good Sunday afternoon. I’m Ali Bianco, taking the lead today. As always, inbox is open.

INSIDE TRUMP’S WAR ON DRUGS: POLITICO’s Nahal Toosi pens her latest Compass column, digging into President Donald Trump’s war on drugs that has another target in mind: “The first time President Donald Trump tried to push Nicolas Maduro out of power, he wasn’t coy about it. He accused the Venezuelan dictator of stealing an election, stripped U.S. recognition from Maduro’s government, imposed sanctions on Caracas and rallied other countries to pressure Maduro to quit. It didn’t work.

“In his second term, Trump is targeting Maduro differently, and his message is, uncharacteristically for Trump, less direct. Even though Trump continues to say Maduro is an illegitimate leader, he has said ‘we’re not talking about’ regime change in Caracas. Instead, he’s emphasizing the long-standing accusations that the strongman is a drug lord and a dangerous criminal. The plan, people familiar with the situation tell me, is to force Maduro out as part of Trump’s ongoing fight against drug cartels.”

DRIVING THE DAY

THE CRACKDOWN CONTINUED: A federal appeals court temporarily lifted the block on Trump’s federalization of National Guard troops in Chicago yesterday, but stopped short of green-lighting their deployment in the city, POLITICO’s Gregory Svirnovskiy and Josh Gerstein report. In Portland, where troops are also waiting in the wings, an appeals court appears primed to soon let the deployment move forward.

The two cases mark the latest in a series of whiplash-inducing legal battles over Trump’s mass immigration crackdown and efforts to deal with crime in cities led by Democratic mayors — which has at times been brushed back at the lower levels before receiving friendlier rulings from the Supreme Court. But it’s also part of a larger aggressive escalation of interior enforcement that has become the marquee agenda item of Trump’s second term.

A raft of favorable Supreme Court emergency decisions this year — stripping protections for hundreds of thousands of immigrants with temporary protections, among them — has given Trump space to increasingly test the reach of his executive authority to enact what he promised to be the largest mass deportation in history.

The view from the White House: “The administration is confident that our actions will be upheld as lawful, because at the end of the day, they are lawful,” one White House official granted anonymity to speak candidly told Playbook. “You know, if it has to go to a higher court, it has to go to a higher court.”

The military deployments to Los Angeles, Chicago and Portland have been reactive to protests, the official said. Trump has also floated sending troops to other major cities in the future, which the official did not rule out. “Obviously you’ve seen the president wants to and won’t hesitate to protect federal law enforcement officers,” they added.

That confidence extends to Trump’s allies outside the White House. “Even these recent court rulings that you might characterize as setbacks, they’re going to get overturned,” Ken Cuccinelli, who served as DHS deputy secretary during the first Trump administration, told Playbook. “No other president has done this in our adult lifetimes in terms of how they implement immigration policy.”

The National Guard deployment, multiple immigration lawyers and experts told Playbook, is no exception and is poised to be one of the biggest tests of his power.

“He’s winning,” Mark Krikorian, director of the conservative Center for Immigration Studies, told Playbook. “He’s not going to win every case, I don’t think, but he’s winning a lot of them, because the immigration law is designed that way.”

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council agreed that the office of the president provides Trump with “an enormous amount of hidden weapons,” which he’s deploying at a scale unseen before. But he also said the resistance to Trump’s immigration agenda isn’t causing the administration to consider pumping the brakes. “It’s causing them to step on the gas pedal,” Reichlin-Melnick said.

Rise of the resistance: Still, Democratic leaders from Chicago and Portland aren’t backing down from the fight. “I am not afraid. Do I think that he could do it? He might,” Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said this morning on ABC’s “This Week” when asked whether he worried about Trump potentially coming after him, given the president’s Truth Social post saying he should be jailed. “But as I’ve said before, come and get me.” Oregon AG Dan Rayfield said Trump’s moves amount to an abuse of power in an interview with Playbook’s own Dasha Burns for “The Conversation” this week.

Where this is headed: Any of Trump’s most controversial moves that land on the Supreme Court’s desk will be meeting a different reality than the first few months. Trump began his second administration in the middle of the high court’s last term, and gained significant deference through so-called “shadow docket” decisions. With the new term just kicking off, there’s more time for the court to chew on cases.

“Trump’s been fortunate to do a lot of the stuff that he got away with during the shadow docket time. I’m not so sure that will continue happening when the Supreme Court has to sit there every week and hear arguments,” immigration lawyer Charles Kuck told Playbook.

But Trump has the time to duke this out in court — and the impact could be far-reaching. “The legal piece will gradually fall away. That may take a little while, like a year and a half, but Trump has started very early in his term,” Cuccinelli said. “There’s plenty of time to legally see these through and to permanently eliminate questions on the legal front, all while employing this relatively new tactic.”

Democrats are still holding out hope that the rule of law will keep Trump in check. “Look, we’ve got to rely on the courts to do the right thing. I realize that sometimes that’s risky business, especially when some have been appointed by Donald Trump,” Pritzker said on ABC this morning. “But we’ve seen that even a Trump-appointed judge out in California, on the West Coast, has ruled against the administration.”

But Trump has found ways to work around court orders slowing his immigration crackdown in the past. Even while the temporary blocks on troop deployments are in place, Trump’s end goal won’t be stymied, said David Bier, immigration director at the libertarian Cato Institute.

“They say you can’t do a National Guard deployment, well, is there some other way to get the military involved?” Bier told Playbook. “There’s a million different ways in which you can kind of get to the same outcome under different rubrics. … We haven’t even seen the half of it yet.”

SUNDAY BEST …

— VP JD Vance on the impending release of the hostages and the war in Gaza, on NBC’s “Meet the Press”: “It really should be any moment now, Kristen. The president of the United States is planning to travel to the Middle East to greet the hostages Monday morning … It’s a monumental thing. It’s great of course for their families. But I really do think that it shows what happens when you go outside the traditional failed diplomatic route and actually try something new.” More on Vance’s Sunday show appearances from POLITICO’s David Cohen

— Speaker Mike Johnson on the extension of the Obamacare subsidies, on “Fox News Sunday”: “The Republicans have already said we were going to have thoughtful conversations, deliberation and debate about continuing the Covid-era Obamacare subsidies. Because they don’t expire until Dec. 31. They’re trying to pretend like that’s a September issue. It never was.”

— House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on negotiating with Republicans, on “Fox News Sunday”: “This should be a bipartisan negotiation. … My friends on the other side of the aisle, they seem to believe that health care is an extraneous issue. … It’s a central issue. This is the wealthiest country in the history of the world, and people throughout this country should be able to afford to go see a doctor when they need one for themselves, their family and their children.”

— Kamala Harris on Trump’s Justice Department, on MSNBC’s “The Weekend”: “What we see is that the rule of law is very much under attack by this president who thinks that the Department of Justice is his personal lawyer and is basically subverting the will of the people around constitutional safeguards. … I think he has a vengeance campaign, which is, I think, really exposing the petty nature of who he is.”

— Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett on having conversations amid a wave of political violence, on “Fox News Sunday”: “I feel like when I talk to people, people are not happy with the level of polarization in the country and the inability of people to have conversations with those whom they disagree with. And so I guess my hope is that we are at a turning point in a corner where more people want to know how to have those conversations.”

TOP-EDS: A roundup of the week’s must-read opinion pieces.

9 THINGS FOR YOUR RADAR

1. MIDDLE EAST LATEST: Trump will head to Tel Aviv at 3:30 p.m. today, arriving in the Middle East at a tense moment as the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel seems to be holding, but is pending the hostage release and prisoner swap that marks the first phase of the U.S.-brokered peace plan to end the two-year war, AP’s Aamer Madhani and colleagues write. Hamas told Israel that it has 20 living hostages in hand and is ready to release them as early as today, WSJ’s Summer Said and colleagues scooped. They will be exchanged for about 2,000 Palestinians imprisoned by Israel, per NYT’s Isabel Kershner.

How it’s playing: Thousands of people have been returning to Gaza City as the fragile ceasefire takes effect, but the area has been ravaged by war and many are returning to find their homes and former lives are gone, NYT’s Liam Stack and Bilal Shbair report. But the families of Palestinian prisoners said they feel “rare happiness” at the imminent exchange, NYT’s Fatima AbdulKarim writes from the West Bank. Preparations are also underway for an influx of critical humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip, per AP.

Order of operations: Trump arrives in Tel Aviv at 2:20 a.m. Eastern time Monday morning, where he will meet with hostage families and deliver remarks to The Knesset around 4 a.m. Eastern. He will then fly to Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, for a Middle East peace ceremony at 7:30 a.m. Eastern. He will depart Egypt to return to the White House at 10 a.m. Eastern.

For your radar: Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy over the phone yesterday, per CBS. “If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well - including the Russian war,” Zelenskyy said in a post on X recounting the call.

2. SHUTDOWN SHOWDOWN: Trump said yesterday he directed the Pentagon to pay U.S. military troops despite the government shutdown, heading off the prospect of troops missing their paychecks this Wednesday, POLITICO’s Ben Johansen and Jennifer Scholtes report. The Pentagon is redirecting about $8 billion from their research and development accounts to pay the troops. “I will not allow the Democrats to hold our Military, and the entire Security of our Nation, HOSTAGE, with their dangerous Government Shutdown,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Cutting deep: After reduction-in-workforce orders were sent Friday kicking off mass layoffs across multiple federal agencies, a number of employees at HHS who were initially tabbed to be laid off are now being rehired, POLITICO’s Sophie Gardner reports. Sources said an unspecified number of CDC employees were mistakenly fired through a “coding error.”

Where things stand: The Senate remains at an impasse on how to proceed. WSJ’s Lindsay Wise writes “even the ‘Groundhog Day’ jokes are getting old now.” House Democrats will be on the Hill Tuesday for an in-person caucus meeting — but the House remains out and is nearing a month without any votes.

The impact: WaPo’s Jacob Bogage and Hannah Natanson break down how the shutdown has already caused flight delays, closed helplines at the IRS, shut off national parks and more — but the effects will only get worse as missed paychecks could cause a consumer spending dip.

3. WEAPONIZATION WATCH: Federal prosecutors met yesterday to square the details of a potential indictment against former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, CNN’s Katelyn Polantz reports. Bolton is under investigation in the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland, and prosecutors there initially pushed back on the investigation against the desires of DOJ leadership, requesting more time to prepare a case by the end of the year. But the office is now discussing potential charges, and whether to subject Bolton to a “perp walk” or otherwise public arrest.

Trump vs. James: Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s U.S. attorney in Virginia, faced intense backlash after charging former FBI Director James Comey, but it didn’t deter her from presenting charges against New York AG Letitia James days later, WSJ’s Sadie Gurman and Meridith McGraw write. Halligan “wanted to just get it done,” and will likely bring more charges against James.

On the charges: “In the Eye of a Political Storm, a Tiny Yellow House in Norfolk, Va,” by NYT’s Jonah Bromwich and colleagues: “Attorney General Letitia James of New York purchased the $137,000 home for a grandniece who needed tranquillity. Prosecutors say it is an impermissible investment property.”

4. IMMIGRATION FILES: “Trump administration says immigration enforcement threatens higher food prices,” by WaPo’s Lauren Kaori Gurley: “The Labor Department warned in an obscure document filed with the Federal Register last week that ‘the near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens’ is threatening ‘the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S. consumers.’ … The Labor Department’s comments appear to be the first time that the Trump administration has publicly acknowledged that its hallmark immigration policy — sealing the border and deporting undocumented immigrants — threatens labor shortages and higher food prices.”

5. SCOTUS WATCH: The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Wednesday on a landmark case that could erode what remains of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, NYT’s Abbie VanSickle writes. The case centers around 12 Louisiana voters who challenged the state’s district map, saying that they had been discriminated against as white voters, because state lawmakers took race into account when the map was drawn in 2020. Though figures from such high-profile cases can sometimes become publicly known names, the identities of the 12 voters in this case have largely remained hidden.

6. CALIFORNIA SCREAMIN’: The viral videos depicting California gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter derailing an interview and berating staffers are driving momentum for strategists trying to coax other candidates like Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) into the race, NYT’s Laurel Rosenhall and Benjamin Oreskes report. “The videos offered fresh evidence of fears expressed behind closed doors by power brokers in Sacramento, San Francisco and Los Angeles: Can a politician who appears so volatile run the state of California?” One political consultant told the NYT that Porter’s record of staff turnover “is the worst kept nonsecret in California politics.”

Fun read: “7 times politicians imploded in TV interviews,” by POLITICO’s Aaron Pellish

7. ANATOMY OF AN ENDORSEMENT: Florida AG James Uthmeier was endorsed by Trump to run again next year, a move that initially jolted Florida Republicans but stemmed from Uthmeier’s work on “Alligator Alcatraz” and securing the land for Trump’s presidential library, POLITICO’s Gary Fineout and Kimberly Leonard break down this morning. “The president’s endorsement lowers the possibility of a contentious Republican primary next year and lessens the chance of a full-blown Trump-DeSantis proxy war across the ballot.”

8. DANCE OF THE SUPERPOWERS: China hit back today at Trump’s threat of a potential 100 percent tariff on its products. “We do not want a tariff war but we are not afraid of one,” China’s Commerce Ministry said, per AP’s Ken Moritsugu. Trump threatened to ramp up import costs by Nov. 1 — and a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is on the rocks after Trump cast doubt on whether it would be productive. “If the U.S. side obstinately insists on its practice, China will be sure to resolutely take corresponding measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,” the Commerce Ministry post said.

The bigger picture: POLITICO’s Megan Messerly and Phelim Kine write that the tit-for-tat actions on tariffs this week is “the sharpest escalation in tensions between Washington and Beijing since the two countries slapped triple-digit tariffs on each other this spring and threatens to derail months of quiet efforts to stabilize the relationship” and it “raises fresh doubts about whether Trump, operating with a hollowed-out national security team and a fragmented China strategy, is prepared for Beijing’s latest power play.”

9. THE MAHA AGENDA: The massive backlash to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s calls for pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol is bringing out a bigger problem — most drugs don’t have enough data on their safety during pregnancy, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein reports. State abortion bans are worsening existing barriers to women’s health, including drug trials and other studies, as the legal repercussions loom over scientists. Much of the “gold-standard science” lauded by the administration has become more difficult to test on pregnant women and throwing a wrench in the greater mission to do safety testing.

TALK OF THE TOWN

IN MEMORIAM — “Bart Barnes, a Washington Post journalist for five decades, dies at 87,” by WaPo’s Harrison Smith: “Reflexively self-deprecating, [Bart] Barnes was 87 when he died Oct. 5 at his home in Washington. As a Post reporter, he had covered a little bit of everything: Local news, politics and sports (including an NFL players’ strike), along with cops and courts. … But he found an enduring home on the paper’s obituaries desk, where he wrote thousands of stories about the famous, the infamous and the hardly known.”

OUT AND ABOUT — MSNBC hosted its “MSNBCLIVE ‘25: This Is Who We Are” event in New York City yesterday, bringing together dozens of the network’s hosts with members of the MSNBC audience. Hosts Rachel Maddow, Lawrence O’Donnell, Nicolle Wallace, Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, Martin Sheen and more came together for programming and discussions that focused on the state of the world.

Immigration officers deployed tear gas and fired pepper balls to disperse protesters. Schools emailed parents in the middle of the day with warnings: Immigration agents might be nearby.

These scenes from the Chicago area in recent days looked far different from what residents were seeing along city streets about a month ago, when the Trump administration announced the start of a crackdown on illegal immigration in Chicago and its suburbs.

What began with a slow uptick in arrests has escalated rapidly. One unauthorized immigrant was fatally shot. American citizens have been detained along with undocumented immigrants. Border Patrol agents have walked in groups through downtown Chicago. Residents have given chase to federal agents’ vehicles. And chemical agents have been used on protesters, journalists and clergy members.

By this week, tensions were high, and many Chicagoans said they sensed a city on edge.

The New York Times reviewed more than 100 videos taken in the Chicago area over the past month, chronicling the actions of federal agents and the response by the public. Videos captured protests, raids, arrests on city streets and residents’ confrontational responses. Together, the videos show how tensions have risen, unfolding in charged and adversarial scenes in locations scattered around the city.

Federal authorities originally told local officials that they expected the operation to last 45 days. There now appears to be no end in sight.

Sept. 5-11

A Slow Ramp Up

From the beginning, residents in heavily Latino neighborhoods in the city were wary of the promised escalation by immigration authorities. But in a city of 2.7 million spread out across more than 200 square miles, other residents seemed unconcerned or unaware, with few early signs of a crackdown visible along their streets.

Some residents began sharing information on social media about possible sightings of immigration authorities in the city and in far-flung suburbs, warning one another to stay alert. Other residents applauded the actions of federal agents, saying that they supported efforts to more strictly enforce immigration law.

Thousands marched downtown in an energetic protest, chanting and beating drums while denouncing Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shouting support for other causes, including the plight of Gazans in the Middle East.

Immigration arrests by federal agents were nothing new in Chicago. And small, regularly scheduled protests and prayer groups had been held outside an ICE processing facility in Broadview, a suburb about 30 minutes from downtown, for years. But this felt different. Federal authorities boarded up windows and doors of the ICE facility, and more and more protesters began gathering outside on some evenings.

Celebrations for Mexican Independence Day mostly carried on. But tensions flared. On the Southwest Side, a street vendor who was known for the flowers he sold outside a car dealership was arrested by federal agents. He was later deported to Mexico.

A video of his arrest spread on social media, angering community members. For days, neighbors left flowers and candles on the sidewalk where he had worked.

On Sept. 8, the Department of Homeland Security officially announced the start of Operation Midway Blitz, targeting “the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago.” Sightings of immigration arrests began to multiply.

Sept. 12-28

A Shooting Alarms the City

On the morning of Sept. 12, two immigration officers pulled over a man driving a silver Subaru on a busy street in a Chicago suburb shortly after he had dropped off his children at an elementary school and day care. When the driver attempted to pull away, an agent shot him in the neck. Officials said that the man, Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez, a Mexican national who federal officials said was not authorized to live in the United States, had attempted to hit the officers with his car. He did not survive.

Last weekend, tensions escalated further.

Outside the ICE facility in Broadview, federal agents threw smoke bombs at a large group of protesters, tackling and slamming others to the ground. Protesters heckled agents about their roles in carrying out President Trump’s deportation efforts, calling out questions to the agents like “What are you going to tell your children?”

In footage shared with The Times, federal agents shouted at a group of protesters to move. “You’re getting ready to get it,” Mr. Bovino told the crowd, threatening them with arrest, while members were yelling at the agents. Mr. Bovino grabbed a man and tackled him to the ground with the help of another agent.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/10/us/politics/Cover_top-art_Chicago01/Cover_top-art_Chicago01-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:57:14.371869

“We don’t need another detention center here.” About 30 miles northeast of Denver, Hudson’s once-privately run prison has been shuttered for more than a decade.
In August, members of Colorado’s congressional delegation were told that the Hudson facility was going to reopen for that purpose.
But it’s unclear when exactly the facility will reopen or if ICE is still planning to do so at all.
(Geo also operates the Aurora contract facility, ICE’s only detention center in the state.)","HUDSON — More than 70 people protested Saturday against plans to open a new immigrant detention center near a rural community north of Denver, with organizers calling on state and local leaders to stop the facility from reopening.

Carrying signs that likened immigrant detention facilities to concentration camps, protesters organized mass phone calls to Gov. Jared Polis’ office and to elected officials in Hudson, urging them to oppose the reopening of the Hudson Correctional Facility. They chanted and voiced broader opposition to the mass arrest-and-deportation program undertaken by the Trump administration, the scale of which prompted federal officials this year to seek new detention options in Colorado.

Jessica Hernandez and her sister Michelle, both of Greeley, held a sign for their father, who they said was a military veteran deported in 2005. He still lives in Juarez, Mexico, they said. As protesters chanted and spoke into a microphone, tuba player Yehuda Serotta punctuated sentences and chants with the horn slung across his body.

“Excuse my language, it’s [expletive],” Michelle M., who provided only her last initial because of concerns about her job, said of the plans to reopen the Hudson prison. “We don’t need another detention center here.”

About 30 miles northeast of Denver, Hudson’s once-privately run prison has been shuttered for more than a decade. But documents obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union indicated that its owners had offered the prison to Immigration and Customs Enforcement as a potential new detention center. In August, members of Colorado’s congressional delegation were told that the Hudson facility was going to reopen for that purpose.

Shortly after, the Washington Post reported that Hudson was one of three new detention facilities that ICE officials were targeting in the state, based on leaked agency documents.

Hudson’s city manager, Bryce Lange, and Mayor Joe Hammock did not return messages seeking comment this month. When The Denver Post reported in August that the Hudson facility was apparently set to reopen as a detention center, Lange said the town had not been informed of the plans. In July, Hammock told Denver 7 that he considered the prison reopening to be like any other new business coming to town and that he would support it.

In a statement Saturday, Polis spokeswoman Shelby Wieman said the governor’s office has “not heard any communications directly from the administration about potential facilities or ICE operations in Colorado.” She noted that the Hudson prison was not a state facility and was not on state-owned land, suggesting the decision to reopen the prison was up to private companies and a federal agency.

“Gov. Polis has repeatedly called for the Trump administration to be transparent about their operations in Colorado and has not received that courtesy,” Wieman wrote.

When it was last open, the Hudson Correctional Facility had a capacity of 1,250 beds. If it opens and is filled to that same capacity, the detention center’s population would nearly rival that of Hudson, which is home to more than 1,600 residents.

The protest was organized by Jenifer Montes of the Immigrant Partnership Team of Greeley and Weld County, and it spread on social media. Shelby Mendoza drove from the nearby town of Keenesburg after hearing about the protest on TikTok. She said she felt sick when she learned that ICE was planning to reopen the prison.

“My son goes to school down Highway 52,” she said as a light rain fell. “It makes me sick knowing that he is going to school in a town — or in between a town — that has a concentration camp.”

According to documents obtained by The Washington Post, ICE officials were planning to rechristen the former Hudson Correctional Facility as the “Big Horn Detention Facility.” The newspaper reported that it was set to be opened before the end of year.

But it’s unclear when exactly the facility will reopen or if ICE is still planning to do so at all. Highlands REIT, the Chicago-based real estate investment trust that owns the prison and offered it as a detention center, did not return a message seeking comment.

Geo Group, the private prison company that previously operated the prison, also did not return a message seeking updates on the facility. (Geo also operates the Aurora contract facility, ICE’s only detention center in the state.)

Geo has not publicly disclosed any contracts with ICE to open or operate the facility, and no such contracts have been released on federal spending databases. In July, congressional Republicans’ tax-and-spend bill provided tens of billions of dollars in new funding to ICE, including $45 billion for detention.

Some of that money appears to now be moving: CoreCivic, another private prison company, recently announced new ICE contracts to operate detention facilities in California, Oklahoma and Kansas. Geo has also extended its contract for the Aurora facility and increased the detention capacity there, federal contracting records show.

Lucie Donovan, a 25-year-old teacher who attended and spoke at the protest Saturday, said her husband has been detained in the Aurora detention center for the past eight months. The two married last month. Donovan said they signed the marriage license separately because they couldn’t do it together.

With the help of a lawyer, she’s working to get him released from the Aurora facility.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit ruled that members of the National Guard in Illinois right now can remain federalized, but they can not be deployed in the state.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” they added.

The move came after the Trump administration appealed an earlier decision by a federal judge to temporarily block the deployment of National Guard troops in the state.

In response to Saturday's ruling, a White House spokesperson indicated that a further appeal was coming.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,"" Abigail Jackson said in a statement. ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

Representatives for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

Hundreds of National Guard troops from Illinois and Texas had originally deployed to Illinois earlier this week at the direction of the Trump administration.

It comes as President Donald Trump has threatened to use the Insurrection Act, an 1807 law, to continue to deploy members of the military in American cities if the courts uphold the deployment of the troops in multiple legal challenges.

Last week, Trump federalized members of the National Guard to deploy troops near Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, saying that the troops would help keep Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities in Oregon and Illinois safe and that they would help these cities address crime.

The Democratic governors and mayors of Illinois and Oregon have pushed back on Trump’s moves, with each state engaged in ongoing litigation to block the deployment of National Guard troops in their states.

In response to reports about a growing threat of wildfires in Texas, Pritzker wrote in a post on X that “Texas is preparing emergency resources for wildfires and floods. The Texas National Guard should be THERE — not in Illinois. We stand ready to support their return home so they are best positioned for helping Texans respond to any natural disasters.”

Earlier this year, the Trump administration federalized the California National Guard to quell anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles. That was blocked by a federal judge who ruled in September.

California sued again this month and won when the Trump administration aimed to send California’s National Guard troops to Oregon after a federal judge blocked the deployment of Oregon’s National Guard there.

A three-judge panel for the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in California is currently weighing a case on the deployment of National Guard troops in Oregon. The Trump administration appealed a federal judge’s ruling that blocked the state’s National Guard from being federalized and deployed.

The panel, made up of two Trump appointees and a Clinton appointee, seemed likely to grant the administration’s request that the lower court’s temporary restraining order be reversed, with one judge suggesting Trump, in his capacity as president, should get more deference in his decision-making.

One of the judges said the court would deliver a decision as soon as possible, but did not offer a specific timeline.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251011-national-guard-ch-1535-0740c6.jpg",N,,2025-10-12 12:57:47.058445

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which includes Border Patrol, has accused her of throwing an object at a Border Patrol car. WGN reported that she hasn’t been charged with a crime.

A man recording the incident asked for her name. Brockman, whose LinkedIn lists her as a producer, identified herself and said she works for WGN, a Chicago-based news station. “Let them know,” she said.

Agents then placed her in the back of an unmarked gray Chrysler minivan with tinted windows as onlookers yelled at them.

News producer 'threw objects' at Border Patrol agent's vehicle, DHS says

In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of public affairs at DHS, said Border Patrol was conducting immigration enforcement operations at the time of the incident. She said “agitators” used their cars to block agents, and agents then hit a suspect’s vehicle to create an opening.

As agents were driving, Brockman, an American citizen, “threw objects” at the car, McLaughlin said. Agents then placed her under arrest on suspicion of assault on a federal law enforcement officer, she added.

Another video of the incident, published by WGN, showed an object flying in the air near a van. Later, Brockman was cuffed.

WGN confirmed in a statement that the employee has since been released and no charges were filed against her. The statement didn’t name her out of respect for her privacy.

The U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago didn't immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by USA TODAY on Saturday, Oct. 11.

What's going on in Chicago?

The incident came a day after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order against federal agents targeting journalists covering protests against immigration enforcement in the Northern District of Illinois, which includes Chicago. USA TODAY contacted the Chicago Headline Club, one of the news representatives that requested the order, about Brockman and the Oct. 9 order, but has not received a response.

Chicago area communities have been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement crackdown, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, for more than a month.

President Donald Trump has also deployed the National Guard to Illinois, arguing that clashes between federal agents and protesters require troops in the state. Illinois officials say sending troops is unwarranted and have challenged their deployment in court.

On one side, President Donald Trump declares the city a war-torn “hellhole” requiring deployment of National Guard troops to help enforce his administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts as the Department of Homeland Security posts propaganda videos on social media.

Appeals court denies Trump administration request to halt judge’s ruling on National Guard pending appeal

On the other, more than a million people, largely tourists from around the world, are gathering across the city and at Grant Park to urge on runners in the Chicago Marathon after tens of thousands had converged in Wrigleyville to cheer on the Cubs.

“This is JB Pritzker reporting from war torn Chicago,” the state’s Democratic governor said Thursday in a mock field report for “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” wearing body armor while walking along a quiet sidewalk on the riverfront’s Wacker Drive.

“As you can see, there’s utter mayhem and chaos on the ground. It’s quite disturbing,” he said. “The Milwaukee Brewers have come in to attack our Chicago Cubs. We’ve seen people being forced to eat hot dogs with ketchup on them and our deep dish pizza, well, has gone shallow. So it’s a challenge to survive here in the city of Chicago, but there’s no hellscape that I’d rather be in.”

Pritzker’s “report” came as U.S. District Judge April Perry on Thursday handed the governor, along with other Illinois Democrats and administration opponents, a major victory by issuing a temporary restraining order that blocked the president’s federalized Illinois and Texas National Guard troops from duty to assist with immigrant enforcement activities.

Pritzker knows that Chicago’s issues are more than binary pictures. And while the governor has placed his faith in the judiciary, there are questions whether a stream of recent federal court defeats for the Trump administration will only prompt a more serious reaction from Trump, using the powers of the presidency at his disposal and his willingness to go after those who he perceives as his political enemies.

Trump did not have a good week in federal court in Chicago.

In addition to the National Guard ruling, U.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt on Thursday ordered the removal of a fence erected outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility’s Broadview detention facility for violating the west suburb’s right to access its own land.

Also Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal agents from using pepper-spray bullets, tear gas and other weapons associated with riot control against journalists and protesters who don’t pose a serious threat. Ellis also banned federal agents from using physical force or arrest against journalists unless they are crime suspects.

And on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings extended until February a consent decree that limits ICE agents’ authority to make warrantless arrests and requires them to disclose monthly any warrantless arrests they make. Cummings also found that the agency had violated the consent decree earlier this year.

“You want me to express joy? Look, I am pleased, if that doesn’t come across my face and my words. I am very pleased,” Pritzker told reporters Friday of Perry’s National Guard ruling.

“We’ve always said that we have to rely on the judiciary to be the check and balance on what the president and the Congress are trying to do or sometimes failing to do,” he said. “So we’re going to take them to court. We think we’re going to get the right results, because we know that it’s unconstitutional for him to attack our states and our cities the way that he has.”

But the victory may only be temporary. The Trump administration has already appealed Perry’s ruling to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. And as Perry was hearing arguments in the case, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals appeared to be favoring Trump and presidential “deference” in a challenge to a similar ruling by a federal judge in Oregon who blocked the president’s federalization of the California and Oregon National Guard for deployment in Portland.

As Perry did in her ruling, Judge Karin Immergut found conditions on the ground at protests of ICE facilities did not constitute a “rebellion” or were as dire and in need of a federal response as portrayed by administration lawyers. Immergut said the federalization issue was “untethered to the facts.”

But during a simultaneous hearing of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump-appointed Judge Ryan Nelson questioned whether the judiciary can put conditions on presidential National Guard deployments.

“I am sort of trying to figure out how a district court of any nature is supposed to get in and question whether the president’s assessment of executing the laws is right or wrong,” Nelson said.

If the 7th Circuit in Chicago and 5th Circuit based in San Francisco reached opposite conclusions, it would provide the legal grist for the conservative-dominated U.S. Supreme Court to decide — a prospect viewed as providing Democrats an unfavorable outcome.

“This thing could be in the Supreme Court in a couple of weeks. So it is a victory, certainly, but it’s just the first step, and what could be a long road of appeals,” said Pat Brady, a former federal prosecutor and state GOP chairman who has not supported Trump.

“The courts tend to give deference to the president on national security issues and that’s what the appellate court looks like looks like it’s doing” in the Oregon case, Brady said.

Even if the lower court rulings stand, Trump also has the ability to invoke the two-century-old Insurrection Act to make military deployments on domestic soil that go far beyond the protection of federal assets and agents that were part of his original federalization of the National Guard.

“I’d do it if it was necessary. So far it hasn’t been necessary, but we have an Insurrection Act for a reason,” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “If I had to enact it, I’d do that. If people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up, sure, I’d do that.”

The Insurrection Act allows a president to deploy the military to “suppress rebellion” or “insurrection” when enforcing federal law becomes “impracticable.” It is an exception to the federal Posse Comitatus Act which prohibits the use of U.S. military assets from taking part in law enforcement actions on domestic soil.

Past Supreme Court rulings have given the president broad discretionary powers to decide if conditions have been met to invoke the Insurrection Act. But the nation’s highest court has left the door open for judicial review to determine if a president invoked the law “in bad faith” or in going beyond “a permitted range of honest judgment.” And the actions of the military, once invoked, are also subject to judicial review.

Invocation of the Insurrection Act would almost surely be contested in court by Pritzker and Attorney General Kwame Raoul, leading to another series of court battles.

“I think the governor and Kwame are doing this for all the right reasons,” said veteran Democratic political consultant Pete Giangreco. “So the question becomes, where, at what point, does the Illinois attorney general and the Illinois governor run out of legal cards? I think we’re rapidly getting to that place.”

With Pritzker a high-profile Trump critic as he seeks a third term as governor and also considers a potential 2028 bid for the White House, there are also questions how far a president who has vowed revenge against his political enemies will go.

Trump previously floated a suggestion that Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson be “jailed,” something largely viewed as fanciful political rhetoric.

But the state could face consequences regarding attempts to cut federal grants and funds beyond the Trump administration’s recent move to freeze $2.1 billion in previously approved transit funding, largely dedicated to the effort to extend the CTA’s Red Line to the Far South Side, out of concerns over “race-based contracting” for the project.

“Trump is always going to double down. He is always going to try to win the fight,” Giangreco said. “He either backs down or he doubles down. And he’s been much more into the double down way lately.”

Brady said “pretty much everything Trump’s been doing recently as president, from the tariffs on, are all pushing the limits of what his authority is and that’s been a conservative strain of thought forever, that the executive needs to be stronger.”

“This is going to be a battle and there’s going to be consequences,” he said. “I think there’s big risk, but I understand exactly why they’re doing it as Democrats: You can’t sit back.”

The 62-year-old was a part of a tight-knit community and never committed a crime.

On Feb. 5, immigration officers who came to his house looking for someone else took him into custody. He was denied bond, despite letters of support from friends, family, his employer and a physician who said the family needed him.

He was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Tacoma, Washington, where his health rapidly declined in part because he was not always provided with his prescription medication for several medical conditions, including high blood pressure. Then there was the emotional toll of being unable to care for his family or sick granddaughter. Overwhelmed by it all, he finally gave up.

At an appearance with an immigration judge, he asked to leave without a formal deportation mark on his record. The judge granted his request and he moved back to Mexico, alone.

His case is an exemplar of the impact of the Trump administration’s aggressive efforts to deport millions of migrants on an accelerated timetable, casting aside years of procedure and legal process in favor of expedient results.

Similar dramas are playing out at immigration courts across the country, accelerating since early July, when ICE began opposing bond for anyone detained regardless of their circumstances.

“He was the head of the house, everything - the one who took care of everything,” said Gloria Guizar, 58, Rodriguez’s wife. “Being separated from the family has been so hard. Even though our kids are grown, and we’ve got grandkids, everybody misses him.”

Leaving the country was unthinkable before he was held in a jail cell. The deportation process broke him.

It is impossible to know how many people left the U.S. voluntarily since President Donald Trump took office in January because many leave without telling authorities. But Trump and his allies are counting on “self-deportation,” the idea that life can be made unbearable enough to make people leave voluntarily.

The Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review, which oversees immigration courts, said judges granted “voluntary departure” in 15,241 cases in the 12-month period that ended Sept. 30, allowing them to leave without a formal deportation mark on their record or bar to re-entry. That compares with 8,663 voluntary departures for the previous fiscal year.

ICE said it carried out 319,980 deportations from Oct. 1, 2024 to Sept. 20. Customs and Border Protection declined to disclose its number and directed the question to the Department of Homeland Security.

Secretary Kristi Noem said in August that 1.6 million people have left the country voluntarily or involuntarily since Trump took office. The department cited a study by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for immigration restrictions.

Michelle Mittelstadt, spokesperson for the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said 1.6 million is an over-inflated number that misuses the Census Bureau data.

The administration is offering $1,000 to people who leave voluntarily using the CBP Home app. For those who don’t, there is a looming threat of being sent to a third country like Eswatini, Rwanda, South Sudan or Uganda,.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the voluntary departures show that the administration’s strategy is working, and is keeping the country safe.

“Ramped-up immigration enforcement targeting the worst of the worst is removing more and more criminal illegal aliens off our streets every day and is sending a clear message to anyone else in this country illegally: Self-deport or we will arrest and deport you,” she said in a statement sent to The Associated Press.

A Colombian woman dropped her asylum claim at a June appearance in a Seattle immigration court, even though she was not in custody.

“Your lawyer says you no longer wish to proceed with your asylum application,” the judge said. “Has anyone offered you money to do this?” he asked. “No, sir,” she replied. Her request was granted.

Her U.S. citizen girlfriend of two years, Arleene Adrono, said she planned to leave the country as well.

“They treat her like a criminal. She’s not a criminal,” Adrono said. “I don’t want to live in a country that does this to people.”

At an immigration court inside the Tacoma detention center, where posters encourage migrants to leave voluntarily or be forcibly deported, a Venezuelan man told Judge Theresa Scala in August that he wanted to leave. The judge granted voluntary departure.

The judge asked another man if he wanted more time to find a lawyer and if he was afraid to return to Mexico. “I want to leave the country,” the man responded.

“The court finds you’ve given up all forms of relief,” Scala said. “You must comply with the government efforts to remove you.”

Ramón Rodriguez crossed the U.S. border in 2009. His eight siblings who are U.S. citizens lived in California, but he settled Washington state. Grandview, population 11,000, is an agricultural town that grows apples, cherries, wine grapes, asparagus and other fruit and vegetables.

Rodriguez began working for AG Management in 2014. His tax records show he made $13,406 that first year and by 2024, earned $46,599 and paid $4,447 in taxes.

“During his time with us, he has been an essential part of our team, demonstrating dedication, reliability, and a strong work ethic,” his boss wrote in a letter urging a judge to release him from custody. “His skills in harvesting, planting, irrigation, and equipment operation have contributed significantly to our operations, and his absence has been deeply felt.”

His granddaughter suffers from a heart problem, has undergone two surgeries and needs a third. Her mother doesn’t drive so Rodriguez transported the girl to Spokane for care. The child’s pediatrician wrote a letter to the immigration judge encouraging his release, saying without his help, the girl might not get the medical care she needs.

The judge denied his bond request in March. Rodriguez appealed and became the lead plaintiff in a federal lawsuit that sought to allow detained immigrants to request and receive bond.

On September 30, a federal judge ruled that denying bond hearings for migrants is unlawful. But Rodriguez won’t benefit from the ruling. He’s gone now and is unlikely to come back.

It’s unclear exactly how many Border Patrol agents have joined up with Ice and other federal agents in raids targeting Chicago, Los Angeles and other big cities.
Earlier this month, Border Patrol agents, along with other federal agents, conducted a military-style immigration raid of an apartment complex in Chicago.","Border patrol officers have become ubiquitous footsoldiers in Donald Trump’s mass deportation plan, and lawyers and human rights advocates worry that the agency is expanding its aggressive tactics into cities far from its conventional range.

Led by Gregory Bovino, a particularly hardline Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sector chief from southern California, border patrol agents have become a daily presence in several major cities across the US.

Earlier this month in Chicago’s Southwest Side, a border patrol shot a woman multiple times amid protests against the Trump administration’s militarized immigration raids in the city.

This summer in Los Angeles, border agents on horseback swept through a public park downtown – riding alongside national guard troops and other agents in military vehicles. In southern California, videos of border patrol agents pinning down and beating 48-year-old landscaper ​​Narciso Barranco went viral.

Agents have also made arrests in California’s agricultural Central Valley and at New York immigration courthouses. They have set up immigration checkpoints in Washington DC.

Lawyers and human rights advocates say the agents, who are trained to block illegal entries, drug smugglers and human traffickers at the country’s borders, may be ill-suited to conduct civil immigration enforcement in urban communities.

“The border patrol is certainly quite cavalier, and has been very aggressive historically as it goes about its enforcement responsibilities,” said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University. They tend to do their work in rural places and isolated parts of the United States. And they generally are not trained in community interactions and policing.”

Until recently, the agency usually worked close to the southern US border – especially along the south-western border – though the department has long had the authority to conduct patrols more inland.

Under a 1946 statute, Border Patrol agents have the ability to conduct warrantless searches within a “reasonable distance” – or up to 100 miles – from any international boundaries. Those boundaries include international land borders as well as coastlines – so in effect, their range encapsulates most US major cities – including LA, New York and Washington DC. Chicago falls within this 100-mile zone, because the Great Lakes are considered a maritime boundary.

Nearly two-thirds of the US population lives within the zone.

Still, García Hernández said, until recently, it was highly uncommon to see border patrol agents stray far from the south-western border.

But now illegal border crossings are at a historic low, and the administration has deployed thousands of military personnel to the southern border, freeing up the Border Patrol, he said – ready and available as force multipliers in the administration’s deportation mission. The department currently has about 19,000 agents. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which encompasses the Border Patrol, is about 60,000 strong – making it the largest law enforcement agency in the country.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), meanwhile, has about 5,500 immigration enforcement officers, plus an additional 7,000 agents tasked with investigating cross-border criminal activities. Though the agency is making a massive push to hire 10,000 more agents, that process is expected to take some time.

It’s unclear exactly how many Border Patrol agents have joined up with Ice and other federal agents in raids targeting Chicago, Los Angeles and other big cities.

DHS did not immediately respond to the Guardian’s query.

As border agents stray away from their original mission, legal experts have raised concerns that they are bringing along with them a culture of combative enforcement. “CBP has a history of problematic treatment of people, in my opinion, perhaps worse than any other law enforcement agency,” said Deborah Anthony, a professor of legal studies at University of Illinois Springfield with an expertise in constitutional law and the legality of Border Patrol operations.

The Border Patrol has long had “more leeway” with the US constitution’s fourth amendment’s protections against random and arbitrary stops and searches, Anthony said. They are able to set up checkpoints and, in some cases, roving patrols, she said – but these authorities are limited by law.

Agents cannot pull people over without “reasonable suspicion” of an immigration violation, or search homes or vehicles without a warrant or probable cause.

In recent deployments, however, agents appear to be flouting these restrictions. Earlier this month, Border Patrol agents, along with other federal agents, conducted a military-style immigration raid of an apartment complex in Chicago. Video evidence showed agents indiscriminately bursting through front doors.

“All the evidence suggests there were egregious violations of rights, both in the treatment of people, in the lack of a warrant, in the breaking down of people’s doors, in what seems to be almost indiscriminate targeting of almost everyone in the building,” Anthony said.

Immigrant advocates have had limited success in opposing this type of indiscriminate enforcement. In a January operation that took place shortly before Trump took office, plainclothes border agents poured into California’s Central Valley region, conducting random stops along the highway. In response, the ACLU sued the Border Patrol on behalf of the United Farm Workers union – and a federal district court found that the operation violated the fourth amendment.

And in June a federal lawsuit from advocacy groups accused the Border Patrol, Ice and other agencies of violating rights by profiling street vendors, car-wash workers, day laborers and others, and making arrests without adequate cause – resulting in a temporary restriction against such enforcement in California and parts of the west coast.

But proving such fourth amendment violations can be a big burden on advocates, said Anthony. And Border Patrol has a long history of aggressive enforcement tactics.

“There’s evidence of everything from legal and constitutional violations to physical and sexual abuse and mistreatment, and very little recourse or accountability,” Anthony said. “Internal discipline within [the] Border Patrol is very problematic and that has been systematically the case for a long time now.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4393177562734795a7ba8e41914a5a7aabef8a5c/250_0_2500_2000/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2db8c1355a7c0bf17fc98c1f781a927b",N,,2025-10-12 11:57:20.110255

Much of the problem, Garcés Infante said in a September call from the detention center, was the food.","Not long into his confinement at the sprawling immigrant detention center in Tacoma, Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino heard swearing as dinner was served. “Hey, look at this,” said the man swearing as he brought his tray over for Juarez to see.

On it was chicken, normally the best food the Northwest ICE Processing Center has to offer, the Skagit Valley farmworker and labor organizer had been told. But on this day, the meat sat in a pool of blood. He inspected his own chicken and saw the same. He lifted the skin to take a closer look. “It was just raw,” he said.

“Everybody got mad and shouted that we weren’t going to eat this,” Juarez said. People returned their food to a cart. Close to 1 a.m., as he recalled, officers brought in sandwiches.

In March, the then-25-year-old had entered a world that, for many people, remains a mystery. The privately run detention center is one of the biggest such facilities nationwide, with 1,575 beds.

Advocates have for years called attention to conditions, collecting thousands of complaints from immigrants held there and submitting them to the state health department. Government agencies and human rights groups have written reports citing concerns. Immigrants locked up there have launched repeated hunger strikes, and some have tried to kill themselves. In 2018, one did.

But the low-lying gray building, surrounded by a chain-link fence, is rarely seen from the inside except by people who work there or are “detained.” Many people don’t even know what that word means, or how it differs from imprisonment. Even some who do would undoubtedly be surprised that one man has been held in ICE’s Tacoma facility for seven years.

More and more immigrants are learning about detention firsthand under President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort. A record number are being held, nearly 60,000 nationally, according to the government’s September figures.

At Trump’s request, Congress has allocated billions of dollars to expand immigrant detention.

Already, the Northwest detention center’s surging population is putting a strain on the facility, exacerbating long-standing complaints and generating new ones, according to interviews with people currently and formerly held there, court declarations and accounts from lawyers and advocates. Many, like Juarez, tell stories of undercooked food and meals arriving in the middle of the night.

They also cite erratic access to outdoor recreation, little to no provided toiletries like soap, unclean uniforms and stained underwear, and long waits for medical care and legal visits. The atmosphere, they said, is tense amid new policies that offer little chance of getting out beyond being deported. Sometimes, even those ready for that outcome can’t leave quickly.

Advertising

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which oversees the facility and provides its medical care, and the GEO Group, the Florida-based corporation running it since 2005, declined interview requests.

“False narratives about ICE detention facilities undermine the hard work of our dedicated professionals,” a spokesperson for the federal agency said in a statement. “ICE facilities operate under strict standards, including accreditation requirements for medical care and staffing.”

A GEO spokesperson said the company provides an array of services, including “around-the-clock access to medical care, in-person and virtual legal and family visitation, general and legal library access, translation services, dietitian-approved meals, religious and specialty diets, recreational amenities, and opportunities to practice their religious beliefs.”

Those familiar with ICE’s Tacoma facility say it does not have the harshest conditions. Some detention centers operate in remote locations far from attorneys, lawyers and outside observers, said Michelle Brané, formerly the immigration detention ombudsman for the Biden administration. “They’re really running in the shadows.”

On one occasion, an asylum-seeker asked to be transferred there because he heard it was one of the better detention centers.

“I would say that it is fairly typical,” Brané said of the Tacoma facility, its problems endemic to the unique system it is in.

From cold holding cell to tense unit

Juarez, who had no criminal record, arrived at ICE’s Tacoma facility the way many immigrants do: in handcuffs, ankle shackles and a chain around his waist.

He had been stopped by federal agents early that morning as he was driving his partner to work picking Skagit Valley tulips, and taken first to a small, unmarked building, he recalled recently. It was 9 or 10 at night when he reached Tacoma and was placed in a crowded holding cell with others waiting to be processed. He met construction workers in dirty clothes they hadn’t yet changed out of, a father and son, and residents of Seattle, Eastern Washington and Portland.

The hours dragged on. “It was really cold and we couldn’t really sleep,” he said. They tried, on the concrete floor, with no blankets.

He was called out around 4 or 5 in the morning, given a blue uniform that signifies low risk, and placed in a two-tier residential unit. Some units have cells where groups of people sleep, but his was a large open area with bunk beds, Juarez said. The unit also had tables and chairs, a microwave, sink and three TVs.

One TV was always set to English-language programming, one to Spanish-language. Juarez, who came to the U.S. from Mexico as a child, speaks both languages, but some people spoke neither, having immigrated from Russia, Turkey, Egypt and elsewhere. What to watch was a source of contention.

“There was always a high risk of a fight breaking out over the smallest thing,” Juarez said.

Still, the well-regarded labor organizer, whose detainment generated community outrage, said he got along with most everyone. He would buy instant ramen soup and macaroni and cheese from the commissary and share with those who didn’t have money.

Sometimes, he helped immigrants who had lost their cases write requests to be deported as soon as possible so they could get out of detention. One he recalled as waiting at least two months.

Days after Juarez arrived, an officer came into his unit with a list of people to be deported right away. Juarez’s name was on it. “Pack your stuff, you’re going tonight,” he said he was told.

Years before, a judge had ordered Juarez removed after he didn’t appear at a court hearing. Juarez said notice of the hearing had gone to the wrong address and he didn’t know about the removal order until he was detained. His lawyer, Larkin VanDerhoef, quickly filed a court motion that stopped him from being deported that night.

Months ticked by. “I started having vision problems because the lights were on pretty much 24/7,” some of them anyway, he said. He went to the “sick call” area one day, where immigrants line up starting as early as 5 a.m. to see health care providers.

There weren’t enough providers to see many of them, Juarez said. He went back to his unit and didn’t try again.

In July, after a judge declined to release Juarez on bond, he opted for “voluntary departure” to Mexico. He lives there now, hoping to find a way to come back to the U.S.

“Stuck in quicksand”

A paradox defines the detention system. It is part of a civil system that’s supposed to be, as ICE says on its website, “non-punitive.” Yet, it operates like a jail or prison system, an Obama-era ICE official noted in a 2009 report.

The Trump administration, which consistently portrays detained immigrants as dangerous, apparently sees no contradiction.

To be sure, some detained immigrants have committed crimes, including entering the country illegally. But whatever punishment they receive in the criminal legal system is intended to be separate from detention, which ICE standards say exists “for no purpose other than to secure their presence both for immigration proceedings and their removal.”

An array of immigrants without formal legal status in the U.S. can be detained, including people who overstay visas (which is not a crime) and asylum-seekers who entered the country without breaking any laws. In some cases, lawful residents with criminal convictions have also been held by ICE.

At the Tacoma detention center, roughly 60% of those reported in September ICE records as being held were categorized as noncriminal.

Despite similarities, detention and criminal incarceration differ in key ways. Those confined to prison have a fixed sentence. Those detained do not.

“It could be three days. It could be three years,” said Brané, the former ombudsman.

Some might be whisked away using a fast-track removal process the Trump administration increasingly deploys. Others are held until a judge or administrative body issues a final ruling on whether they can stay in the U.S. Huge backlogs impede the immigration court and appeals system, adding to the uncertainty of how long detention stretches on.

“It’s like you’re stuck in quicksand,” said Javier Martinez.

Martinez is the man who has been held at the Tacoma detention center for seven years.

The 44-year-old has applied to stay in the U.S. based on what he says is a fear of torture should he be deported, in part for political reasons. His case is complicated, involving two countries he could be deported to, Costa Rica, where he was born, and Nicaragua, where he is a citizen.

While his case has gone through multiple levels of review, he has tried and failed to get bond through every legal avenue, including the U.S. Supreme Court. Once a lawful resident, Martinez’s biggest stumbling block has been two cocaine distribution convictions before ICE took him into custody.

He served prison time for those convictions, offering him a point of comparison. In prison, Martinez earned a GED, obtained a waste management certificate and took parenting classes.

Martinez has found no such activities in detention, designed for comparatively short stays. “Sometimes, I just sit there and I feel like a vegetable,” Martinez said. Even getting to walk around or play sports outside has been tough lately. “Sometimes we have yard and sometimes we don’t,” he said.

He attributes that, as well as irregular meal times that have him going to bed hungry rather than waiting for dinner, to insufficient staffing.

After a steep decline in population due to COVID and slowed immigration enforcement, the detention center’s population has roughly doubled since January, according to immigration lawyers who regularly visit and ICE figures provided to the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights.

Other detained immigrants said it’s patently clear the Tacoma facility is short-staffed. In a lawsuit on behalf of five immigrants held there for more than six months, plaintiff Jesus Bento Cardozo said in an April declaration that one officer frequently oversees two units. “The guard typically goes back and forth between two units and is sometimes gone for as long as 45 minutes or an hour. I worry that something bad could happen.”

As the only person in his unit to speak Konkani, an Indian language, Cardozo also said in his declaration: “I feel very isolated here.”

In Martinez’s particularly low periods, he has turned to a chaplain at the Tacoma facility.

“He’s a great guy,” Martinez said. “You can request to have a one-on-one with him, or a prayer session with him and he will come to the unit.” In a separate area, volunteers lead religious services.

But Martinez may have reached his limit on how much detention he can take. He is now considering an agreement to leave the U.S.

Detained while pregnant

In recent months, Martinez has noticed a new level of despair among those detained with him.

Until several years ago, many stood a decent chance of getting bond in Tacoma’s immigration court located within the detention center, but that changed as judges started automatically denying release to most immigrants who entered the country illegally. A U.S. District Court in September ruled the practice unlawful, and the federal government — which in July made the practice a nationwide policy — has indicated it will appeal.

In the past, ICE refrained from taking some people into custody for humanitarian reasons. A Biden-era policy, for instance, directed ICE officers to refrain from detaining pregnant, postpartum and nursing immigrants in most circumstances. ICE’s website notes the policy “is not reflective of current practice.”

Alejandra Gonza, executive director of a human rights legal group called Global Rights Advocacy, said she knows of three pregnant women who have been recently held at ICE’s Tacoma facility.

One, Anelys Garcés Infante, was taken there in July. A Venezuelan asylum-seeker living at the time in Oregon, Garcés Infante, 27, said she had been arrested on a shoplifting-related charge and ICE officers took her into custody as she left a sheriff’s office.

After advocates and members of Congress from Washington and Oregon pressed ICE to release Garcés Infante, the agency did so in early October, allowing her to continue her immigration court case while living in the community. Her lawyer, VanDerhoef, who also represented Juarez, said it’s the first grant of a procedure known as humanitarian parole he is aware of under the Trump administration.

Seattle midwife Amanda Heffernan visited Garcés Infante at the detention center and contributed to a release request supported by Seattle University’s International Human Rights Clinic and Global Rights Advocacy. “She walked in and I was like, oh my goodness, this person looks really thin and really sick,” Heffernan recalled in an interview.

Garcés Infante had been nauseous, throwing up and losing weight. Much of the problem, Garcés Infante said in a September call from the detention center, was the food. The extra sandwich she got because she is pregnant, bolognalike meat on white bread, was so unappetizing she didn’t eat it. The meals she got relied heavily on beans, which don’t agree with her stomach.

“I just don’t feel good here,” she said in Spanish.

She worried that her baby or babies — an early ultrasound indicated she may be carrying twins — would be malnourished.

She received prenatal vitamins and medical care in detention, and said the doctors there treated her well. The facility called an ambulance to take her to the hospital when she was experiencing severe pain, Garcés Infante said. The hospital gave her medication.

But in Heffernan’s opinion, Garcés Infante needed more specialized care, especially because of possible twins, than detention offers.

Where’s the oversight?

Inspections by Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman during previous administrations often haven’t fixed problems but they have cataloged some. Among those cited in reports on the Tacoma facility over the past two years: medical understaffing, inconsistent suicide-watch checks and preventive health screenings, and foods stored years past their “best-by” dates.

That oversight is now shrinking. The Trump administration largely defunded the detention ombudsman’s and Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, which investigates complaints. A legal challenge is ongoing.

Washington state’s Department of Health, which has received 2,800 complaints since 2023, is attempting to step in. It is backed by recent state laws explicitly giving the agency authority to conduct inspections.

“I have been shocked by the complaints that we hear,” said Lauren Jenks, a department assistant secretary. One of her top concerns is the drinking water, which more than 100 complaints to her department describe as strange looking, smelling and tasting.

The department believes there’s something wrong with pipes inside the building, which it could help fix. But GEO and ICE have long prevented state health inspectors from coming in, which is being litigated in court. (The litigation also involves the state Department of Labor & Industries, which the detention center has allowed in to conduct workplace safety inspections but would likely do so more frequently under state legislation challenged by GEO.)",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10082025_ICE_tzr_115243.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-10-12 09:56:41.485090

“Texas National Guard can stay in Illinois but can’t activate, court says. Here’s what to know about the unit.” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.

Hundreds of Texas-based National Guards deployed this week to Illinois to boost federal authorities can stay there, but can’t be activated, a federal judge ruled Saturday.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the latest ruling states.

This comes after fierce pushback from local residents and Democratic leaders in both Texas and Illinois who have called the president’s decision to deploy the National Guard — with the blessing of Gov. Greg Abbott — unlawful. Two days ago, U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the guard from being deployed, but the Trump administration appealed the decision, prompting Saturday’s ruling.

In a Fox News interview Monday night, Abbott said that the National Guard troops were being deployed to “safeguard” U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. The Trump administration over the last month has flooded Chicago with ICE agents who have been using increasingly aggressive methods to go after undocumented immigrants — drawing sharp protests from local officials and advocates for immigrants’ rights that in some instances has escalated to violent clashes on the streets.

Abbott’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after Perry issued her ruling and order.

Around 200 members from different units of the Texas Guard are currently in Illinois, according to an update from the U.S. Northern Command. It also says that the troops were “mobilized for an initial period of 60 days and will be under the command and control of the Commander of U.S. Northern Command.” After the initial ruling, the Department of Defense said the federalized National Guard troops “will remain in a federalized status,” though it declined to comment on the ongoing litigation.

Some troops were already at an immigration building in the Chicago suburb of Broadview when Perry heard arguments on Thursday. The building has been the site of occasional clashes between protesters and agents.

Perry said the actions of the Department of Homeland Security are largely rooted in President Donald Trump’s “animus toward Illinois elected officials.” She expressed skepticism of the federal government’s characterization of protests in Broadview.

“DHS’s narrative of events is simply unreliable,” she said.

Since the Chicago-area crackdown began about a month ago, ICE has apprehended more than 1,000 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally. U.S. citizens and children have been caught up in raids and altercations between masked federal agents and locals in the nation’s third largest city.

“The president has the constitutional responsibility to enforce the laws of the United States, and those laws include the immigration laws,” Abbott told Sean Hannity. “The president has the authority to call up National Guard to assist in enforcing those laws, and that’s exactly what the president is doing and what Texas is doing — we’re assisting the president in that cause.”

The leveraging of soldiers to help Trump carry out his promised mass deportations of undocumented people echoes a vision the president laid out on the campaign trail, when he pitched an approach of using multiple levels of authority much like former President Dwight Eisenhower’s infamous immigration crackdown.

Here is what you need to know:

What is the Texas National Guard?

The Texas National Guard, made up of more than 20,000 soldiers, is overseen by the Texas Military Department. Guard members are often deployed in response to natural disasters, and in the past have helped rescue people stranded by floodwaters after a hurricane and delivered basic necessities to communities ravaged by storms.

The Military Department’s mission is to provide the president and the governor with “ready forces in support of state and federal authorities at home and abroad,” according to TMD.

The governor has the authority to deploy the Guard as its commander-in-chief. Additionally, a president can take control of troops to deploy them as the nation’s top executive sees fit.

Trump’s federalization of Texas’ troops was blessed by Abbott, who authorized the request.

When has the Texas National Guard been used for non-traditional deployments?

No mission has drawn as much attention to the Texas National Guard or been drenched in politics more than Operation Lone Star.

Abbott launched the border security mission in 2021 in response to what he characterized as the Biden administration’s “open border” immigration policies. The mission became a long-term domestic military deployment, as the governor surged thousands of troops to the 1,254 miles of border that Texas shares with Mexico.

While it was not the first time that military personnel had been deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border, the deployment was unique due to the large number of troops quickly dispatched for an indefinite period of time. Also while soldiers in previous federal operations had provided logistical support roles, Texas tested the boundaries of how much immigration enforcement a state could undertake.

The Operation Lone Star deployment was initially defined by its messiness: Troops reported deplorable conditions for a mission that upended their lives.

It was also accompanied by scandal and questions of authority. Guard members were accused of spying on migrants, started shooting would-be border crossers with pepper ball irritants and helped block federal immigration authorities from parts of the border — dragging the Biden administration into court over a constitutional dispute as courts had long held that federal authorities have sole jurisdiction over the enforcement of immigration laws.

Earlier this year, Abbott directed the Guard to help the Trump administration with its immigration crackdown. The Guard is one of two statewide agencies that entered into an agreement with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement which grants it limited authority to enforce immigration laws during regular duties.

In June, the governor deployed 5,000 soldiers across the state in anticipation of massive protests in the state’s largest cities against the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Guard members can augment local police in certain circumstances — like during civil unrest — but federal law prohibits the use of troops as civilian law enforcement.

Is it legal for the Texas National Guard to be used for non-state purposes?

Under Title 10 U.S.C. § 12406, the president is able to call upon the National Guard in the case of an invasion, a rebellion or the danger of one, or if the federal government cannot execute its laws “with the regular forces.”

On Sunday, the Texas governor said he “fully authorized” such a deployment.

“You can either fully enforce protection for federal employees or get out of the way and let Texas Guard do it,” Abbott said in a post on X.

Trump’s attempts to federalize some blue states’ guards over their objections have, however, resulted in lawsuits.

On Sunday, a federal judge temporarily barred the deployment of any state guards to Oregon. A three-judge panel — which includes two Trump nominees — from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then heard arguments on Thursday about the mobilization, but has yet to issue a ruling.

Illinois sued on Monday, saying that the federal government can still enforce its laws in the state and conditions have not been met to justify the mobilization. A federal judge then granted a partial temporary block on Thursday, but specific details were still unclear.

Ten Democratic U.S. representatives from Texas have called Trump’s deployment of national guards unlawful. They also said it set a bad precedent that could undermine Texas’ ability to resist deployment from other states in the future.

“If any other state deployed their National Guard to Texas without our consent, we would call that an invasion of Texas,” the lawmakers said in a Tuesday letter to Abbott.

Amid challenges against his use of the National Guard, Trump has also discussed invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 if necessary, which would allow the president to use the military for civilian law enforcement. But it can only be used under specific situations, such as when requested by a state or when “unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or rebellion … make it impracticable” to enforce federal laws.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in response to the 1992 Los Angeles riots following an aid request from California’s governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

What do we know about what the Texas National Guard is doing in Illinois?

Texas Guard members were sighted in the Chicago area Tuesday morning, according to The Chicago Tribune.

“The elite Texas National Guard are on the ground and ready to go,” Abbott said in a post on X. “They are putting America first by ensuring that the federal government can safely enforce federal law.”

The following day, the U.S. Northern Command said in an update that troops were active in the greater Chicago area effective Wednesday. It says they are tasked with protecting ICE and other federal officers who are enforcing federal laws, as well as safeguarding federal properties. Troops may also “temporarily detain” individuals to stop them from interfering with federal officers, but they will not be performing arrests because “that is a law enforcement activity,” the command said.

Some Texas guards were then seen at the Broadview ICE facility, according to local media.

‘Like dogs' in ICE hold rooms Immigrants arrested by ICE in New York have faced similar conditions in temporary holding rooms.
Federal statutes and ICE standards guarantee access to legal counsel in ICE detention centers.","ALBANY - Packed into small concrete cells inside U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Oswego station, detained immigrants were falling asleep standing up or lying on top of each other.

With up to 30 people crowded in a 10-square-foot cell, the station had become the first holding site for nearly 60 workers detained in a September factory raid in the western New York town of Cato - one high-profile example among rising numbers of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests across upstate New York.

Inside, there were no beds, no showers and no hot meals delivered. Under prior presidential administrations, migrants weren't held there long - usually a few hours. But now, at least one migrant was confined in that station for a week, according to his attorney.

And while detainees languished inside the station, their attorneys were running into bureaucratic dead-ends.

Border Patrol officials refused to confirm where the detainees were being held or to allow their attorneys inside the stations. The clients' locations also did not show up in the online detainee locator maintained by ICE. Attorney Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer drove to county jails and the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility hunting for them, unaware that they were still in Border Patrol custody.

It would be days before she and attorney Jose Perez would pin down their clients' whereabouts. At that point, they had already been moved to facilities in other states.

This experience - once unprecedented - is now becoming common in New York. At border and immigration offices around the state, small cells and conference rooms intended for short waits are now being used to detain immigrants for days, forcing them to sleep on concrete floors, on benches or in chairs in spaces jammed with dozens of people.

The attorneys described cramped, uncomfortable and unhygienic conditions in the facilities and say immigrants are often unable to call family members or to get legal advice while in there. Several attorneys also recounted being unable to confirm with federal agencies that their clients were in fact detained in the locations, sometimes for days.

""Almost no one knows what's happening inside there,"" said César Cuauhtémoc García Hernández, a law professor at Ohio State University specializing in civil rights and immigration. ""Pretty much the only people who go into the … cells at the Border Patrol stations are either working for the Border Patrol or the people who are detained.""

While the number of migrants crossing the northern border has fallen dramatically this year, Border Patrol is increasingly confining migrants, including children, for extended periods in their New York stations - with around 40% staying for more than three days in June, the Times Union found. This is despite the agency's own standards advising it should generally hold migrants for no more than three days before transferring, releasing or sending them back to their country of origin.

At the same time, thousands of immigrants picked up by ICE have also experienced long waits in small holding cells at immigration courts and field offices in New York City, Buffalo, Albany, John F. Kennedy International Airport and on Long Island this year, the Times Union found. ICE had a longstanding policy of not detaining immigrants in temporary hold rooms for more than 12 hours but, in June, the federal agency issued a waiver to extend the permitted stay to three days, ""absent exceptional circumstances.""

At Federal Plaza immigration court in New York City, over 600 migrants were detained for more than three days in temporary hold rooms in the first seven months of this year, ICE data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the Times Union shows. In the overcrowded holding rooms, there were no beds, no showers, no confidential legal calls and two small meals per day, according to a lawsuit filed in August. One man in his 60s remained there for more than two months, data shows.

Meanwhile, in Buffalo, at least 180 immigrants were detained in a temporary ICE hold room in an office building this year. Forty percent of them were confined there for more than three days.

ICE said it permitted longer stays in temporary holding rooms to ""manage the surge responsibly while upholding detention standards,"" emphasizing that the move was both ""lawful and necessary.""

""The waiver is a temporary tool to ensure order, continuity, and compliance during extraordinary circumstances - not an abandonment of standards,"" said Jason Koontz, an ICE spokesman. ""ICE operates these hold rooms and holding facilities in strict accordance with its National Detention Standards (NDS) to ensure the safety, security, and humane treatment of individuals in custody. These facilities are designed for short-term processing, transfer, and repatriation, with clear limitations and oversight.""

Border Patrol officials did not respond to a request for comment.

Why the holds are happening

Long waits in temporary facilities can largely be attributed to the nationwide surge in ICE arrests amid President Donald J. Trump's deportation campaign - and a lack of adequate space for the ensuing detentions, according to ICE, immigration attorneys and academics.

Koontz characterized this heightened volume of arrests and detentions as a ""direct result of individuals choosing to break the law"" and an effort by ICE to ""restore integrity"" to the U.S. immigration system following the administration of former President Joseph L. Biden, whose policies had triggered an immigration crisis when millions of migrants flowed across U.S. borders.

Traditionally, Customs and Border Protection centers and ICE holding rooms were meant to hold detainees for initial short-term processing while agencies determined next steps: transfer to ICE facilities, release, or deportation.

But the volume of detainees has left ICE with less available space in its long-term detention centers - the majority and largest of which are concentrated along the U.S. southern border in states like Texas and Louisiana. New York, by contrast, has only one: the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia.

In New York, the issue is particularly acute. The Batavia center has been full or near capacity for many months. In other states, ICE has contracted with private prison companies and county jails to house detainees; while detentions in New York's county jails have also skyrocketed, private prisons are illegal in this state.

Koonz noted that state and local sanctuary policies have also limited ICE's ability to contract with authorities in those areas for detention services.

Some advocates believe the rise in long detentions in temporary facilities stems from a federal ""strategy"" of overpopulating detention facilities, even with people who may have open cases or qualify for hearings, to ""intimidate them into giving up their rights.""

""Even if people aren't (immediately) deportable, they are subjecting them to such harsh conditions that they're hoping that they will just choose to leave,"" said Jessica Maxwell, executive director of the Workers' Center of Central New York. ""It's a tactic.""

‘Bare bones' Border Patrol cells

The three-day time frame for Customs and Border Protection detention is a guideline, not a law or regulation. Across multiple presidential administrations, CBP has held migrants for extended periods - primarily along the southern border - with hundreds of children apparently held in custody for more than a week at times under the Biden administration, when crossings were especially high.

Nevertheless, detentions of this length used to be rare in New York. That's changing.

In June, the number of people detained by CBP for longer than three days included 74 migrants along the Buffalo border sector and 47 migrants along the Swanton sector, CBP data obtained by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by the Times Union shows. Since 2013, Buffalo had typically seen between two or less such detentions, and Swanton fewer than 15. In both sectors, the June numbers amount to nearly 40% of people held longer than CBP's benchmark.

Exhibits filed by Customs and Border Protection in federal court recently also showed seven children detained by the agency for more than three days in June in the Buffalo and Swanton sectors, and 12 in July.

CBP has New York stations in Niagara Falls, Buffalo, Wellesley Island, Oswego, Rochester, Erie, Massena, Ogdensburg, Malone and Champlain, divided between these two sectors. The Swanton sector also includes Vermont.

Unhygienic and overcrowded conditions in CBP facilities have been well documented for years, and advocates familiar with recent detentions in western New York say those conditions are more severe than ever - ""unlivable,"" according to Claire Molholm, a staff attorney at the New York Civil Liberties Union.

""There is no bedding. They are forced to sleep on a concrete bench basically,"" said Matthew Borowski, an attorney whose clients have been held at Border Patrol stations in Tonawanda and elsewhere. ""They get something like a peanut butter sandwich with chips, not real food. … It's small and bare bones.""

A nursing mother detained at the Wellesley Border Patrol station told Maxwell's team that nobody working on-site could speak Spanish to communicate with the detainees, so they asked her to translate for them. Without adequate medical care at the station, Border Patrol officers had to drive the woman to a hospital in Watertown, which is nearly 40 minutes away, because her breasts were engorging painfully due to separation from her baby, she told legal aides.

In contrast, long CBP detentions have declined in southern border sectors in Texas and California, where such detentions used to reach thousands per month, but recently have dipped to the low hundreds. But the data shows that other sectors along the northern border - Detroit, Michigan, Montana and Maine - saw swells akin to New York.

‘Like dogs' in ICE hold rooms

Immigrants arrested by ICE in New York have faced similar conditions in temporary holding rooms. Some are waiting five days or more in these spaces, data shows.

{ ""__type"": ""devHubFreeformEmbed"", ""__id"": ""Datawrapper"", ""__fallbackImage"": ""https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/nWaQ6/mobile.png"", ""__data"": { ""datawrapper_id"": ""nWaQ6"" } }

Children are among those subject to long stays in facilities not designed for overnight detention.

In June, 24 children were held in ICE's New York City holding room for more than three days, five kids in Buffalo and one in Albany, according to an exhibit the federal government filed last month in connection with a lawsuit challenging its detention policies that's pending in U.S. District Court. In July, 10 children experienced holds longer than three days in New York City, one in Albany and one in Buffalo.

In Buffalo, many immigrants have been detained in ICE's field office, located on the seventh floor of a modern office building that includes a hotel and retail shops.

Perez said before Trump's second term began in January, clients would wait there for three to four hours, but now it is three to four days.

""They are waiting in a conference room,"" he said. There are no beds, no showers and no calls permitted. ""For food, they just get some snacks, not proper food.""

Men, women and children are all confined together there, he said.

Nearby, at the 650-bed Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia, the facility is so crowded that in September, roughly 75 to 100 detained men slept on gym mats and mattresses on the floor of the gymnasium, according to a man detained in Buffalo Federal Detention Facility. He asked not to be named due to his ongoing detention. The immigrants all share one toilet, he said. He surmised some might have been there for days or longer.

Justice for Migrant Families, a Buffalo-based organization which regularly works with immigrants in that area, had never heard of those conditions under prior administrations, said Executive Director Jennifer Connor.

At ICE's Malta office, near Albany, detained immigrants can access their phones, personal belongings and landline telephones while supervised by officers in the holding area, according to an attorney who visited the space but requested not to be named to protect their clients' cases. The space also contains three lockable, cell-like rooms with no furniture and just a toilet inside.

In New York City, ICE detains 50 to 90 people at a time in the four holding rooms located on the 10th floor of the Federal Plaza immigration building, according to the class action lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union, New York Civil Liberties Union and others on behalf of people detained there.

The detainees sleep on concrete floors, are fed small rations of food twice per day, are subject to extreme hot and cold temperatures and have been denied prescription medications, the lawsuit alleges. They must use a toilet in the holding room with no privacy, wear the same clothes and are denied items like soap, toothbrushes, menstrual products and the opportunity to bathe.

""Look how we are like dogs in here,"" said an immigrant detained by ICE in one of Federal Plaza hold rooms in a video he filmed there in July that was published by the New York Times.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which is representing the Department of Homeland Security in the lawsuit, wrote in August that people held in the rooms have access to medical care, hygiene products, can call attorneys on a landline phone and are issued a change of clothes upon request. People in custody are typically fed two meals per day, a filing confirmed.

The office wrote in August most individuals are transported to other facilities within three days, ""except in exceptional circumstances."" Data shows from January to late July, 14% of waits at that holding room were longer than three days.

In September, a judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent ICE from overcrowding holding rooms and requiring them to provide bedding mats, hygiene materials, confidential calls to attorneys and space that is cleaned three times per day.

‘Legal black holes'

Temporary detention facilities pose several limitations for detainees in contrast to standard ICE centers, according to advocates. A major one is restricted access to legal counsel.

""At least there are some protocols,"" Maxwell said, regarding ICE centers and jails. ""It's clear how you make a phone call or when you get your phone access. None of that exists in these other places that are more makeshift and temporary.""

For one, it is much harder for the public to track individuals in CBP custody. Those detained for less than 48 hours do not appear in ICE's online detainee locator database, making it difficult for attorneys and family members to find them. Even after Kelley-Widmer's clients from Cato appeared in the locator, it only showed them as being in CBP custody, without information about where they were being held.

According to Albany-based immigration lawyer Matthew Geiling and New York Immigration Coalition Legal Director Rosanna Eugenio, the overlap in law enforcement agencies involved in immigration now - ICE, CBP, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. Marshals Service, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and local police - often makes it difficult to even determine who has custody of a person.

Kelley-Widmer's experience is a common one, according to Eugenio, who said that CBP often refuses to confirm whether someone is in its custody.

""Essentially, that's just kidnapping,"" she said. ""When (we) don't know where the person is and you won't tell us, what is the recourse for that person's family member or their attorney or their community?""

Even when attorneys can locate their clients in detention, they are typically barred from meeting with them inside CBP stations - a longstanding practice that lawsuits have alleged is turning the facilities into ""legal black holes"" that leave detainees ""incommunicado"" with the outside world. That was the case for Kelley-Widmer and Perez.

Federal statutes and ICE standards guarantee access to legal counsel in ICE detention centers. CBP has argued, however, that these requirements do not apply to their detainees because of a federal regulation that excludes inspections at ports of entry from the right to legal counsel.

And once detainees are transferred to other states, attorneys like Kelley-Widmer are no longer able to represent them in certain matters because they are not licensed in those states.

She and her team at the Cornell University clinic are still working with one Cato client because they are co-counseling with a Texas attorney. For most detainees, however, the transfer effectively ends their legal representation, as they struggle to find new counsel - especially pro bono lawyers - in other states.

""If they cannot access supports such as loved ones and attorneys, they are very likely to accept the pressure to sign documents agreeing to their deportation,"" she said.

As of early October, Maxwell said at least 10 of the Cato workers had been deported.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aJ41Ckixai6v7yrPMwpNuw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/albany_times_union_471/f57e851423b0e2829be37d69c0a19276,N,,2025-10-12 12:58:10.658686

Extralegal detention and law enforcement terrorism are as native to Chicago as deep-dish pizza and ketchup-free hot dogs.
The tactics that the federal agents have used against the crowds have been so aggressive that another judge temporarily blocked the use of tear gas and pepper balls.","The fragrant steam rose from the plates of pasta like mist from a hot spring as the famished Venezuelan newcomers lined up to eat on a frozen Chicago November afternoon in 2023. Many arrived in shorts and flip-flops.

I had partnered with local restaurateur Eldridge Williams to help feed and clothe the group, who had been bused up to my hometown along with other “sanctuary cities” run by Democrats by Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas as part of an inhumane political stunt. Chicagoans stepped up to aid these people in need.

It was a strain, as Mr. Abbott knew it would be. The newly elected mayor of Chicago, Brandon Johnson, had to reallocate already tight resources to help. Much of the responsibility of providing for the Venezuelans ended up being shouldered by Chicago’s Black community: Shelters were placed in our neighborhoods, and services were diverted away from our most vulnerable.

The apparent chaos of these arrivals, hyped by the right-wing media, helped re-elect Donald Trump. And it led directly to what happened this past week, when the federal government began treating my city like enemy territory. Rappelling out of helicopters like in a scene from “Black Hawk Down,” federal agents raided an apartment building in the predominantly Black community of South Shore, knocking down doors, separating children from their zip-tied parents and detaining people barely clothed.

Many people in Chicago assumed the targets of this action would be limited to immigrants, some of whom were, according to Trump administration officials, engaged in criminal activity. But the effects rained down on Black citizens who were caught up in the raid, too. Some Black Chicagoans expressed indignation and disbelief at seeing us be brutalized by Mr. Trump’s deployments, with one young brother exclaiming as he watched federal agents appear to choke a Black man on the street, “Ya’ll supposed to be choking Mexicans.”

At its heart, his comment speaks to Mr. Trump’s success in dividing us from one another and our humanity: a nagging devil on the shoulder of struggling Americans barely scraping together the rent and telling them someone else is to blame. It also reflects the divisions within the African diaspora, where it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that—like my own father—many Black people are also immigrants, experiencing their own traumas at the sight of these cruelties.

I visited the apartment complex on 75th Street and South Shore Drive after the raid. A friend of mine who is a journalist, Maira Khwaja of the Invisible Institute, had been one of the first on the ground and warned me of the wreckage that had been left behind by the mayhem, but seeing it in person was shocking. Tension loomed in the air even days later. A child’s soiled pink unicorn toy seemed to cry out for help beneath a broken headboard and an uprooted mattress. My heart breaks for the lessons of worthlessness being taught to these children.

Conversations with the victims of ICE’s South Shore raid reveal a people divided. One man expressed love for his new Venezuelan neighbors, one of whom helped him fix his car. Others burn with contempt, like a hot coal in weathered hands. These are hands that all too often can’t find work and are perfectly primed for pointing the finger. “I don’t agree with how they did it, but they needed to get them out,” said one disgruntled neighborhood resident.

And I get it: Not long ago, I welcomed a friend home from prison with the help of Gov. JB Pritzker. I was hopeful he’d be eligible for subsidized housing through the state’s re-entry programs, only to find that many of the opportunities had been siphoned off to the Venezuelan immigrants, and nothing was available. A crisis of conservative design, this desperate scramble for scarce resources is a rife breeding ground for ethnic animosity.

The reality of the Black American experience is that being at the heel of a racially unjust society means that the oppression of anyone invariably affects us.

Extralegal detention and law enforcement terrorism are as native to Chicago as deep-dish pizza and ketchup-free hot dogs. This is the city of the disgraced detective Jon Burge, who, after leaving the military police, joined the Chicago Police Department and deployed what have been likened to military black sites to torture what has been estimated to be over 100 Black men in the 1970s to early ’90s, causing the city to pay out over $100 million in settlements. After Laquan McDonald was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke in 2014, protests erupted downtown over his death. Then, after George Floyd, as in other cities full of people fed up with police brutality, many of us took to the streets. Some protesters vandalized property in that heated moment.

The question now is: How will Chicago’s residents respond? The protests started small, but as the stakes of the federal incursion ramp up, with Mr. Trump ordering Department of Homeland Security agents in and attempting to deploy the National Guard as well (which has been blocked, for now, by the courts), the crowds have gotten bigger and the mood more defiant. The tactics that the federal agents have used against the crowds have been so aggressive that another judge temporarily blocked the use of tear gas and pepper balls. All of this could eventually provoke peaceful demonstrators into revolt, which would also turn Chicago into the “war zone” Mr. Trump and his administration keep saying our city is, as a justification for his sending in his forces in the first place.

In Season 7 of Showtime’s “The Chi,” a show on which I appear as the character Jamal, there’s a moment when he’s shot in an attack meant for someone else and he has to wrestle with how to respond. In my creative exploration for the role, I contemplated the enormous weight of forgiveness and restraint. I sat in silence with Jamal’s gnawing, burning urge for revenge. I thought of the damage and the destruction it would do to his family, to his younger sister, who was left abandoned during Jamal’s previous incarceration. And ultimately, for the greater good of himself, and his loved ones, my character decided against it.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/12/multimedia/12mensa-mkfh/12mensa-mkfh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 09:56:32.172199

Over 150 court cases have been filed as part of democracy litigation efforts against Trump’s administration, with several recent victories for opponents.
Meanwhile, Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and ICE agents has faced fierce resistance.
On the immigration front, ICE raids and National Guard deployments have sparked outrage and further litigation.
As the nation braces for the next wave of protests and legal battles, one thing is clear: the struggle for the soul of American democracy is far from over.","Donald Trump’s second term has been marked by a series of extraordinary and controversial moves that have left the nation’s democratic institutions under strain and sparked a groundswell of opposition across the country. In recent weeks, the former president has ramped up his use of executive power, targeting political adversaries, deploying federal forces to American cities, and facing a mounting wave of legal challenges and public protests. The events of early October 2025 encapsulate the high-stakes battle now raging between Trump’s administration and defenders of the rule of law.

According to Publisher's Roundup, Trump has increasingly relied on extraordinary powers—pressuring allies to prosecute perceived enemies and using the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to suppress peaceful demonstrations. These actions, the publication argues, are not signs of strength, but of deep insecurity and mounting weakness. “Trump’s abuse of power is a sign of his insecurity and weakness, and it is setting up massive, peaceful, lawful opposition,” the article contends.

The legal front has been especially active. Over 150 court cases have been filed as part of democracy litigation efforts against Trump’s administration, with several recent victories for opponents. As reported by The Atlantic, this wave of litigation has become “the anti-Trump strategy that’s actually working.” In particular, Trump’s push to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James on what critics call “unmerited charges” has drawn national attention. This follows the similarly controversial indictment of former FBI Director James Comey just a week earlier. Legal experts, including Richard Painter and Virginia Canter, have already filed multiple ethics complaints against the administration, and more may be on the way.

Meanwhile, Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and ICE agents has faced fierce resistance. In Chicago, at least three court orders have halted aspects of the administration’s activities in the city, as reported in early October 2025. Federal Judge Karin Immergut temporarily blocked the deployment of National Guard troops to Oregon, warning that the administration’s arguments “risk blurring the line between civil and military federal power—to the detriment of this nation,” according to Zeteo. When the Trump administration attempted to send hundreds of National Guard troops from California and Texas to Oregon and Chicago, Judge Immergut broadened her order, stating the effort was “in direct contravention” of her decision.

These legal setbacks have been accompanied by a collapse in Trump’s popularity. As Publisher's Roundup notes, “Trump is at historic lows in popularity at this early point in his term.” The American public, by and large, disapproves of the prosecution of Trump’s opponents, the aggressive use of federal forces, and the chaos that has come to define his administration. The electoral consequences have been dire for Trump’s party: Democrats have won or outperformed in 42 of 43 elections held in 2025, signaling a potential sea change in the political landscape.

Public protest has surged to levels not seen in decades. The No Kings protests, which first swept the nation in June 2025 in response to Trump’s military deployments in Los Angeles, are set for a second coast-to-coast iteration on October 18. With planned National Guard deployments in Portland and Chicago, and a recent deployment in Memphis, millions of Americans are expected to take to the streets. Political scientist Erica Chenoweth’s research suggests that when 3.5% of the population stands against a tyrannical regime, it cannot continue—a threshold that activists believe is within reach.

Press freedom has also come under intense pressure. Both independent and mainstream media have become more outspoken in their criticism of the administration. The New York Times ran a headline reading, “Letitia James Indicted After Trump’s Pressure Campaign,” signaling a break from its traditional neutrality. Meanwhile, journalists and civil society groups in Chicago have sued the Trump administration, alleging a “pattern of extreme brutality” by federal agents at protests, aimed at silencing both the press and civilians. A federal judge recently issued a 14-day order prohibiting federal agents from using physical force or arresting journalists in Chicago without probable cause, and restricting the use of riot control weapons.

Political leadership, particularly among Democrats, has become more unified in opposition to Trump’s authoritarian tactics. State attorneys general, governors, and national party leaders have coalesced to resist efforts to strip health care from millions and oppose government shutdowns. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have been credited with winning the messaging war during the ongoing government shutdown, making clear that Democratic votes would not be used to undermine essential services.

Yet, the administration’s aggressive posture persists. On social media, Trump has called for the removal and even jailing of political opponents, including Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. Pritzker fired back, calling Trump “unhinged,” “insecure,” and a “wannabe dictator,” and declared, “If you come for my people, you come through me. So come and get me.”

Trump’s foreign and domestic policy moves have also drawn scrutiny. Despite claiming credit for a ceasefire in Gaza and angling for a Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian committee passed him over in 2025—a development that set off a storm among his supporters. Meanwhile, the administration has conducted strikes on alleged drug boats in international waters, with legal experts warning that the Department of Justice’s classified opinions grant the president “such extraordinary powers that he alone can decide to prosecute a war far broader than what Congress authorized after the attacks on 9/11,” according to CNN.

On the immigration front, ICE raids and National Guard deployments have sparked outrage and further litigation. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson issued an executive order barring federal immigration agents from using city property, stating, “We will not tolerate ICE agents violating our residents’ constitutional rights nor will we allow the federal government to disregard our local authority.” Anti-ICE protests have erupted in Chicago, Portland, and other cities, as activists decry what they see as unconstitutional crackdowns on ordinary Americans.

Within the federal government, the Trump administration has initiated mass firings, with Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought announcing that “Reduction in Force” notices have gone out, though it remains unclear which agencies are affected. The government shutdown has exposed further fault lines, as the administration considers withholding back pay from some furloughed federal workers—a move not seen since the 1960s.

Against this backdrop, the fate of American democracy hangs in the balance. While the damage wrought by Trump’s policies—both at home and abroad—is undeniable, the resilience of legal institutions, the press, political leaders, and ordinary citizens has become a defining feature of this tumultuous era. As the nation braces for the next wave of protests and legal battles, one thing is clear: the struggle for the soul of American democracy is far from over.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/LeVuIBso68J7lUCWRIV9OVeBc1k=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2Fcc342760-fe2e-4045-ae1a-85b5e5596075.jpeg,N,,2025-10-12 11:57:33.089743

But after approaching Illinois State Police officers standing outside the facility, the group’s communion request was rebuffed.

The processing facility has been at the center of ongoing demonstrations in recent weeks. About 11 a.m., protesters marched down Lexington Street toward the center, praying and singing.

Illinois State Police Lt. Col. Jason Bradley called the facility with the religious leaders’ request to give communion. Bradley said ICE denied the request.

Bradley said no reason was given for the denial.

ICE didn’t immediately return a request for comment on why the request was denied.

About 1,000 members of Chicago-area parishes and of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership were part of the delegation.

When the leaders announced to the group that ICE had declined the request, people started yelling “Shame! Shame!”

The group had communion among themselves in the parking lot and street before dispersing to either walk home or board yellow school buses the organizers had rented to take people home.

The Rev. Larry Dowling, one of the priests holding the communion elements, said, “We’re just very disappointed because we simply wanted to bring the love of God and the presence of the Eucharist to these prisoners, which we had been allowed to do before all this stuff happened. So they’re basically rejecting us bringing the presence of Christ and the love of God.”

A spokesperson for the coalition pointed to the 2008 Access to Religious Ministry Act, which allows religious workers “reasonable access” to jails and people in immigration detention facilities to meet with those who wish to “consult about their spiritual needs.”

“ICE has completely shut down and [is] not allowing any ministers inside to provide communion and religious support for many weeks now,” said spokesperson Sarah Rand of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership. Rand was unsure whether any attempts by other groups had been successful.

Chuck Fitzsimmons led the singing during the procession along Lexington Street to the ICE facility.

“In one sense [the music] keeps up your spirits, but also it focuses us on the message that we are here as one, brothers and sisters all,” he said.

He said he was sad to not be able to share communion with the detainees. “However, these are the times and these are the morals, and I think we were prepared to be denied,” he said.

On Saturday, crews put up barricades in front of the fence that a judge ordered removed by Tuesday per state police orders, according to a crew person on site.

U.S. District Judge LaShonda A. Hunt issued a temporary restraining order Thursday ordering the removal of the fence outside the processing facility to be taken down immediately.

The fence, erected in September, was still up as of Saturday afternoon. Officials have until 11:59 p.m. Tuesday to take it down.

Before the clergy arrived, dozens of protesters had already gathered at Harvard Street and 25th Avenue.

About 30 minutes ahead of Broadview’s 6 p.m. protest curfew, some protesters went onto 25th Avenue to heckle a vehicle full of federal agents. Police then declared an unlawful assembly and pushed protesters down the street. State and sheriff’s confirmed 15 arrests throughout the day. Protesters arrested earlier Saturday face charges including destruction of government property, aggravated battery to a police officer, mob action and resisting or obstructing an officer.

About 7 p.m. Illinois State Police retreated and protesters cleared the roadway as Illinois Department of Transportation made small adjustments to the barriers around the designated free speech zones along 25th Avenue and demonstrators largely dispersed.

The ICE facility is the site of ongoing and often tense demonstrations, with agents deploying chemical irritants and rubber pellets, since President Donald Trump’s administration aggressively ramped up a deportation campaign in the Chicago area last month under the name “Operation Midway Blitz.”

Since then, protesters have arrived at the facility in the early morning hours, sometimes as early as 5 a.m. and have clashed with federal authorities into the late night hours.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d21b62f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7712x4402+0+371/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F88%2Fa8%2F6fb987c244eb9fa51696a552be7f%2Fbroadview-101225-035.jpg,N,,2025-10-12 12:57:42.188328

Over the last decade, the front line of civil rights activism has been the struggle for police accountability — for a more humane and equitable system of public safety.
He is also the editor of the book “A Worthy Tradition: Freedom of Speech in America,” written by his father Harry Kalven Jr.","Where is the line between “democracy” and “fascism”? Since President Donald Trump’s return to power nine months ago, that question has been posed again and again in response to the latest affront to human dignity, common sense and/or constitutional norms committed by his administration.

Arguably, however, this is the wrong question in that it assumes there is some precise threshold beyond which we cease to be free. Those who have experienced fascist takeovers elsewhere warn that if we insist on a definitive answer to that question, we will only belatedly realize that the walls have closed in around us. The danger is that we will drift — disoriented, unmoored, bewildered — into the iron cage of tyranny.

While there may be no red line from which to take our bearings, recent events have pulled back the curtain on the nature and trajectory of the Trump regime’s fascist project. In their haste to exploit the murder of Charlie Kirk, Trump and senior members of his team have revealed their contempt for fundamental First Amendment principles. The president has ruminated about the possibility of making it a crime to criticize him. Multiple voices in the administration have demanded punishment for anyone who speaks of Kirk in less than reverential terms. Calling for a crusade against the forces of “evil” and “wickedness,” Trump’s chief of staff Stephen Miller has conjured a vast left-wing “domestic terror network.” Vice President JD Vance has said it is exemplified by the Nation magazine and the Open Society Institute founded by George Soros.

(Full disclosure: I am a Nation contributor and have been an Open Society fellow. So if you are curious about the face of terrorism, according to the administration, I’m your guy.)

The “us versus them” logic of fascism is voracious. We have seen the category of “the enemy within” rapidly expand from MS-13 and Tren de Aragua gang members to the majority of the population that dissents from the MAGA-certified state ideology.

What has been revealed in recent weeks is ugly but deeply familiar. We have seen it before, and we have seen effective resistance to it. What is critical at this juncture is to be clear about the nature of the threat. Even with a supine Congress and compliant Supreme Court, it is unlikely the administration could effectively repeal the First Amendment by turning seditious libel (criticism of the government) and blasphemy into crimes. Rather, it has adopted a transparent strategy of seeking to provoke civil disorder in order to justify crushing dissent.

Sixty years ago, my father Harry Kalven Jr., a constitutional scholar, coined the term “heckler’s veto” to describe a situation in which those hostile to a speaker’s message seek to suppress it by threatening disorder. If the police restore order by silencing the speaker, they give the heckler a veto over public discussion. Censorship is thus achieved by a circuitous process.

The context in which my father developed the heckler’s veto concept was the Civil Rights Movement of the early 1960s, when those engaged in nonviolent protests against segregation in the South were often met by hostile crowds. Local authorities would then use the threat of disorder as a rationale for suppressing the protests.

On several occasions during that era, the federal government, over the objections of Southern governors, deployed federal troops to protect those exercising their constitutional rights. Among the photographs that illuminate that moment, one is especially telling: the image of 6-year-old Ruby Bridges entering a previously all-white elementary school, accompanied by U.S. marshals, while hostile white people jeer and heckle.

Today, the federal government is the heckler. Its military interventions in Chicago and in other targeted cities do not seek to maintain order and protect the constitutional rights of the vulnerable. Rather, at the direction of the heckler-in-chief, they are designed to provoke disorder that can then be seized upon as a rationale for declaring a state of emergency and suppressing dissent.

This theater of cruelty — masked federal agents terrorizing migrant families and brazenly attacking protesters and journalists — is not a matter of misconduct by the officers involved. On the contrary, they are delivering the message the administration intends to send.

In this respect, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement television commercial seeking to recruit local officers that has recently been airing in Chicago is revealing. “You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city safe. But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free,” the ad declares. “Join ICE, and help us catch the worst of the worst.” The subtext is clear: Join us and be relieved of constitutional constraints and the nuisance of accountability. Enjoy impunity.

Over the last decade, the front line of civil rights activism has been the struggle for police accountability — for a more humane and equitable system of public safety. Similarly, declaring Chicago a sanctuary city is an expression of care for and solidarity with our neighbors. These civic aspirations are now under siege. In contrast to the federal interventions of the 1960s in support of those working to desegregate the Jim Crow South, we now confront a white supremacist regime seeking to undo the limited but real achievements of pluralism and tolerance.

While there is reason to hope that legal challenges to federal intervention and to ICE practices will ultimately prevail, it is important to recognize that we confront a rogue regime that has contempt for the rule of law and is in the process of building a massive paramilitary force answerable only to the president.

The terms of engagement are thus daunting. They are also clear. It is up to us all — elected officials, civil society, the press — to defend First Amendment freedoms by exercising them in the place where we live. Challenges abound: for protesters, to maintain nonviolent discipline; for public officials, to hold their ground in the face of economic retaliation; for police and military, to honor their oath to uphold the Constitution when given clearly unconstitutional orders; and for the press, to remain agile and work together to bear witness to events on the ground.

In meeting the moment, we can take heart from historian Hannah Arendt’s distinction between violence and power, which she saw as opposites. Power arises when people act together for a common purpose, as Chicagoans have been doing across the city by confronting ICE, providing legal and material aid to those targeted by the federal dragnet, and building networks for sharing information. Seen in isolation, these efforts may be small-scale and intensely local, but in the aggregate, they are building capacity for civil resistance. Violence, by contrast, is purely instrumental. It can destroy power but not create it. It is an expression of impotence. Only people acting in concert can generate power.

The great Irish poet Seamus Heaney, who was well acquainted with sectarian violence, said it best: “What looks the strongest has outlived its term. The future lies with what’s affirmed from under.”

The short-order cook always let someone know if he was running late, even by just five minutes. Earlier that morning, Villegas Gonzalez, 38, had been fatally shot by a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, shortly after dropping his children off at a school and daycare in the suburb of Franklin Park.

The agents were attempting to arrest him as part of a massive immigration sweep launched by US President Donald Trump. Villegas Gonzalez was the Chicago crackdown's first casualty.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said, after the 12 September incident, that Villegas Gonzalez was ""a criminal illegal alien"" with ""a history of reckless driving"", who steered his car at agents, causing one to fear for his life and fire his weapon, killing Villegas Gonzalez.

DHS told Reuters on Friday (local time) that it would conduct its own investigation into the incident, after the first agency that responded had finished its review.

Both Franklin Park police and the FBI responded to the shooting incident, but it wasn't clear which agency was investigating.

The FBI declined to comment, citing a lack of staff to respond to media inquiries, due to the government shutdown.

Franklin Park police did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

A reserved boy from Irimbo

Reuters interviews with family and coworkers, and a review of public records, present a more nuanced picture of a man who left his quiet village years ago for economic opportunity and worked long hours to support his children.

A man who had become sober after heavy drinking, resulting in liver disease, and who had become one woman's steadfast partner.

""He was so soft-spoken,"" said Ashley Alekna, manager of the diner, describing him as a kind, dependable presence during his 11-hour shifts in a kitchen full of boisterous personalities, making food for the crowds that spilled in from the community college across the street.

Villegas Gonzalez made a similar impression on partner Blanca Mora, when they were growing up in Irimbo, a small town in Michoacán, Mexico.

Mora said they were in their early teens, when they started greeting each other around town, meeting to chat on the corner near her grandparents' house.

People often leave Irimbo for opportunities beyond the tiny town, including Villegas Gonzalez's older brother, Jorge.

Jorge, who first went to the US in 1998, remembers his little brother watching him walk away.

""He was a kid,"" said Jorge. ""He hid, so I wouldn't see him crying.""

Father of two

In 2007, Silverio followed his brother north, part of a wave of more than 348,000 Mexican emigrants to the US that year, US Census data showed, as President Felipe Calderon's violent war against drug cartels deepened.

Villegas Gonzalez found employment in the restaurant kitchens, where - according to recent National Restaurant Association data - 46 percent of the nation's chefs and 31 percent of its cooks are foreign-born.

He met a woman and they had two sons. Jorge Villegas Gonzalez said his younger brother often struggled to cover the bills.

Between 2011-19, Villegas Gonzalez was cited for a handful of traffic offences, one for driving more than 48kmh over the speed limit.

He was also ticketed for driving an uninsured vehicle and having a broken taillight. He had no criminal record.

His abuse of alcohol during those years led to a diagnosis of liver disease, he told Alekna later. A doctor told him that, if he kept drinking, it would kill him.

He had been sober for more than a year when he died, co-workers and Mora said.

Mora and Villegas Gonzalez fell out of touch, when he moved to the US, but she eventually moved there too, looking for her mother, who had left Mexico to better support her three children years before.

She never found her mother, but she found love with the reserved boy from home. She visited him when he was sick and later the two became a couple. Villegas Gonzalez, his two sons, Mora and her 13-year-old daughter eventually all lived together in Franklin Park.

A family in Franklin Park

Mora said Villegas Gonzalez took his sons to the library three times a week, played with Lego and banned phones at the dinner table, so the newly blended family could focus on each other.

He began to open up to his co-workers, said Alekna, cracking little jokes throughout the day. When his younger son celebrated his birthday, they helped him bake a Minecraft video game-themed cake with green icing.

The morning he was killed, Villegas Gonzalez dropped his older son off at Passow Elementary School in Franklin Park and then his younger son at Small World Learning Center, just around the corner. Minutes later, surveillance video from a nail salon showed ICE agents pulling him over, each leaning into his front car windows.

Villegas Gonzalez backed up and tried to drive away, as the agent on the passenger side chased on foot. The agent on the driver's side was not visible, as Villegas Gonzalez drove forward.

In separate surveillance footage from another nearby business, what sounds like two gunshots can be heard around the same time. Police records and bodycam footage indicated that Villegas Gonzalez quickly crashed into a parked delivery truck.

A few hours later, Jorge Villegas Gonzalez was driving a minibus through the streets of Irimbo when he got the call that his brother was dead.

Villegas Gonzalez's two boys were taken to foster care, Mora said.

The guard troops in Memphis remain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.
Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.
“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.
And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.","The national guard troops Donald Trump sent to Illinois can remain in the state and under federal control but can’t be deployed, an appeals court ruled on Saturday.

The appeals court granted a pause in the case until it can hear further arguments.

The decision to prevent the troops from protecting federal property or going on patrol comes after federal judge April Perry ruled on Thursday to temporarily block the national guard deployment for at least two weeks, finding no substantial evidence that a “danger of rebellion” is brewing in Illinois as Trump continues his immigration crackdown in major cities across the US.

On Friday, Democratic US senators Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth said they had visited an immigration enforcement building near Chicago but were barred from going inside.

The senators stopped by the facility in suburban Broadview on Friday, requesting a tour of the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility and to deliver supplies to protesters who have been demonstrating at the site for weeks.

Their visit coincides with a ruling that the fencing installed at the site must be taken down. A federal judge late Thursday ordered Ice to remove an 8ft-tall (2.4 meters) fence outside the Broadview facility after the Village of Broadview said it illegally blocks a public street.

Both senators spoke to the local NBC News affiliate while there and have pushed for answers and called for oversight into the conditions inside the facility.

“We just want to go in and look at the facility and see what the conditions are and they would not let us in. It is shameful,” Duckworth said.

“They’ve refused to tell us this information,” Durbin stated. “I’ve done this job for a few years now, I’ve never had this stonewalling by any presidential administration.”

“What are you afraid of?” Duckworth said to reporters, referring to the government. “You don’t hide, you don’t run away when you’re proud of what you’re doing.”

The senators said they have congressional oversight authority.

“Something is going on in there they don’t want us to see,” Durbin said. “I don’t know what it is.”

To the south, in Tennessee, at least nine armed guard members began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, a Memphis landmark, about a mile (1.6km) from historic Beale Street and FedExForum, where the NBA’s Grizzlies play.

They also were at a nearby tourist welcome center along the Mississippi River. Wearing guard fatigues and protective vests labeled “military police”, the troops were escorted by a local police officer and posed for photos with visitors.

Trump has sent or discussed sending troops to other cities as well, including Baltimore; the District of Columbia; New Orleans; and the California cities of Oakland, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The federal government says the troops support immigration agents and protect federal property.

The guard troops in Memphis remain under the command of the Republican governor, Bill Lee, who supports their use to further a federal crackdown on crime.

By contrast, Trump has attempted to deploy national guard troops – including some from Texas and California – in Portland and Chicago after taking control of them himself, over objections from state and local leaders who say such interference violates their sovereignty and federal law. Federal courts in Illinois and Oregon this week blocked Trump’s efforts to send troops out in those cities.

The US district judge April Perry in Chicago said the Trump administration had violated the 10th amendment, which grants certain powers to states, and the 14th amendment, which assures due process and equal protection, when he ordered national guard troops to that city.

In a written order Friday explaining her rationale, Perry noted the nation’s long aversion to having military involvement in domestic policing.

“Not even the Founding Father most ardently in favor of a strong federal government” – referring to Alexander Hamilton – “believed that one state’s militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” Perry wrote.

“The court confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the national guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” the Illinois governor, JB Pritzker, said.

An earlier court battle in Oregon delayed a similar troop deployment to Portland. The 9th US circuit court of appeals heard arguments in that case Thursday.

Lt Cmdr Teresa Meadows, a spokesperson for US northern command, said the troops sent to Portland and Chicago are “not conducting any operational activities at this time”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3369c14ac045b44fc198005afcd52efd994da41f/483_0_6827_5464/master/6827.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae0103029435ab57fff1cde4f9139fb",N,,2025-10-12 02:56:40.876057

At least 15 people were arrested on Saturday outside the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility in suburban Broadview during a day of escalating tensions between protesters and police.

Demonstrators gathered near 25th Avenue and Harvard Street, where they called out federal agents and the Trump administration's immigration enforcement campaign called ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

Alexis Garcia, a Bolingbrook resident who was among the crowd, said she was feeling a wave of emotions.

“Sad and anger, just feeling hopeless at the same time, but hopeful. It’s just a lot of emotions,” she said. “Being Mexican right now, it's just a sensitive time for us.”

She brought her dad to Broadview for the first time.

“I share how I feel with my peers, with my family and educate him with what’s happening because he deserves to know, just like the whole world deserves to know what’s really happening,” she said.

As the sun began to set, Illinois State Police tried to disperse the crowd, enforcing an executive order signed by the village's mayor to limit protesting hours from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

“We’re agitated by this restriction, by the way,” said Dr. Alli Muhammad, national leader of the Revolutionary Black Panther Party. “We feel that the mayor of Broadview, she considers herself an ally, but we’re not comfortable with this 9 to 6 curfew, so we’re going to present this cease and desist to remove the curfew.”

Earlier in the day, religious leaders marched from St. Eulalia Catholic Church in Maywood to the processing facility during a eucharistic procession.

Clergy members arrived, praying for the people detained and even attempted to serve communion to those inside but they were denied access.

U.S. Senator Dick Durbin joined faith-based leaders and community members for a service at the church before the procession.

“I am here as an elected representative with this organization and these people to tell them what is going on. The fear and hatred is giving rise—this is not America,” he said. “We’re better than that, this is not what Chicago is all about and shouldn’t be—we’re a great city and a great nation, and we will stand up to them.”

Trump has previously sent the National Guard to other Democratic-led cities, such as Los Angeles, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon.
The US military said this week there were 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and 200 members of the Texas National Guard activated in the Chicago area.
""Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,"" Saturday's appeals court order said.
Officials in Illinois and Chicago had sued the Trump administration, arguing the deployment was a ""grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty"".","A federal appeals court has ruled that US President Donald Trump's administration cannot deploy the National Guard in Illinois.

The Chicago-based US Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit also ruled that the force could remain under federal control for now.

The decision partially upheld a lower court ruling that blocked the deployment of troops in the Chicago area, which said it was ""likely to lead to civil unrest"" and ""only add fuel to the fire"".

Trump has previously sent the National Guard to other Democratic-led cities, such as Los Angeles, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon.

He has argued troops were needed to crack down on illegal immigration and crime, but local officials have filed lawsuits accusing him of exceeding his legal authority.

The US military said this week there were 300 members of the Illinois National Guard and 200 members of the Texas National Guard activated in the Chicago area.

""Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,"" Saturday's appeals court order said.

On Thursday, US District Court Judge April Perry granted a temporary restraining order blocking the troop deployment in Illinois.

The Biden appointee wrote: ""I have seen no credible evidence that there has been rebellion in the state of Illinois.""

Officials in Illinois and Chicago had sued the Trump administration, arguing the deployment was a ""grave intrusion on Illinois' sovereignty"".

Chicago has been a particular flashpoint since the Trump administration launched Operation Midway Blitz in September to detain and deport undocumented migrants.

Trump's September deployment of 200 National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon is still being challenged in the courts.

Last week, it was blocked by Oregon District Judge Karin Immergut, who was appointed by Trump during his first term in the White House.

She wrote that the administration's justification for the deployment ""was simply untethered to the facts"".

In June, Trump sent 4,000 National Guard and 700 Marines to Los Angeles to quell at-times violent protests over immigration raids in the city.

”Now this new ruling seeks to stop us from protecting our ICE Broadview facility, the detainees being processed in it, and our law enforcement officers,” McLaughlin said in an emailed statement.
During arguments in the lawsuit Tuesday, Hunt began by warning both sides she didn’t want to get caught up in the politics of the moment.
“There are so many words we could use here, but it is volatile.
Broadview residents are scared as ICE facility becomes a battleground for Trump immigration blitz “Our understanding is that a Greyhound bus can fit through that gate,” said attorney Thomas Walsh of the U.S. attorney’s office’s civil litigation division.","A federal judge has ruled that a controversial security fence constructed around the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Broadview is violating the west suburb’s right to access its own land and ordered its removal.

In a ruling Thursday night, U.S. District Judge LaShonda Hunt said it was clear from the government’s own arguments that “there is no plan to take the fence down and that ‘Operation Midway Blitz‘ currently has no end in sight.”

In addition, the judge said, ICE acting Director Todd Lyons wrote in a letter to the village that the agency has an issue with “unlawful assemblies” of protesters and there “will be no change in our operational posture” until the demonstrations stop.

“In other words, the (defendants’) current operations are indefinite and the protests — which Acting Director Lyons seemingly considers to fall into the category of ‘unlawful activities’ — will undoubtedly continue,” Hunt wrote in her opinion. “Under these circumstances, the court concludes that because the persistent protests are a direct response to the defendants’ ongoing operations, there is no reason to believe that they will end and that the fence will be voluntarily removed any time soon.”

The fence must be removed by 11:59 p.m. Tuesday, the judge ordered.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson said in a written statement the ruling was “a decisive win for public safety.”

“The judge’s decision confirms that the illegal fence constructed by ICE is not only a clear defiance of Broadview’s ordinance but an unacceptable and escalating risk to our Beach Street businesses, their customers, and our first responders,” Thompson wrote. “The law of probability dictates that the danger increases daily. The court has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge’s order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.”

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, decried “activist judges” and local leaders she says are attempting to stop lawful immigration enforcement.

”Now this new ruling seeks to stop us from protecting our ICE Broadview facility, the detainees being processed in it, and our law enforcement officers,” McLaughlin said in an emailed statement. “It is shameful that this is coming less than one week after the attack by domestic terrorists who rammed their cars into our DHS officers’ vehicles.”

The fence, she said, was extended only after “rioters and sanctuary politicians obstructed law enforcement, threw tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.”

The village of Broadview last week filed a motion for a restraining order requiring the removal of the 8-foot-tall fence, which was constructed around the temporary holding facility on Beach Street that has seen daily protests and federal agents using tear gas and other weapons on crowds.

During arguments in the lawsuit Tuesday, Hunt began by warning both sides she didn’t want to get caught up in the politics of the moment.

“It is very charged, it is very challenging,” Hunt said. “There are so many words we could use here, but it is volatile. But those issues are not before me.”

Attorneys for Broadview argued that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, constructed the fence “in the middle of the night without notice,” and that it not only physically deprives the village of its right to control its own land, but constitutes a public safety hazard by blocking emergency service personnel and vehicles from reaching several commercial and industrial properties located on the other side.

Lawyers for the government, meanwhile, said the village still has access to the area through a key-card gate on another street, and that complaints that the gate was too small for fire trucks did not hold water.

Broadview residents are scared as ICE facility becomes a battleground for Trump immigration blitz

“Our understanding is that a Greyhound bus can fit through that gate,” said attorney Thomas Walsh of the U.S. attorney’s office’s civil litigation division.

Walsh said the government had “no other option” than to put up the fence because protesters were gathering day after day and accosting law enforcement outside the facility, inciting violence and slashing tires of ICE vehicles pulling in and out of a secure lot.

“This went on for weeks,” Walsh said. “If the fence comes down, it is very foreseeable that the same kind of violence is going to occur.”

Hunt pointed out the building had been there for 40 years without issue, yet no one seemed to have a plan for protesters once the Trump administration’s immigration push began.

The Trump administration said it had targeted more than 1,400 employees at the Treasury Department, and nearly 1,200 employees at the Department of Health and Human Services, where notices started to reach some workers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by late Friday.

The administration also proceeded with layoffs at the Commerce Department, the Education Department, the Energy Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, according to the court filing, which indicated that the cuts at many of those agencies would range into the hundreds.

By seeking to oust civil servants during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight.

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.
“I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.” Gov.","A federal appeals court in Chicago on Saturday denied the Trump administration’s request for an emergency stay of a district judge’s order barring the president from deploying National Guard troops in the city and state.

The 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals did, however, grant a temporary stay on a portion of U.S. District Judge April Perry’s order involving the federalization of the National Guard within Illinois.

“Members of the National Guard do not need to return to their home states unless further ordered by a court to do so,” the court order said.

The ruling keeps in effect Perry’s granting of a temporary restraining order Thursday halting President Donald Trump’s plan to send federalized National Guard troops into the Chicago area to act as a security force during the administration’s controversial immigration enforcement action known as “Operation Midway Blitz.”

The Department of Justice argued in a filing Friday night that Perry’s order “improperly impinges on the Commander in Chief’s supervision of military operations, countermands a military directive to officers in the field, and endangers federal personnel and property.”

The 20-page motion asked the higher court to freeze Perry’s order while an appeal is pending, saying the National Guard should be allowed to “protect federal personnel and property” while the litigation continues to play out.

In a response on Saturday, attorneys for Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said Perry was correct in halting Trump’s illegal and unconstitutional plan to dispatch federalized troops to Chicago with no clearly defined scope of the mission, its duration, or any “provable factual underpinning.”

It was clear, the plaintiffs’ attorneys argued, that “absent an injunction, the federal government could and would use the troops consistent with the unbounded scope of the federalization orders — that is, to assist any federal agency on any federal mission that is occurring anywhere in Illinois.”

The dueling motions were a clear indication that the legal battle over Trump’s National Guard plans is far from over.

Perry on Thursday blocked Trump from deploying National Guard troops to the city and state, saying she had no faith in the government’s claims of out-of-control violence and that it was federal agents who started it by aggressively targeting protesters with tear gas and militaristic tactics.

Trump has claimed ongoing violence and clashes between protesters and immigration agents in Chicago and other U.S. cities justified sending federalized troops onto the streets as security, even as local and state officials accused the president of manufacturing a crisis to justify unnecessary — and unprecedented — force.

In her oral ruling from the bench, Perry, a Biden appointee, said National Guard troops are “not trained in de-escalation or other extremely important law enforcement functions that would help to quell these problems,” and that allowing troops to come into Chicago “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

The judge also said the Trump administration’s attempts to cast protesters as violent rebels “cannot be aligned” with the view of local officials. Perry said she had no faith in the declarations of federal officials submitted to the court due in large part of a growing body of evidence that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s views are “simply unreliable.”

Perry cited several assault cases that had been dismissed against protesters and other orders from federal judges in Chicago entered against DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.

Perry also said a rebellion is defined as “a deliberate organized resistance openly opposing the laws and government as a whole” by means of armed violence. “I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Gov. JB Pritzker cheered the ruling in a statement on social media, writing, ”Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law.”

A spokesperson for Trump, meanwhile, said the judge got it wrong.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an emailed statement. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

(AP) — The Trump administration is pushing again to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was mistakenly sent to El Salvador, and hasn’t given up on moving him to Eswatini or Ghana even though both have rejected the idea, an immigration official told a judge Friday.

Abrego Garcia has challenged efforts to re-deport him to a third country after the government admitted that a previous order prevents his deportation to his home country of El Salvador. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said recently that it plans to deport him to the southern African country of Eswatini.

WATCH: Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s attorney discusses his case amid new deportation effort

The case has come to represent the bitter partisan struggle over the President Donald Trump’s sweeping immigration policy and mass deportation agenda.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland will decide whether Abrego Garcia should remain in custody or be released from immigration detention while his challenge moves forward. She ordered government officials to explain the steps they have taken to remove Abrego Garcia to another country.

An ICE official told the judge during a hearing Friday that the government was continuing to talk with officials in Eswatini about sending him there even though the country rejected the idea this week.

He said his understanding is that the administration also was still in discussions with Ghana. However, Ghana’s foreign minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, posted on social media Friday that the nation will not accept Abrego Garcia.

Abrego Garcia could be removed within 72 hours if the judge allows it and once the administration receives approval from a third country, said John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who helps oversee removals for ICE.

“We could quickly operationalize the removal,” Schultz said.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys have charged that the Republican administration is trying to illegally use the immigration system to punish him after the embarrassment of his mistaken deportation.

Meanwhile, attorneys in criminal court in Tennessee have made similar claims about retribution in the human smuggling charges brought against Abrego Garcia in June on the day he was returned to the U.S. from El Salvador. The Tennessee judge has concluded that Abrego Garcia’s prosecution may be an illegal retaliation after he successfully sued the Trump administration over his deportation.

The smuggling charges stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Abrego Garcia was not charged at the time, and agents did not begin investigating the stop until earlier this year after his wife sued over his deportation.

At a Friday hearing in Nashville, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw said he will hear evidence on the motion to dismiss the charges on Nov. 3.

In addition, defense attorneys said they intend to file a motion asking that statements unrelated to the smuggling charges be removed from the indictment. Attorney Jenna Dabbs cited allegations that her client is a member of the MS-13 gang as an example of the extraneous accusations that are not relevant to the actual charges.

Trump administration officials have waged a relentless public relations campaign against Abrego Garcia, repeatedly referring to him as a member of MS-13, among other things, despite the fact he has not been convicted of any crimes.

On Friday, the offices of commissioners Roger Garcia, Christ Rodgers, Jim Cavanaugh, and Brian Fahey detailed five points as to why they were rejecting the proposal.

""The true humanitarian choice is to not detain mothers, fathers, and workers who have no criminal record,"" said their response.

It went on to say the people who help Nebraska's economy shouldn't be detained if they have no criminal record.

The commissioners cited the Glenn Valley Foods raid in Omaha, saying most who were detained were ""hardworking and law-abiding residents who have built lives and families here.""

They alleged that detaining those kinds of individuals deepens fear and negatively affects the state's economy.

Their third point is the cost to house someone at the jail, saying it costs about $220 per day, which exceeds the amount ICE is paying at other facilities.

""Real solutions require real reform,"" said the commissioners' response, claiming that what's needed is advocacy at the federal level.

In their final point as to why they were rejecting the proposal, the commissioners said that they do support jailing criminals but must protect those who are contributing to society and ""reflect the values we hold dear, such as faith, hard work, and hope for a better future for their children.""

Filippo Grandi, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, voiced his concerns this week over the U.S. policy of deporting migrants and asylum seekers to countries where they could face harm. He said the administration's approach is inconsistent with international legal principles designed to protect refugees.

""I am worried that the current debate, in Europe for example. and some current deportation practices, such as in the United States, address real challenges in manners not consistent with international law,"" Grandi said on Oct. 7, as reported by The Associated Press.

Grandi also criticized what he described as a growing disregard for international law among developed nations and emphasized that poorer countries continue to carry most of the global refugee burden. Speaking at the opening of UNHCR's executive committee, he urged world leaders not to use politics or nationalism as an excuse to dismantle long-standing protections for displaced people.

""Pressures to reform asylum are not made in good faith, but represent yet another attack on international solidarity, at the time when many countries continue to welcome refugees,"" Grandi said.

Grandi's warning comes as the U.N. refugee agency itself faces major setbacks. As a result of sharp U.S. funding cuts under the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" passed in July, the UNHCR was forced to eliminate nearly 5,000 jobs this year — almost a quarter of its global workforce.

""This was certainly not an easy year for any of us,"" Grandi said.

A pattern of criticism from U.N. officials

This isn't the first time the Trump administration's immigration policies have drawn criticism from U.N. officials. In May, Volker Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, raised alarms over the scale and conditions of U.S. deportations.

Türk said his office had received reports from lawyers and families alleging serious human rights violations, including lack of due process, arbitrary detention, and deportations that exposed individuals to torture or other irreparable harm.

""This situation raises serious concerns regarding a wide array of rights that are fundamental to both U.S. and international law,"" Türk said.

The U.N.'s warnings come amid a broader ideological clash. At the U.N. General Assembly in September, President Trump delivered a speech denouncing the U.N.'s ""globalist migration agenda,"" and called on countries to close their borders and expel foreigners.

""It's time to end the failed experiment of open borders,"" Trump said, according to The Guardian. ""You have to end it now. Your countries are going to hell.""

The administration also claimed the global asylum system has been abused and needs to be overhauled.

In response to the criticism, U.S. State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott defended the administration's stance, framing Trump's remarks as a rejection of international pressure.

""Our actions are consistent with U.S. law and the will of the American people, who demand secure borders and a lawful immigration system,"" Pigott said. He added that Trump's U.N. speech was ""a call to action against the destructive policies promoting mass and illegal migration that globalist bureaucrats have pushed for years.""",https://d.latintimes.com/en/full/583820/us-president-donald-trump-speaks-united-nations.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:24.840431

She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.","The Trump administration has attempted to postpone at least nine challenges to its immigration policies during the government shutdown, including cases that could determine whether people can be held in detention centers without bail.

Federal judges have repeatedly said no.

In the detention-without-bail case, Judge Brianna Fuller Mircheff said that if the deportation apparatus is still running during the shutdown, an immigration-related challenge should continue too.

“Despite the government shutdown, Immigration and Customs Enforcement continues to remove noncitizens from the community; noncitizens continue to be detained under the policy that is challenged in this case; and immigration courts continue to process cases involving detained respondents,” the court’s order states.

“Given that individuals are continuing to be detained subject to the challenged policy, the Court declines to indefinitely stay adjudication of whether such individuals are lawfully detained,” it states.

Immigrant advocacy groups filed the class action lawsuit in California against a July 8 policy change ending bond eligibility for people who have lived in the country for years but are in detention centers while their immigration cases continue.

It’s one of at least nine legal challenges to the Trump administration’s immigration policies that the Department of Justice has sought to pause during the shutdown, which is now in its second week with no progress toward an end.

Most judges are insisting on keeping their scheduled deadlines, pointing to continued immigration enforcement and urgency of the lawsuits, which also include challenges against the end of temporary deportation protections for Venezuelans, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia’s deportation and federal funding freezes for so-called “sanctuary” jurisdictions.

Starting Oct. 1, the first day of the government shutdown, DOJ attorneys began approaching courts with requests to delay immigration-related proceedings as part of the department’s plan to limit civil litigation during the lapse in federal funding.

The DOJ shutdown contingency plan states that it will continue to deal with cases where the safety of human life or protection of property would be compromised significantly by a delay. It also states attorneys have to keep working if judges deny the department’s requests.

Some groups suing the government over immigration matters argue that there would be serious impacts to putting the cases on hold.

The case over whether the Department of Homeland Security can end temporary protected status for Venezuelans, for example, affects about 600,000 people directly and could have repercussions for others with these protections.

“It is important because it’s one of the only hopes with little possibility of continuing the protection for people with TPS,” said Jose Palma, a national coordinator for the National TPS Alliance, which is suing Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem over ending TPS for Venezuelans.

Palma said moving ahead with the legal challenge is particularly vital in light of a recent Supreme Court decision that allows the government to cut off deportation protections and work authorization for Venezuelans while the ultimate fate of TPS for the population is determined in lower courts.

The case is set to move forward in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel denied the federal government’s request to pause the case because of the government shutdown. However, a federal judge agreed to pause a similar case out of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts until the end of the shutdown.

Despite DOJ’s efforts to pause proceedings in the lawsuit seeking to stop the second deportation of Abrego Garcia, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland is requiring the DOJ to bring to a Friday hearing witnesses with first-hand knowledge of the steps the government has taken to deport him to Eswatini, Costa Rica or any other country.

During a hearing on Monday, Xinis lost her patience with the government attorneys’ inability to provide information about the administration’s plan to once again deport Abrego Garcia, who was wrongfully deported to a maximum security prison in El Salvador. She said she wouldn’t pause the case because of “important fundamental questions” at stake, according to Bloomberg.

DOJ also failed to secure an indefinite pause in the lawsuit filed in February by several cities and counties over the Trump administration’s attempts to withhold funding for “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Santa Clara and San Francisco, along with multiple other counties and cities, have been granted preliminary injunctions by District Judge William Orrick twice, as the lawsuit has grown to include other counties, most recently at the end of August.

Following the most recent ruling, the Trump administration’s attorneys had a deadline of Oct. 16 by which they could respond, but on Oct. 1, they filed for a motion to stay, similarly citing the government shutdown as the reason for the need for an extended deadline.

“Absent an appropriation, Department of Justice attorneys and employees of the federal defendants are prohibited from working, even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances, including ‘emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property,’” the DOJ motion states.

Attorneys representing Santa Clara cited the DOJ’s own contingency plan in response, noting “the Department’s (contingency) plan assumes that the judicial branch will continue to operate, though possibly at a reduced level, through the lapse.”

Orrick promptly denied the motion to stay, and the administration has until the original deadline to reply to the ruling.

The judge’s motion “helps ensure that accountability doesn’t stop when it’s inconvenient for those in power,” said Jonathan Miller, the chief programs officer at Public Rights Project, which is representing some of the cities in the lawsuit.

“The federal government can’t use a shutdown as an excuse to halt oversight while continuing to pursue the policies we’re challenging,” he said.

Mark Warner joined Jen to unpack the latest on the MAGA government shutdown, Trump’s notice of “armed conflict” to Congress, and the constitutional strength of our military.","It can be hard to make sense of how American democracy is doing given the incessant stream of autocratic actions by Donald Trump and the over 100 court rulings against him and other pushback. My view is that Trump has been frustrated in the pursuit of his dictatorial ambitions through the use of the ordinary powers of the presidency, including by all of those court orders, and so he has turned to his extraordinary powers. They include improperly pushing his cronies to bring criminal prosecutions of his perceived enemies and deploying the National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to crack down on peaceful protest–also wrongly.

These dual policing initiatives represent an outrageous overreach—the besetting sin of dictators, and one that often leads to their ouster. Make no mistake, Trump’s abuse of power is a sign of his insecurity and weakness, and it is setting up massive, peaceful, lawful opposition.

That includes more problems for Trump in litigation, recently recognized by The Atlantic as “the anti-Trump strategy that’s actually working”. That article reported on the success of my and my colleagues’ democracy litigation–the over 150 legal cases and matters that you Contrarians make possible through your paid subscriptions.

On the legal front, I wrote with Richard Painter and Virginia Canter this week about Trump’s push to indict New York Attorney General Letitia James with unmerited charges that match the similarly baseless indictment last week of James Comey. Team Trump is, in our view, headed for bumpy judicial waters in both cases, and the three of us have already lodged multiple ethics complaints, with more on the way. We also analyzed Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and his use of ICE and the legal opposition that has occasioned—including no fewer than three court orders stopping various aspects of Trump’s Chicago activities this week.

Dr But his obstacles are deeper than the courts. As readers of this column know, most backsliding democracies make U-turns. The Trump regime is facing mounting opposition in all of the main dimensions that determine whether autocracy becomes permanently entrenched or whether democracy is poised to make a comeback.

I don’t want to sugarcoat the tremendous damage Trump is doing domestically and internationally and the lives that are being destroyed and even lost as a result. And not every backsliding democracy makes a U-turn. But when you look objectively at the landscape, there are ample reasons to believe Trump is not succeeding in his dictatorial ambitions. That goes well beyond the challenges that he is facing in court.

Trump’s Standing in and at the Polls

A majority of the American people do not like the prosecution of Trump’s adversaries, his deployment of the National Guard, his aggressive immigration processes, his role in shutting down the government to tear health care from millions and the rest of the chaos. No wonder Trump is at historic lows in popularity at this early point in his term.

The results at the polls this year have been similarly devastating. Democrats have won or outperformed in 42 of 43 elections this year. That is a reflection, in part, on Trump’s unpopularity–and augurs ill for the future for Trump’s party.

Public Protest

The size, number, and geographic distribution of protests against the Trump regime in 2025 have been off the charts. We have not seen anything like it in decades.

Now, we will have the second iteration of the No Kings protests on Saturday, Oct. 18. The No Kings protests in June saw a massive coast-to-coast turnout, driven by Trump’s initial National Guard and military deployments in Los Angeles. With Trump’s planned deployments in Portland and Chicago and the deployment in Memphis that started Friday, expect millions of Americans to show up, stand up, and speak out.

Political scientist Erica Chenoweth famously found that when 3.5% of the population stands against a tyrannical regime, it cannot continue (Contrarian Editor-in-Chief Jen Rubin argues it would take much less). We are well on our way to that number of peaceful, lawful protesters.

Press Pressure

In this category, I include both old and new media, including independent outlets like The Contrarian. We, of course, saw this coming from Day One and have been outspoken, but, in recent weeks, we have increasingly been joined by traditional media.

That includes perhaps the single most authoritative source in theUnited States, The New York Times, which has broken with its more careful neutrality in recent weeks. A case in point is its banner headline on the James prosecution: “Letitia James Indicted After Trump’s Pressure Campaign.”

Political Leadership

Experts also look at whether there is unified political opposition to a would-be dictator. The strong example initially set by state attorneys general has been followed in recent months by governors stepping up—and now national political leaders are succeeding in doing the same.

In this column last week, I noted that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and national Democrats were winning the shutdown messaging war by making clear that their votes were not available to strip health care from millions of Americans or make it prohibitively expensive. Another week has gone by, and their success has now become evident—recognized in poll after poll and in Republican disarray.

When you add all that up, there is cause for hope. Obviously, it’s too soon to say which path the United States will take and whether we will follow the majority of other democracies that have executed a U-turn following democratic backsliding. Trump and his enablers certainly are not slowing down, and the damage is vast and growing every day.

But if they are not stopping, neither must the friends of democracy—including you, Contrarians. Our rundown of all the week’s stories here at The Contrarian shows that Trump’s “flood the zone” continues to meet “rule of law shock and awe.” See for yourself…

At 11am I will try to live-blog, for @lawfaremedia.org , the hearing in Abrego Garcia’s civil (habeas corpus) case in federal court in Greenbelt MD. Abrego is seeking release from detention under a SCOTUS precedent called Zadvydas v Davis (2001). ... /1 tile.loc.gov

Meanwhile, in Abrego’s criminal case, a status conference is due to start at 9am CT/10am ET in Nashville TN over what sort of discovery to provide Abrego in pursuing his motion to dismiss for vindictive prosecution. Unfortunately, we can't get someone there today. ... /2

Here in Greenbelt, we do not yet know if we'll hear live testimony or just oral argument. To keep Abrego detained, govt must show that Abrego faces a “significant likelihood of removal ... in the reasonably foreseeable future.” Here’s Judge Xinis’ order convening the hearing: /3

The Zadvydas issue involves these statutes, plus due process principles. Immigration laws (8 USC 1231a1 & a2) say an alien shall be detained for 90 days after his order of removal (“removal period”), & 1236a6 says that period can be extended in some cases. But ... /4

... in Zadvydas, SCOTUS held that there was a rebuttable presumption that the alien should be detained no more than 6 mos. The key is whether govt can show “significant likelihood of removal ... in the reasonably foreseeable future. ... /5

... Abrego’s situation is a bit different. His order of removal was back in 2019 but he was released because he won “withholding of removal.” He was only re-arrested in March 2025. His attys say his 6-mos Zadvydas period” expired in early 2020. ... /6

... They argue basically (1) govt can’t show its really taking steps to remove him in the “reasonably foreseeable future” (in part because they’re keeping him for criminal trial) & (2) it could’ve taken steps to remove him during the 5 years he was free. ... /7

Though Abrego's attys were notified that govt planned to remove him to Eswatini (after 1st saying Uganda), at the last hearing govt attys could not even say whether Eswatini had yet been contacted. Today govt can present evidence of concrete steps its taken or is about to take. ... /8

There have also been recent reports that DHS notified his attys that now he'd be sent to Ghana, but that notice seems to have been rescinded. Doubtless we'll get the most up-to-date info shortly. ... /9 abcnews.go.com abcnews.go.com

DHS says notice about deporting Abrego Garcia to Ghana was 'premature' Looks like DOJ has brought at least one witness today, so we'll likely get testimony. /10

Plaintiffs attorneys at counsel table are Andrew Rossman, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, Sascha Rand, Jonathan Cooper, & Olivia Horton. All are from the Quinn Emanuel firm excerpt Sandoval-Moshenberg, who's an immigration specialist who was Abrego's first lawyer after his 2025 arrest. /11

For DOJ I see Bridget O'Hickey (counsel to the Asst AG), Ernesto Molina, Jr. (deputy director of office of immigration litigation), and, I think, 2 others, but I can't yet ID them. /12

I suspect one of the other DOJ attys is Jonathan Guynn, who was here last time and whose name I misspelled then. (Regret the error.) He's a deputy assistant AG. (Molina is a career guy.) /13

Houston: Missing teen in immigration custody

The backstory:

The teen was reported missing after he was last seen Saturday afternoon near the intersection of Clay Road and Hempstead Road in Spring Branch.

FIEL, an immigrant-led civil rights organization, helped the boy's family put out a call for help during a press conference on Friday.

According to the organization, the teen was selling fruit with his mother and sister on Saturday when he asked to go to the restroom. His mom was reportedly busy tending to a customer at the time, and when she turned back around, he was gone.

After trying to find her son, his mom called Houston police and filed a missing person report.

Hours after the press conference on Friday, Houston Police confirmed with FOX 26 that the teen had been found safe and his family had been contacted.

FOX 26 later learned from FIEL that a law enforcement agency found the teen, and he had been in ICE custody at a Houston-area detention center since Monday. He is reportedly OK.

The family is undocumented. They are working to get him out of custody.

So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program.

The federal government is sending mixed signals about Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca), a popular program devised under Barack Obama that had until recently allowed undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children to live and work legally without serious risk of deportation.

On one hand, in a new court filing, the federal government suggested it may eventually resume official consideration of initial Daca applications for the first time in years, which could let tens of thousands of people finally have their petitions processed.

On the other, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has claimed that immigrants who say they are under the Daca umbrella “are not automatically protected from deportations”, as the program “does not confer any form of legal status in this country”.

Such an approach has been used by Trump officials to justify detaining about 20 known Daca recipients during the new administration so far – despite no White House or DHS memo, regulation or executive order revealing a policy change.

“We started hearing from those detained that when they tell Ice [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents that they have Daca, the Ice agents say: ‘Oh, that doesn’t matter any more’,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, a spokesperson for the immigrant youth organization United We Dream.

Here’s what to know about Daca, the “Dreamers” it protects, and how Donald Trump’s hardline immigrant agenda is upending that protection.

Who are dreamers?

“Dreamers” is a nickname for immigrants brought stateside as children, who do not have legal status. One estimate counts almost 2.5 million Dreamers in the US.

The moniker refers to the Dream Act, proposed legislation that has been deliberated for decades in an attempt to offer Dreamers a pathway to legal immigration status. Lawmakers have introduced at least 20 iterations of the bill, but despite bipartisan support, no version has cleared both chambers of Congress.

So-called Daca recipients are the subset of Dreamers who have been able to qualify for the Daca program. There are more than 525,000 active Daca recipients nationwide, the vast majority from Mexico, though beneficiaries come from countries around the globe.

Daca recipients’ average age is 31 years old. California and Texas host the largest Daca populations by far, with 147,440 and 87,890 respectively.

In 2023, more than nine out of 10 Daca recipients who were surveyed by national immigrant-focused organizations were either employed or in school. They reported that having Daca protections had made it possible for them to find jobs that paid better, work in fields that reflected their education and long-term career goals, get professional licenses and reach economic independence. The program had also opened the door for some beneficiaries to buy homes and cars.

What is Daca?

The Daca policy debuted on 15 June 2012 to address Dreamers’ need to work legally and be “lawfully present” in the US rather than hide from immigration enforcement and work under the table. To qualify, an applicant must have come to the country before they were 15 years old, have been aged 30 or younger on the date the Obama administration announced the program and have resided in the US since June 2007, among other requirements.

Daca access is barred for anyone convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor or three or more misdemeanors.

Although the program has been a lifeline for many undocumented youth, it’s not a legal status or pathway to citizenship, and the antiquated cutoff dates for eligibility have made it so that Dreamers in high school now are less likely to qualify. At the same time, protracted litigation has long paused the processing of initial Daca applications.

“I think it’s really important to understand how tragic it is that young people who are Americans in every sense but lack one piece of paper here not only aren’t getting a pathway to citizenship, but aren’t even getting these very basic and temporary deportation protections and work authorizations,” said Todd Schulte, president of the advocacy group FWD.us.

Why Congress hasn’t done anything to provide more stability for Dreamers is the “billion-dollar question”, said Diana Pliego, senior strategist for campaigns at the National Immigration Law Center – especially, she added, when more than 80% of Americans support a pathway to citizenship for them, and when it’s estimated that providing that would add about $800bn in US gross domestic product growth over a 10-year period.

Where does the program stand now?

Earlier this year, the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in practice that Daca and work permit adjudications should restart as normal everywhere except Texas, where officials successfully argued the state was negatively affected by Daca recipients because of education and healthcare costs.

The window has closed for appeals to the US supreme court, at least for the time being. Now, a district court will eventually decide how to implement the fifth circuit’s ruling, and in a recent court filing, the Trump administration outlined its vision for complying, in part through restarting initial adjudications of Daca petitions.

Yet, simultaneously, the Trump administration said those proposals would “not limit DHS from undertaking any future lawful changes to Daca”, and for now, the status quo prevails.

“This administration can do many things. So we’re just worried about creating an expectation or false hope for people with initial applications,” said Macedo do Nascimento.

Trump tried to phase out Daca during his first administration but was ultimately stopped by the supreme court.

What about Dreamers in Texas?

Though they are likely to still receive deportation protections, there’s a risk that Texas Dreamers may lose both their work permits and their “lawful presence” designation, which would affect their economic prospects and could have larger immigration consequences.

Who is being detained?

Even as the Trump administration floats restarting initial Daca adjudications, it is arresting current Daca recipients as part of its mass deportation campaign.

Evenezer Cortez Martínez – who came to the US when he was four years old and had a valid Daca permit through October 2026 – was deported to Mexico in March. He was eventually allowed to return to his wife and children in Kansas City, though he said: “I still have that doubt about whether it’s really true that I’m [back] here.”

Similarly, in August, Paulo Cesar Gamez Lira was targeted in El Paso, Texas, in front of his children, his arm being dislocated during the chaos, before he was detained in New Mexico. DHS called him a “criminal illegal alien” because of a decade-old charge for marijuana possession as a teenager that was later reduced to disorderly conduct, and that had never stopped the agency from renewing his Daca protections.

Cortez Martínez and Gamez Lira are two of 20 or so known Daca recipients who have been arrested, detained or deported this year.

Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, has encouraged Daca recipients to consider voluntary deportation.

To Pliego, that would be a loss for the US.

“These are people who have built their lives here, who, you know, have been here since they were young kids,” she said. “This is their home. And so we’re losing longstanding community members who are contributing to the country, who are giving back in a lot of ways.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83fbac16aee1df1683a89d7b938ea41016bd34ce/539_0_3708_2967/master/3708.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9dbf1abcf46db58aa4a63e88fa1f5ba4",N,,2025-10-11 12:57:56.023080

AFL, representing allies in the House Judiciary Committee, is urging the Supreme Court to restore the true meaning of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.
U.S. citizenship is a privilege, not a right, and the touchstone is total allegiance to the United States, not mere location or subjection to its laws.","America First Legal (AFL), in partnership with Boyden Gray LLC, has filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of eighteen members of the House Judiciary Committee—led by Chairman Jim Jordan—urging the Court to defend the original meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment and the limits it places on U.S. citizenship.

AFL’s brief argues that allegiance is a reciprocal bond requiring loyalty from the individual and consent from the sovereign. When that consent is broken, citizenship cannot be claimed. The Fourteenth Amendment enshrines this principle, granting citizenship only to those born or naturalized in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction—meaning total, exclusive allegiance and lawful presence, not mere location.

The Framers said it plainly: the Citizenship Clause does not include “aliens or anyone owing allegiance to a foreign sovereignty.” Courts and scholars ever since have agreed. Citizenship is not automatic, nor is it a right: it is earned through allegiance, consent, and law.

AFL’s brief emphasizes that there is also widespread agreement that children born in the United States to foreign ambassadors or invading soldiers are not U.S. citizens—not because those parents have immunity, but because they owe allegiance elsewhere. The same principle applies to children of aliens unlawfully present in the country: their parents owe allegiance to another nation and are here without the consent of the United States. This is not a question of compassion, but of constitutional order. Citizenship cannot be born of defiance, and allegiance cannot exist without consent.

AFL’s brief further makes clear that only Congress may confer citizenship. As the Supreme Court has long held, no court or executive agency can invent citizenship outside those bounds. The Fourteenth Amendment does not confer citizenship on the children of illegal aliens, and Congress has never granted it by statute. Thus, it may not be conferred upon the children of aliens, regardless of birthplace.

“Our history and tradition stand for the proposition that citizenship depends upon a public determination of allegiance. Being subject to the country’s jurisdiction is not a default presumption. Instead, citizenship is a duty, a bond, and a privilege reserved for those who are subject to our laws and our sovereignty into an entitlement,” said Dan Epstein, Vice President of America First Legal.

AFL, representing allies in the House Judiciary Committee, is urging the Supreme Court to restore the true meaning of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment.

It looked like Border Patrol agents in a minivan had slammed some lady to the ground.
She said she was a WGN employee,” said Josh Thomas, a witness who lives in a condo above the scene in the city’s Lincoln Square neighborhood.
According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the WGN employee, who is also a U.S. citizen, allegedly threw objects at a Border Patrol car.
You’ll see in the video, the WGN [employee] wasn’t Black or brown … they are terrorizing anyone.","An employee of WGN-TV was detained by two Border Patrol officers and later released after federal agents swarmed a busy intersection in Chicago Friday morning.

WGN is not naming the employee, who works in the station’s creative services department, as station policy requires blurring faces and not identifying those who have not been charged with a crime.

Witnesses on site who captured the incident on video spoke to WGN, a local news station owned by Nexstar Media, about the moments leading up to the staffer’s detainment.

“I heard yelling and screaming and honking. I ran downstairs to see what was going on. It looked like Border Patrol agents in a minivan had slammed some lady to the ground. And so, I ran up to her and asked her for her name. She said she was a WGN employee,” said Josh Thomas, a witness who lives in a condo above the scene in the city’s Lincoln Square neighborhood.

Thomas added that when he made his way down to the scene, around 8:30 a.m., he realized there was another person already detained inside the minivan being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.

“I didn’t get his name, although I asked for his name,” Thomas said. “He didn’t speak very good English. They claimed that the WGN employee was obstructing justice, even though she was, like all of us, just standing there, taking video.”

Giordana Mahn told WGN-TV that she was in a cab on her way to the airport when she, too, captured the scene.

“She was walking east. We were driving west, and that’s when I took out my phone. They had just, like, tackled her and brought her into the street. That’s when I asked her, ‘What’s your name?'” Mahn said.

According to a statement from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the WGN employee, who is also a U.S. citizen, allegedly threw objects at a Border Patrol car. She was placed under arrest for assault on a federal law enforcement officer, but was later released without charges, according to WGN-TV.

In an area with condos, apartments, and concerned neighbors, Thomas called Friday’s scene heartbreaking.

“It’s terrifying for the community. When I came back upstairs to my condo, my son was crying and asked me what was happening and if people were going to come take him,” Thomas said.

Mahn shared his sentiments, lamenting her fear for the community.

“I’m scared for my community. I’m scared for anyone who is Black or brown. You’ll see in the video, the WGN [employee] wasn’t Black or brown … they are terrorizing anyone.

We run five of the seven city-contracted day labor centers in Los Angeles, including the Van Nuys Community Job Center.
Our day labor centers are overseen and paid for by the city, and several of our sites are on city-owned or state-owned property.
Over the course of that same week, three day labor centers we operate next to Home Depots were raided a total of four times.
Our network includes the nonprofits that run the other two city-contracted day labor centers, the Central American Resource Center and Hope the Mission.","In September, the United States Supreme Court paused a temporary restraining order intended to stop Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from terrorizing Los Angeles with roving patrols, giving ICE the green light to target people because of the color of their skin or the language they speak.

But even while the restraining order was in effect starting in July, ICE never stopped targeting day labor centers in Los Angeles. On August 8, masked men in tactical gear surrounded the Van Nuys Community Job Center, and pointed weapons at my coworkers and me. When I asked to see a warrant, I was met with cold stares and a Border Patrol agent wielding a teargas canister.

I am the executive director of the Instituto de Educación Popular del Sur de California (the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California or IDEPSCA), the largest operator of day labor (jornalero) centers in California. We run five of the seven city-contracted day labor centers in Los Angeles, including the Van Nuys Community Job Center. The City of Los Angeles funds these official day labor centers to provide direct services to day laborers, including know-your-rights trainings, health and immunization clinics, housing support, and language classes, and contracts with nonprofit organizations like IDEPSCA to operate the centers. Our day labor centers are overseen and paid for by the city, and several of our sites are on city-owned or state-owned property.

ICE has raided our day labor sites at least 14 times since June.

Just days before the raid, Mayor Karen Bass hailed a 9th circuit ruling upholding the temporary restraining order against ICE as “a great day for Los Angeles” and said that she hoped fear among immigrant communities in our city would subside.

It didn’t feel like a great day for Los Angeles when we looked down the barrels of guns pointed at us by federal agents in our workplace.

While my coworkers and I were held at gunpoint, I felt fear and rage, but not surprise. This was the 6th time ICE raided the Van Nuys Community Job Center in under three months. Just three hours earlier, my staff witnessed the same Border Patrol agents kidnap seven day laborers from the parking lot in front of the center. Over the course of that same week, three day labor centers we operate next to Home Depots were raided a total of four times.

Without the restraining order, things will only get worse. Our entire city is on edge now that ICE is receiving billions more in funding to kidnap and disappear our immigrant neighbors, thanks to congress. ICE’s budget for fiscal year 2026, which began on October 1st, is a whopping $18.7 billion.

ICE’s campaign of terror in Los Angeles escalated in June when federal agents in unmarked vehicles stormed the parking lot of the Hollywood Home Depot and surrounding sidewalks, and violently kidnapped 30 day laborers. When people rose up in response to demand ICE vacate the city, they were met with National Guard deployments, ordered by President Donald Trump.

That morning, I started receiving frantic calls from families on the ground, and later, others looking for their loved ones. Many of the people disappeared by ICE were our members. We were able to track down nearly all of those kidnapped — now being held in San Diego detention centers. ICE’s operation was indiscriminate in regard to immigration status: among those kidnapped was a U.S. citizen, later released, and a person with an active asylum case.

These kidnappings were not a one-off horror, but a terrifying new normal driven by the federal government’s white supremacist strategy to erase communities of color. ICE is racially profiling and hunting down people in our streets, making immigrants across our city afraid to leave their homes, go to work, or take their kids to school.

We need political leaders across the nation to act boldly and use the full power of their offices to throw sand in ICE’s gears — introduce legislation, continue to file lawsuits, and call these actions what they are: kidnappings driven by racial profiling. Our city and state leadership must put state resources behind protecting immigrant communities.

Mayor Bass has not been a model of solidarity. In January, she proposed cutting day labor centers completely out of the city’s budget, despite knowing that President Trump specifically named jornaleros as targets and that day laborers were doing dangerous cleanup work during the widely reported on fires that devastated our city. Our funding was only restored because we mobilized and fought back.

The city still isn’t doing enough to protect day labor centers. We call on Mayor Bass and LA elected officials to speak out against ICE’s targeting of day laborers and the worker centers that serve them, and to stand by their promise to protect all Angelenos. It’s time for city and state officials to get creative and use every legal avenue at their disposal.

In September, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed laws banning ICE from entering schools or hospitals without a warrant.

Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson recently signed an executive order banning ICE from operating on any property owned or controlled by the city.

Mayor Bass should follow Governor Newsom and Mayor Johnson’s lead and ban ICE from all city-contracted facilities like our day labor centers.

While we hold our elected leaders to account, we’re not waiting on them to protect and defend our communities. For over 30 years, we’ve built a network of worker and community centers across Los Angeles that builds power and functions as a safety net for our people. Our network includes the nonprofits that run the other two city-contracted day labor centers, the Central American Resource Center and Hope the Mission.

Over the decades, the Institute of Popular Education of Southern California has fought for the dignity and rights of day laborers and domestic workers by providing direct services and mobilizing for campaigns, such as improved minimum wage standards and enforcement, worker safety, and immigrant rights. We’ve raised awareness about the health hazards that day laborers and domestic workers face from wildfires and the frontline role they’ve played in wildfire recovery, and we provide wildfire safety resources as we fight for better protections.

The Institute of Popular Education of Southern California continues to track down workers detained by ICE, bring people their medications, reconnect families, and deliver groceries and other essential aid to impacted communities.

Across Los Angeles, many community members are responding in creative ways — building community defense centers, protesting outside hotels where ICE agents are staying so they can’t sleep, and growing mutual aid networks. But we need more people to be involved.

These raids are not just a threat to undocumented people. Everyone is at risk as this racist and fascist regime uses its power to sow chaos and terrorize our families, friends, and neighbors.

The way we stop them is by growing our community power. If you see unmarked vans or suspect ICE presence, report it to a trusted immigrant rights group. Join or support a local rapid response network. Donate to mutual aid efforts and funds for those in detention. Check in and share resources with your neighbors. Refuse to let kidnapping become normal.

From what we see unfolding in Washington, D.C., and Chicago, it’s clear that Los Angeles was a test site for a larger project of racial terror and ultimately ethnic cleansing. This will continue until we all rise, in all the ways we can, to stop it.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2232619972-1536x1024.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 11:58:30.042028

When they checked in a few days later, ICE detained them again, and on Friday, his father was deported, the Marine told NBC 7.

Steve Rios of Oceanside said he enlisted because of his parents, Esteban Rios and Luisa Rodriguez. He said they came to the U.S. from Mexico more than 30 years ago and have washed cars and cleaned houses from sun-up to sundown for his whole life.

“It was just making them proud, right? I’ve seen all the struggles they’ve gone through,” Steve said. “The least I could do, right, and serve this country and try to, you know, put some time in. I don't think amounts to what they've done.”

Steve and his parents were headed to pick up his younger sister Ashley Rios and her husband, who’s also a Marine, at Camp Pendleton on Sept. 28. They’ve done that every weekend for the past few months because she’s expecting her first child.

But Steve said this last time, they were stopped at the gate, and ICE agents arrived, detaining both his parents. Their family says they have no criminal history, as well as pending green card applications – sponsored by Steve – and work visas as they wait for approval.

“It was scary,” Steve said. “It was scary because my whole life, I've kind of just, it's been in the back of my head.”

“My brother texted me that they got stopped. And as soon as I heard that, I just started, like, bawling,” said Ashley, who was waiting for them with her husband, looking forward to eating French toast together. “He asked what was wrong, and I said that my parents were getting taken.”

Their parents were taken downtown and Steve said he was able to pick them up a few hours later, with ankle monitors, and bring them home. They were told to check in with ICE downtown on Thursday, Steve said, so he went with them, and they waited for several hours before learning they would be detained again.

“I just kept on looking at my parents. I didn't know if it would be the last time I'd see them,” Steve said.

ICE agents led his parents away as his father wore a red shirt and white hat that both said “Proud dad of a U.S. Marine,"" an outfit he picked out with intention for the check-in.

“He said, 'Yeah, this is my lucky shirt, so we'll be fine,'"" Steve said.

Steve said Friday morning, he talked briefly by phone with his dad, who told him they were being held in the basement of the federal building that houses ICE and immigration court, but they were told they will be moved to the Otay Mesa Detention Center.

When asked why the couple was detained, a spokesperson for ICE said in a statement, “As part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws.”

“All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality,” the statement continued.

“It's just hard because you just want to hear, like, your parents voice, that everything will be OK,” Ashley said, adding that she was nervous, especially thinking about her pregnancy. “I'd always want, like, my mom in that delivery room and everything, so it's just hard to not think about your parents there.”

Steve and Ashley said they weren’t told why their parents were detained and aren’t sure what will happen next, but they both have faith.

“They might get sent back. They might not,” Steve said. “The only person that knows is up there.”",https://media.nbcsandiego.com/2025/10/marine-parents-detained.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-10-11 11:58:57.891042

While legal efforts to return him to Atlanta are being pursued, Mario Guevara has made it clear he will continue to report on the struggles of immigrants.","Mario Guevara — a well-known Spanish language reporter for Mundo Hispanico for many years who more recently had established a digital news outlet called MG News — was deported from Atlanta at 4 a.m. on Oct. 3 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Guevara established his reputation as an advocate for immigrants, who like himself entered the United States fleeing unsafe conditions in their home countries — in his case El Salvador.

Members of the Georgia Detention Watch could count on Guevara to cover demonstrations in front of the ICE headquarters denouncing the conditions at Stewart Detention Center. He would report on the crowds brought to city and county meetings by the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights opposing the implementation of 287(g) agreements that turned local police into ICE agents.

Guevara’s on-the-ground reporting won him Emmy awards and an extensive network of community contacts that provided him with on-the-spot information about ICE activities. On June 14 Guevara — wearing a bright red T-shirt and his big black vest with PRESS emblazoned on it — went to a “No Kings” protest in Dekalb County, just north of the Atlanta city limits. The crowd was amassed on the sidewalk, so Mario with his video camera walked along the edge of the street to film the signs.

He was jumped by police who ignored his statement that he was with the press and charged him with three misdemeanors, including obstruction and unlawful assembly. Although those charges were dropped, ICE agents showed up at the jail and placed him in removal proceedings.

ICE fought every legal effort by Guevara’s lawyers to release him from the Folkston ICE Processing Center, a GEO Group facility located 247 miles from Atlanta near the Florida border. He was held there for over 100 days until he was transported to Louisiana and then put on a plane to El Salvador.

His wife and two U.S. born children were sent a video of him arriving in a rural area by car where he was greeted by family, including his mother. While legal efforts to return him to Atlanta are being pursued, Mario Guevara has made it clear he will continue to report on the struggles of immigrants.",https://www.workers.org/wp-content/uploads/Mario-Guevara-.png,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:29.025878

Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me every day at work, he couldn’t help but notice … Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:01].","Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Tchelly Moise was expecting this call. Ted Genoways:Hey, Tchelly, it’s Ted Genoways. Tchelly Moise:Hey, man, how’s it going? Al Letson:Ted is a reporter with the Food and Environment Reporting Network and he’s been trying to reach Tchelly for almost 24 hours, ever since he heard the news out of the Trump administration. Tchelly Moise:I can tell you honestly this is the first time I feel like this is really happening for real. Al Letson:Tchelly is Haitian and has what’s called temporary protected status or TPS. It gives Tchelly the right to live and work in the US legally because Haiti is considered too dangerous to go back to. But on February 20th, all of that changed. Speaker 4:Now, despite the ongoing violence in their home country, the Trump administration is canceling an extension of temporary protected status for half-a-million Haitians. Al Letson:Haiti has been in turmoil for centuries. It suffered through colonialism, harsh dictators, natural disasters, including a devastating earthquake in 2010 that it never fully recovered from. Food and water is still scarce, and over the last several years more than 15,000 people have been killed in gang violence. It’s led many Haitians to flee the country. Tchelly was one of them. He nearly died after being shot in the chest during a robbery. The situation in Haiti felt dire. Tchelly Moise:I was thinking, “Maybe because they know what is going on in Haiti, it’s logically possible to just cancel TPS for the Haitians.” Al Letson:Tchelly says he doesn’t know anyone who is planning to leave the country, at least not willingly. Tchelly Moise:I don’t think no one is going to get on a plane and say, “Hey, I’m going back home.” I don’t think this is going to happen. I think people are going to try everything but leaving this country unless they get arrested by ICE. Al Letson:Tchelly knows a lot of Haitians. That’s because he’s a union representative for workers at one of the largest meat packing plants in the country. It’s owned by JBS, the largest meat producer in the world. At one point not so long ago, the union says the plant in Greeley employed more than 1200 Haitian migrants, just over a third of the workforce. The company has been accused of trafficking these workers, luring them in with the promise of good jobs and a place to live. Instead, the work was dangerous and the living conditions harsh. Speaker 4:Immigrants at a meat packing plant in Greeley say they were victims of a bait-and-switch scheme. Al Letson:Tchelly says he saw firsthand how people were being treated. It’s why he left JBS and started working at the union that represents the workers, to try and fight back and improve conditions. And they had made some gains, bringing national attention to the situation and forcing the company to respond. But now, after going through all of that, the workers are among the more than 300,000 Haitians who could be forced out of the US. Tchelly Moise:We’re talking about Haitians that have had TPS since 2010. Al Letson:We first told you about these Haitian workers back in February when President Trump had just taken office for his second term. And so much has changed since then that we decided to revisit that episode and update you about what’s happened since. To start, Ted Genoways of the Food and Environment Reporting Network reminds us how these people ended up working at a meat packing plant in the first place. Ted Genoways:It all started with a TikTok video. Mackenson Remy:[foreign language 00:03:32]. I said good news for good news because I had assurance when you’re coming, you’re going to have a job. Ted Genoways:The man in the video is Mackenson Remy. Mackenson is originally from Haiti. He’s in his 30s with braided hair and a thin beard. He’s been living in the US for almost a decade now and moved to Colorado in 2023. At that time, he began making TikTok videos about job openings in the area for his few followers, mostly other Haitians. None of them got that much attention until this one. The video opens with Mackenson driving through the parking lot of a huge meat packing plant, speaking in his native Creole. There are industrial truck beds, people wearing hard hats and reflective vests, and a giant red and white logo on the side of the building reads “JBS.” Mackenson Remy:That job, they pay good. [foreign language 00:04:28]. They pay like $22 and $23 an hour. Ted Genoways:Meat packing work is hard and Mackenson makes it clear in the video. He tells his followers, “This isn’t a job for lazy people or people who don’t like the cold.” Mackenson Remy:[foreign language 00:04:50]. Ted Genoways:He adds, “Speaking English is not a job requirement.” If his followers come, Mackenson says he even knows a place for them to stay. So if you’re interested. Mackenson Remy:I say, you can text me, tell me when you want to come because I already know if you came, you can have a job. Ted Genoways:Mackenson posted the video that night and when he woke up the next morning … Mackenson Remy:The video has been viral. Ted Genoways:It had gone viral. Less than a year after posting that video, Tchelly’s union, the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 7, would issue a formal complaint to the government, accusing Mackenson and JBS of human trafficking. I’ve found that to keep its profits high, JBS has a track record of recruiting new immigrants who are desperate for work in the United States. And over the last 20 years, the company has been the subject of more than 100 lawsuits, EEOC complaints, and government investigations over its working conditions. Mackenson says he didn’t know very much about JBS when he made the TikTok video. Everything he shared with his followers, he says he learned from Edmond Ebah. Edmond Ebah:My name is Edmond Ebah. I’m from Benin, West Africa. I work at JBS Plant in Greeley in Colorado. Ted Genoways:This is a promo video of Edmond posted to the JBS Facebook page. Edmond Ebah:There is nothing I can say make my world hard because I’m happy to do what I’m doing. Ted Genoways:Lots of soft focus and slow motion, it cuts from scene to scene. Edmond driving a van, Edmond walking through the plant, Edmond making coffee. Then it ends with Edmond sitting in an office. Edmond Ebah:I applied to HR because I speak seven language and I can help people come to work for JBS. Ted Genoways:The video fades to white, text appears saying, quote, “Edmond has helped more than 30 people find a new life path with JBS USA.” Now, speaking seven languages is never not an asset for any job, but it’s especially useful at JBS because nearly all the people Edmond has hired are immigrants. There are over 3000 employees working at the plant in Greeley and the union representing those employees says between 80 and 90 percent are immigrants. JBS is hardly unique. Nationally, the meat packing industry is overwhelmingly dependent on immigrant labor. But Mackenson didn’t know this. He says he was even a little surprised when he first met Edmond. Mackenson Remy:When I meet him, it’s like I think he’s a white guy. He’s like, “Oh, you look like my people.” He say, “Yeah, I’m from Benin.” I say, “Oh, nice, I’m from Haiti.” Ted Genoways:Mackenson met Edmond the same day he made the video, and Edmond told him they had 60 jobs on the line available. Jobs slaughtering, butchering, and packaging the meat. He’s also the one who told Mackenson about the pay, the benefits, and the fact that workers didn’t need to speak English. Mackenson’s other videos on TikTok got maybe a few dozen views at most. The one he posted about the JBS job had 35,000 views the next day. And the messages started pouring in. This was way more people than expected and there are only 60 positions available. So he texts Edmond. Mackenson Remy:I sent the screenshot for him to show him how many people watched the video. Ted Genoways:But he says Edmond didn’t seem at all phased. He just gave Mackenson a new number of available positions. Mackenson Remy:He said even 100 or 200 people, he can help them out. Ted Genoways:This surprised Mackenson, but it doesn’t surprise me. Turnover in the meat packing industry is incredibly high, an estimated 40% each year. That’s because the work is grueling and extremely dangerous. That’s been the case since the earliest days of industrial meat packing at the turn of the 20th Century. People burn out and are injured all the time. But the Haitians who responded to Mackenson needed work and were enticed by the high pay. Plus, Mackenson had said he could help them find a place to stay, but he’d never expected this kind of response. Mackenson Remy:I just scared because when I see a lot of people text me and I didn’t know where they going to live. Ted Genoways:Soon, he gets a text from Edmond, promising that the new hires will be staying at a motel near the plant for two weeks free of charge. Mackenson Remy:So then after I remember, he called me. He say, “Hey, listen, we got a place for them. Don’t worry, let them come. Let them come.” Ted Genoways:And so they came. Mackenson Remy:Hey, my boss, I’m with the guy. I’m waiting for the other one, I’m at the airport right now. Ted Genoways:This is a voice memo Mackenson sent to Edmond from the Denver airport. It was December 2023, and he was picking up some of the first Haitians to arrive. Mackenson Remy:Boss, you see the last guy I sent it to, this is him ticket, he’s already booked the ticket. Ted Genoways:Edmond directed him to bring everyone to a place called the Rainbow Motel. It sits right off a highway about a mile from the JBS plant. Much like other budget motels, there’s not much to it. Tiny rooms, mismatched furniture, some plastic chairs out front. No pool, but there is a fenced-off square of AstroTurf. And yes, there is a neon rainbow on the roof. There were dozens of Haitians who came to Greeley that first month and Mackenson quickly became their point person for almost everything. Mackenson says he would sometimes stick around Greeley for a few days to drive people, to get anything they needed. Food from Walmart, coats from Goodwill. It was becoming a lot. Mackenson Remy:Boss, this work is hard for me, boss, it’s hard. I have to explain everything with them. Ted Genoways:Here’s another one of those voice memos to Edmond. Mackenson Remy:A lot of people want to come on this job, man. I got people, boy. I told you, I’m an influencer, bro. That’s why they trust me, bro. They really trust me, bro. Ted Genoways:Mackenson says he would charge each person he picked up at the Denver airport $120 to make the two-and-a-half hour trip from Greeley and back. He also charged for the rides to Walmart and Goodwill. But Mackenson said what he really wanted was to be hired by JBS and he asked Edmond to connect him with his boss. Mackenson Remy:He said, “Okay, no problem. Be patient.” When the second group came, I talked to him about the same thing. He told me the same thing, “You have to be patient.” Ted Genoways:Were you being paid by JBS? Mackenson Remy:Nothing. JBS never paid me for anything. Ted Genoways:And still, people kept coming. 100, 200, more. Even though Mackenson was frustrated with Edmond and JBS, he kept telling himself that, at the end of the day, he was doing something good, helping his fellow Haitians find a better life. People like Auguste. That’s not his real name. We’ve given him an alias because he’s worried about retaliation from JBS. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:25] Ted Genoways:Auguste came to the US from Haiti in 2023. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:34]. Ted Genoways:He calls it an epic experience. And by all accounts, it was. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:40]. Ted Genoways:He first flew to Brazil in March 2023 and set off north, traveling across 10 different countries. Auguste:[foreign language 00:12:50]. Ted Genoways:The journey included crossing the Darien Gap, a 60-mile expanse of thick rainforest at the Columbia-Panama border. Auguste walked thousands of miles. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:02]. Ted Genoways:He says he slept on the jungle floor, woken up by the sounds of wild animals in the night. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:13]. Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me he was always on guard because people warned him of armed thieves along the way, who would rob people or worse. Auguste:[foreign language 00:13:25]. Ted Genoways:And then of course, there were the dead. Auguste says he saw bodies along the way, of people who would never finish the journey. It took a month, but he finally made it to Mexico, where Auguste immediately applied to enter the US legally via temporary protected status, TPS for short. It’s a rigorous process. He was fingerprinted as part of a background check, his cheek was swabbed for medical screening. Finally, his application was approved. Auguste entered the US in the spring of 2023. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:10]. Ted Genoways:Today, there are more than 200,000 Haitians in the US under TPS, making them one of the largest groups with that status. Auguste spent six months waiting for work authorization, often going hungry. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:28]. Ted Genoways:But Auguste tells me it’s easier to live without food than it is without hope. Then he heard about Mackenson’s video. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:41]. Ted Genoways:He was living in Baltimore and struggling to find work. A friend of his already moved to Greeley and got hired by JBS. He told Auguste the job was legit, so Auguste decided to go, too. Auguste:[foreign language 00:14:55]. Ted Genoways:When he arrived in Colorado, he was taken straight to the Rainbow Motel. The room was pretty small, just big enough to walk around a full sized bed, one bathroom, no closet, a mini fridge. And to his surprise, Auguste learned he would be sharing this room. Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:17]. Ted Genoways:He tells me there were five, six, seven, sometimes eight people in one room. Auguste was sleeping on the floor. Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:29]. Ted Genoways:He tells me it was hard to live this way. When was that? Auguste:[foreign language 00:15:39]. Tchelly Moise:December 2023. Ted Genoways:That’s Tchelly, translating for Auguste. We’re sitting together in an office at the union. Tchelly never lived at the Rainbow Motel, but he saw what was happening there. Tchelly Moise:Well, me, I was I would say not a victim of the process, but I was a direct witness to the process. Ted Genoways:It’s part of the reason he left his job at JBS and went to work for the union instead. Tchelly Moise:This is extremely bad. When you go to the Rainbow Motel and you have eight people inside of one little motel room with one bed, one bathroom, women and men at the same time, so no privacy. When people have to use the bathroom, it was a very bad situation. Ted Genoways:There was also nowhere to make food. The motel was off a busy highway with no grocery stores, no restaurants, nothing around for miles. Tchelly Moise:We’ve had people saying, “I was starving for two to three days because I don’t know where to go get food.” Ted Genoways:The people brought to live in the Rainbow Motel were in a strange place with little to no money, many didn’t speak English. Plus, it was December and freezing outside. Tchelly says people felt stranded. The motel has 17 rooms, and at the peak Mackenson counted over 100 Haitians staying there at once. It got so packed at one point, that Tchelly says Edmond was forced to rent a house nearby. The conditions there weren’t any better. Tchelly Moise:There were around 40 people living inside of the house. I’m saying people sleeping on the floor, on the blankets, people everywhere. And at some point, they didn’t have electricity in the house and it was winter. Ted Genoways:Auguste was one of the people living there. After a week-and-a-half in the motel, he spent five months in this unfurnished house. The people living there were charged $60 to $70 a week. Auguste:[foreign language 00:17:42]. Ted Genoways:But he says at least in the house, they had a kitchen. There may be a line of people waiting to use it, but at least it was there. Meanwhile, Auguste and his housemates were still expected to go to work. These jobs are essentially like working on a disassembly line, like a standard factory run in reverse. The whole cow walks off the back of a cattle trailer and is slaughtered, then broken down into steaks, and roasts, and ribs, and hamburger meat. This work is done with things like power knives and bone saws, tools meant to cut flesh and bone. It’s no surprise that this can lead to injuries. I’ve talked to dozens of people over my career who have lost fingers or had hands crushed by grinders. I remember one man who was a gut snatcher, which is exactly what it sounds like. The gut snatcher pulls all the guts out of the animal, while the spine splitter cuts through the vertebrae with a bone saw. But this time, they got out of sync. The spine splitter went too soon and the gut snatcher lost four of his fingers. Stories like these are common across the industry. According to data from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, jobs at meat packing and poultry companies are consistently among the most dangerous. Workers at JBS and their union say the speed of the line makes serious injuries like amputation more commonplace. But the profits that companies like JBS make depend on how much meat they remove and how fast. Around the same time this new crop of Haitian workers was hired, JBS had introduced its aptly named White Bone Program. Kim Cordova:This is a program where what the company is trying to do is get as much of the meat and product off of a bone it’s literally like white bone. Ted Genoways:This is Kim Cordova, president of UFCW 7, the Greeley plant union. She says the white bone program meant more cutting, more repetition, more exertion, and all at a dizzying speed. Kim Cordova:The line speeds were really increasing to line speeds we had never seen before. Ted Genoways:Almost all of the Haitian workers were put on the same evening shift from about 2:00 to 11:00 PM, B shift. Tchelly says B shift had faster speeds than the day shift. Tchelly Moise:Way faster. We have people that have been working at the plant for 10, 15 years and they can tell us they have never seen any chain speed going over 390. Ted Genoways:That’s 390 head of cattle per hour. Typically, workers on the day shift rarely saw speeds above 300 per hour. Tchelly Moise:But right now, you’re having 420. At some point, we had 430. Ted Genoways:That’s roughly 35,000 cows a week. Kim Cordova:Workers are really put at risk for their safety because it is so fast. Ted Genoways:Kim says people were getting injured. Union members were going to JBS management almost every day, telling them to slow things down because this wasn’t safe. Tchelly Moise:Sometimes, we went from 420 to 410, which is still unacceptable. Ted Genoways:And it wasn’t just the chain speed. Kim Cordova:This new group of workers were being forced to sign documents in languages that they don’t speak, in English actually, that waived their rights or abandoned their injury claims. Ted Genoways:Workers’ medical cards were being kept from them. Kim Cordova:Medical bills not being paid. Ted Genoways:Workers’ mail was being withheld. Kim Cordova:The supervisor had total control of their US mail. Ted Genoways:Haitians were being treated differently than other workers. Tchelly Moise:If I asked for a break to go to the bathroom, I would not get it. Ted Genoways:Meanwhile, Auguste and his fellow Haitians would go back to a so-called home with little to no food, a line for the bathroom, and only the floor to sleep on. Auguste:[foreign language 00:21:53]. Ted Genoways:Auguste tells me every day at work, he couldn’t help but notice … Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:01]. Ted Genoways:… that each cow had its own little cage. Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:08]. Ted Genoways:But he was expected to share a tiny space with five, six, seven, eight of his coworkers. It was darkly ironic, but he found himself thinking the cows had it better. What does that make you think as you see that the cows are treated better than the workers? Auguste:[foreign language 00:22:42]. Tchelly Moise:He say, “It even make think about the past. I feel like I was being treated as a slave.” If we need to take a break, we can. Al Letson:Coming up, JBS is forced to respond. Ted Genoways:They told the union that they had never heard the name Mackenson, that they didn’t believe that there was such a person. Mackenson Remy:They lie. They lie. Al Letson:That’s up next on Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. In September 2024, JBS made national news. The Wall Street Journal published a story about a new wave of Haitian workers at JBS and the terrible living conditions they found in Greeley, Colorado. The headline read, “Life for Haitian immigrants, jobs nobody wants and sleeping on the floor.” Mackenson Remy was featured heavily throughout, alongside allegations of exploitation from the very Haitians he thought he was helping. Mackenson Remy:Those Haitian, most of them, they hate me. They think I made money from them. Al Letson:Some workers alleged that Mackenson was working for JBS and getting paid for how many people he brought to Greeley. Mackenson Remy:Some of them, they said JBS give me $3,000 for each of them, each of them. Al Letson:Mackenson denies all of this. Mackenson Remy:I charge people to take them at the airport and I charge people if they need services. I didn’t charge anyone for job. No, I’m not a criminal. Al Letson:Mackenson says he was following directions from Edmond Ebah, the HR supervisor with JBS. Edmond was the one who told him to bring people to the Rainbow Motel. Mackenson doesn’t deny knowing how many people were packed in each room, but he says he never heard anyone complain, at least not to him. But dozens of complaints were made to the UFCW 7, the union representing the JBS plant in Greeley. And now, Mackenson’s name was in the news, alongside all those allegations. Mackenson Remy:I just like doing that for my people. I didn’t get money from anyone. When they see me, they talk very badly about me. It’s very stressful for me. Al Letson:Ted Genoways, a reporter with the Food & Environment Reporting Network, has been covering the meatpacking industry for over a decade. In that time, he’s watched JBS get sued again and again for allegations of workplace discrimination, wage suppression, and unfair hiring practices. All the while, JBS continues to grow dramatically. The company made $77 billion in 2024. Here’s Ted again. Ted Genoways:The union had raised concerns to JBS about the squalid living conditions long before the Wall Street Journal article came out. JBS had told the UFCW 7 that it was investigating, but the union didn’t hear anything for months. But now, with these allegations made public, JBS was forced to respond. So I’m sure you know, JBS claims that they had no knowledge of this system. TChelly Moise:Well, I’ve seen- Ted Genoways:This is TChelly Moise again, the union rep with UFCW 7. TChelly Moise:… the spokesperson from JBS that said, “Any allegations are completely unacceptable.” This is the exact word that I think I’ve seen online. Ted Genoways:Here are the exact words that a spokeswoman for JBS sent in an email to the Wall Street Journal. She said the company found, “Reports about living conditions, unacceptable and alarming.” TChelly Moise:What exactly is unacceptable? Is it the allegations or the actual situation that was going on? Ted Genoways:In that same email to the Wall Street Journal, JBS says it wants all of its employees to have access to safe housing. The company fired the two HR managers above Edmond. And Edmond was moved to a different facility. The company says it also put in new training programs to teach employees about proper recruitment. JBS maintains that their leadership didn’t know what was happening at the Rainbow Motel, something TChelly finds really hard to believe. TChelly Moise:It is really hard for anyone from JBS to deny what was happening when they had someone from that plant supervising those people every day, assigning them room and filling an application for them. It’s really hard for you to deny when you’re directly involved like that. Ted Genoways:I’ve seen the texts to Mackenson that prove at least Edmond knew. Mackenson Remy:If JBS said they didn’t know anything about the motel, they lie. I got the text message from Edmond. Ted Genoways:Edmond asked Mackenson, who was being checked into the Rainbow Motel. Mackenson replied with five, six names to a room. At one point in January 2024, Mackenson sent a list of nearly 50 people staying in nine rooms. But after the Wall Street Journal article came out, Edmond abruptly cut ties with Mackenson. I tried to reach Edmond many times, even dropping by his house. Marianne:Edmond? Ted Genoways:I’m Ted Genovese. This is my wife, Marianne. We were just hoping to talk to you for a few minutes if you’ve got time. Edmon Ebah:I get your text message. I’m going to respond to you. Trust me, we will have a conversation. Ted Genoways:He never got back to me, and instead, directed me to a company spokesperson. JBS did eventually send me a short email, in response to the many questions I sent them from my reporting. Their statement repeats much of what they sent the journal. They want all employees to have access to safe housing. They’ve hired new HR leaders and put in place new recruitment training programs. The company says they’ve taken the situation very seriously, but ultimately, deny any involvement. JBS says it conducted two separate investigations and, “No substantiated evidence was provided that tied Edmond Ebah or company leadership to the claims outlined by the union.” They did not respond to the fact that I’ve seen the text messages and phone calls between Edmond and Mackenson. JBS just underscored that Mackenson never worked for the company. And after the “alarming allegations came out,” they say they banned him from the plant. In response to the reports of dangerously fast line speeds, JBS simply said it follows the law. The email ends with, “At JBS, we have best in class workforce eligibility, safety and compliance standards.” But the union is still demanding answers. Here’s Kim Cordova again, president of the UFCW 7. Kim Cordova:We have been dealing with what we believe is human trafficking and exploitation of these workers. Ted Genoways:In 2024, the union filed complaints with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, and the National Labor Relations Board alleging exactly that. Kim says, “These Haitian migrants at JBS were brought here under false pretenses. They were promised a job and a place to stay, but the job wasn’t just hard, it was unsafe. And this wasn’t proper housing. They were sleeping on the floor of a tiny motel room with a bunch of strangers sharing one bathroom and little to no food.” The complaint calls this abuse of workers and it says that JBS’s investigations into this treatment were, “a whitewash.” And Kim believes she knows how we got here. Kim Cordova:I mean, the one thing COVID did was shed the light on what I call the dark secret of the packing industry. It exposed everything. Ted Genoways:Back during the pandemic, US meat workers were considered essential. After meatpacking plants across the country were forced to close, then President Trump, ordered them to reopen. And so even though the JBS plant in Greeley didn’t have COVID safety protocols in place, it brought workers back to the line. OSHA fined JBS for, “Failing to protect employees from exposure to the coronavirus.” If you watched Last Week Tonight, you probably heard John Oliver talk about it back then. John Oliver:After six workers from a JBS plant in Colorado died from COVID, the company’s total fine was just $15,000. Ted Genoways:But $15,000 was just .00003% of the company’s revenue at the time. John Oliver:And if you find a company, a fraction of a percent of their profits, don’t be surprised when they carry on only giving a fraction of a (beep) about the welfare of their workers. Ted Genoways:Kim says this started a huge fight between the company and its workers. Kim Cordova:We started to see workers mobilize, stand up, fight back. There were walk-offs not just here, but around the country. Workers were not going to die for their job. Ted Genoways:This not only led to more personal protective equipment, it also led to a new contract. The union had pressed the CEO for higher wages and better benefits and won. Kim Cordova:And workers got stronger, in my opinion, and I think that that’s what has sparked some of the change. Ted Genoways:Kim says shortly after they renegotiated that contract with the CEO, he retired and was replaced. Then came a wave of firings among union workers. Then came the white bone program and hundreds of brand new Haitian workers. The UFCW 7 complaint to the Department of Labor says, “The plant increased chain speeds to dangerously unsafe levels when these workers occupied the line.” Kim Cordova:In our opinion, they needed a new group of workers to come in, so that they had more control over them, especially to work at this high speed. Ted Genoways:TChelly says, he thinks the company just saw an opportunity and took it. TChelly Moise:Big companies like that, one of the first goal is to make money. And unfortunately, most of the time, it doesn’t matter how this money is made, it doesn’t matter what cost. Ted Genoways:August still works at JBS. After about six months, he was able to save enough money to move into his own place with his own bed and bathroom, but it all comes with a cost. As far as we know, the white bone program is still going on. August:[foreign language 00:10:30] Ted Genoways:And August told me he can no longer fully close his left hand, an injury he believes as a result of his work being too fast and too repetitive. Despite everything though, August says he is still glad to be here. August:Yeah. [foreign language 00:10:51] Ted Genoways:Because his life is stable now and he just hopes things continue to get better. Then came the second Trump administration. Donald Trump:We will begin the largest deportation operation in American history, larger than- Ted Genoways:On the campaign trail, Trump promised to deport an unprecedented 15 to 20 million people and said, he would direct federal agencies to go after undocumented immigrants. But he also promised to go after immigrants here legally by ending programs like temporary protected status. Reporter:So you would revoke the temporary protected status? Donald Trump:Absolutely, I’d revoke it, and I’d bring them back to their country. TChelly Moise:Going back to Haiti is a death sentence really. Ted Genoways:TChelly Moise again. TChelly Moise:The biggest issue is not the deportation itself. The biggest issue is what is going to happen after the deportation. Because most of us, not to say all of us, we left the country obviously, because it was very bad in… You’re talking to some members at the plant, and they’re telling you, “Man, my cousin just got killed today and my family members, they just burned some house.” So it’s getting worse every day. You really don’t know where it’s going to get. It’s really bad. Ted Genoways:The New York Times has been tracking deportations and it’s found that the Trump administration is on pace to deport more than 400,000 people this year. While that’s far less than Trump’s campaign trail promise, the government’s tactics are disrupting communities across the country and a lot of what’s happening is unprecedented. There have been aggressive immigration raids in the recent past, but they usually focused on workplaces like meatpacking plants. Newscaster:Federal officials said today, that yesterday’s immigration raids at six meatpacking plants were the largest workplace crackdown ever. Ted Genoways:In May of 2006, then President George W. Bush, addressed the nation with promises of a new immigration policy. Part of that policy was to find and deport undocumented workers. And on December 12th of that year, he made good on that promise. Immigration and customs enforcement carried out a coordinated raid of meatpacking plants across the middle of the country. They were all run by Swift & Company, the world’s second largest beef producer at the time. Armed ICE officers arrested and deported nearly 1,300 undocumented workers at these plants. Here’s Mark Lauritsen, then vice president of the UFCW, speaking with PBS at the time. Mark Lauritsen:That one small community, the school district still held 25 children, some as young as six years old, because their parents were not around to pick them up. They were in a bus some place to points unknown. Ted Genoways:The Swift plants were located all across the country, places like Cactus, Texas, Grand Island, Nebraska, Marshalltown, Iowa, and Greeley, Colorado. In the Greeley plant alone, 220 undocumented workers were detained. After the raid, production came to a screeching halt. And though they were able to get things moving again, it was never back at the level it was before the raids. Within a year, Swift was forced to shut down and sell the plant. The buyer, JBS. And now you have to wonder, will JBS and the thousands of immigrants it employs meet a similar fate? Kim Cordova:This workforce is an immigrant workforce. Ted Genoways:Union president, Kim Cordova again. She says at one point, there were 57 languages spoken at the Greeley plant alone. Kim Cordova:JBS is the largest food producer in the world. The industry would collapse without these type of workers. Ted Genoways:The Trump campaign promised it would lower grocery prices, but deporting the workforce that meatpackers depend on would halt processing at every stage of the supply chain, from feed lots, to the packing house floor. This would drive up prices for Big Macs and Outback steaks, but also for chicken breasts and pork chops at grocery stores. TChelly says, “That’s why deporting all these people doesn’t make any sense.” TChelly Moise:I feel like us, the immigrants, we are a good part of the economy. Like I said, most of the jobs that we’re doing, people who are born in this country are not in line to do those jobs. They’re not actively looking to do those jobs. Ted Genoways:This is why TChelly says he’s confused. If mass deportations hurt not only JBS, but the economy as a whole, why do it? He says he’s left with only one answer. TChelly Moise:I think it’s just hatred against people with different skin color, because that’s the only logical thing that I can actually see. Deporting everyone, I don’t see how it can benefits honestly. I don’t see. Al Letson:Up next, we fast-forward to the present day to see how ending TPS is impacting TChelly and the other workers. TChelly Moise:I’m coming here to work, so there is definitely some frustration as far as why this is happening to me. Al Letson:That’s coming up on Reveal. Al Letson:From the Center for Investigative Reporting and PRX, this is Reveal. I’m Al Letson. Today, we’re returning to a story we first brought you in February, back when President Trump was weeks away from fulfilling a promise to not just go after undocumented immigrants, but to also target people living in the country legally. Speaker 2:A really scary time for the Haitian community as the federal government has set a deadline for deportation. The pressure is now on find answers and do them fast. Al Letson:Haitians with temporary protected status were told to leave the U.S. by August 3rd. But a federal judge intervened and extended that deadline to February 2026. This is the second time the Trump administration has attempted to end TPS for Haitians. During Trump’s first term, the White House claimed Haiti was once again safe and people could return. Several groups sued, arguing that Haitians were being racially targeted, and TPS remained in place. This time around, the administration says it’s ending TPS because Haitian gangs could be using the program to enter the US and threaten our national security. Only, the Department of Homeland Security has offered no proof this is happening. And once again, several groups are suing the government to keep TPS in place. Shelly says all of this is frustrating because not only are people like him not in gangs, they came here to get away from the gangs. Shelly:We are not really criminals. I mean, a lot of us in this country, we’ve never really had not even a speeding ticket. I’m coming here to work, so there is definitely some frustration as far as why this is happening to me. Al Letson:Ted Genoways of the Food & Environment Reporting Network has been keeping up with the Haitian workers at JBS, and he’s joining me now to update us on where things stand. Welcome back, Ted. Ted Genoways:Thanks, Al. Al Letson:Okay. So, first things first. What’s happening with the workers at the plant in Greeley, Colorado? Do they still have their jobs? Ted Genoways:So, Shelly was telling us that since February JBS has fired somewhere between 300 and 400 workers at the plant in Greeley. The Union says that’s about a third of the Haitians hired in the last year or so. Shelly:The company called them in, and they let them know that unfortunately we have to stop working. Ted Genoways:The Union says the workers were given 30 days to give the company documentation that proves they could continue to legally work in the U.S. Al Letson:But wait. If TPS doesn’t expire until February, how is the company able to fire all these people already? Ted Genoways:Well, when you’re working on TPS or other immigration programs, you’re given the right to apply for a work permit. Then once you get the permit, you have to keep renewing it. And some of these workers had let their permits expire. In the past, the company probably wouldn’t have been as aggressive about enforcing that paperwork, but because the Trump administration has put Haitian workers under scrutiny, companies like JBS are being more vigilant and asking more questions. It usually goes something like this. Bryce Downer:HR reaches out to me to say, “Hey, listen, we’re covering our [inaudible 00:03:32] here.” Ted Genoways:This is Bryce Downer. Bryce Downer:“You’re going to have to provide us with evidence of your authorization to be able to be employed, otherwise, you’ll have to be terminated.” Ted Genoways:Bryce is an immigration lawyer with Novo Legal, and has been working on cases for these workers. In theory, he says, an employer could allow time for these employees to figure out their work status, but the company risks being hit with penalties. And Bryce says companies like JBS simply aren’t willing to do that. Bryce Downer:It is a very difficult time right now for immigration attorneys that are counseling these employers, because generally speaking they’re incredibly conservative. Zero liability, zero risk. Al Letson:But I mean, losing 400 workers in just a few months, still seems like a big problem, right? I mean, isn’t that impacting production? Ted Genoways:Yeah. I actually asked JBS about the number of Haitian workers that were fired. And they said they don’t track workers based on national origin. But in a written statement, a spokesperson said that the company is focused on hiring people legally authorized to work in the United States and would continue to follow the guidance provided by the government. As for the workers that were fired, JBS said that if people can prove their status has changed, they would be eligible to be hired. And the company said, “At this point in time, our facilities are operating normally and our production levels remain unchanged.” When I read that last line to Shelly, he didn’t argue with it. Shelly:I would say that this is exactly right, because before they let someone go, there’s already someone there to replace them. So production is not really affected. Ted Genoways:According to the Union, JBS has mostly been replacing Haitian workers with Somali workers, another immigrant population whose TPS is still active, at least for now. Bryce says The industry has always turned immigrant populations because, for the most part, Americans are just not willing to take these jobs. Bryce Downer:And so who’s the next most vulnerable community in line? Ted Genoways:Basically, JBS has been jumping from one immigrant group to another for years. And as we heard in our original story, the way the company treats these workers has been under a lot of scrutiny and complaints over unsafe working conditions that the plant continue. Al Letson:Well, yeah, let’s talk about that. What happened with the complaint Shelly’s Union filed, the one accusing JBS and McKesson of human trafficking? Ted Genoways:Right. So the National Labor Relations Board is the government body that was supposed to be investigating this complaint. But in January, right after taking office, Trump fired two members of the board, leaving them without a working quorum, effectively killing any investigations. He finally announced new appointees just recently, but they haven’t been confirmed yet. So, even if the nominees are appointed, it’s possible that the Haitians in Greeley could be scheduled for deportation before any investigation can even be completed. For its part, JBS has continued to insist that it thoroughly investigated and found no evidence that showed its employees were involved in trafficking Haitian workers. Al Letson:So Ted, oftentimes these companies justify using immigrant labor like this as a way to keep grocery prices low. It’s something that President Trump even promised to do when he was on the campaign trail. So, I can’t help but to wonder what this all means for the price of meat. Ted Genoways:Right. So, the price of beef has increased 14% since August of last year. It’s such a steep increase the consumers are actually starting to cut back on buying beef, which historically just never happens. At the same time, JBS, along with three other companies, are being sued for allegedly manipulating the market. The claim is that big beef packers like JBS have a monopoly on beef and are artificially inflating prices. I think this underscores just how big and powerful JBS really is. Al Letson:And I guess when you’re this big, it’s pretty easy to fire a few hundred Haitians just like that. Ted Genoways:Yeah, just like that. But Al, that hasn’t been the story for everyone. August and Shelly are both still working in Greeley, and it looks like they will be able to continue for the foreseeable future. Al Letson:How so? Ted Genoways:U.S. immigration law is confusing, always. And it’s especially confusing right now. But when your livelihood depends on it, you get pretty savvy pretty fast. August and Shelly got new work permits, but those will expire in February, when TPS is supposed to end for Haitians. So they also did something else. They applied for asylum, which means that even if TPS gets rescinded, they may still be able to stay in the U.S. as they wait for their asylum cases to be decided. It’s a bit of a gamble, because the Trump administration has been trying to limit the rights of asylum seekers. But in theory, it’s another shot at a green card, and even citizenship. Now, there are so many Haitians who don’t have that kind of second chance. Shelly has spoken to many of them. And he says some tell him they will try to go to Canada, but most of them plan to just lay low and wait for another job, another court ruling, or even another president. Shelly:I can only wait, and I can only hope things get better. We hope something better comes. Al Letson:It’s such a tough situation. Ted, thanks so much for updating us about what’s happened since you first reported that story. Ted Genoways:It’s good to talk to you, Al.

URGE placed a heavy emphasis on knowing one’s rights in case students happen to find themselves in a situation with law enforcement or immigration enforcement; that is, the right to remain silent and speak with a lawyer.","On Oct. 9, the student-led organization URGE (Unite for Reproductive and Gender Equity) held their weekly meeting to discuss immigration rights and the increase in border patrol and interior immigration enforcement following the passing of bills such as the “One Big Beautiful Bill” and the “Keep STEM talent act.” The meeting began at 7:30 p.m. and lasted until 8:30 p.m.

URGE is a national organization with several chapters across American universities, including Washburn. They discuss all matters relating to their acronym, advocating and highlighting different communities to ensure that their voices are heard. They also work to make wellness products free and accessible on campus, such as Plan B, condoms and menstrual products. URGE is partnered with HALO (Hispanic American Leadership Organization), which is an organization that helps promote and support the Hispanic community on campus.

The meeting began with an interactive icebreaker game that many students readily engaged in. It involved throwing a beach ball with questions on it before the meeting was relocated due to technical problems.

Once the meeting was relocated, it began with a presentation from Loud Light, discussing the importance of voting and voting registration, which smoothly segued into the next presentation. The presentation informed students about the history of immigration, along with the current legislation, knowing your rights and how to be an ally.

Covering things such as the timeline and history of immigration, which began in 1776 with the publication of “Common Sense” by Thomas Paine. URGE discussed that the book relates back to current legislation and issues, as ICE continues to operate despite the recent shutdown of the government.

URGE placed a heavy emphasis on knowing one’s rights in case students happen to find themselves in a situation with law enforcement or immigration enforcement; that is, the right to remain silent and speak with a lawyer.

The members spoke about how being an ally can be as simple as asking what one can do to help. Including people and having discussions about current events can help spread awareness on matters and can help students advocate for what they need. URGE also mentioned that students can use their privilege to advocate for those who may not be safe to do so as well. Paloma Martinez, junior anthropology and criminal justice major, spoke on personal motives to advocate for these rights.

“What inspires me the most is my ethnic identity. I am Mexican, so I am trying to help the Hispanic community, because I am privileged enough,” Martinez said. “My mom’s white, my dad’s Hispanic, so I definitely feel like I have the ability if something actually ever happens to me.”

Empowering voices from different communities is vital in creating a healthy and inclusive environment that URGE prioritizes in their mission. Parker Whaley, vice president of URGE, speaks on what inspires them to get involved with these matters.

“[It’s] the safety and advocacy part of it and making people feel like they belong and [the] things that affect them are important,” Whaley said. “It affects a lot of people in a really heavy way and if nobody talks about it, then those communities will feel like it’s not important and what’s happening to them doesn’t matter. And that’s the complete opposite of the truth.”

The event ended by opening up for discussion. Students were welcomed to ask questions or share thoughts and stories of their own. Protests were brought up as a good way to advocate for rights and students brought up the No King’s protest taking place on Oct.18 at the Kansas State Capitol. Students were eager to engage in this discussion to provide information regarding protests and other organizations. Red Black, junior political science major, spoke on why they chose to attend this event.

“This event in particular is a really important one. While we’re closing out Hispanic Heritage Month, we want to keep that on people’s minds,” Black said. “Also, immigration has been a really serious issue with the recent political situations, especially with Customs Enforcement going into cities and impersonating police officers. We want to make sure that people are above and beyond safe.”

URGE holds meetings weekly. Their next meeting will be on Oct. 23 from 7:30-8:30 p.m. in the Blair Room at the Living Learning Center. They will be discussing the history of menstrual products and making medieval hats for their costume contest.

The HALO organization will be holding their next meeting on Oct.16 from 6-7 p.m. in the Blair Room of the LLC, and they will be having a cultural trivia night.

“Right-leaning parties tend to talk tough on immigration so that they keep the nationalist factions within their parties happy, but then quietly they act open towards migration,” Professor Gamlen said.

“They need to keep businesses happy by keeping labour flowing. So that’s kind of the classic right-leaning party’s strategy on migration for the last several decades.

“And then conversely on the left-wing side, we see the opposite kind of doublespeak in many places where left-leaning parties speak very positively about migration-driven diversity, and sort of claim to be the representatives of diversity to satisfy the liberal intelligentsia who favour human rights and migration.“But then at the same time, what left-leaning parties do is keep unions happy with strong labour market regulations which tend to cut migration levels, tend to make it harder to migrate.”

Looking at the figures

ANU has broken down the data finding the Coalition has generally expanded temporary migration.

The Liberal and National Governments tied universities to international student fees, created the 457 visa, expanded post-study work rights, and signed nearly 70 per cent of Australia’s working holiday migration agreements.

Labor has often tightened immigration policy. They raised financial, compliance, and labour standards on students and skilled workers, and introduced stricter integrity measures on colleges, savings, English language tests, and visa hopping.

Pressure to cut immigration rate

Annual net overseas migration peaked at 555,000 when borders reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic under the Albanese Government.

But have since dropped by 40 per cent.

However, there is political and public pressure on Labor to cut further.

Guardian Essential polling shows 53 percent of Australians think the current permanent migration cap for 2025-2026 of 185,000 is too high.

Populist parties are rising around the globe including the Republicans under Donald Trump and Reform UK under Nigel Farage.

The latest Newspoll has Pauline Hanson’s One Nation on an 11 per cent primary vote.

But Gamlen doesn’t believe a populist anti-immigration party will takeover in Australia.

“Although we often compare ourselves with them, the US and the UK are really very different from Australia,” Gamlen said.

“One of the big differences is that they have functionally open borders in a way that Australia does not and never has had.

“It’s partly about being an island nation, but it’s partly just about the fact that we’ve got this actually finely tuned and well-oiled machine in government and across many of our democratic institutions that is geared towards managing immigration because it’s such an important part of Australia’s modern story.”

‘Establish an immigration department’

Gamlen’s key advice to the Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is to re-establish an independent Immigration Department that handles visa compliance, and an independent research bureau on migration.

“There should be a restoration of the concentrated policy expertise in migration in one part of government in one properly empowered agency,” Gamlen said.

“You know if they do those two things and get the facts, set a basis for you know a common set of facts that we can all discuss a debate, that are reliable that will improve the quality of the debate, then that will lead into a better deliberation in our parliament.”",https://images.7news.com.au/publication/C-20315336/33d617b45c8fc6d05b0b67c258a7f354de469b1b-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.png?imwidth=1200,N,,2025-10-11 08:56:33.918075

With Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations beginning, some people have been scared to go out and celebrate their culture for fear of ICE.
The presence of ICE goes even further than events like those during Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month.
Despite this, the Latinx/Hispanic community continues to celebrate and take pride in its rich culture.
The Lowrider parade was extremely successful this year, bringing together many people of Latinx/Hispanic heritage.","Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month lasts from Sept. 15 to Oct. 15. The celebrations commemorate the rich history and culture of those who identify as Latinx and/or Hispanic. Recently, laws reinforced by the Trump administration have made it challenging for some people to come forward and openly celebrate this month.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was created in 2003. According to its official website, it aims to “protect national security and public safety by enforcing federal laws and prosecuting cross-border crime.” ICE is composed of two main task forces: Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which deals with transnational crimes, and Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO), which enforces immigration laws. ICE reports to the president, who appoints the director of the organization.

The current administration has increased funding for the immigration department. In July, 2025, Congress approved legislation that gave $170 billion to immigration and border enforcement. Funding for ICE specifically increased from around eight billion dollars before the current administration to around $28.7 billion now. As a result of the additional funding, there has been an increase in the presence of ICE within cities and towns in recent months. There has been a growing number of reported instances of ICE raiding towns and homes and detaining individuals.

“We’ve seen our family members and friends from Southern California be picked up by ICE on their way to school or work, and so it just puts a lot more pressure on us here in the Bay, because we’re like, what if we’re next?” Itzel Vasquez Calvo, an Ethnic Studies teacher at Berkeley High School, said.

Berkeley is considered a “City of Refuge” and a sanctuary city. A sanctuary city is a city that enacts policies to limit its cooperation between the local and state governments and the federal government regarding immigration measures. In mid-2025, the Department of Justice began filing lawsuits against sanctuary jurisdictions, laws that limit the policy’s effectiveness. This led some sanctuary cities to revoke all of their jurisdiction over immigration officers. In other cities, it led to the city’s laws officially being in direct conflict with federal laws. Berkeley is one of the many cities that have had lawsuits filed against them, but they remain committed to maintaining their sanctuary status.

With Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations beginning, some people have been scared to go out and celebrate their culture for fear of ICE. Calvo is from Oaxaca, Mexico, and said she has many family members who are scared about what might happen if they attend celebrations. “(My family is) only willing to put themselves at risk for essential things, like getting groceries and going to their jobs and so the other festivals or concerts or parades, is kind of secondary like, ‘Oh, we don’t have to, we don’t want to put ourselves out there for no reason,’” Calvo said.

On Sunday, Sept. 21, 2025, an event called “Comunidad en al Placita” took place, organized by the Latinos Unidos de Berkeley organization. The event was supposed to be held at Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center Park, but many vendors moved inside the BHS campus in order to feel safer and protected.

The relocation came at a cost. “It was really poorly attended. Normally, there are a lot of people that come, and there’s a lot of music, and it feels very celebratory, but it was very muted. (...) People are erring on the side of caution and staying home and maybe gathering at home,” Susi Lopez, a Spanish teacher at BHS, said.

Under the presidential administration, many Latinx people are skeptical about attending celebrations this year. “As the federal government attacks our community and abducts people through racial profiling across the nation, many Latine people are afraid of being targeted. Many Hispanic Heritage Month events were brought to more secure locations this year to ensure we can all celebrate safely,” Berkeley Council member Cecilia Lunaparra said, “To me, this highlights the resilience of our community and the importance of coming together to celebrate our beautiful and diverse cultures.” Lunaparra is Mexican American with a mixed ethnic background, with parents who immigrated to the United States in the 90s.

The presence of ICE goes even further than events like those during Latinx/Hispanic Heritage Month. Raquel L’Esperance Feldman, a junior at BHS, said, “I feel like the detentions and raids go deeper than just the celebrations this month because more immigration enforcement has been stopping many other events. For example, I know that Bad Bunny didn’t even plan a tour in the U.S.” Bad Bunny, a prominent and popular Puerto Rican Latin music artist, didn’t put tour dates in the U.S. in fear that U.S. immigration authorities could raid his venues to target his fans.

As federal immigration policy shifts, many still question where they can feel safe in the U.S. Despite this, the Latinx/Hispanic community continues to celebrate and take pride in its rich culture. Multiple celebrations still took place, including El Grito de Delores on Monday, Sept. 15, 2025, at Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco, and the Saturday, Sept. 20, 2025, King of the Streets Lowrider Parade and Festival in San Francisco. The Lowrider parade was extremely successful this year, bringing together many people of Latinx/Hispanic heritage. According to many, celebrations like these are what bring the community together. “(ICE is) not gonna stop me and my family from enjoying ourselves and finding community … that’s literally the only thing that’s going to help us,” Calvo said.",https://berkeleyhighjacket.com/assets/2025/10/screenshot-2025-10-10-at-3.59.47-pm.png,N,,2025-10-11 17:57:20.700784

Community members lined the sidewalks outside neighborhood schools Friday afternoon in Lincoln Square, part of a rapid response mobilization following word of ICE activity in the area.

Federal agents reportedly detained two people, including an employee of WGN-TV, Friday morning at the busy intersection of Lincoln and Foster avenues.

The TV station said in a statement that it is “actively gathering the facts” related to the “evolving situation.” The employee involved is not a member of the news department, WGN added.

Ald. Matt Martin (47th Ward) notified his constituents via social media that ICE agents were in the area and encouraged them to help their neighbors: “Many of the locations ICE agents have been spotted at are schools — both public and private. If you’re able, please consider supporting safe pick ups at the school closest to you.”

Erin Tobes and Audra Wunder had already formed a mutual aid team for Chappell Elementary — located just blocks from where the incident occurred in the morning — and were able to muster a sizable group by the time students were dismissed from classes Friday. Adults were posted all along the school’s perimeter.

“People are dropping everything,” said Tobes. “We’re hoping ICE will see all these bodies, us showing up as a community.”

Similar groups have popped up at other schools, including nearby McPherson and Ravenswood elementary schools, and organizers are sharing resources and tactics, Wunder said.

“We’re all starting this out of necessity,” she said.

The response teams are equipped with whistles to warn of the presence of ICE agents, and groups like the one at Chappell are also helping families within the school’s community who might need rides to work or other assistance out of fear of detainment.

Though neighborhoods such as Pilsen and Little Village may have larger Latino populations, schools in Lincoln Square enroll anywhere from 25% to 42% Latino students.

In addition to providing safe passage for students and parents at pick-up and drop-off, Tobes said she hoped the community’s presence would deter any action by agents that could traumatize children.

“We want to maintain the safety and innocence of all the kids,” she said.

Silvia Hernandez, who was among the parents safeguarding Chappell and adjacent Amundsen High School, said her 8-year-old daughter isn’t so much scared as she is upset, and even spent last night making a video calling on people to just get along.

All the women agreed that while it was heartwarming to see the community sticking together and standing up for neighbors, the need to do so in the first place was heartbreaking.

“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” the justices wrote.
“You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.","More than three dozen federal judges have told The New York Times that the Supreme Court’s flurry of brief, opaque emergency orders in cases related to the Trump administration have left them confused about how to proceed in those matters and are hurting the judiciary’s image with the public.

At issue are the quick-turn orders the Supreme Court has issued dictating whether Trump administration policies should be left in place while they are litigated through the lower courts. That emergency docket, a growing part of the Supreme Court’s work in recent years, has taken on greater importance amid the flood of litigation challenging President Trump’s efforts to expand executive power.

While the orders are technically temporary, they have had broad practical affects, allowing the administration to deport tens of thousands of people, discharge transgender military service members, fire thousands of government workers and slash federal spending.

The striking and highly unusual critique of the nation’s highest court from lower court judges reveals the degree to which litigation over Mr. Trump’s agenda has created strains in the federal judicial system.

Sixty-five judges responded to a Times questionnaire sent to hundreds of federal judges across the country. Of those, 47 said the Supreme Court had been mishandling its emergency docket since Mr. Trump returned to office.

The judges responded to the questionnaire and spoke in interviews on the condition of anonymity so they could share their views candidly, as lower court judges are governed by a complex set of rules that include limitations on their public statements.

Of the judges who responded, 28 were nominated by Republican presidents, including 10 by Mr. Trump; 37 were nominated by Democrats. While those nominated by Democrats were more critical of the Supreme Court, judges nominated by presidents of both parties expressed concerns.

In interviews, federal judges called the Supreme Court’s emergency orders “mystical,” “overly blunt,” “incredibly demoralizing and troubling” and “a slap in the face to the district courts.” One judge compared their district’s current relationship with the Supreme Court to “a war zone.” Another said the courts were in the midst of a “judicial crisis.”

The responses to The Times serve as the most comprehensive picture to date about the extraordinary tensions within the judiciary, hints of which have begun to spill out publicly.

At a hearing in September, Judge James A. Wynn Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit said his court was “out here flailing” as it tried to apply vague emergency rulings from the Supreme Court that left judges “in limbo.” Ruling on a different case, Judge Allison D. Burroughs of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts noted that the emergency orders “have not been models of clarity.”

The Supreme Court has so far issued emergency orders in about 20 cases involving the Trump administration’s policies. In at least seven of those orders, the majority offered no reasoning for its decision.

At public events, some Supreme Court justices have defended their use of the emergency docket as a legitimate response to the increase in swift presidential policy-making by executive order, as opposed to legislation passed through Congress. Offering extensive reasoning or explanation, they argued, would risk locking the court into a position that might not turn out to be its final view.

A spokeswoman for the Supreme Court did not respond to a request for comment.

The Times reached out to more than 400 judges, including every judge in districts that have handled at least one legal challenge to a major piece of Mr. Trump’s agenda.

Most of those who declined to participate did not give a reason. Others said they did not think it was their place to judge the work of the Supreme Court.

The judges who responded may not represent the views of the entire judiciary, but to have even several dozen judges out of the nation’s more than 1,000 district, appellate and senior judges express such concern about the Supreme Court’s behavior is highly unusual.

Forty-two judges went so far as to say that the Supreme Court’s emergency orders had caused “some” or “major” harm to the public’s perception of the judiciary. Among those who responded to the question, nearly half of the Republican-nominated judges said they believed the orders had harmed the judiciary’s standing in the public eye.

Twelve judges who responded to the questionnaire said they believed the Supreme Court had handled its emergency docket appropriately. But only two said public perception of judges had improved as a result of how the Supreme Court had handled its recent work.

The code of conduct for federal judges requires them to act in ways that promote “public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” They seldom comment on public controversies and almost never share their views of Supreme Court jurisprudence, outside of the carefully chosen words of their written opinions.

Judge Luttig is a critic of the Trump administration’s interpretation of the Constitution who is in frequent contact with sitting judges from across the political spectrum. He said he believed the views expressed to The Times were broadly representative of the lower courts as a whole.

“I can’t think of words to capture the significance that federal judges themselves have to speak out,” he said, “because the Supreme Court has given them no choice but to speak out.”

‘An Atmosphere of Disrespect’

The emergency docket is known to its critics as the shadow docket, and its rise as a flashpoint for tensions in the judiciary coincides with the Supreme Court’s increasing use of it in ways that have benefited Mr. Trump’s agenda.

Time and time again, district court judges have imposed blocks on expansive policies issued by Mr. Trump’s administration, rulings that have been upheld by the appeals courts, only to have the Supreme Court remove them with an emergency order. Mr. Trump has benefited from nearly all of the Supreme Court’s rulings on emergency applications since his return to office.

For now, his administration can withhold some forms of congressionally appropriated funds, send undocumented immigrants to dangerous places such as South Sudan and use race as a criterion in making immigration stops, all because of emergency orders.

Some of the judges who responded to the Times questionnaire expressed concerns with the substance of the Supreme Court’s orders, fearing critics would see partisanship in the justices’ consistent siding with the president over lower court judges. Similar views have been aired in dissents from the Supreme Court’s liberal wing, which have called pro-Trump rulings by the majority “misguided,” “dangerous” and an “existential threat to the rule of law.”

For Mr. Trump’s allies, lower court judges are the ones who exceeded their authority in blocking presidential actions, interfering with what they claim is a popular mandate. That view was shared by one judge, a Trump appointee, who praised the Supreme Court for “flushing out anti-democratic rulings” with its emergency orders.

The main complaint voiced by a majority of the judges was not where the Supreme Court was coming down, but how it was doing so. By presenting its emergency orders in just a few sentences, with little or no reasoning, judges said the Supreme Court was leaving them without a clear path to assess what the justices were thinking.

The result, one judge said, was that the court was expecting their district court colleagues “to read their minds about what their view of the law is.”

Despite the justices’ brevity and lack of reasoning, the Supreme Court has become more insistent that its emergency orders are supposed to serve as guideposts for the lower courts. In an unsigned emergency order from July, the Supreme Court noted that while emergency orders were “not conclusive,” district court judges should still consider them in “like cases.”

Some justices have gone further, using their opinions to publicly admonish judges who, in their view, are failing to correctly apply the court’s emergency orders. In August, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh took to task Judge William G. Young of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for what they saw as a failure to apply an emergency ruling in one spending case to another. “Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” the justices wrote.

In response, Judge Young issued a rare apology from the bench, though he expressed some bewilderment with the court’s opacity.

“Never, before this admonition, has any judge in any higher court ever thought to suggest that this court had defied the precedent of a higher court — that was never my intention,” he said.

Several judges singled out the justices’ criticism of Judge Young, an 85-year-old appointee of President Ronald Reagan and an Army veteran who has sat for more than 40 years, as a particularly demoralizing breach of decorum.

That view resonated with one of their retired colleagues, Jeremy Fogel, who was a federal judge for 20 years. Judge Young, he said, “has been at it for so long. He’s done the toughest cases, and he’s done them well. For a guy like that to get bench-slapped for not reading the tea leaves properly? That’s just not fair.”

Justice Gorsuch’s opinion could be read as “promoting a disrespect for the judiciary,” one that echoed Mr. Trump’s rhetorical attacks on judges, said Nancy Gertner, a retired judge who teaches at Harvard Law School. Both, she said, “undermine the bench and promote an atmosphere of disrespect.”

The Lower Courts Speak Out

Responses to the questionnaire were overwhelmingly critical of the Supreme Court, but they were not unanimous. Twenty-one judges either declined to answer the question about the effect of emergency orders on the public’s perception of the judiciary or said they believed they have had little or no effect.

A few judges were more equivocal about emergency orders, views that were echoed by Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a widely respected jurist and Reagan nominee who wrote a robust defense of the role that district courts play in the constitutional scheme. In an interview, Judge Wilkinson noted that the Supreme Court was largely at the mercy of circumstances beyond its control: a high volume of emergency challenges to a presidency that “would put its foot on the pedal, because it has an agenda, and it’s sensitive to the fact that electoral mandates are perishable.”

While noting that the emergency docket had its advantages in terms of quickly and uniformly managing a mushrooming caseload from the executive branch, Judge Wilkinson said there were good arguments for the Supreme Court to be careful about using it too much.

“You don’t want too many snap judgments and emergency orders creating a public impression of either secretiveness or arbitrariness,” he said.

I will leave it to the lawyers to say exactly what “reasonable suspicion” means in a legal sense these days.","National Review, September 11, 2025

On Monday, the Supreme Court lifted a district-court injunction that blocked federal agents from making immigration stops based on certain demographic characteristics. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong had ruled that location, occupation, language, and ethnicity – taken individually or in combination — are not sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion that someone is an illegal alien. But as Justice Kavanaugh explained in staying Judge Frimpong’s order, circumstances on the ground make reliance on such factors entirely reasonable:

Here, those circumstances include: that there is an extremely high number and percentage of illegal immigrants in the Los Angeles area; that those individuals tend to gather in certain locations to seek daily work; that those individuals often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction, that do not require paperwork and are therefore especially attractive to illegal immigrants; and that many of those illegally in the Los Angeles area come from Mexico or Central America and do not speak much English.

Having recently published a report on the illegal immigrant share of workers in each Census-identified occupation, I can bolster Kavanaugh’s point with some numbers. Let’s take the example of landscaping mentioned above. As of the 2019-2023 period that the data set covers, about 17 percent of all “landscaping and groundskeeping workers” in the U.S. were illegal immigrants. Put another way, a randomly-selected landscaping worker has a 17 percent chance of being illegal. That’s already a fairly high percentage without adding any additional information.

But of course, we can add more. This case focused on enforcement operations in Los Angeles. A landscaping worker in the Los Angeles metropolitan area has a 30 percent chance of being illegal. Furthermore, a i>Hispanic landscaping worker in Los Angeles has a 33 percent chance. Finally, a Hispanic landscaping worker in Los Angeles who speaks English less than very well has a remarkable 42 percent chance of being illegal.

This exercise can be repeated for other immigrant-heavy occupations. For example, about 21 percent of all construction laborers in the U.S. were illegal in the 2019–2023 period. Adding the factors of Los Angeles, Hispanic ethnicity, and low English ability increases that percentage all the way to 52 percent.

I will leave it to the lawyers to say exactly what “reasonable suspicion” means in a legal sense these days. However, if a law enforcement officer encounters a suspect who has about a 50–50 chance of having committed the violation that the officer is investigating, then common sense suggests that a stop is justified.",https://cis.org/sites/default/files/2017-07/logo-facebook.png,N,,2025-10-11 07:57:18.046610

Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was allowed to return to Maryland pending trial.","A federal judge expressed frustration with Justice Department lawyers at a marathon hearing Friday as she weighed the Trump administration’s efforts to send to Africa Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man previously deported to El Salvador.

Abrego Garcia is back in the United States in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, but he remains protected from deportation to his home country.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis is weighing arguments from Abrego Garcia’s lawyers that the administration is illegally punishing their client by floating various African countries that won’t accept him rather than oblige his demand to be removed to Costa Rica instead.

Abrego Garcia’s lawyers argue the judge should release their client. The judge will issue a ruling in writing later.

“They have spun the globe and picked various places they can identify, whether it’s to troll him for political purposes, essentially to fail on purpose by selecting places that would be completely unpalatable for Mr. Abrego Garcia,” attorney Andrew Rossman said.

In August, the government signaled it would remove Abrego Garcia to Uganda. After he expressed claims of fear, he was notified last month the government was looking to send him to the small, landlocked African country of Eswatini.

It led Xinis to demand the Trump administration bring to her Greenbelt, Md., courtroom Friday a witness with personal knowledge of the steps being taken so she can better assess the situation.

The government chose John Schultz, who has worked at Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more than two decades and oversees removal operations in Africa and other regions.

During roughly four hours of testimony, Schultz revealed that the ask for Eswatini to accept Abrego Garcia did not take place until this past Wednesday evening. Schultz said the country declined, but “discussions are ongoing.”

“The final decision is made when the manifest is sent over, and no cases have been denied after a manifest has been sent over,” Schultz said.

After Uganda and Eswatini, Abrego Garcia recently received notice the government was intending to deport him to Ghana, but Ghana’s foreign minister hours before the hearing made clear on social media the country “is not accepting Abrego Garcia.”

Schultz testified the notice was “prematurely sent.”

His testimony left Xinis frustrated. She told Justice Department lawyers afterward they had “ignored” her order by choosing a witness who knew “less than nothing” about Abrego Garcia’s request to be sent to Costa Rica.

“If the government has not done anything to effectuate the one place he says he’ll go and the one place they say will take him, how can I find you’re really pursuing this?” Xinis quipped.

The Justice Department points to Abrego Garcia’s previous suggestion he feared persecution in more than 20 countries, which included Costa Rica.

“That is still potentially a live issue, although I’ll acknowledge the clarity given in court today could change the analysis,” Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign told the judge.

Xinis, an appointee of former President Obama, has temporarily blocked Abrego Garcia’s deportation until she figures out next steps.

Schultz expressed confidence Abrego Garcia would be deported in as soon as 72 hours if the judge lifts her ruling and Eswatini agrees to take him.

“We could remove him very quickly,” Schultz testified.

Abrego Garcia’s case has emerged as a flashpoint in Trump’s second-term immigration crackdown. His administration accuses Abrego Garcia of being an MS-13 gang member, an allegation he denies.

A Salvadoran national, Abrego Garcia entered the United States illegally and lived in Maryland for years. He garnered national attention after the Trump administration in March deported him to a megaprison in El Salvador, despite an immigration order protecting him from being removed there over fears he’d face persecution.

In June, the government flew Abrego Garcia from El Salvador to Tennessee to face felony human smuggling charges. Abrego Garcia pleaded not guilty and was allowed to return to Maryland pending trial.

Between April 2024 and August 2025, nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers across the country, according to data cited in the report.
They also warned that ""solitary confinement continues to be used with people who have mental health conditions and other vulnerabilities in a way that violates ICE's own directives and international human rights mandates.""
The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security, Congress, and the president to immediately end solitary confinement in immigration detention and to release detainees with existing vulnerabilities.
""ICE detention facilities are systemically torturing people and are on track to be torturing more people,"" Zarifi told Axios.","A new joint report from Harvard University and Physicians for Human Rights says U.S. immigration detention facilities are ""systematically torturing"" detainees through the prolonged use of solitary confinement — often for weeks at a time — in what the United Nations defines as psychological torture.

Between April 2024 and August 2025, nearly 14,000 people were placed in solitary confinement in immigrant detention centers across the country, according to data cited in the report. Those labeled ""vulnerable,"" including individuals with mental health conditions, spent an average of 38 days in isolation during the first quarter of 2025 — nearly triple the 14-day average recorded in 2021.

Researchers say the findings, based on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data, point to a worsening trend since late 2024, with the practice now used routinely and without clear oversight. ""We are torturing people simply because they want a better life in the U.S.,"" said Sam Zarifi, executive director of Physicians for Human Rights, to Axios. ""This violates both U.S. and international law.""

ICE guidelines limit solitary confinement for people with mental health issues to exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, but the report found the policy is routinely violated. In many cases, isolation was used for minor infractions, such as refusing medical procedures or protesting detention conditions.

The report's authors concluded that solitary confinement in immigration detention ""has no place in a civil system,"" arguing that ICE's growing use of the practice transforms administrative custody into a punitive system operating without due process. They also warned that ""solitary confinement continues to be used with people who have mental health conditions and other vulnerabilities in a way that violates ICE's own directives and international human rights mandates.""

The report calls on the Department of Homeland Security, Congress, and the president to immediately end solitary confinement in immigration detention and to release detainees with existing vulnerabilities. It also urges states and local governments to ban or restrict the practice in facilities that contract with ICE, conduct unannounced inspections, and ensure detainees have access to legal representation and interpreters.

""ICE cannot be presently trusted to account accurately, let alone implement humane policies in its existing facilities,"" the report said. ""Although transparency, accountability, and oversight are essential first steps, ICE must focus its attention on abolishing the inhumane practice of solitary confinement and immediately releasing vulnerable populations from immigration detention.""

The new report builds on earlier investigations showing that solitary placements in ICE custody rose 41% between December 2024 and August 2025, peaking at more than 1,100 individuals. Some detainees reported being held in windowless cells for weeks, denied medical care, or isolated after filing abuse complaints — despite DHS policy prohibiting segregation as retaliation.

Fear of retaliation by the Trump administration has left many federal employees reluctant to speak on the record with NPR.

With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.","As the government shutdown stretches into its second week, hundreds of thousands of federal workers are not working — and more are not getting paid. The White House has thrown into question whether some will ever be made whole.

Still, for the first time in awhile, Monica Gorman is upbeat.

""I'm feeling energized, honestly,"" says Gorman. ""It's felt for so long to me like federal workers have just been screaming into a void.""

Gorman works at NASA and is a member of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers (IFPTE). She spoke in her personal capacity and not on behalf of the government.

Long before Congress failed to pass a funding bill, the Trump administration essentially started shutting down the government bit by bit, Gorman says. At NASA, entire offices have been shuttered, including her own at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She had been using data science to predict the cost of future NASA missions.

Due to cuts proposed in Trump's budget request, she was reassigned to a new position working on a lunar communications project. Her first day was supposed to be Oct. 1 — the same day the government shut down.

Now, the shutdown has given her hope that some in Congress may be willing to assert their Constitutional authority over spending and push back against some of the sweeping cuts.

""To see people in Congress taking a harder line, I feel like we're finally being heard now in a way that we weren't before,"" she says.

""I'm done being afraid""

Even as the government shutdown has brought financial and emotional stress to federal workers and their families, it's also given a boost to some who see the standoff in Congress as an opportunity to get the word out that things are not okay.

Nine months into President Trump's second term, Gorman and other federal workers tell NPR they are coming together to strategize, talk to reporters, meet with members of Congress and sound the alarm about everything the government has already lost: institutional knowledge, funding for vital services, the means for holding officials accountable.

Fear of retaliation by the Trump administration has left many federal employees reluctant to speak on the record with NPR. But now?

""I'm done being afraid of them,"" Gorman says. She believes many others are too. ""They say the best organizer is a bad boss, and we all have the same bad boss.""

NPR asked the White House for a response to the criticism coming from some civil servants. In a statement, spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote: ""President Trump was elected by a resounding majority of Americans to carry out the agenda he is implementing. Federal workers who are actively resisting the Trump agenda are, in reality, working against the American people who elected the President.""

Connecting with others for support and information

Sarah Kobrin, who has worked at the National Cancer Institute for nearly 22 years, says the Trump administration's repeated attacks on the federal workforce have brought government workers closer.

""They have made us much, much stronger,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Kobrin says she has met all kinds of people in other agencies and around the country. They've been forced by the Trump administration to turn to each other for information about the administration's latest directives — and for support.

Earlier this year, Kobrin faced the difficult task of calling grantees to inform them that their research funding had been terminated. She'd been told her area of expertise — uptake of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine — was not a priority of the current administration. With so much of her work hobbled, she now refuses to stay silent.

""I see the dismantling of the government and the scientific enterprise, specifically, and must speak,"" she says.

Still, in a workforce of more than 2 million people, Kobrin acknowledges that not all federal workers are weathering the shutdown and the turmoil of the past nine months the same way.

""I know there is certainly a wide variety of what people need. How afraid they are, how stable they feel,"" she says. ""It's hard not to be paranoid under the current circumstances.""

With unions sidelined, grassroots employee networks grow

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal employees, citing national security concerns even at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Weather Service. That executive order faces multiple lawsuits.

Also targeted were unions representing employees at the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), including a local chapter of the National Federation of Federal Employees that was led by Stephanie Rice, an employee of BLM based in Alaska.

With the union's future looking dim, Rice began looking for other ways to connect with federal workers and discovered the Federal Unionists Network, the group that Gorman is also a part of.

Now, from her base in Anchorage, Rice has been able to stay engaged and informed, even with little information coming through official channels.

""This sort of crowdsourcing across the country, with everyone saying, 'I saw this. What have you heard?'… has been really useful,"" she says, speaking in her personal capacity.

Before her time in Alaska, Rice served for six years in the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations. She's devoted her entire adult life to public service.

""I believe very strongly that my job as a civil servant is to carry out the lawful instructions of the sitting administration, regardless of whether I think it's a good policy,"" she says. ""That's my job, and I did it under the first Trump administration.""

But this time, she believes the administration is acting lawlessly, including by sidelining the unions.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2999x1687+1+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/png/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F99%2Fb3%2F669b2b3d494eae8b0c9dde6077bc%2Fmonica-sarah-fed-shutdown.png,N,,2025-10-11 05:59:12.059158

“These ICE raids are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act, when the U.S. Marshals would hunt down and kidnap Black Americans,” Bynum said in a statement. “That was a dark and shameful time in our nation’s history—we must not allow that to repeat. Masked federal agents aren’t welcome in our state and they can’t keep kidnapping Americans.”

Frank Miranda, 46, filmed ICE agents confronting him(link is external) before work on Oct. 2, demanding that he answer questions about where he was born. When he refused, agents threatened him with a dog and took him to the ICE facility on South Macadam Avenue.

Bynum demanded a “thorough investigation” into Miranda’s abduction.

WW was first to report the incident on Tuesday and asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for comment. An ICE spokesperson returned the message today, impugning the paper’s motives and journalistic standards.

“ICE officers do not abduct people. Full Stop,” an unnamed spokesperson said in an email. “To suggest they do is what is leading to the 100% increase in assaults on our officers. A responsible journalist would not advocate for violence and instead would seek truth over clicks so it’s clear the Willamette Week is only interested in fueling the fire rather than seeking to tone down the rhetoric.""

Miranda “was handed to ICE Oct. 2 to determine his alienage and removability,” the spokesperson said. “He was eventually released the same day as arrest.”

Portland lawyer Michael Fuller described Miranda’s ordeal in a letter(link is external) to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem on Tuesday, flagging his client’s intention to seek damages.

Asked about ICE’s response today, Fuller wrote in an email: “As Trump himself said, anonymous sources are bullshit. The fact that ICE won’t attribute its comment to an actual person speaks to the baseless nature of its statement. The abduction video speaks for itself.”

Noem visited Portland on Tuesday, where she joined officials on the roof of the ICE building and watched a small group of protesters(link is external), including a man in a chicken suit, stand along the road. She called them “uneducated and ill-informed.”

“Not only do these raids undermine the principles that our country was founded on, but they’re against the law and downright racist,” Bynum wrote. “I’m demanding an end to ICE’s reign of terror, a thorough investigation into the kidnapping of Mr. Miranda, and fundamental change to this administration’s approach to immigration.”",http://bynum.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/bynum.house.gov/files/evo-media-image/bynum_bc_045_020525.jpg,N,,2025-10-11 08:57:04.909691

WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) today announced U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lodged arrest detainers against two criminal illegal aliens from Honduras for their involvement in a highway shooting in Virginia along I-295 on October 5, 2025.

Police were alerted of shots fired around 5 p.m. when a 911 caller reported possible gunfire along Interstate 295 northbound near the Creighton Road exit at mile marker 34.

A Hanover County Sheriff's deputy who was conducting a nearby traffic stop on the interstate observed a silver BMW matching the suspect description traveling northbound on I-295. When the deputy pulled onto the interstate, the BMW sped off, prompting a police pursuit. The Virginia State Police were called to assist with the investigation.

The two 17-year-olds were arrested. According to public records, the criminal illegal aliens have been charged with shooting from a vehicle, possession of a firearm under age 18, possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, and reckless handling of a firearm.

ICE officers lodged arrest detainers with the Merrimac Juvenile Detention Center in Williamsburg, where the pair is currently being held in custody.

“These criminal illegal alien thugs whipped around in their BMW with complete neglect for the safety of Virginians when they decided to open fire on an interstate highway,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “These illegal aliens were released unvetted by the Biden Administration into our country.

Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), and Thom Tillis (R-NC) not voting. The passage tees up talks with leaders in the House of Representatives, where nearly all Republicans and 17 Democrats approved an NDAA last month.

""Yesterday, the Senate voted to give the Pentagon a trillion-dollar spending package while the Trump administration and MAGA Republicans play politics with troop pay and nuclear security and refuse to reopen the federal government,"" Markey said in a Friday statement. ""All the while, they are stealing healthcare from American families to fund tax breaks for CEO billionaires. This isn't a budget that funds America's real security needs.""

""The Senate voted to give the Pentagon a trillion-dollar spending package while the Trump administration and MAGA Republicans play politics with troop pay and nuclear security and refuse to reopen the federal government.""

""Republicans rail that we need to cut government spending—for food assistance, for healthcare, for environmental protection—yet they are showering their defense contractor cronies with hundreds of billions for wasteful and destabilizing programs like Trump's Golden Dome space-based missile system,"" Markey continued. ""Yet they decry that funding will soon dry up for paying military salaries and for essential nuclear security operations at the National Nuclear Security Administration.""

""In their desperation to score cheap political points, Republicans are undermining vital national security missions,"" he added. ""Year after year, Congress continues to expand military spending while denying investments in the programs that will truly build a safer, healthier future for working- and middle-class families. The cost of passing this bill in the form of denied rights and wasteful spending is simply too great.""

In posts on Bluesky, journalist Erin Reed called out the Senate Democrats who helped pass the bill, given its attacks on LGBTQ+ Americans and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)—common targets of congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.

""In 2024, the NDAA became the vehicle for one of the most consequential betrayals of transgender Americans by national Democrats in recent memory, after Democrats allowed provisions targeting trans military family members and dependents to stand when they had control of the Senate and White House,"" Reed noted.

""This year, history is repeating itself,"" she said. ""Senate Democrats dropped key objections and allowed a vote to proceed on the bill—ultimately passing the Senate version of the bill, complete with anti-trans culture-war riders, an anti-DEI clause, and no limits on the domestic deployment of US troops.""

Early Thursday afternoon, Duckworth, a veteran herself, said that she was blocking the NDAA until she secured a hearing to investigate the president's ""gross abuse of our military"" by sending soldiers into American cities. A few hours later—shortly before a federal judge temporarily blocked Trump's National Guard deployment in her state, Illinois—Duckworth announced that a hearing is planned.

Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), one of the Democrats who voted for the NDAA, secured sufficient bipartisan support for his amendment to end the authorizations for use of military force related to the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 invasion of Iraq. The Washington Post reported that ""the House bill also includes a similar measure, bringing Congress to the precipice of repealing the laws.""

Some other Democrat-proposed amendments weren't successful. According to The Hill:

Amendments that failed to pass included one from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) who had hoped to block money for President Trump to retrofit a luxury Qatari jet he accepted as an intended replacement for Air Force One.

""Retrofitting this foreign-owned luxury jet to make it fully operational will cost hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. That's money that shouldn't be wasted,"" Schumer said.

Among three who completed speech assessments, all showed significant improvement with one able to identify one- and two-syllable words with no visual cues and respond to distant sounds and speech in noisy environments

Latest DB-OTO data presented at AAO-HNSF; U.S. regulatory submission planned later this year, pending discussions with the FDA

TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced updated data for their investigational gene therapy DB-OTO for profound genetic hearing loss due to variants of the otoferlin ( OTOF ) gene were published in The New England Journal of Medicine and presented during an oral presentation at the annual American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNSF) meeting. These latest results from the pivotal CHORD trial show 11 out of 12 participants have experienced clinically meaningful hearing improvements, including 3 who achieved normal hearing levels. Additionally, eight participants with longer follow-up showed stability or continued improvement in their hearing, and among three who completed speech assessments, all showed significant improvement.

“Until now, genetic OTOF -related hearing loss was considered permanent, which is why many of us have dedicated our careers to this field,” said Lawrence R. Lustig, M.D., Chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a trial investigator. “This registrational data set showcases consistent, rapid and robust responses to DB-OTO, and for those followed to later timepoints, we’ve seen hearing stability as well as continued improvement in understanding of speech. These results are even more poignant when viewed by the families – as one of the parents said, their situation is now ‘unimaginable’ from one year ago. This truly represents a new era in the treatment of hearing loss.”

The CHORD trial evaluated pediatric participants with profound hearing loss due to variants of the OTOF gene that received a single administration of DB-OTO via intracochlear infusion. Among 12 participants (aged 10 months to 16 years), nine received the gene therapy unilaterally (in one ear) and three received it bilaterally (in both ears). The surgical procedure to administer DB-OTO leverages an approach similar to cochlear implantation, which enables use in young infants.

Nearly all participants (11 of 12; 14 of 15 treated ears) demonstrated improved hearing, responding within weeks of treatment. As published and presented, the trial met the primary endpoint with 9 participants experiencing hearing improvements at a threshold of ≤70 decibel hearing level (dBHL) as assessed by behavioral pure tone audiometry (PTA) at week 24. This threshold corresponds to a clinical standard that typically does not require cochlear implantation and enables natural acoustic hearing. Notably, 6 could hear soft speech without assistive devices, and 3 were further able to detect whispers (achieving normal hearing sensitivity). One participant who did not meet the primary PTA endpoint at week 24 further improved to achieve “nearly normal” hearing sensitivity at week 48. Nine participants also demonstrated an auditory brainstem response (ABR) at ≤90 decibels (dB), achieving the trial’s key secondary endpoint.

Hearing improvements remained stable or continued to improve in 8 participants who had follow-up visits of ≥36 weeks (up to 72 weeks). Speech development was also assessed in the 3 participants who were followed at least 48 weeks and all showed significant improvements. One of these participants demonstrated the ability to identify one- and two-syllable words with no visual cues and could respond to distant sounds and speech in noisy environments.

Across all 12 participants, both the surgical procedure and DB-OTO were well tolerated, and there were no DB-OTO-related adverse findings reported. Two participants experienced serious adverse events: one was attributed to a cochlear implant surgical complication and the other to a recent vaccination. Some participants experienced transient post-surgical vestibular adverse events (e.g., nystagmus, nausea, dizziness, vomiting), all of which fully resolved.

The U.S. regulatory application for DB-OTO is planned for later this year, pending discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). DB-OTO received Orphan Drug, Rare Pediatric Disease, Fast Track and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designations from the FDA. The European Medicines Agency also granted Orphan Drug Designation.

The potential use of DB-OTO for OTOF -related hearing loss is currently under clinical investigation, and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.

About OTOF -related Hearing Loss

Permanent congenital hearing loss (present at birth) is a significant unmet medical need that affects approximately 1.7 out of every 1,000 children born in the U.S. and approximately half of these cases have genetic causes. Notably, otoferlin-related hearing loss is ultra-rare, affecting 20-50 newborns per year in the U.S. This specific condition is caused by variants in the OTOF gene, which lead to a lack of a functional otoferlin protein that is critical for the communication between the sensory cells of the inner ear and the auditory nerve.

About the CHORD Trial

The CHORD trial is a registrational Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of DB-OTO in infants, children and adolescents with OTOF- related hearing loss. The trial is currently enrolling children (<18 years of age) across sites in the U.S., United Kingdom, Spain and Germany.

CHORD is being conducted in two parts. In the initial dose-escalation cohort (Part A), participants receive a single intracochlear infusion of DB-OTO in one ear. In the expansion cohort (Part B), participants receive DB-OTO in both ears at the selected dose from Part A.

Hearing improvements were assessed by PTA and ABR. PTA is the gold standard measurement of hearing sensitivity and is measured through behavioral responses to sound (e.g., turning head towards sound) that is emitted at different intensity levels and measured in dB. ABR corroborates these behavioral responses, serving as an objective confirmation of hearing function, and is measured through recording electrical brainstem responses to sound emitted at different intensity levels measured in dBs. At baseline, all participants had profound hearing loss (behavioral PTA), and no electrophysiological (ABR) responses at maximum sound levels.

Additional information about the trial, including enrollment, can be obtained by contacting clinicaltrials@regeneron.com .

About DB-OTO and the Regeneron Auditory Program

DB-OTO is an investigational cell-selective, dual adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector gene therapy designed to provide durable, physiological hearing to individuals with profound, congenital hearing loss caused by variants of the OTOF gene. The treatment aims to deliver a working copy of the OTOF gene to replace the non-functional otoferlin protein using a modified, non-pathogenic virus that is delivered via an infusion into the cochlea under general anesthesia (similar to the procedure used for cochlear implantation). In this gene therapy, the newly introduced OTOF gene is under the control of a proprietary cell-specific Myo15 promoter, which is intended to restrict expression only to hair cells that normally express otoferlin.

In addition to OTOF , Regeneron is committed to investigating several other targets for genetic forms of hearing loss.

TOP TALKER

IN A SLAP to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown, a federal judge in Chicago has temporarily halted plans to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois. The move stalls a key part of the president’s effort to boost federal presence in so-called sanctuary states.

U.S. District Judge April Perry issued the restraining order Thursday, casting doubt on the administration’s claims of unrest in Chicago. She described the narrative of violence as exaggerated and pointed to the use of tear gas and military-style tactics against “mostly peaceful demonstrators” — a group she noted was never more than a few hundred strong.

It’s a legal blow for Trump, who’s leaned hard into law-and-order messaging, especially in cities that limit cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Chicago and nearby Broadview — home to a major ICE facility — have been front and center in the administration’s push.

Within hours of the TRO, the Trump administration filed notice of appeal in the Seventh Circuit.

In Oregon, meanwhile, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals — which covers Oregon and other western states — signaled it was likely to rule in Trump’s favor on his deployment of the guard in Portland. Our story is here.

From the bench in Chicago: Perry, a Biden appointee, warned that National Guard troops lack the law-enforcement training to handle civil protests and could make things worse. “They’re not trained in de-escalation,” she said.

At the center of the case is Trump’s claim that Illinois is in “rebellion” — a legal basis to justify the deployment. Perry didn’t buy it and pressed the administration’s attorney repeatedly on that point.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul, who led the legal challenge, called the ruling a “victory for the rule of law,” saying the court recognized the administration’s lack of “credibility.”

The Illinois ruling drew praise from Gov. JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, who have accused Trump of using public safety as cover to go after political opponents.

Pritzker said the ruling shows “Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law,” according to a post.

And Johnson made clear: “The Trump administration is unreliable. They lie, misrepresent, and put people in danger.”

For the administration: Attorney Eric Hamilton defended the National Guard plans, citing the “urgent need” to protect federal agents and property tied to immigration enforcement.

After the ruling, he asked Perry to confirm that the order only blocks deployments in Illinois — she agreed.

The drama isn’t over. The TRO is for 14 days, and the Trump appeal will be on a fast track. Perry’s full written opinion will be released today.

THE BUZZ

SPRINGFIELD MOVES: Thursday’s court ruling addressed the National Guard, but Illinois Senate President Don Harmon says state lawmakers are examining how to address the federal immigration enforcement actions that are continuing in Illinois communities.

“People are on edge,” Harmon said in an interview ahead of next week’s legislative session. He cited masked individuals with no identification and driving unmarked cars as they detain people.

“I don’t know what tools we have to try to prevent that, but I’m damn well willing to try because that’s wrong,” Harmon said.

Although no specific bill has been filed yet, Harmon said the caucus is exploring options that could set legal boundaries for how and when federal immigration authorities can operate in Illinois, particularly in coordination with local or state agencies.

The challenge: “The system was not designed for the state to police a federal government. And a federal government assaulting an American state or an American city is just beyond the pale, so we are clearly in uncharted waters,” Harmon said.

Any ICE-related legislation could face legal scrutiny and political opposition, but Harmon said that’s not a reason to shy away.

The administration, in the meantime, has said it wants to deport Abrego again, this time to some other country.
Abrego told the administration in August that he would accept deportation to Costa Rica.
“I understand a notice was prematurely sent to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” Schultz said.
Schultz did provide some new details about the Abrego deportation efforts.","Abrego is originally from El Salvador. He entered the U.S. illegally and lived in Maryland for more than a decade before he was arrested in March and deported to a notorious Salvadoran prison. Courts declared that deportation illegal because it violated a 2019 order from an immigration judge who barred the U.S. from sending him there due to potential persecution by a local gang.

The Trump administration returned Abrego to the U.S. in June under court order. Federal prosecutors simultaneously charged him with human smuggling in Tennessee — charges Abrego denies.

The administration, in the meantime, has said it wants to deport Abrego again, this time to some other country. But Abrego’s lawyers argued during Friday’s hearing that the administration is dragging its feet in those deportation efforts in order to keep Abrego in immigration jail and pressure him to plead guilty.

The meager and unsuccessful deportation efforts could lead to Abrego being released from immigration detention within days, if U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis concludes the government hasn’t shown it’s making a sincere and substantial effort to find a destination for Abrego.

Abrego told the administration in August that he would accept deportation to Costa Rica. One of his lawyers, Andrew Rossman, said Friday that the administration’s scattershot attempts to identify African countries instead show that the administration is intent on refusing the Costa Rica offer.

“We now know they are 0 for 3. Three strikes and you’re out. They have spun the globe and picked various places … to fail on purpose by selecting places that would be completely unpalatable for Mr. Abrego,” Rossman told Xinis. “What we’ve been getting in this courtroom is a lot of run-around.”

The appearance that arrangements for Abrego’s deportation were being intentionally or unintentionally fumbled by the administration was underscored by the testimony of Immigration and Customs Enforcement official John Schultz, who said lower-level personnel at his agency erred by formally notifying Abrego Thursday that the U.S. government intended to send him to Ghana.

“I understand a notice was prematurely sent to Mr. Abrego Garcia,” Schultz said. “I believe the field office was just trying to get ahead of things so that, if Ghana did say yes, removal would be quicker.”

Xinis held the daylong hearing in connection with a lawsuit Abrego filed seeking his release from immigration detention. She ordered the government to produce one or more witnesses Friday with “first-hand knowledge” about the administration’s efforts to find a country to send Abrego to.

Schultz did provide some new details about the Abrego deportation efforts. He said the State Department reported that officials in Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland, “said no initially” when they were asked just this week to accept Abrego. But, he said, discussions are ongoing.

“I don’t know if there’s a rank structure on the next country if Eswatini doesn’t work,” Schultz said.

Schultz also appeared to confirm the White House’s involvement in selecting countries Abrego might be sent to. He said an official at the Homeland Security Council, Matt Ochoa, told him that Uganda was a place the administration wanted to send Abrego to, but that eventually fell through. Justice Department attorneys cut short that questioning with an executive privilege claim.

However, Schultz acknowledged he’d had no significant involvement in the Abrego matter before this week and said he was entirely unaware of discussions about sending Abrego to Costa Rica. That irritated the judge, who complained that aspects of her order were “ignored” by the government.

“You come today with a witness who knows nothing about Costa Rica — I mean, less than nothing,” said Xinis, an Obama appointee. “That seems to be in contravention of this order.”

Under a 2001 Supreme Court case, immigrants can’t typically be detained for more than six months unless their deportation is reasonably foreseeable.

Abrego’s lawyers and the government disagree about when that six-month clock started. His attorneys say it was back in 2019 when Abrego was ordered deported by an immigration judge, albeit with the caveat he could not be sent to El Salvador. The Justice Department contends the clock didn’t begin running until August.

Rossman argued that the time Abrego spent in prison in El Salvador from March to June should count as immigration detention, but regardless of the calculation the government failed to show it was making sincere efforts to find a country to take Abrego. The attorney said the administration is holding him “for political purposes” and to avoid going back on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s vow that Abrego will never walk the streets of America again.

During a separate court session Friday in Nashville, the judge presiding over Abrego’s criminal case set a hearing for Nov. 3 to take evidence and possibly testimony about whether the charges should be dismissed on the grounds that the Trump administration instituted them to lash back at Abrego for defeating the government in court over his illegal deportation.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F77%2Fad%2Fb8f009754aa090f4357389826bc1%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2231303351,N,,2025-10-10 21:57:15.263226

Joshua Blackman, South Texas College of Law professor, said the federal government does not need permission from states to defend federal facilities. The Trump administration's position is that it needs to deploy the National Guard to protect federal personnel and Immigration and Customs Enforcement buildings.

""This is a principle that goes back to the beginning of the Republic,"" Blackman told Fox News Digital, pointing to the landmark case McCulloch v. Maryland, which found that Maryland could not tax a national bank created by Congress.

The high court said in that case that allowing a state to impose such a burden on a federal institution would violate the Constitution's supremacy clause, which says federal law trumps state law.

The need for the National Guard

During one set of oral arguments this week before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, a Trump administration lawyer argued that unrest in Portland, prompted by ICE activity, justified the deployment of about 200 National Guard soldiers.

""For months, the ICE facility in Portland and the federal law enforcement officers who work there have faced a steady stream of violence, threats of violence and harassment from violent agitators bent on impeding federal immigration enforcement,"" said Eric McArthur, arguing for the Justice Department.

The rebellion statute that Trump is using to federalize the National Guard, which governors have shared authority over, can be invoked in those situations, McArthur argued.

He also said it was the government's position that the courts had no say over Trump's assessment of the need for the military. Blackman made a similar point.

""The statute lets the president make the judgment over the need. It's not clear to me that a court can second-guess it,"" Blackman said.

States are ‘frustrating’ immigration enforcement

In court papers, the Trump administration has also cited a case from 1890, Neagle v. Cunningham, which established that the president has authority under the Constitution’s take care clause to ""take care"" that federal laws be carried out, including by doing what is necessary to protect those executing immigration laws.

In Neagle, a U.S. marshal shot and killed a person who attacked a Supreme Court justice, and the Supreme Court found that the State of California could not prosecute the marshal for murder since the marshal was protecting a federal officer.

FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT TO PORTLAND AMID CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE

Blackman said that states have for years been ""frustrating"" federal immigration enforcement and that these blue-state lawsuits trying to challenge the National Guard’s presence were an instance of that.

He said the states' resistance did not ""quite rise to the level of nullification,"" like when states in the South tried to block integration of segregated schools, but that it was ""in the ballpark."" If states were to defy court orders, that could escalate matters, Blackman said.

The lawsuits, which could rise to the Supreme Court, especially if the circuit courts were to rule against Trump in the coming days, could help to sharpen the dividing line between state and federal authority over law enforcement.

Policing falls under ‘state's responsibilities'

Like Oregon and Illinois, Matt Cavedon, a director at the CATO Institute, said the 10th Amendment is also in play in these cases and that it implies that the Trump administration cannot typically take over a state's law enforcement responsibilities.

Cavedon also said it was unusual, in his view, that a Republican government would adopt a more expanded view of federal power.

""It's not usually conservatives who are arguing that there are just vast unenumerated federal powers belonging to the president, certainly in the domestic context,"" Cavedon told Fox News Digital.

Cavedon said the events in the two states are ""really core issues of public security and safety, which are at the heart of what a state's responsibilities are."" Oregon and Illinois leaders have made similar claims that nothing extraordinary was playing out crime-wise to warrant National Guard intervention.

""I think the 10th Amendment answers a question: Any powers that are not conferred on the federal government are reserved to the states, respectively,"" Cavedon added.",https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/f158c403-trump-national-guard-portland.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 20:58:17.923952

After a more than six-hour hearing, District Judge Paula Xinis said a witness provided by the Justice Department showed little evidence that the Trump administration made an effort to remove Abrego Garcia to the southern African nation of Eswatini, and knew nothing about Abrego Garcia agreeing to be removed to Costa Rica.

The witness tapped by the Department of Justice was John Schultz, a deputy assistant director who oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement removal operations.

After hearing from him, Xinis said keeping Abrego Garcia detained indefinitely would likely be unconstitutional. She said she would issue an order soon.

Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran immigrant whose wrongful deportation from Maryland put a spotlight on the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is currently detained in Pennsylvania.

His attorneys have argued the Trump administration is using detention to punish Abrego Garcia because officials are not trying to remove him, even after Abrego Garcia agreed to be deported to Costa Rica.

‘Three strikes, you’re out’

Xinis expressed her frustration with Department of Justice attorneys for not providing a witness who would give clear answers on how immigration officials were handling the removal of Abrego Garcia.

“We're getting to the three strikes, you’re out,” Xinis said.

Andrew J. Rossman, an attorney for Abrego Garcia, argued that if Immigration and Customs Enforcement is making no plans to immediately remove him, he should be released from detention.

He also argued that since March, when the Trump administration erroneously deported Abrego Garcia to a mega-prison in El Salvador, to the present, Abrego Garcia has been “in continuous containment” way past the six-month limit set by the Supreme Court regarding the detention of immigrants.

“The real aim of the government… is punitive, which is just to keep him incarcerated,” Rossman said. ""It's an overtly political purpose.”

Rossman told Xinis that he has not received an answer from the federal government as to why they will not remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, after he agreed to that proposal in August.

Xinis asked DOJ attorney Drew Ensign why Abrego Garcia hasn’t been removed to Costa Rica.

Ensign said that it was not clear to the government until Friday that Abrego Garcia had agreed to be removed to Costa Rica, because Abrego Garcia had previously expressed fear of being sent there.

Abrego Garcia changed his position after Costa Rica assured him he would be given refugee status.

“That is a new development that I will report back to people,” Ensign said.

Supreme Court ruling

A 2001 Supreme Court ruling does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them.

After 90 days without efforts to deport an immigrant, a challenge can be made because detaining that person any longer than a maximum of 180 days, or six months, would likely be unconstitutional, the high court found in Zadvydas v. Davis.

Earlier this week, Xinis seemed likely to order Abrego Garcia’s release from Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, where he has remained since late August.

Xinis, who also ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garica to the United States after she found his removal to El Salvador unlawful, is overseeing his habeas corpus petition, which challenges his detention.

Protesters rally outside the courthouse

Ahead of the hearing, dozens of supporters from the immigrant advocacy group CASA gathered in front of the District Court for the District of Maryland, chanting, “Somos todos Kilmar,” or, “We are all Kilmar.”

Rallygoers also chanted “What do we want? Justice!” “When do we want it? Now!”

Some also held signs urging the Trump administration to free Abrego Garcia.

Two Maryland state legislators, Dels. Nicole Williams and Bernice Mireku-North, both Democrats, joined the rally.

Williams sponsored legislation during this year’s General Assembly session to prohibit local police from entering into certain agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the ban, the biggest loss for Maryland immigration advocates this year.

“We are going to be working on legislation with regards to masking by law enforcement officers,” Williams said. “We need to start treating everyone, I don’t care where you’re from, in a humane and decent way. And that’s what we’re going to be fighting for every single day until Kilmar is free and Kilmar comes home. So stop using Kilmar for your own political gain. Bring Kilmar home.”

White House involvement

Schultz, the DOJ witness, revealed that the White House had direct involvement in picking Uganda as a potential third country of removal for ICE’s deportation of Abrego Garcia.

The move was unusual because the State Department typically coordinates third-country removals for the Department of Homeland Security.

Schultz said the Homeland Security Council, which operates within the White House, notified ICE of Uganda as a third country of removal. The Homeland Security Council works with the National Security Council of the White House.

While Uganda is no longer a third country of removal for Abrego Garcia, ICE is trying to now remove him to Eswatini.

Schultz said Eswatini has not agreed to take Abrego Garcia, but discussions, which he said started on Wednesday, are underway.

“The discussions are continuing,” Schultz said.

Schultz said he is not aware if ICE has not made any efforts to determine if Abrego Garcia would face persecution or be tortured or confined in Eswatini, or be removed a second time to El Salvador.

Eswatini has previously agreed to accept third-country removals from the U.S. and the two countries have a memorandum of understanding, he added.

Ghana another potential destination

Schultz said that ICE has also identified the west African country of Ghana as a potential nation for Abrego Garica’s removal. Schultz said once a third country has agreed to accept Abrego Garica, he could be removed by ICE within 72 hours.

However, Ghana’s Foreign Minister, Sam Okudzeto Ablakwa, wrote on social media that the country will not accept Abrego Garcia.

“This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,” he wrote. “In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.”

Schultz said that ICE ""prematurely"" sent a notice of removal to Abrego Garcia with Ghana as the designation.

The Costa Rica alternative

One of Abrego Garcia’s attorneys, Sascha Rand, grilled Schultz about why DHS would not remove him to Costa Rica, despite Abrego Garcia agreeing to go.

Schultz said he was unaware of the letter from Costa Rica’s government saying it would accept Abrego Garcia.

Another attorney for Abrego Garcia, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, said that the Trump administration offered to remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica in August if he were to plead guilty to criminal charges in a federal case in Tennessee.

Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his criminal case in Nashville said in court filings that the Trump administration is trying to get him to plead guilty to human smuggling charges by promising to remove him to Costa Rica if he does so, and threatening to deport him to Uganda if he refuses.

Rand asked Schultz if anyone from DHS was in contact with Costa Rica.

Schultz said he was unaware if there were conversations between the federal government and Costa Rica about removing him there.

Rossman said based on Schultz’s testimony, it was clear the Trump administration was “holding hostage passage to Costa Rica.”

“They aren’t presently intending to remove him,” he said. “They have spun the globe and picked various (African) countries… to fail on purpose.”

They went to work early that day; they headed home late in the afternoon. Hector, an undocumented immigrant who requested anonymity for this story when he and his son met with Mississippi Youth Media Project student journalists in Jackson in July 2025, was leaving Home Depot on Interstate 20 when he looked in his rearview mirror and saw a K-9 police SUV, its windows blacked out.

“At first I didn’t notice them,” David said in an in-person interview with the Mississippi Youth Media Project. “But then my dad said, ‘Look, there’s an SUV behind us.’”

A mile later, it was still trailing them.

The SUV continued to stay close behind Hector and his family before turning its lights on. Hector pulled the car over and waited patiently. The police officer got out, tapped the tailgate and continued walking up to the driver’s side window. David’s mind raced and jumped to what could possibly be happening. However, one thought stayed consistent: “I wish I was driving.”

Immediately, David asked why they were pulled over. The officer claimed the driver was driving recklessly. David, sitting in the passenger seat, saw nothing out of the ordinary in his father’s driving; both had, after all, been keenly aware of the vehicle following them closely.

The officer asked for Hector’s ID. David sat still, on edge, not knowing what could happen next because his father was undocumented. The officer assured Hector and his family that the stop was just going to be a warning. He then ordered Hector to step out of the vehicle for a search. After patting Hector down, the officer walked to his car and made a few calls, telling the family to sit on the curb and wait.

Within minutes, eight more law-enforcement vehicles arrived on the side of I-20 where the original officer’s vehicle had pulled them over. Brandon Police Department officers arrived, then the Pearl Police Department joined them. (Neither commented for this story.) The last cars to arrive belonged to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The main officer from Brandon began reading Hector his Miranda rights while simultaneously slapping the handcuffs around his wrists, the men told the Mississippi Free Press student journalists. Hector was charged with reckless driving.

The arrest was accomplished in a flash. The immigration sweep that ensnared Hector that day parted 27 men and women from their families. Some have been deported. Others languish. Most were caught somewhere in the tangle of immigrants, side-by-side with Hector, in the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Jena, trapped in an American limbo.

‘He’s My Role Model’

The 17-year-old son watched as ICE ripped his father from him. “It all felt like a lot to bear,” David told the Youth Media Project. “He’s my role model, my biggest supporter. I rely on him a lot.”

The officer took all of Hector’s belongings, including $200 in cash he was carrying. They did, however, forget to confiscate his phone, which Hector kept on him during his detainment.

David watched his dad step into the backseat of the blacked-out SUV. As it sped off, his mind spun. He began running in the scorching sun after the car and watched as it disappeared from sight. The son was able to track his dad’s location through a tracking app called Life360. Once he got into Madison, David walked to the sheriff’s office.

Upon arrival, David saw a pastor who had been known to help immigrants, but this time the religious leader explained apologetically to the teenager that, due to the presidential administration’s restrictions, he couldn’t help Hector’s family.

‘“(The pastor) tried talking to some of the agents,” David said. “But they said they couldn’t help us with anything.”

The teenager, feeling defeated, finally called his mom from the station. He tried to cover his pain and panic with a simple “Hey, mom,” then told her what happened. She immediately picked him up and drove home, cautious of any further police presence.

Call in the Middle of the Night

At home, the family began calling all the local jails—and Hector’s phone—to find him. There was no response. It was almost as if he was a ghost. It was getting late when David’s mom suggested it was time to call it a night and try again in the morning. Everyone agreed.

The phone rang around midnight. David immediately woke and looked at the phone. It was his dad. The phone had awakened David’s brother as well, so they answered the call together. Hector explained that he had snuck out his phone to call them. He informed them that ICE was still holding him at the Madison County Detention Center.

“I’m OK, don’t worry. Everything will be OK soon,” Hector said as he hung up.

The boys sprinted out of the room and down the hall to wake up their mom.

“We just talked to Dad!” David told her. “He’s in Madison County!”

For their mother, it was a bittersweet moment. Her husband was healthy and in communication with the family, however briefly. But as suddenly as he had appeared, he was gone. And this was only the beginning for Hector. He was up against a system that meant to keep him captive, a system set in place by years of consecutive administrations—but massively expanded under President Donald Trump.

His dad’s words that night were the last David would hear from him for the next few weeks.

Immigrant Health Care At Risk

The Trump administration has dramatically tightened immigration enforcement, with the U.S. Department of Justice aiming to enact a mass-deportation regime by framing immigrants as a “national security threat.” President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” provided tens of billions to ICE’s budget for hiring and the construction of new detention facilities, like the beleaguered but still open “Alligator Alcatraz” in Florida, making it a larger law-enforcement agency than the FBI, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is engaging in expedited removal, which allows the government to quickly deport someone whom they believe is undocumented without the opportunity to see a judge.

President Trump signed the executive order on Jan. 21, 2025, to begin expedited removal anywhere in the country of any undocumented person who cannot prove they had been in the U.S. for two years before the arrest. These changes, which closely follow Project 2025 campaign promises and plans, were set into effect on Jan. 21, 2025—just one day after Trump took office.

The new governmental changes not only affect the detainee process but also the community’s access to health care. The Immigration Forum reports that 45% to 71% of undocumented immigrants do not have access to health care.

President Trump included plans to ensure that American taxpayer resources are not used to support immigrants in the United States in his “Big Beautiful Bill”—including access to health care. Parts of the bill, which he signed into law on July 4, 2025, are aimed at stopping immigrants from obtaining Social Security Act benefits, which include Medicare and Medicaid.

‘Are You Legal Here?’

Isaura Camacho, a community health organizer at Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance, says new anti-immigration policies hurt the Hispanic community’s access to medical services. Camacho took her own parents and community members to discount clinics that were once federally funded but are not now.

“The first thing that was affected was the discounted clinics,” Camacho said. “The prices have gone up on appointments and medicine.”

These clinics were once available to undocumented immigrants who needed affordable health care, but new policies have created a barrier to services for immigrants.

Camacho described her experience assisting a young Colombian woman. “She couldn’t afford routine check-ups while being eight to nine months pregnant,” Camacho said. “The first thing they asked her while she was in serious pain was, ‘Are you legal here?’”

These new policy changes were not just hurting people who were detained but were destroying the entire community around her, Camacho soon realized.

“This immigration system was created for the U.S. to benefit; yet, the very people who are contributing to this system get no access to health care,” Camacho said.

‘Madison County Still Has Your Money’

The Madison County Sheriff’s Department processed Hector into the detention center in Madison County. They took all his belongings, along with the $200 cash he had worked hard to earn. When they took his money, they gave Hector a receipt and told him to keep up with it for the rest of his stay. He thought of this as a little strange, but he held on to that receipt for dear life.

As weeks went by, Hector began to get more comfortable in the system. He started talking to more people who shared similar experiences and, through this, he uncovered a dark secret: People who lost their receipts lost that money forever. The money was very important to detainees because that’s what they planned to use when they returned to the outside world. The receipt was their lifeline.

When Hector was transferred to Jena, Louisiana, he was instructed to give officials the receipt for his money, and he did. Instead of giving Hector the money, though, the family said Madison County, which declined comment to YMP student reporters, still had his money. It would take Hector over a month of calling with David’s help after his eventual release on bond to locate those funds.

But Hector couldn’t dwell too much on this money problem. From the time he walked into the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, commonly referred to as Jena or LaSalle Detention Center, he had larger problems to worry about.

‘I Couldn’t Even Eat’

On June 17, 2025, Hector walked into the Jena facility along with 20 to 30 detained immigrants. White brick walls loomed over him, and when he walked in, he was stunned by how crowded it was. Hector is not the only Mississippi immigrant who has been held at Jena. Others, such as Kerlin Moreno-Orellana and Kasper Eriksen, were also imprisoned there.

“There were around 90 to 100 people crowded into one cell with me,” Hector said.

The overcrowding was overwhelming. He was a long way from home. Problems in the facility began unfolding in front of his eyes.

The LaSalle Detention Center has faced several allegations and complaints from detainees saying their basic needs, such as food and water, were not met. Several alleged denials of—or restricted access to—medical treatment.

“We would have to ask two to three times before we were ever able to receive medical attention,” Hector said.

Hector said that, while detained, he and other inmates were exposed to bad drinking water, sickening him and many others. “They gathered us all together and announced to us that the water was contaminated,” Hector said. “But I was already experiencing stomach aches and problems prior to them announcing it.”

Mistreatment of immigrants, including the lack of safe drinking water, is a known problem in detention centers in Louisiana, both before Trump’s second term began and since his anti-immigration efforts this year.

The Jena processing center’s response to the issue was to give inmates one small 16-ounce bottle of water a day, Hector said.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been notified multiple times of contamination issues at the processing center, as well as complaints of medical, verbal, sexual and physical abuse. Yale Law School students and civil-rights advocates filed a complaint about its drinking water and food within the past several years. The Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights filed another recent complaint for a detainee who has experienced abuse at these facilities. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has conducted several internal investigations on the Jena facility and others in Louisiana.

“I couldn’t even eat because of how filthy everything was,” Hector said.

The GEO Group, a private prison company, operates the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center, or CLIPC, and has been managing the facility. The GEO Group runs 28 immigrant facilities across the U.S.

In response to an interview request, GEO Group spokesman Christopher V. Ferreira issued a statement on the water contamination at the processing center: “We can confirm that during the middle of June, water at the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center was impacted for two days by scheduled maintenance to the City’s water main by the City of Jena. In the interim, all individuals at the Center were provided with bottled water. Water services at the facility have been functioning properly following the completion of the maintenance by the City.”

The Youth Media Project contacted the GEO group with further questions, but Ferreira did not respond to inquiries about detainees reporting being sickened during the water outage, neither how many reported symptoms of illness, nor what the facility did to treat their condition.

ICE Response: ‘At Times Things Happen’

Jena is one of many detention centers that the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses to detain immigrants. ICE’s stated goal at these detention centers is to “arrest and remove aliens who undermine the safety of our nation’s communities and the integrity of U.S. immigration laws.”

The Youth Media Project spoke with Lindsay Williams, a spokesperson for ICE for southern states, including Mississippi. Williams stated that ICE has no record of water issues in Jena and does not handle any financial issues within the detention center.

“Our mission is to identify, arrest, detain and remove aliens from the country,” Williams said. “We do that every day.”

Williams says that facilities holding immigrants across the U.S. may have problems but have been or are currently being repaired. “I can tell you (that) just like any jail or any facility if there are plumbing issues or some sort of infrastructure issues, that has happened,” Williams said. “Just like in your own personal homes, at times things happen. You work around that.”

The ICE spokesman said he does not know the specifics of the water issues at Jena. However, he told YMP that ICE performs several inspections through a third-party inspector. July 26-28, 2022, inspection report, the Jena facility received a superior rating on the care of the facility.

Williams had no clear answer on ICE’s part in monies taken at arrests.

“I don’t know exactly how it all works, because it’s not something I do. There is a record of somebody being in a detention facility,” Williams said. “I’d imagine that there’s a record of what their property was or is.”

Williams said ICE’s main goal is to protect the states and to have an honest system. “One of the major things that we want to do is to get everything right,” he added.

‘We Couldn’t Give Up’

The Madison County Sheriff’s Office released Hector on bond to go home with his family at the end of June. Although he was finally home with his sons and their mother, it was not the end for them. The family now has to figure out how to navigate life after the ordeal.

“We were trying to figure all sorts of things out and figuring out what is going to come next,” David said.

Hector now awaits his master hearing, which is a public proceeding where the judge explains the charges against the respondent and shares the next steps. The hearing has been pushed back to sometime next summer. Hector’s family must also continue paying the legal fees that come with the process of deportation.

“The bond alone was $7,500,” David said. “Not only that, but we have to pay for legal fees and for his attorney to represent him at the master hearing.”

David graduated top of his high school class with high honors this past May. He planned on entering the National Guard to serve as a combat medic; however, he expressed second thoughts now that he has seen the actions of the new administration.

“I honestly feel betrayed,” David said. “To get my father taken away like that months after I made this decision is heartbreaking.”

He still wants to serve to save his family.

“At times, yes, I still want to serve, and even though I didn’t join the military because I wanted to save my parents’ citizenship, I’m going to use that in hopes that it can carve them a path to citizenship,” David said.

Hector’s story is one of hundreds that haven’t been told. Similar incidents are happening throughout the entire state.

Isaura Camacho, the community health organizer at Mississippi Immigrant Rights Alliance, said the system has had flaws for a while. Her family had a similar experience with ICE. “I remember even experiencing the same thing during Katrina. In 2005, my parents were wrongfully accused of human trafficking,” Camacho said.

She added that the problems create mistrust for organizations that are trying to support the Hispanic population of the state. “I want to help the community, and I want them to come to us for help.”

For now, Hector remains with his family in the Jackson area, awaiting what will come next. “We just had to keep going. We couldn’t give up,” David told the Youth Media Project.

Federal agents were present twice in the ""Alpha"" lot, a designated spot for rideshare drivers, with the most recent time being around 2:15 p.m. Agents were asking drivers if they were U.S. citizens and to show proof. One agent came up to NBC Chicago reporter Regina Waldroup and asked if she was a U.S. citizen.

As of the late afternoon, about 50 rideshare vehicles were in the parking lot. But NBC Chicago was told there are usually several hundred. Several people were handcuffed and taken into custody.

Agents showed up in nondescript white mini vans; they were at the lot for about 15 to 20 minutes.

The sweep marked the second time ICE went to the lot on Friday.

One driver described what happened around 10 a.m.

""It was pretty surprising to see them up here, though, honestly,"" said rideshare driver Donald Cooper. ""I didn't even see them. I was sitting in the lot for a nice little minute, and I pulled out, and they were all around.""

The union that represents rideshare drivers issued a statement that, in part, read:

""We are deeply concerned that the drivers’ due process rights were violated at O'Hare today. This is part of a broader pattern of attacks on immigrant families by an administration that continues to weaponize fear and division instead of investing in solutions that strengthen our communities…we are working diligently to gather more information.""

More than 1,000 immigrants have been arrested since an immigration crackdown started last month in the Chicago area, DHS previously said.

DHS released the following statement from Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin on Friday evening:

“U.S. Border Patrol conducted a targeted immigration enforcement operation at O’Hare International Airport that arrested of 12 illegal aliens, all in violation of our nation’s immigration laws. Among those arrested was Elvis Rodriguez-Colmenares, a criminal illegal alien from Venezuela, who was previously arrested for domestic battery causing great bodily harm. These criminals will remain in ICE custody pending removal proceedings.

“Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, if you break the law, you will face the consequences. Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the U.S.”",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/ice-agents-chicago-rideshare-lot.png?resize=1200%2C675&quality=85&strip=all,N,,2025-10-10 19:59:13.250896

Mr. Trump fired Ms. Cook in August because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage.
The White House first telegraphed that it would pursue layoffs during the shutdown before the fiscal stalemate even began.
Many Democrats condemned the Trump administration for targeting federal workers while many were out of work or serving without pay.
Analysts had speculated that China’s move could be Beijing’s effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi.","Ms. James has called the charges “baseless” and said the indictment was “nothing more than a continuation of the president’s desperate weaponization of our justice system.”

Mortgage fraud accusations have become one of the main tools the Trump administration has used to harass its political enemies.

William J. Pulte, who was tapped by Mr. Trump to run the Federal Housing Finance Agency, has threatened a crackdown on mortgage fraud. In addition to initiating the investigation into Ms. James, who prosecuted the president and his companies, Mr. Pulte started an inquiry into the finances of Senator Adam B. Schiff, the California Democrat who led the effort to impeach the president during his first term.

The type of mortgage fraud that the president and his allies have used to bring charges against adversaries involves a false claim that a second home or rental property is a principal residence in hopes of obtaining more favorable financial terms.

That sort of allegation somewhat echoes a New York civil case that Ms. James won against Mr. Trump in 2024, which found Mr. Trump liable for fraudulently inflating his net worth to obtain loans or tax benefits. A New York appeals court panel later rejected the $500 million penalty the judge in the case imposed, but let the judgment stand so Mr. Trump could continue appealing it.

A mortgage fraud accusation was also used to ensnare Lisa Cook, a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Cook in August because of allegations that she falsified records to obtain favorable terms on a mortgage.

Mr. Pulte posted images of her signatures on social media that appeared to show that she improperly designated both a condominium in Atlanta and a home in Ann Arbor, Mich., as her primary residence when taking out loans.

“When someone commits mortgage fraud, they undermine the faith and integrity of our System,” Mr. Pulte said on social media. “No one is above the law.”

The move came as Mr. Trump railed against the nation’s central bank for being slow to cut interest rates and looked to staff the Federal Reserve Board with loyalists.

The Supreme Court said Ms. Cook, who denied any wrongdoing, could remain a governor on the Federal Reserve Board while her lawsuit against Mr. Trump proceeded.

“Another vindictive prosecution of someone on the president’s enemies list,” Mr. Schiff said on social media of Ms. James’ indictment on Thursday. “Another terrible abuse of the Justice Department as an instrument of Trump’s retribution campaign.”

The ruling is the third over the past week against the Trump administration in Chicago. On Wednesday, a federal judge imposed new limits on ICE agents, restricting their ability to make arrests without warrants. On Thursday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the deployment of the National Guard, which the Trump administration hoped to send to protect federal property from protesters who were angered over immigration enforcement.

In all three rulings, the judges said ICE’s tactics were informing their decisions.

“The Court concludes that because the persistent protests are a direct response to the Federal Defendants’ ongoing operations, there is no reason to believe that they will end and that the fence will be voluntarily removed any time soon,” Judge Hunt wrote.

She said she reached that conclusion after Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, told the court that there would “be no change in our operational posture” until the protests stopped at the agency’s facility in Broadview, just west of Chicago.

Katrina Thompson, the mayor of Broadview, praised the decision as “a validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety.” She said that the fence would have to be dismantled by Friday.

“Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge’s order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance,” she said.

Federal authorities had the fence installed last month in response to the protests, which sometimes turned violent. But in recent days, demonstrations at the facility have been peaceful and small in numbers. To quell the activists, Ms. Thompson on Monday issued a curfew near the facility.

On Friday morning, a few hundred protesters gathered at the facility in Broadview. Many carried signs, sang songs and prayed with religious groups. Some arrived during the curfew and were given citations, and a handful were arrested because they refused to get off the street.

Whenever ICE vehicles arrived, the crowd chanted “shame, shame.” By 10 a.m., many began to leave and the crowd decreased to about 100 people.

At the federal courthouse in downtown Chicago, it was even quieter. Michael Boyte, a 41-year-old bartender from Chicago, was one of about eight gathered to protest the arrests of two activists. One of the arrested, Marimar Martinez, had been shot by a federal agent.

“We thought it was important to come out and let the people who were arrested know that we got their backs,” Mr. Boyte said.

Meantime, immigration operations continued to make waves in the city. On Friday morning, a producer at one of Chicago’s largest television news outlets was detained by two Border Patrol agents in the morning rush hour.

These deals are the result of pressure from Mr. Trump, who has threatened tariffs, demanding that drug companies lower prices and bring manufacturing back to the United States. Pfizer said last week that its drug-pricing deal with the administration had helped secure a three-year grace period from Mr. Trump’s tariffs.

In July, AstraZeneca said it planned to spend $50 billion over the next five years building and expanding factories and research facilities in the United States.

On Thursday, the company held a groundbreaking ceremony for one of those manufacturing investments, at a site in Virginia that it said would help manufacture drugs for cancer, weight loss and blood pressure.

Pascal Soriot, AstraZeneca’s chief executive, was expected to attend a scheduled event about drug prices at the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. AstraZeneca declined to comment.

In July, Mr. Trump sent letters to 17 of the largest drugmakers, including AstraZeneca, asking them to lower some of their prices. Officials said they were in talks with other major drugmakers about reaching similar agreements.

Under the terms of the Pfizer deal, the company agreed to sell nearly all of its drugs to Medicaid, the health insurance program for lower-income Americans, at about the same prices that it offers to European countries. Some of Pfizer’s best-selling drugs include the blood thinner Eliquis; the cancer drugs Ibrance and Xtandi; and the Covid treatment Paxlovid.

Officials also announced plans to create a website, TrumpRx.gov, which would send American patients to direct-sales websites offered by various drugmakers like Pfizer. Officials said Mr. Trump’s online drugstore would be up and running next year.

Whether the deals will yield significant savings for taxpayers under Medicaid is unknown. In many cases, the prices Medicaid programs pay for drugs are already similar to those in Europe, experts said.

Under Pfizer’s agreement, the company made no commitment to lower prices for drugs it currently sells for employers, insurers and other government programs like Medicare, which shoulder most of the costs of drugs in the United States.

Brand-name drug prices in the United States are three times as high, on average, as those in peer nations. But the disparities vary across types of insurance. Drugmakers already give Medicaid lower prices than other payers in the United States.

AstraZeneca’s best-selling products include Farxiga, for diabetes, kidney disease and heart failure; Tagrisso and Imfinzi, for cancer; and the inhaler Symbicort, for respiratory problems.

Like other large multinational drugmakers, AstraZeneca has long had a presence in the United States, its most important market. The company has moved recently to strengthen those ties.

AstraZeneca said last week that it planned to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange next year, though it will remain headquartered in Britain and listed in London and Stockholm.

Drugmakers that are building factories in the United States are expected to be at least partly exempt from Mr. Trump’s threatened tariffs on imported medicines. His administration has said the tariffs will be up to 15 percent on drugs from the European Union and 100 percent from other parts of the world. His administration has delayed imposing drug tariffs he had said would begin on Oct. 1.

In an event on Monday at the Aspen Institute, Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he expected a series of similar announcements from drug companies in the coming weeks. He praised the voluntary nature of these deals over policymaking that would have most likely prompted legal challenges from the industry.

“All these are opportunities for us to re-envision the way the government normally works, not based on litigation, slowing everything down, but by leapfrogging litigation, if possible, to get people to do what they probably want to do,” he said.

The project, known as Esmeralda 7, would have comprised a sprawling network of solar panels and batteries across 118,000 acres of federally owned land in the Nevada desert northwest of Las Vegas. It was expected to produce up to 6.2 gigawatts of energy, enough to power nearly two million homes.

The developers of the project included NextEra Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, and Invenergy, a company that builds solar and wind farms as well as natural gas plants and battery storage systems.

The Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management quietly updated its webpage on the project’s permitting process late Thursday to reflect the cancellation. The webpage did not provide additional information.

Alyse Sharpe, a spokeswoman for the Interior Department, said in a Friday email that Esmeralda 7 consisted of seven separate solar projects and that the developers could still seek permits for each individual project.

But restarting the permitting process, which was already in its late stages, could lead to significant delays.

Neil Nissan, a spokesman for NextEra, said in an email that the utility was “committed” to its portion of the project and would work with the Interior Department.

The cancellation caused concern on Capitol Hill, where Nevada lawmakers and clean energy lobbyists said they were scrambling to find out details.

“The Trump Administration’s lack of transparency around wind and solar projects has caused chaos and confusion,” Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement, adding that Interior Secretary Doug Burgum should “clarify the administration’s actions soon.”

The move comes as the Trump administration has taken a rapid-fire series of steps to slow or stop the construction of renewable energy projects on public and private lands across the country.

The Interior Department is now requiring dozens of formerly routine approvals for wind and solar projects to undergo new layers of political review by the interior secretary’s office, a policy that is causing significant permitting delays. The agency is also opening investigations into bird deaths caused by wind farms and withdrawing millions of acres of federal waters previously available for leasing by offshore wind companies.

In addition, the Interior Department has ordered work to stop on several wind farms off the coast of New England. Last month, however, a federal judge ruled that the Danish energy company Orsted could restart work on one of these projects, a $6.2 billion wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island that is 80 percent complete.

At the same time, the Trump administration has continued to approve permits for new oil and gas drilling and to encourage coal mining. The burning of fossil fuels is a main driver of climate change.

During the ongoing government shutdown, the Interior Department has designated employees who process oil drilling permits as essential, enabling them to keep working while other workers are furloughed.

Gov. Joe Lombardo of Nevada, a Republican, sent a letter to Mr. Burgum in August expressing concern about the new layers of political review for solar and wind projects. He wrote that the additional scrutiny could “prevent or unnecessarily delay energy development in the state that is poised to help meet the growing energy demands of the mining industry and data centers.”

Representatives for the governor did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Esmeralda 7 had advanced through the permitting process under the Biden administration, which prioritized clean energy development as part of its ambitious climate agenda. But after President Trump took office, the Bureau of Land Management declined to release a final environmental impact statement, the next step in the process to approve the project.

NextEra was among the companies that donated at least $5 million to fund the construction of Mr. Trump’s $200 million ballroom in the East Wing of the White House, CBS News reported. Another one of the utility’s large solar projects in Nevada, known as Dodge Flat II, was still listed as “in progress” on the Bureau of Land Management website on Friday.

Early indications suggested that the layoffs could be significant, affecting a wide range of agencies, including the Departments of Commerce, Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, and Treasury, according to officials there and congressional aides who later learned of the plans.

Unions representing federal workers quickly denounced the attempted firings as illegal, as they blasted the Trump administration for trying to use the government’s work force as a bargaining chip in a political feud. Even before the White House had announced that it would proceed with cuts, labor officials had sued to block them, and on Friday they urged a federal judge considering the case to intervene swiftly.

“It is disgraceful that the Trump administration has used the government shutdown as an excuse to illegally fire thousands of workers who provide critical services to communities across the country,” said Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, one of the unions suing the administration.

Many Democrats and even one Republican — Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chamber’s lead appropriator — also condemned the administration for the timing and scope of its attempted firings. In a statement, Ms. Collins blamed Democrats for the shutdown but said that terminating federal workers could “cause harm to families in Maine and throughout our country.”

”Regardless of whether federal employees have been working without pay or have been furloughed, their work is incredibly important to serving the public,” she said.

The White House repeatedly declined to answer questions about its strategy or the scope of the layoffs. Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, said only in a social media post that the “RIFs have begun,” referring to the reduction-in-force notices to federal employees about pending dismissals.

A White House official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the cuts as substantial. The president’s aides had previously indicated they could range into the thousands.

By seeking to fire federal workers during a shutdown, Mr. Trump risked a costly escalation in a fiscal stalemate that has no end in sight. Rather than negotiate a resolution with Democrats, the president has embraced the government closure as a political advantage, using it as an opportunity to try to rearrange the federal budget without Congress and exact revenge against his political foes.

The administration has already canceled or frozen tens of billions of dollars in federal aid that had primarily benefited Democratic-led cities and states. Mr. Trump has also threatened to slash what he has described as “Democrat agencies,” reducing spending perhaps on a permanent basis, even though lawmakers have not agreed to any cuts.

“We’ll be cutting some very popular Democrat programs that aren’t popular with Republicans, frankly,” Mr. Trump said at a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, adding that he would give Democrats a “little taste of their own medicine.”

If the Trump administration proceeds with its plans, a new round of layoffs could further decimate the federal work force, which is expected to employ 300,000 fewer people by the end of December compared with January, officials have said. The staggering decline is a direct result of Mr. Trump, who has presided over an aggressive and legally contested effort to shrink the bureaucracy through firings, layoffs and induced retirements.

Under its published guidelines, the government must give workers 60 days’ notice before a layoff, though this may be reduced to 30 days in certain exceptions.

The White House first telegraphed that it would pursue layoffs during the shutdown before the fiscal stalemate even began. In a memo last month, the president’s budget aides essentially argued that a lapse in funding would mean that the government no longer needed to retain some of its workers.

The Trump administration even appeared to issue guidance that allowed officials producing termination notices to work throughout the federal stoppage, a status typically reserved for the most vital employees, including military service members.

Unions representing federal workers have contested both the rationale for layoffs and the administration’s efforts to carry them out. On Friday, labor officials told the judge reviewing the case that they believed the cuts could be significant, citing one agency — the Treasury Department — where they believed officials were working to issue 1,300 terminations.

A court previously ordered the Trump administration to respond by Friday, at which point the government was supposed to offer an explicit accounting of the layoffs it was seeking.

Many Democrats condemned the Trump administration for targeting federal workers while many were out of work or serving without pay. Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, who leads his party on the House Budget Committee, described the layoffs on Friday as an “illegal” attempt by Mr. Trump to “seize more power for himself.”

By the afternoon, Democrats and Republicans did not seem anywhere close to a resolution that might reopen the government, with Congress having left Washington for the weekend.

Democrats continue to reject a Republican plan to reopen federal agencies into next month as they seek to extend a set of expiring subsidies that help millions of Americans afford health insurance.

“I think to their credit, the White House has now for 10 days laid off doing anything in hopes that enough Senate Democrats would come to their senses and do the right thing and fund the government,” Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the majority leader, told reporters on Friday.

But, he added, that could soon change.

“That’s what a shutdown does,” Mr. Thune said. “You put the administration and this presidency in a position where you have to make some hard decisions.”

The announcement followed a post Friday morning in which the president threatened retaliation and to cancel an upcoming meeting with China’s leader, Xi Jinping.

The president called the curbs that China put out this week on its exports of rare earth minerals “sinister and hostile” and said they would “make life difficult for virtually every Country in the World.” He added that he had planned to meet Mr. Xi in two weeks at an international economic conference in South Korea, “but now there seems to be no reason to do so.”

“One of the Policies that we are calculating at this moment is a massive increase of Tariffs on Chinese products coming into the United States of America,” he wrote. “There are many other countermeasures that are, likewise, under serious consideration.”

Markets shuddered at the developments, with the S&P 500 index sliding more than 2 percent on Friday.

Rare earth minerals, which are vital for making an array of products including motors, brakes, semiconductors and fighter jets, have been at the center of tensions between the United States and China this year. In April, the Chinese government responded to stiff tariffs Mr. Trump imposed on Chinese goods by clamping down on mineral exports destined for U.S. automakers and defense manufacturers.

The Trump administration tried to encourage China to back down by imposing its own restrictions on exports of chip design software, airplane engines and other products. U.S. tariffs on Chinese products rose to a minimum of 145 percent, bringing much trade between the countries to a halt.

But China’s curbs threatened to close U.S. factories and forced the United States, which depends on Chinese supplies, to pull back. Ultimately, officials from both countries reached a fragile truce in meetings this spring that led to Mr. Trump’s reducing his tariffs and Beijing’s approving more mineral exports.

On Thursday, Beijing again escalated its controls, asserting broader jurisdiction over the global manufacture of semiconductors and other technology.

The Chinese government said it would require foreign companies to obtain licenses to export products containing even a minimal amount of rare earths, including for chip manufacturing. It also put new controls on technology and equipment used for extracting and refining minerals, and for making electric vehicle batteries. Those rules are set to take effect Dec. 1.

China mines 70 percent of the world’s rare earths, and it also performs the chemical processing for roughly 90 percent of the global supply of such minerals. In addition to rare earths, the Chinese government has set out long-term plans in recent decades to dominate key industries, including steel, shipbuilding, robotics and biomedicine.

On Friday, China also announced an antimonopoly investigation into the American chipmaker Qualcomm and new fees for U.S. ships docking at Chinese ports.

The new restrictions have caused significant anxiety among U.S. companies. Analysts said the new limits could scramble the supply chains of some of the world’s biggest companies, including Nvidia and Apple.

Tech stocks were particularly hard hit on Friday, with Nvidia down almost 5 percent, Advanced Micro Devices falling almost 8 percent and the broader semiconductor sector sliding over 5 percent.

The stock market was already on edge this month, after five straight months of gains had lifted prices to record levels, prompting some investors to warn of the potential for a pullback.

Analysts had speculated that China’s move could be Beijing’s effort to amass leverage ahead of the meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi. If so, it may have backfired. In addition to the president’s calls for retaliation, other critics of China said the measures highlighted the need for the United States to reduce its exposure to the Chinese economy.

John Moolenaar, the chairman of the House Select Committee on China, called Beijing’s action “an economic declaration of war against the United States and a slap in the face to President Trump amid his efforts to fight for a level playing field.”

Mr. Moolenaar said the United States should immediately pass legislation to end preferential trade treatment for China, build the U.S. supply of minerals and “strangle China’s technology sector with export controls instead of selling it advanced chips.”

Wendy Cutler, a senior vice president at the think tank Asia Society Policy Institute, said the president’s statements showed “how fragile the emerging détente between the two countries really is.”

“Beijing has become increasingly assertive, believing it has the upper hand in the bilateral relationship,” she said. But Mr. Trump’s counter threats showed that “two can play this game.”

With the planned summit between the leaders in just over two weeks, it was unclear whether the two sides would be willing to de-escalate in order to still hold the meeting, Ms. Cutler added.

In his social media post, Mr. Trump said that the changes “came out of nowhere.” The United States’ relationship with China over the past six months had been a very good one, he said.

The president went on to say that although China had a monopoly on rare earth minerals, the United States had other monopolies that were “stronger and more far reaching.” He added, “I have just not chosen to use them, there was never a reason for me to do so — UNTIL NOW!”

The White House has been planning a trip to Asia later this month for the president, which would include a meeting with Mr. Xi on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in South Korea.

The plans had generated speculation about whether the meeting could lead to an economic deal between the countries, potentially including Chinese purchases of American products or Chinese investment in the United States. Beijing has also been interested in having the United States roll back the global controls it has put on China’s access to advanced A.I. chips.

American farmers have also asked the administration to push China to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybean exports that have crippled business this year. One of them, Caleb Ragland, a Kentucky soybean farmer who is the president of the American Soybean Association, said in a statement that his group was “extremely disappointed” that the planned meeting between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would be canceled.

“Trade wars are harmful to everyone, and these latest developments are deeply disappointing at a moment when soybean farmers are facing an ever-growing financial crisis,” Mr. Ragland said.

In a letter on Friday to the Trump administration, M.I.T.’s president, Sally Kornbluth, wrote that the university has already freely met or exceeded many of the standards outlined in the proposal, but that she disagrees with other requirements it demands, including those that would restrict free expression.

“Fundamentally, the premise of the document is inconsistent with our core belief that scientific funding should be based on scientific merit alone,” Dr. Kornbluth wrote.

A White House spokeswoman, Liz Huston, said in a statement that “any university that refuses this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform higher education isn’t serving its students or their parents — they’re bowing to radical, left-wing bureaucrats.”

“The best science can’t thrive in institutions that have abandoned merit, free inquiry, and the pursuit of truth,” she added. “President Trump encourages universities to join us in restoring academic excellence and common sense policies.”

The White House has said it wants responses from the universities by Oct. 20. The other eight colleges are the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Southern California, the University of Texas, Vanderbilt University and the University of Virginia.

The idea of the compacts has been deeply unpopular among faculty members and free speech advocates, who view them as yet another political intrusion into the affairs of academia. They argue that the Trump administration is threatening the independence of American higher education by cutting hundreds of millions of dollars in research funding to force top universities to adopt its agenda.

But at a politically sensitive moment, as schools are trying to avoid being singled out by the administration, most of the universities’ responses have been noncommittal.

“Brown’s course of action should and will be informed by the perspectives of our community,” Christina Paxson, its president, said in a message to the community on Friday.

Some schools, like the University of Virginia, have turned to the time-tested higher education strategy of delaying controversial decisions by creating a committee.

A letter from university board leaders to faculty said on Wednesday that the school’s response would be guided by principles of academic freedom and free inquiry and that the board “has no intention of abandoning the university’s principles,” according to a copy of the letter.

Others expressed what appeared to be concern about the compact but did not shut the door on signing it.

“I am deeply committed to Dartmouth’s academic mission and values and will always defend our fierce independence,” Dartmouth’s president, Sian Leah Beilock, wrote last week.

“You have often heard me say that higher education is not perfect and that we can do better,” she wrote, “At the same time, we will never compromise our academic freedom and our ability to govern ourselves.”

The University of Pennsylvania’s president hit a similar note.

“The long-standing partnership with the federal government in both education and research has yielded tremendous benefits for our nation,” J. Larry Jameson, Penn’s president, said in a message on Sunday.

“Penn seeks no special consideration,” he continued. “We strive to be supported based on the excellence of our work, our scholars and students, and the programs and services we provide to our neighbors and to the world.”

While university leaders have walked a tightrope, faculty members on those campuses have been more forceful. The American Association of University Professors, a faculty rights group and union, lauded M.I.T.’s decision to reject the compact.

“The ability to teach and study freely is the bedrock of American higher education,” Todd Wolfson, the group’s president, said in a statement. “We applaud M.I.T. for standing up for academic freedom and institutional autonomy rejecting Trump’s ‘loyalty oath’ compact. We urge all institutions targeted by the administration’s bribery attempt to do the same.”

The University of Virginia faculty senate called on its president to reject the compact, saying it threatens the school’s independence and “likely violates state and federal law” by infringing on constitutional rights. Sixty faculty members supported the resolution and only two opposed it.

The compact has complicated negotiations between the Trump administration and individual schools, including Harvard, who worry it is a sign that even if they reach a deal with the administration, the government will come back and ask for more concessions. Among the schools asked to join the compact are Brown and Penn, which had already come to agreements with the Trump administration.

The University of Virginia has been engaged with the Department of Justice’s civil rights division about a potential deal for months. As part of those negotiations, the department pressured the school, saying that its president had to resign before it could resolve the investigations. The president has resigned and the school has been negotiating a potential agreement. Because the University of Virginia is a public school, the negotiations have become a flashpoint in the state’s governor’s race.

The offer of a compact has added a layer of complication to the ongoing talks, according to three sources involved in the discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

Perhaps the most enthusiastic response came from the University of Texas at Austin, which is in a state that has aggressively tried to control what professors can teach in the classroom on sensitive topics like gender.

The chair of the system’s board, Kevin Eltife, a former Republican state lawmaker, said he was honored that the Austin campus was selected. “We enthusiastically look forward to engaging with university officials and reviewing the compact immediately,” Mr. Eltife said in a statement last week.

What we know:

Agents surrounded the vehicle in a school pickup line. Though the women were not there to collect any children, the incident happened as parents and students watched nearby.

In the video, one of the women says they were followed by ICE agents from Cicero to the West Loop — a distance of just over seven miles. The incident occurred around 2:51 p.m.

The video was recorded by a teacher named Eryn, who began filming after hearing screams.

She said she saw a woman named Jocelyn shouting that the agents did not have a warrant. Eryn said she was alarmed for the woman’s safety and well-being.

Later that day, Eryn said she heard from Jocelyn’s friends and family that both women were released, raising questions on whether any wrongdoing actually occurred.

""I was scared for Jocelyn's life… I didn't know what was about to happen. Even just talking about it right now. It just makes you feel very uncomfortable. That's not something that we want to see, it's not something that's fair, it's not something that's okay. I needed to cry because that was very scary. The last thing I saw was just them pushing them into their car. I didn't know where she was headed,"" Eryn said.

This latter policy change could wreak “catastrophic setbacks” to U.S. research, according to higher education groups who recently filed a lawsuit challenging the fee.
Even in the early days of the current Trump term, Canada and Europe were courting U.S. scientists.
Seventy-five percent of U.S. scientists polled by the journal Nature said they were contemplating leaving the country, according to a survey published in March.","Growing up, Omar Yaghi shared a room with his siblings—and some cattle—in Amman, Jordan, with no access to running water or electricity. The son of Palestinian refugees who “could barely read or write,” the University of California, Berkeley, researcher was captivated by chemistry at a young age after gazing at “stick and ball” models of molecules in a library. This week, Yaghi received a share of the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on revolutionary materials called metal-organic frameworks.

Yaghi moved to the United States at 15 years old, initially attending community college and eventually receiving his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. His path isn’t unique: Half of this year’s United States Nobel Prize winners in science are immigrants. Researchers with stories similar to Yaghi’s have propelled the country’s global scientific ascendance for generations. But with the increasingly restrictive immigration policies and science funding austerity enacted by the administration of President Donald Trump, the country’s top research rank—and future Nobel wins—hangs in the balance.

“The Trump administration is systematically discouraging international students and undercutting the research infrastructure that attracts them,” says James Witte, professor emeritus at George Mason University and former director of its Institute for Immigration Research. “Those students will find their academic homes elsewhere.”

“I think we will definitely see a long-run decline in U.S. science overall—measured by Nobel laureates.”

The U.S. wasn’t always the academic powerhouse it is today. Prior to World War II, Nobel laureates mostly hailed from European institutions—before the 1930s, scholars affiliated with U.S. institutions received less than 12 percent of all science Nobel Prizes. But as the country invested more in research and conflict rocked Europe, foreign scientists increasingly migrated to the states. Most famously, this exodus included Albert Einstein, who escaped Nazi Germany, eventually landing in the U.S., and Enrico Fermi, who fled fascist Italy by attending the Nobel Prize ceremony in Stockholm and from there decamping to New York City. At the time, most researchers emigrating to the U.S. hailed from Europe, some of whom, like Fermi, contributed to the Manhattan Project.

This trend helped fuel the United States as it rocketed to scientific preeminence. From 1941 to 1950, researchers working at U.S. institutions represented 47 percent of all Nobel laureates in science categories, 19 percent of whom were immigrants.

“That was a period when the U.S. jumpstarted the golden age of science and innovation,” says Ina Ganguli, a professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Growing numbers of scientists from Asia, including India and China, began arriving in the U.S. in the 1960s. This coincided with the end of immigration quotas affecting Asian countries and, a decade later, the opening of China’s economy. The U.S. share of Nobels peaked between 1991 and 2000. During this period, U.S. scientists composed 72 percent of all academic Nobel laureates—a quarter of those prizewinners were immigrants.

Seeking bountiful academic opportunities, researchers and students across the world have continued to flock to the U.S. After receiving their Ph.D.s, the majority of international STEM students settle down here and start their scientific careers, some carving their path toward a Nobel or other accolades over the course of decades. One study, looking at the career trajectories of young medalists from the International Math Olympiad, found that those who immigrated to the U.S. went on to have more productive careers than those moving to other countries. This higher productivity in the U.S. has likely owed to more abundant resources and opportunity, says Ganguli, one of the paper’s authors.

Beyond awards, immigrants have outsized impacts on innovation—in 2011, 76 percent of patents awarded to the country’s top patent-producing universities “had at least one foreign-born inventor” on the team, according to a report from the Partnership for a New American Economy.

But over the past two decades, the share of international students at U.S. universities and colleges have declined. This is likely related to the rising costs of attending school here, Witte says, which are particularly prohibitive for people arriving from low- or middle-income nations. The COVID-19 pandemic, along with strict immigration policies from the first Trump administration, have likely also played a role, Ganguli adds.

Now, the Trump administration’s increasingly restrictive policies may exacerbate the slowing trickle of global academic talent to the U.S. by attacking academia on multiple fronts. For one, significant federal funding cuts and freezes threaten research programs that have long attracted people from around the world. Just getting here is becoming increasingly difficult. The administration introduced travel bans and restrictions affecting nearly 19 countries this summer, is ramping up vetting of student visas, and recently attached a hefty $100,000 fee to H-1B visa applications. This latter policy change could wreak “catastrophic setbacks” to U.S. research, according to higher education groups who recently filed a lawsuit challenging the fee.

Potential impacts on the U.S.’s Nobel chances likely won’t be obvious at first, says Patrick Gaule, an economist at the University of Bristol in the United Kingdom who co-founded the Global Talent Fund, a non-profit that supports STEM students across the world. Over time, more young students could opt to attend universities in nations other than the U.S.—taking their award-winning smarts with them.

“It’s a very long gestation lag with the Nobels,” Gaule says, because it can take decades for one’s research to mature to the point that it’s recognized by these awards.

But an exodus of scientists already further into their careers could yield more immediate effects, Ganguli says. Even in the early days of the current Trump term, Canada and Europe were courting U.S. scientists. Seventy-five percent of U.S. scientists polled by the journal Nature said they were contemplating leaving the country, according to a survey published in March.

“If we go at this rate with more [immigration] restrictions, then I think we will definitely see a long-run decline in U.S. science overall—measured by Nobel laureates,” Ganguli says. “The big question is, how soon is that gonna come?”

U.S. District Court Judge for Western Washington Tiffany Cartwright issued a temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring that Martinez be released.
There’ve been similar rulings across the country in recent months, but that doesn’t mean every detainee is being released, Stock said.
“The class action covers hundreds of people, but people have to assert their status as a class member somehow,” Stock said.","An Anchorage restaurant worker who was detained by federal immigration officials in August has been released after a judge’s ruling in a class action lawsuit.

ICE arrested Santiago Martinez, a 30-year-old Mexican national seeking asylum in the U.S., on Aug. 11 outside the sushi restaurant where he worked and sent him to the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma, Washington.

Martinez is one of at least 56 people detained by ICE in Alaska this year, according to the state Department of Corrections, which jails detainees under a contract with the federal government.

Immigration judges in Seattle were refusing to let detainees like Martinez out on bond, said Margaret Stock, Martinez’s lawyer. A legal advocacy group called the Northern Immigrant Rights Project filed a class action suit against the Seattle ICE field office, she said.

“They won their case, and they got an order from a federal judge saying that people cannot be detained, that their detention is unlawful,” Stock said.

U.S. District Court Judge for Western Washington Tiffany Cartwright issued a temporary restraining order, or TRO, requiring that Martinez be released. He officially left ICE custody on Tuesday.

There’ve been similar rulings across the country in recent months, but that doesn’t mean every detainee is being released, Stock said.

“The class action covers hundreds of people, but people have to assert their status as a class member somehow,” Stock said. “And because Santiago had an attorney, me, I was able to assert his membership in the class and work with the lawyers to get the TRO issued. People who don't have an attorney, it's very difficult for them to deal with this situation.”

A regional ICE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Stock said she’s concerned over the high number of immigration detentions during Trump’s second presidency. The Department of Homeland Security is acting unlawfully and misrepresenting who’s being detained, she said.

“Although DHS claims they're only arresting criminals, that's not the case,” Stock said. “They're going after mostly people that are not criminals. They're going after people who are legally in the country, doing things that are perfectly legal, working legally.”

Stock said she plans to continue helping Martinez apply for asylum, now that he’s been released from detention.

“The screening of Borderland: The Line Within is meant to be generative,” Sebastiaan Faber, professor of Hispanic Studies, said.
The former is an organizer working to empower undocumented women through education on their rights as immigrants.
Yates and de Onís’ visits to various classes sparked conversations regarding the process of shooting and editing a documentary like Borderland.
And, yeah, maybe you can still argue about it, but what [Yates and de Onís] have shown is … there’s a point.","Pamela Yates and Paco de Onís visited Oberlin this week for the screening of their film, Borderland: The Line Within, at the Apollo Theatre. Over the course of their time in Oberlin, they visited classes, spoke with students, and hosted a Q&A following the film’s showing.

“The screening of Borderland: The Line Within is meant to be generative,” Sebastiaan Faber, professor of Hispanic Studies, said. “What they’re asking is, ‘What kind of things can be done now to prepare for future reckoning?’”

Yates and de Onís head Skylight, a nonprofit responsible for creating documentary films that center protagonists’ stories in the name of human rights and strengthening networks between activists. Faber, a longtime friend of Yates and de Onís, has helped organize past Skylight screenings at Oberlin, including that of their film, Granito: How to Nail a Dictator, which included outtakes from Yates’ prior work that were used as key evidence in the trial against Guatemala’s former dictator. Their latest film was created with past truth commission processes in mind. Faber noted that Latin America and the rest of the world may have much to teach the U.S. about exposing governmental abuses of power.

Paco de Onís, producer of Borderland, explained in an interview the importance of applying the same tools used by the government to track undocumented immigrants to monitor detention centers and removals of people from their homes and families by ICE. In the documentary, digital humanists analyze data on everything from these centers to companies and politicians with funds linked to ICE to demonstrate the vastness of the border industrial complex.

“They turn the tables,” de Onís said. “The whole point of journalism is a kind of surveillance of the government and society, in the sense that you’re bringing into account if there’s corruption, mishandling of government. Journalists can bring that to light.”

Together, Yates and de Onís are forging a path in documentary film that traces narratives back to those experiencing them and puts the authority in their hands. From there, narrators like Gabriela Castañeda and Kaxh Mura’l delve into their own experiences. The former is an organizer working to empower undocumented women through education on their rights as immigrants. The latter is a Guatemalan land activist who was forced to flee his home and seek asylum in the U.S. following death threats from a mining company.

“It’s important to realize what is being done and who’s doing it,” Faber said. “It’s the communities most affected that are also the most active resistors and the smartest resistors and the most inventive resistors. … The movie lays out what the interests are that are driving much of this so that the audience can come out more informed, more hopeful, and with a clearer sense of what they can do.”

The question of what could be done weighed on many students’ minds following the screening. As Yates described it, people become emotionally invested in the lives of those they’ve met in the film. During a Q&A following the Wednesday night showing, one student inquired about how Obies can use their privilege to help those who need it. Yates and de Onís pointed students to identify their local representatives and find out what is being paid for in their district by the border industrial complex, then voice their concerns. Yates in particular emphasized that all students should ensure that immigrants they know have their name, address, and phone number, in case they ever need to use it. More broadly, she spoke to the idea that everyone affects change differently, and the power is in one’s commitment to the cause.

“That is a great question,” Yates said. “And, I can’t really answer that for you. But what I can say is, you have to throw yourself into some activity … and become proximate to the immigrant community.”

In creating films that take years to come to fruition, Yates and de Onís place value back on long-term reporting. They tell compelling stories about complex issues in a moment when news is often reduced to a stream of information that can feel distant from peoples’ day-to-day lives. Borderland closes the gap by championing individuals and their place among the national headlines. Yates and de Onís know better than anyone what it is to devote themselves to the facts that build the basis for future justice.

In response to the screening and surrounding events, students have shown curiosity and gratitude. Yates and de Onís’ visits to various classes sparked conversations regarding the process of shooting and editing a documentary like Borderland. College first-year Griffin Larson-Erf spoke of his own interest in the field of journalism and said that the film reminded him why reporting is still valuable.

“Everybody says ‘tell the story, document’ … because we think it’s going to help.” Larson-Erf said. “We don’t actually know. And, yeah, maybe you can still argue about it, but what [Yates and de Onís] have shown is … there’s a point. … I’m glad the documentary exists, that all of their work exists, and I’m hopeful.”

Samantha Soto, College second-year, described at once the distinctiveness of each individual story in Borderland and the familiarity of the film’s sentiment as a child of immigrants.

“Having family members, friends that have been deported, the process of leaving your home country to go to the United States … [they’re] experiences that aren’t too out of this world,” Soto said. “I’m glad more awareness about this is spreading to Oberlin.”",https://oberlinreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/masthead_alt.png,N,,2025-10-10 17:57:56.873635

The Department of Homeland Security has argued for months that “doxing” threatens its personnel’s safety, and is therefore an act of violence.
There’s no federal law specifically prohibiting “doxing.” But the act can break anti-harassment or cybercrime laws.
Miller argued that “doxing” existed on “a continuum of violence.” “It involves both organized doxing.
DHS, in a news release and in several posts on X, accused Rep. Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat, of doxing.","The Trump administration says it’s cracking down on “organized doxing campaigns,” but free speech advocates worry its use of the vague term is conflating forms of protected speech with crimes, or most recently, domestic terrorism.

The administration has accused a Democratic lawmaker and activists who document enforcement operations of “doxing,” a nonlegal term that usually means exposing someone’s private or identifying information online. But as the administration stretches the meaning of the word, civil liberties groups are growing increasingly worried that it will intimidate people out of recording or reporting on Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s activities with the threat of criminal charges.

The Department of Homeland Security has argued for months that “doxing” threatens its personnel’s safety, and is therefore an act of violence. In DHS’s own words, “videotaping ICE law enforcement and posting photos and videos of them online is doxing our agents.”

But there’s plenty of pushback to that interpretation.

“The law protects federal agents against disclosures of personal information made with the intent to threaten, intimidate, or incite crimes against them, but it doesn’t protect ICE agents from public criticism or justify this Administration’s efforts to silence dissent, investigate activists, and recast lawful organizing as ‘domestic terrorism,’” said Becca Branum, the deputy director of the Center for Democracy and Technology’s Free Expression Project, in a statement to NOTUS.

There’s no federal law specifically prohibiting “doxing.” But the act can break anti-harassment or cybercrime laws.

Constitutional experts and former national security officials have already expressed discomfort with President Donald Trump’s newest public national security directive, which links some commonly held Democratic and progressive viewpoints to domestic terrorism — potentially subjecting more citizens to warrantless surveillance.

In that order, the president argues that online “doxing” is essential to so-called left-wing terrorist groups’ operations.

“These campaigns often begin by isolating and dehumanizing specific targets to justify murder or other violent action against them. They do so through a variety of fora, including anonymous chat forums, in-person meetings, social media, and even educational institutions,” the order reads, without providing examples or evidence.

“These campaigns then escalate to organized doxing, where the private or identifying information of their targets (such as home addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information) is exposed to the public with the explicit intent of encouraging others to harass, intimidate, or violently assault them,” the order goes on.

Last month, DHS issued a subpoena to Meta, demanding the social media company hand over information about accounts that posted about an agent for an “official, criminal investigation regarding officer safety,” calling it “Doxing.”

Federal judges so far have temporarily blocked the request for at least three immigration activists’ Instagram account information. Lawyers representing those users maintain that their clients didn’t break any laws.

“DHS’s Subpoena demanding that Meta disclose identifying information appears motivated by the government’s disdain for Doe’s viewpoint and a desire to chill Doe’s expressive conduct,” the ACLU of Northern California argued in its motion to quash the request.

In a separate motion filed on behalf of another user whose data was subpoenaed, the Civil Liberties Defense Center, an advocacy and legal defense nonprofit, argued that the request violated their client’s First Amendment right to anonymously engage in political speech.

“If they actually had evidence that someone violated one of the federal cyber laws, for which there are many, they would utilize those, but they don’t,” said Lauren Regan, an attorney with the CLDC. “That speaks to the true intention of subpoenas like this, which is to try and chill Americans from engaging in this First Amendment-protected activity in criticizing, or drawing attention to, ICE and the government.”

A judge last week temporarily blocked Meta from complying with the government’s request for that user’s information.

When it comes to the administration’s focus on what it sees as left-wing terrorism, doxing is clearly top of mind. A reporter pressed White House senior adviser Stephen Miller on Monday about the “vast” networks he’s claimed are responsible for recent high-profile shootings. Miller argued that “doxing” existed on “a continuum of violence.”

“It involves both organized doxing. It involves violent threats and intimidation. It involves explicit calls to commit violence against a targeted person, and then that tends to escalate into physically violent and obstructive acts,” Miller said. “It’s this continuum that we see over and over again, where they’re trying to use illegal violence and intimidation to disturb the operations of the federal government and federal personnel.”

“Who’s ‘they?’ Antifa isn’t actually an organization, right?” the reporter asked, as Miller moved onto the next question. In response to questions from NOTUS, the White House did not clarify which specific organizations Miller was talking about, or address civil liberties’ groups concerns.

“Left-wing, anti-Trump organizations are constantly looking for new ways to criticize the President’s popular efforts to Make America Safe Again,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in a statement, referring NOTUS to “the President’s antifa roundtable highlighting the countless examples of radical left-wing violence that his executive action will address.”

Doxing did not come up at that meeting, and the White House didn’t clarify how it distinguishes protected speech from doxing.

But plenty of case law protects people who post truthful information that serves the public interest, including people who film and identify DHS personnel, said David Greene, the civil liberties director with the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

“There might be governmental interest in shielding people from harassment, but then the government has to tailor their response to actually the harassment, not the mere identification,” Greene said. “The fact that someone is involved in something, that’s a matter of public interest — not typically something that would be considered ‘doxing.’”

Greene added that prosecutors attempting to go after people the Trump administration considers doxers would mean that the government still has to prove that the publisher intended for an illegal result to happen, according to existing statutes.

“Merely calling something ‘doxing’ doesn’t really have any type of legal effect. It’s just a rhetorical characterization,” Greene said.

If throwing around “doxing” is intended as a rhetorical tool, Trump’s Department of Homeland Security has a history of using it loosely, and often.

DHS, in a news release and in several posts on X, accused Rep. Salud Carbajal, a California Democrat, of doxing. The administration alleged that he shared an ICE official’s business card “with members of the violent mob” at a farm raid in Carpinteria, California, which DHS said resulted in someone throwing a rock at an ICE employee.

“ICE’s ‘doxing’ claims are completely unfounded. Their on-site public relations officer voluntarily handed me a business card in full view of TV cameras, reporters, and dozens of livestreamers,” Carbajal wrote in a statement to NOTUS. “To characterize it as ‘doxing’ is a deliberate distortion, and an attempt to mislead the public and deflect accountability for their aggressive actions that day, which endangered numerous civilians.”

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

DHS routinely argues that its personnel wear masks to protect them from “doxing.” DHS and Republicans have generally characterized Democratic efforts to prohibit that policing tactic as an effort to subject federal law-enforcement personnel to acts of targeted violence.

The administration’s rhetoric about so-called doxing is especially worrying organizations representing photojournalists — people who might find themselves documenting and publishing identifying photos of federal law-enforcement personnel as part of their job.",https://static.notus.org/dims4/default/8471c3f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5587x3143+0+0/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk2-prod-aji.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F91%2F4d%2F55e870b749f19567b856a2b2079d%2Fap25129668082609.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 23:57:01.257603

Trump | Constitutional Accountability Center,Not Available,,,,,https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/grundmann-v-trump/,"Our brief next explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt.
Congress has been assigning regulatory authority to multimember independent agencies for most of the nation’s history, beginning nearly 150 years ago.
Finally, the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies.
Presidential removal authority became accepted over time as a “practical construction” of the President’s executive power under the Constitution.
In other words, removal authority was established through historical practice, just like the limits on removal authority that later developed for multimember regulators.","The Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) is led by three presidentially appointed members who may be removed from office only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. In 2025, President Trump attempted to fire FLRA Chair Susan Tsui Grundmann without cause, in violation of the FLRA’s governing statute. President Trump asserts that the FLRA’s leadership structure is unconstitutional because it allows the President to remove the agency’s members only for good cause, not at will. After Grundmann sued, a federal district court held that her attempted firing was unlawful, and the Trump administration appealed this ruling. In October 2025, CAC filed an amicus brief in the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in support of Grundmann.

President Trump argues that under the Supreme Court’s 2020 decision in Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, the FLRA’s members must be removable at will by the President. Our brief shows why this is wrong.

We first demonstrate that Seila Law did not call into question the legitimacy of agencies structured like the FLRA, sometimes referred to as multimember independent agencies. As we explain, Seila Law addressed only the relatively new phenomenon of an agency led by a single director who is not removable at will. Based on three unique features of these single-director independent agencies, the Court concluded that they represent a novel intrusion on presidential authority that clashes with constitutional structure. The Court was clear, however, that it was not overruling its precedent upholding similar removal limits for the leaders of “a traditional independent agency, run by a multimember board.” None of the reasons the Supreme Court gave for striking down the leadership structure of the CFPB in Seila Law apply to the FLRA—a traditional multimember agency that resembles agencies dating back 150 years in every constitutionally significant way.

Our brief next explains why long-established practice has placed the validity of multimember independent agencies like the FLRA beyond doubt. In separation-of-powers cases, courts place significant weight upon historical practice, because it embodies the compromises and working arrangements that the elected branches of government themselves have reached. Congress has been assigning regulatory authority to multimember independent agencies for most of the nation’s history, beginning nearly 150 years ago. Supreme Court decisions, including Seila Law, have consistently confirmed the validity of these traditional agencies.

Finally, the text and history of the Constitution further underscore the legitimacy of multimember independent agencies. The Constitution does not address removal, and there was no agreement at the Founding that presidents had inherent or exclusive removal authority. Instead, the topic was vigorously debated. Presidential removal authority became accepted over time as a “practical construction” of the President’s executive power under the Constitution. In other words, removal authority was established through historical practice, just like the limits on removal authority that later developed for multimember regulators. These two doctrines do not conflict: both reflect established practice that settled what was initially a constitutional ambiguity.

But can travel and tourism thrive at a time when the U.S. is working to overhaul border and trade policy?

Las Vegas, Nevada, had been a red-hot spot for travel and tourism in America, but, right now, the economy there is being dealt some tough hands.

Take dinner time on a weeknight, for example. There are, to be sure, cars at the stoplights near the corner of corners: Las Vegas Boulevard and Flamingo Road. But traffic’s a breeze. Next month, a big Formula One event should bring a surge of racing fans.

And since it’s Vegas, you’ll always find some hubbub.

“I'm a big TikTok person,” said Ashley, from Toledo, Ohio. “So everything says it's going to be dead here. It's a dying city. And we're like … it's not that dead.”

So not totally empty, but using the August figures, the number of visitors is down 6.7% from a year earlier. And under the video canopy covering Fremont Street downtown, foot traffic is also sparse. Leah and Claes are part of a Dutch and Belgian tour group out sipping refreshment. They came, but, “some people of our group, they skipped the trip because the situation here in the U.S.,” Leah said.

That situation being hardened borders and a global trade war, along with higher fees to come into the U.S. and other restrictions for people without U.S. passports. For instance, the early fall has typically been prime time for people from Mexico and points South to come. But this time, many Latin-themed events got canceled. As for that other part of North America President Donald Trump talks of adding to the United States?

“Canada's down, probably the most significant of anyone, by some measures, down 30% over where they were a year or two ago,” said Jeremy Aguero at Applied Analysis. “But Canadians make up about 3% to 3.5% of all the visitors that come to Las Vegas. So, you know, at the end of the day, it's an impact.”

Among the down spots are what people here call “the three Cs”: visitors from Canada; China, with its property market mess hitting disposable incomes there; and, one more “C.” Not a country but the adjacent state.

“People from California,” said Diana Valles, president of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 in Las Vegas, Nevada. “And with all these raids and deportation and all these anti-immigrant messages that are going on right now, people — they don't feel good coming in here. They're fearful.”

“We're seeing layoffs,” she added. “We're seeing restaurant closures. People are nervous just to, like, go to the grocery store. Yeah, the people are nervous just to go to church. Even if you are documented … you never know what's going to happen. Is it your profile? When we heard people saying that they're going to deport criminals, we're OK about that. Our members are not OK to deporting people, working people, just because the way they look.”

Another shift engineered in Washington that’s percolating into every regional economy — this one included — are new import taxes, the tariffs.

Juanny Romero opened seven high-design cafes in Las Vegas called Mothership Coffee Roasters.

“Oh, my goodness. The majority of coffee is from Brazil,” she said. “And it's like, just because the president doesn't like the way the Brazilian president is talking to him, we're going to impose a 50% tariff and literally change everything overnight.”

Mothership has deals with women-owned suppliers of raw beans in Brazil — relationships not easily switched to lower-tariff countries.

“The most important thing is, like, we care from beginning to end, and that's what makes coffee really cool and relevant,” she said. “But with these things going on, a lot of roasters aren't able to care as much because prices are going up. They can't afford to care and charge their customer like — you can't charge your customer $40 for a bag of coffee. That's insane.”

Here’s how Aguero see this: “Any of these things, if it was just one of them, you and I wouldn't be even talking,” he said.

“But the combination of conflict in Washington, D.C.; conflict around the world; the fact that consumers are feeling uncertain — all of that is converging today into this very difficult circumstance that we see ourselves in,” he said. “Do I think it's permanent, like structurally unsound? No, I do not.”",https://img.apmcdn.org/b8285eff7e180461938c24535013bf06d6f7c971/widescreen/d98582-20251008-las-vegas-slowdown-tourism-trump-economic-immigration-policy-2000.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:57:52.149635

“Comparing ICE day-in and day-out to the Nazi Gestapo, the Secret Police, and slave patrols has consequences.”","The Department of Homeland Security has condemned the “dangerous” doxxing of immigration agents and their families as the agency pleads to dial down the pervasive and escalating rhetoric emanating from lefty politicians and media outlets.

“The men and women of ICE and CBP are fathers and mothers, sons and daughters. They get up every morning to try and make our communities safer,” said DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin.

“Like everyone else, they just want to go home to their families at night. The violence and dehumanization of these men and women who are simply enforcing the law must stop.”

DHS says not only have threats increased against its agents, but assaults have skyrocketed by 1,000% in recent months as the Trump administration continues its immigration crackdown.

The menacing incidents have come in the form of vicious, profanity-laced voicemails and social media postings revealing the home addresses of the federal officers, leading to several arrests.

Three women were indicted last month for allegedly stalking an ICE agent from the Los Angeles Civic Center to his home, livestreaming the unhinged pursuit on their Instagram accounts while providing detailed directions to their followers.

When they arrived at the agent’s home, they continued streaming while shouting to bystanders that their “neighbor is ICE,” “la migra lives here” and “ICE lives on your street and you should know.”

They publicly disclosed the agent’s home address and encouraged viewers to “come on down,” according to the US Attorney’s Office of the Central District of California.

On Sept. 22, a 68-year-old man was busted in San Diego after he posted the home address of an ICE attorney online and urged people to harass her, or even “swat” her, a dangerous harassment tactic where fake emergency calls are made to provoke an armed response by law enforcement.

The hateful messages continued with a vile voicemail left for a Texas ICE officer’s spouse, comparing them to Nazis and outright threatening their family.

“I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F–k you, f–k your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F–k you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family,” an unidentified female said on the line, her voice dripping with contempt.

Another agent’s spouse received a message on Facebook from an account apparently with the sender’s full name, Robert Buckley, warning, “your husband, the ice man, is a f–k and retribution will come your way eventually.”

“These types of threats against our brave ICE law enforcement officers and their families are disgusting. These officers risk their lives every day to arrest murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our communities,” McLaughlin said, slamming the harassment campaigns.

Members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, early Thursday morning.","The US Department of Defense has yet to say directly whether any National Guard troops remain inside the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, a day after a federal judge temporarily halted a National Guard deployment to the state.

CNN on Friday asked the Department of Defense whether any National Guard troops remained inside the Broadview facility Friday, including members of the Texas National Guard seen entering it earlier in the week.

In an emailed response, the department said: “As a matter of longstanding policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.”

“The federalized National Guard personnel will remain in a federalized status; we don’t have any other details to provide at this time,” the Defense Department email reads.

The statement is identical to one the Defense Department released Thursday.

A CNN crew in Broadview did not see any National Guard troops outside the facility on Friday morning.

Before Thursday’s ruling, the Trump administration federalized National Guard troops from Texas and deployed them to Illinois, arguing the troops were needed “to protect federal property and personnel who are executing federal law.”

US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Iraq War veteran who served in the Illinois Army National Guard before retiring as a lieutenant colonel, slammed the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard in American cities in a Friday news conference outside the ICE detention facility in Broadview, Illinois.

Duckworth made her comments as she and a fellow Illinois Democrat, US Sen. Dick Durbin, visited an ongoing protest outside the Broadview facility.

The site is a flashpoint in the legal battle over the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the Texas National Guard to Illinois and send some to the Broadview facility. A federal judge Thursday temporarily halted the deployment, and no troops were seen outside the Chicago-area facility this morning, though some were seen entering it earlier in the week.

Duckworth said both she and Durbin tried to enter the facility Friday to “see what the conditions are, and they would not let us in.”

“You don’t run and hide if you are proud of what you’re doing. That’s what ICE is doing right now,” Duckworth said. “This is not America. This is not what this democracy is about.”

Duckworth also said she believes the Trump administration is trying to “normalize” the presence of troops on American streets.

“They are trying to normalize an extension of presidential power that is not appropriate under the Constitution,” she said.

“Our National Guard men and women are doing a fantastic job, but you know what? They signed up to be tank drivers. … They should be practicing to defend America against our enemies around the world, and that’s what they would rather be doing.”

CNN has asked the Department of Defense whether any National Guard troops remained inside the Broadview facility Friday, including those seen entering it this week. In an emailed response, the department did not answer the question directly, but said, “As a matter of longstanding policy, the Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.”

“The federalized National Guard personnel will remain in a federalized status; we don’t have any other details to provide at this time,” the Defense Department email read.

Speaking Friday outside the Broadview Immigrations, Customs and Border Patrol facility – which has become a flashpoint in the debate over the National Guard deployment –US Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said he agreed with the federal judge who temporarily halted the Trump administration’s plans to deploy troops in the state.

“She said that the information given to the court was unreliable. It’s a point we made over and over again. This is totally unnecessary,” Durbin said of the Trump administration’s decision to deploy the Texas National Guard.

“If you want to fight crime this is … a diversion of law enforcement from what they can be doing in our neighborhoods to make them safer,” he added. “This political theater may have a lot of opportunities for television and such, but it doesn’t get the job done in fighting crime.”

Durbin made the comments while visiting the protest site outside the Broadview facility with US Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois.

Marimar Martinez, a 30-year-old American citizen who was shot by a Customs and Border Protection agent last weekend in Chicago after she allegedly rammed a CPB vehicle, was indicted Thursday on one count of forcibly impeding, intimidating or interfering with federal agents using a “deadly and dangerous weapon.”

Martinez was scheduled to appear in court today, but the hearing was canceled following the indictment. Her attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN he expects an arraignment to be scheduled next week.

A 21-year-old man, Anthony Ian Santos Ruiz, was indicted on the same charge as Martinez.

The Department of Justice says both Ruiz and Martinez boxed in and struck a federal government vehicle. The Department of Homeland Security previously said that CBP agent fired “defensive shots” at Martinez.

But her lawyer disputes that account. Parente said body camera footage, which he said he viewed but has not made public, shows an agent saying “Do something, b*tch” to another agent before engaging with Martinez.

“To me, that’s someone looking for a problem,” Parente said.

The video, the attorney said, shows a CBP vehicle swerving into Martinez’ vehicle — not the other way around, as the charging complaint claims. Then, “within seconds” an officer jumped out of his vehicle and fired at Martinez.

The charging complaint says a CBP agent shot at Martinez five times. Parente said she suffered five gunshot wounds.

National Guard troops were seen patrolling in Memphis for the first time on Friday, as part of President Donald Trump’s federal task force, which faces multiple legal challenges.

At least nine National Guard troops began their patrol at the Bass Pro Shops located at the Pyramid, an iconic landmark in Memphis.

It was unclear how many Guard members were on the ground or expected to arrive later.

During an NAACP Memphis forum on Wednesday, Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn “CJ” Davis said she hoped Guard personnel would help direct traffic and have a presence in “retail corridors,” but not be used to operate checkpoints or anything similar.

Memphis Mayor Paul Young, a Democrat, said he never requested the Guard come to Memphis. But after Trump announced the Guard’s deployment on September 15 and Republican Gov. Bill Lee agreed, Young and other officials said they wanted the task force to focus on targeting violent offenders rather than use their presence to scare, harass or intimidate the general public.

Members of the National Guard were absent Friday from outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, a day after a federal judge temporarily halted the Trump administration’s deployment of Guard troops in the state.

When CNN arrived at the facility Friday morning – located about 13 miles from downtown Chicago – no Guard members could be seen outside the facility or on the roof, where they’d been staged in previous days.

“We do not see a single member of the National Guard,” CNN’s Whitney Wild told Kate Bolduan from outside the facility.

Instead, local law enforcement observed as a group of protesters occasionally erupted in boos and jeers as vehicles passed.

Members of the Texas National Guard had arrived at the facility Thursday. Although they did not appear to be outside the facility today, it’s unclear where they are or if they’ve returned to an Army training base about 40 miles away, where they had been staging earlier this week.

Correction: An earlier version of this post misstated which type of personnel was absent outside the facility.

Republican Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt criticized the deployment of the Texas National Guard into Illinois during an interview with the New York Times Thursday, saying it goes against his beliefs in states’ rights.

While he said he supports the National Guard’s mission to protect Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, he thinks the president should have federalized the Illinois National Guard first, saying he worries about the precedent set for future presidents.

Stitt is the first Republican governor to speak out against the tactic. Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond, however, joined two filings in the Portland and Chicago cases supporting the Trump administration’s use of the National Guard.

“We believe in the federalist system — that’s states’ rights,” he told the Times. “Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration.”

“As a federalist believer, one governor against another governor, I don’t think that’s the right way to approach this,” he said.

Stitt, who is also a chair for the National Governors’ Association, said he is speaking for himself and says his views don’t represent the organization. CNN has reached out to Stitt’s office for comment.

A federal judge says Immigration and Customs Enforcement must remove the 8-foot-high metal security fence on a street in front of its building in Broadview, Illinois, which has been the site of intense protests.

The village of Broadview, a Chicago suburb, filed suit, saying the fence had been installed in the middle of a public roadway without local government permission or permits.

Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE, had blamed the situation on Broadview.

“Local inaction has enabled agitators to escalate violence and placed federal offices, first responders, and Broadview residents in harm’s way,” Lyons wrote in a letter to village officials. “If our officers were provided the support they need, the crowd control … would not be necessary.”

Hunt ordered both sides to submit a proposal by mid-afternoon Friday to determine a deadline and process to dismantle the fence, which has been in place since September 22.

Editor’s Note: Since this post was first published, the court record has been updated to reflect that today’s scheduled hearing for Marimar Martinez was canceled after she was indicted by a grand jury on Thursday. Her next court appearance has not yet been scheduled.

LEARN MORE: Woman shot by CBP agent indicted, will not appear in court today

Marimar Martinez, an American citizen who was shot by a Border Patrol agent in Chicago last Saturday during an altercation, will appear in court Friday to face a charge of “forcibly assaulting, impeding, and interfering with a federal law enforcement officer.”

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin described the shooting as “defensive” and claimed the suspect was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon.” But Martinez’s attorney, Christopher Parente, told CNN on Monday the federal agents were being provocative.

Parente said body camera footage of the incident showed a Customs and Border Protection vehicle swerving into his client’s car, not the other way around as the charging document says. He also claimed the video shows one agent saying to another, “Do something, b**ch” before engaging with Martinez.

“To me, that’s someone looking for a problem,” he said.

Parente acknowledged Martinez had a handgun in her purse at the time of the incident but says his client – who has a concealed-carry license – did not brandish it and has no criminal record.

CNN has requested the CBP body camera video, but federal authorities have not released it. Parente is not allowed to share a copy of the video because it is covered under a protective order from the court.

In a criminal complaint, Martinez was described as part of a “convoy of civilian vehicles” that was “aggressively” following a Chevy Tahoe with three Border Patrol agents inside through Chicago streets, attempting to “box-in the CBP Vehicle.”

After the vehicle was sideswiped by Martinez, according to an FBI affidavit, a Border Patrol agent exited their SUV and fired on the car driven by Martinez five times.

Martinez drove to a repair shop a mile away, according to the complaint, and called 911. She was taken by ambulance to a local hospital, where a nurse said she was treated for gunshot wounds, the complaint states. Martinez was later released from the hospital and is free on a $10,000 bond.

CNN’s Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.

After video of a Chicago pastor being repeatedly shot by pepper balls during a demonstration outside of an ICE facility went viral, a federal judge granted a temporary restraining order Thursday to limit the types of force and crowd-control measures agents can use against protesters.

The judge’s order, which applies to the entire Northern District of Illinois, blocks federal agents from firing various types of less-lethal projectiles and chemical irritants and from “using force, such as pulling or shoving a person to the ground, tackling, or body slamming an individual.”

In an interview with CNN, Rev. David Black said agents shot him in the head and the face and “multiple times” in his chest, arms and legs during a September 19 demonstration outside of an ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois.

“I was shielded by the bodies of others who were there, who rushed in to support me and took many more hits that were intended for me,” Black told CNN. “We could hear them laughing as they were shooting us from the roof … It was deeply disturbing.”

The future of National Guard troops now standing by for deployment in Portland, Oregon, is in the hands of a three-judge appeals panel in San Francisco, following a hearing in which the conservative majority expressed skepticism that President Trump’s orders could be constrained.

The attorney representing Oregon argued that the protests outside the Portland Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility that have been going on for months are no longer experiencing the violence cited by Trump in his original order and the current clashes can be handled by non-military means.

The appeals court did not give a timetable for when it will make a decision.

Even if the Trump administration gets the stay they are requesting, Guardsmen would still be prohibited from mobilizing in Oregon under a separate order by District Court Judge Karin Immergut, who is also a Trump appointee to the bench. But administration attorney Eric McArthur said if their appeal is successful, they will ask Immergut to immediately cancel her order, which is scheduled to expire on October 19.

CNN’s Shimon Prokupecz contributed to this report from Portland.

The mayor of Chicago declared victory Thursday over the Trump administration’s efforts to mobilize the military in that city – at least for the next two weeks.

“This ruling is a win for the people of Chicago and the rule of law,” Mayor Brandon Johnson said in a statement after US District Court Judge April Perry blocked any National Guard troops from being deployed in Illinois until at least the end of the day on October 23.

The decision came at the end of a contentious hearing that stretched on for hours in a Chicago courtroom, with Perry – a Biden appointee – expressing strong skepticism that continuing protests outside a suburban Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility prevented federal agents from doing their jobs.

The Trump administration immediately announced it will appeal the ruling. That appeal had not been filed with the court as of Friday morning.

Unlike the judge in a similar case in Portland, Oregon, Perry did not suspend President Trump’s order federalizing hundreds of Illinois guardsmen against the wishes of the government, and the administration says there will be no change to their status.

Members of the Texas National Guard arrived at the ICE facility in Broadview, Illinois, early Thursday morning. It’s not clear if they will remain there or go back to a base 40 miles away where they were staging when they first arrived from Texas.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul declined to speculate on what would happen if the troops don’t leave the ICE facility, saying if they believe the judge’s order isn’t being followed, the state will take that up with the court. But he added the Texas troops do not have to leave the state as long as they are not mobilized.

“They’re welcome to stay at our hotels if they pay the hotel rate,” said Raoul. “They’re welcome to eat at our restaurants like any American city.”

Francisco Miranda, 46, was leaving work on Friday, Oct. 4, when he was approached by two plain-clothed immigration officers wearing masks, who repeatedly told him that he was “here on an overstay,” meaning he had stayed in the country longer than he was allowed as a non-citizen.

Miranda recorded much of the interaction on his cellphone before it was confiscated by immigration officials. The video appears to show officers asking him repeatedly where he was born, which he responded was in California.

Miranda’s attorney, Michael Fuller, wrote in a letter to U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, that Miranda showed the officers his Oregon driver’s license, but officers handcuffed him, struck him so hard they knocked him to the ground, then placed him in the back of an unmarked van.

Miranda was taken to the ICE facility in Portland and detained for hours, Fuller said.

He was eventually released, Fuller said, “without being given any legitimate reason for his abduction.”

Miranda’s arrest was first reported by Willamette Week.

In the days since Miranda’s arrest, Congresswoman Janelle Bynum has called for an investigation into what happened, saying that raids by ICE are reminiscent of the Fugitive Slave Act of the mid-1800s, when law enforcement would hunt down runaway slaves.

“That was a dark and shameful time in our nation’s history,” Bynum wrote in a statement. “We must not allow that to repeat. Masked federal agents aren’t welcome in our state and they can’t keep kidnapping Americans.”

The Milwaukie City Council has also condemned the actions.

“This is not just unconstitutional, it is immoral,” the council wrote in a shared statement, “It represents an affront to the basic values of our nation and to this community: dignity of the individual, compassion for our neighbors, fairness under the law, and respect for human life.”

Miranda’s case is not unique. The agency has been criticized for detaining, and sometimes deporting, U.S. citizens by mistake several times over the years. Reports of such incidents have increased over the past year, since the Trump administration expanded ICE’s mission, giving them more authority to find people living in the U.S. illegally.",https://oregoncapitalinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2025/10/IMG_1772-1536x1152-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 17:58:09.810169

The immigration official told the court the Trump administration has also been discussing removing Abrego Garcia to Ghana, but a notice of his potential deportation to the country had been sent to Abrego Garcia prematurely.
Ghana's foreign affairs minister, however, said on social media earlier Friday that his country ""is not accepting Abrego Garcia.""
Rossman told the court that he doesn't believe the Trump administration is ""intending to remove [Abrego Garcia] in a lawful way.""
While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.","Greenbelt, Maryland — A federal judge on Friday sharply questioned Justice Department lawyers about Trump administration plans to again deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to a prison in his home country earlier this year before he was brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis questioned what is standing in the way of immigration authorities removing Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica, a country that he has said is his preferred place to go and which has indicated it is willing to accept him.

Xinis also repeatedly expressed frustration with testimony from a U.S. immigration official, Jonathan Schultz, who appeared to answer questions about the administration's next steps regarding Abrego Garcia's potential removal to Eswatini, a small African nation formerly known as Swaziland, or other countries, including Costa Rica.

Xinis told Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, that the government presented a witness who ""knows nothing, and I mean next to nothing, about Costa Rica."" She said she gave specific directions about the scope of the testimony she was seeking, and said the Justice Department had again ignored those instructions, ""getting to the three strikes, you're out.""

The administration has attempted to deport Abrego Garcia while his criminal case on charges of human smuggling plays out in Tennessee, but Xinis issued an order in August preventing immigration officials from removing him from the U.S. Xinis is weighing whether to release Abrego Garcia from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention moves forward.

Schultz, an official from Enforcement and Removal Operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the court that government officials have had discussions with numerous foreign nations about accepting Abrego Garcia upon his removal from the U.S.

Schultz said the U.S. reached an agreement with Eswatini to accept people deported from the U.S. and has made assurances they will be safe from torture and persecution. But he said Eswatini hasn't agreed to receive Abrego Garcia, specifically, and the Trump administration did not reach out to the African nation about him until Wednesday evening, according to Schultz.

Administration officials do not appear to have undertaken efforts yet to evaluate whether Abrego Garcia would be tortured, detained or face persecution if deported to Eswatini, Schultz said.

The immigration official told the court the Trump administration has also been discussing removing Abrego Garcia to Ghana, but a notice of his potential deportation to the country had been sent to Abrego Garcia prematurely.

Ghana's foreign affairs minister, however, said on social media earlier Friday that his country ""is not accepting Abrego Garcia.""

""He cannot be deported to Ghana. This has been directly and unambiguously conveyed to US authorities,"" Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa, the foreign affairs minister, wrote on Facebook. ""In my interactions with US officials, I made clear that our understanding to accept a limited number of non-criminal West Africans, purely on the grounds of African solidarity and humanitarian principles would not be expanded.""

Schultz said he is ""confident"" that once the Trump administration receives approval from a third country to accept Abrego Garcia, he could be deported within 72 hours.

Ahead of the hearing, Xinis said she wanted the witness to have answers on what steps the government has taken to deport Abrego Garcia to Eswatini or any other country, including Costa Rica, which he designated as his preferred country of removal. The judge also said the administration official should be prepared to testify about what additional steps the government could take ""in the reasonably foreseeable future"" to deport Abrego Garcia.

Schultz revealed that he believes Eswatini entered into discussions about whether Abrego Garcia could be removed to the country after the government in Uganda declined to accept him. Abrego Garcia's lawyers received a notice from the Department of Homeland Security in late August informing them that he might be deported to Uganda. Documents obtained by CBS News in August indicated that the Trump administration and Uganda reached a deal for the East African nation to accept deportees.

Abrego Garcia's attorneys have moved to free their client from federal immigration detention as his immigration case plays out, citing a 2001 Supreme Court decision that found federal law does not permit ""indefinite detention"" for those the government seeks to deport. Detention should be limited to a ""period reasonably necessary"" to bring about their removal from the U.S, the high court ruled.

After being released from criminal custody on unrelated charges, Abrego Garcia was taken into immigration custody in late August, and his lawyers argue that his continued confinement is illegal. They wrote in a challenge to the legality of his detention that because the Trump administration has been relying on a ""purported"" final order of removal for Abrego Garcia from 2019, the ""presumptively reasonable period"" of detention would've expired in 2020.

Andrew Rossman, a lawyer for Abrego Garcia, argued that his client has been in ""continuous confinement"" since March, when he was first arrested by immigration authorities and then deported to El Salvador, where he remained detained — with the exception of a brief weekend in August.

The ""U.S. government held the keys"" to Abrego Garcia's confinement at a Salvadoran prison, he said.

Rossman said the administration is ""0 for 3"" in finding a country that will accept Abrego Garcia for removal to. Abrego Garcia's lawyers also said they confirmed with him that if the U.S. moved to deport him to Costa Rica, he would go.

The Costa Rican government said in an August letter to the top U.S. diplomat in the country that it intends to provide refugee status or residency to Abrego Garcia, and would accept him ""upon the conclusion of any criminal sentence he may serve in the United States of America.""

Rossman told the court that he doesn't believe the Trump administration is ""intending to remove [Abrego Garcia] in a lawful way.""

""They have spun the globe and picked various places,"" he said, to effectively ""fail on purpose"" by selecting countries that would be ""completely unpalatable"" to Abrego Garcia and lead him to express reasonable fear of persecution or torture that then have to be adjudicated — during which he would remain detained.

""That shows the real aim of the government, the improper aim, is a punitive one, which is just to keep him incarcerated,"" Rossman said.

Xinis questioned Ensign, the Justice Department lawyer, about whether the Trump administration has had any conversations with Abrego Garcia and his lawyers about potentially being removed to Costa Rica given his designation of the country as the place where he wanted to be removed.

""Why hasn't there been?"" she said of discussions.

Abrego Garcia had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.

Xinis ordered the Trump administration in April to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.

He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But Abrego Garcia remained detained for several more weeks because of concerns that he would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.

He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.

Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Maryland rejected a request from Abrego Garcia's legal team to reopen his immigration case and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

Last week, a federal judge in Tennessee said he believes the Justice Department's criminal case against Kilmar Abrego Garcia may have been ""vindictive,"" writing on Friday that ""The government had a significant stake in retaliating against Abrego's success."" The judge has not made a final ruling on those claims, and will allow for discovery and a hearing on Abrego Garcia's claims.

There are 62,000 people in immigration custody, Schultz, the immigration official said.

Since then, according to the petition, the asylum seeker had ""diligently attended every immigration court hearing” until ICE agents arrested him this past July at immigration court.
ICE did not respond to NBC Bay Area’s request to discuss the habeas cases or Donato’s comments.
Weiner said she’s filed nearly a dozen habeas cases in the past few months alone, securing the release of roughly 28 migrants from ICE detention.
“Never in my country was I treated like this, like a criminal,” said Valera, describing his recent arrest at San Francisco’s immigration court.","As U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrests continue to soar across the country, federal judges in San Francisco are rebuking the agency over due process concerns and have ordered the release – at least temporarily – of dozens of immigrants being held in detention facilities across California and beyond.

The judges’ orders come in response to a wave of legal filings from attorneys representing immigrants being held in ICE detention – called “petitions for writ of habeas corpus” – arguing their clients are being illegally and indefinitely locked up without being afforded a pre-detention hearing in front of an immigration judge.

An NBC Bay Area review of 24 habeas cases filed in the Bay Area’s federal court district – involving 37 separate immigrants detained by ICE in recent months – found that in every case, judges have issued temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions granting the temporary release of those immigrants until their habeas petitions are resolved.

In a small handful of other cases, judges have yet to rule on the detainee’s motion for a temporary restraining order that would release them from ICE custody.

“The violation of constitutional rights is so egregious,” said Jordan Weiner, who heads the immigration defense program at the San Francisco nonprofit La Raza Centro Legal. “Just arbitrarily arresting someone who hasn’t missed any court hearings or hasn’t committed any crimes.”

Until recently, Weiner said her work typically focused on helping immigrants navigate their asylum cases, not fighting in federal court to free them from detention.

“That’s all changed because ICE agents have been waiting for them in court and arresting them,” said Weiner, who also serves on the San Francisco and San Mateo County Rapid Response Networks, which dispatch attorneys to provide legal aid when immigrants are detained by ICE.

In San Francisco, ICE agents have arrested dozens of immigrants – many of them asylum seekers – after hearings in immigration court, according to multiple Rapid Response Network attorneys. Others have been detained at routine ICE check-ins.

Immigration cases are considered a civil matter in the U.S., and immigrant rights advocates have slammed the agency for the widespread detention of people who are not being held in connection to an alleged crime.

One habeas petition, filed in late July, described the arrest of an asylum seeker who fled Peru and arrived in the U.S. nearly three years ago. When he first arrived in the U.S., according to the petition, federal agents “briefly detained him” before releasing him on his own recognizance with a notice to appear for removal proceedings in immigration court.

Since then, according to the petition, the asylum seeker had ""diligently attended every immigration court hearing” until ICE agents arrested him this past July at immigration court.

A day after the habeas petition was filed, federal Judge Trina Thompson issued a temporary restraining order requiring ICE to release the asylum seeker from custody.

“District courts have routinely granted temporary restraining orders barring the government from detaining noncitizens who have been on longstanding release in their immigration proceedings, without first holding a pre-deprivation hearing before a neutral decisionmaker,” Thompson wrote in her order.

The judge has since issued a preliminary injunction ordering the immigrant’s continued release from ICE custody until the resolution of his habeas case.

“He risks being separated from his family and community, and being subjected to ICE’s inadequate, subpar medical care,” Thompson wrote in her order granting the preliminary injunction. “The public has an interest in preventing constitutional violations, and Respondents-Defendants only risk minimal harm in delaying Petitioner-Plaintiff’s detention.”

For decades, immigration judges have been permitted to grant bond to migrants who were not deemed a safety threat – and who attended mandatory ICE check-ins and immigration court hearings – until their cases were resolved.

However, a July Department of Homeland Security policy memo stated that anyone who crossed the border without permission would be classified as “an applicant for admission” to the U.S, irrespective of when they arrived. According to the memo, those immigrants would be subject to mandatory detention and immigration judges – who serve under the Department of Justice, not the judiciary– lack the authority to hold bond hearings.

In September, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) – also under the executive branch – upheld the administration’s interpretation of the law. Government attorneys opposing the wave of habeas petitions hitting federal court have cited the BIA decision, and the underlying regulations, in support of keeping many immigrants in detention for the duration of their pending immigration cases.

Attorneys such as Weiner, however, say the new policy upends decades of tradition, and call the practice a violation of immigrants’ civil liberties.

“Our argument is that the constitution protects people from arbitrary deprivations of liberty,” Weiner said.

Time after time, federal judges are agreeing.

NBC Bay Area was in federal court in September when a seemingly frustrated Judge James Donato pressed an assistant U.S. attorney on why ICE continues to detain migrants without giving them a pre-detention hearing in front of an immigration judge.

“This argument has failed in every court that it’s ever been argued,” Donato told the assistant U.S. attorney.

“There’s an easy answer here, government: Just give them a hearing,” Donato added.

ICE did not respond to NBC Bay Area’s request to discuss the habeas cases or Donato’s comments.

Weiner said most, if not every federal judge in San Francisco, likely has at least one habeas case involving an ICE detainee on their plate, something that has not gone unnoticed by Donato.

“What’s the master plan for making sure we don’t have the same cases coming up again and again and again in front of every judge in this district,” Donato asked.

Weiner said she’s filed nearly a dozen habeas cases in the past few months alone, securing the release of roughly 28 migrants from ICE detention.

Jorge Valera - an asylum seeker from Peru with no criminal record, according to his habeas petition – is one of the detainees a judge ordered ICE to set free.

“Never in my country was I treated like this, like a criminal,” said Valera, describing his recent arrest at San Francisco’s immigration court. “They shackled my feet. I am not a criminal, I am not a murderer.”

Valera said he was sent to a detention center in Arizona and spent a week in ICE custody before a judge ordered ICE to release him.

Weiner said her “little nonprofit” is focusing on what they can, but they’re hoping others will take up the cause.

“I just want to show that this is how they’re spending their time and resources,” Weiner said. “I’m hoping to shine a light on the lengths that the government is willing to go. They don’t care that the local AUSAs, the local government attorneys defending these cases are overworked and fighting losing cases over and over again.”",https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2025/10/ice-releases-1010-e1760102488903.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-10 18:57:50.013683

But the State Department has reported just three end-use violations to Capitol Hill.
The report added that the State Department hasn’t informed Congress what merits reporting and that it investigates violations inconsistently.

Overseas Defense Department staffers told the watchdog they’re using “professional judgment” to decide what should rise to the State Department’s attention because the State Department hasn’t defined the incident types, thresholds, or timelines.","On paper, the guardrails are clear. When the U.S. ships weapons overseas, partner governments promise three things: That they’ll use them only for authorized purposes, keep them secure, and not hand them off to third parties.

If those conditions are violated or serious suspicions arise that they are, the State Department is obligated to investigate and, in many cases, alert Congress.

In practice, however, a new Government Accountability Office report shows the system is ad hoc, with little guidance or follow through.

The State Department largely relies on overseas Defense Department officials for tips about potential end-use violations.

Since 2019, the Pentagon has flagged more than 150 incidents that could be violations. But the State Department has reported just three end-use violations to Capitol Hill.

The report added that the State Department hasn’t informed Congress what merits reporting and that it investigates violations inconsistently.

Experts in the arms trafficking and conflict monitoring are dismayed, calling the reported gaps an affront to both national and global security.

“It was really shocking to see how far the U.S had fallen behind,” said Kathi Lynn Austin, executive director of the Conflict Awareness Project, who added the number of potential incidents flagged was “extraordinary.”

“We are violating our law and not protecting our own security — at a time when there is so much volatility in the world,” Austin said. “We need to understand this is urgent, and Congress needs to push to maintain transparency and public trust in our arms dealings.”

The 39-page GAO report, published to little notice in September, lays out a simple mismatch: Defense personnel stationed abroad are often the first to see or hear about possible violations, but diplomats with the State Department haven’t told military officials clearly what to flag. (GAO, Pentagon, and State Department officials said the government shutdown left them unavailable to comment.)

In other instances of being tipped to potential violations, the GAO says, the State Department could not produce records showing whether anyone ever decided if the law’s reporting thresholds were met.

The Arms Export Control Act requires notifying Congress when there’s information that a substantial violation may have occurred regarding purpose, transfer, or security; it also requires reporting when an unauthorized transfer actually happens. Those are low thresholds for alerting the legislature, by design. Yet the GAO found no formal procedures inside the State Department for making, recording, and sharing their decision-making process.

In the report, the State Department agreed with GAO’s six recommendations, including providing concrete guidance to the Pentagon, standardizing investigations with timelines, and creating procedures for deciding and documenting what gets reported to Congress.

The GAO cannot force a federal agency to bend to its report and relies on voluntary compliance.

If the changes aren’t actually implemented, however, Congress will continue flying blind when it comes to U.S. arms sales negatively impacting national — and international — security.

The Misuse Pipeline

The mechanics of “end-use” sound bureaucratic, but the stakes aren’t. Around the world, U.S.-made weapons moves from legal sale to illicit use on the battlefield, stolen from depots, through corrupt commanders, transfers to proxies, or simple loss.

The results are everywhere. In Afghanistan, for instance, vast quantities of U.S.-supplied small arms and vehicles seeded regional black markets. Conflict Armament Research, a U.K. group that tracks conventional weapons, traced the Islamic State group’s ammunition stocks to dozens of countries — including U.S.-linked supply lines — often thanks to the chaos of collapsing units and unsecured stockpiles.

A recent Intercept investigation linked U.S manufactured rifle rounds to cartel slaughter in the heart of Mexico.

“The biggest concern for the average American citizen is the potential for these arms to be used against us,” said Brandon Philips, a public affairs professor at California State University, East Bay. “We are in a position right now where we aren’t everyone’s favorite country.”

When the government puts tracking systems in place, however, more of the leaks get plugged. In Ukraine — a challenging venue for containing arms flows because of the sheer quantity of material being introduced — early Pentagon watchdog reviews faulted shortfalls in tracking designated sensitive items amid an active war. Follow-ups found marked improvement as the U.S. expanded “enhanced end-use monitoring,” boosted staffing, and raised compliance rates.

Even with a partner government that has strong incentives to cooperate, effective control requires sustained, well-resourced checks. But the U.S doesn’t even have a system for how those checks should happen.

In its report, the GAO zeroed in on this vagueness. Overseas Defense Department staffers told the watchdog they’re using “professional judgment” to decide what should rise to the State Department’s attention because the State Department hasn’t defined the incident types, thresholds, or timelines.

The ambiguity increases the odds that important cases fall into a bureaucratic void, never formally investigated or reported. The GAO even found examples where one incident drew a full document review and coordination, while a similar one drew no action at all.

“A number of us for years have talked about insufficiencies around end-of-use monitoring, and this report continues to show the problems of how this is done,” said Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Center for International Policy, a Washington think tank. “The American people are attuned that a lot of harm is caused in the world by our weapons.”

The infrastructure exists to track weapons — the State Department has systems to vet its direct buyers, and the Pentagon has a program for enhanced end-use monitoring. But the GAO found that the connective tissue of such programs doesn’t.

“The fact that this report is mostly about things that happened during the Biden administration, and the second part of Trump, shows it’s a systemic problem. It shows that we are going sell things and not bother,” said John Lindsay-Poland, coordinator of the nonprofit Stop U.S. Arms to Mexico. Poland noted that the report only covers a small portion of government-to-government sales, while the bulk of U.S. arms exports are commercial sales and small arms.

“If your priority is selling stuff,” he said, “taking into account whether the stuff you’re selling is massacring people, destroying communities, strengthening terrorists and drug trafficking, or driving immigration is secondary.”

Gaza and Double Standards

The GAO’s accounting of the oversight vacuum comes at an incendiary moment.

In 2024, the Biden administration put a policy in place that required assessments of whether partners receiving U.S. arms in active conflicts were using them consistent with international humanitarian law.

In May 2024, the administration’s report to Congress concluded it was “reasonable to assess” that Israel had used U.S.-provided arms in ways “inconsistent” with international law in some instances, while adding that wartime conditions made case-by-case attribution hard. Human rights groups blasted the equivocation and urged suspensions; Israel rejected the accusations.

In February 2025, the new administration scrapped the policy.

The Gaza debate is precisely where a functioning end-use system should be strongest.

Independent investigators and journalists have documented repeated Israeli strikes that allegedly used U.S.-origin munitions against protected sites or in ways that were indiscriminate. The State Department’s own human rights reporting, before becoming hollowed out this year under President Donald Trump, catalogued grave harms.

Abramson, who has tracked global armament and misuse, said failure to monitor end-use violations and report them to Congress can put American foreign policy in a diplomatic chokehold.

“Around the world,” he said, “we are trying to make friends, But when they have seen our weapons being misused it undermines that ability, and makes us seem hypocritical, dangerous.”",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2240008789-e1760106927494.jpg?fit=3960%2C1980&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-10 16:57:31.867274

The decision from U.S. District Judge April Perry was in response to a lawsuit filed this week by Chicago and Illinois and marked a temporary win for the city and state's Democratic leaders. It comes as President Donald Trump works to move troops into major urban areas, arguing they have a rampant crime crisis, despite statistics not always backing that up. Troops were expected to start patrolling Friday in Tennessee, and a court battle continued over Trump's plans to deploy them in Portland, Oregon.

But what will happen to the hundreds of troops already in Illinois, including a small number outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in Broadview, remained unclear.

In a statement, a White House spokesperson said they plan to take to the case to higher courts.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court,"" White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement.

Perry heard arguments in a crowded downtown Chicago courtroom from attorneys for the state of Illinois and the Justice Department.

She pressed Justice Department lawyer Eric Hamilton on whether National Guard troops would only be stationed around federal buildings or also in neighborhoods, schools and hospitals. Hamilton responded that troops also could be used to “protect ICE agents” in the field.

Trump, meanwhile, has portrayed Chicago as a lawless “hellhole” of crime, though statistics show a significant recent drop in crime.

Perry referenced Alexander Hamilton in condemning the president’s actions.

“(The founders) would never believe that it would ever come to pass that one state militia could be sent to another state for the purposes of political retribution,” she said.

Officials at U.S. Northern Command directed questions to the Department of Defense, which declined to comment citing a policy that the department doesn’t comment on ongoing litigation.

It marks the second major ruling surrounding Chicago immigration enforcement.

In a separate hearing, federal agents were ordered — temporarily — by a federal judge to wear badges and were banned from using certain riot control weapons against peaceful protesters and journalists outside the Broadview ICE facility.

The preliminary injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis restricts agents’ use of force, including pepper balls, rubber bullets and physical force such as pulling, shoving or tackling against protesters and journalists who don’t pose a serious threat to law enforcement.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and Trump both defended the decision to federalize the National Guard during a press availability Wednesday.

“(We’re doing this to) keep our federal officers safe, to keep our federal buildings safe, (and) we’re not gonna have it any more from these thugs,” Bondi said.

Perry, a President Biden appointee, was at first his nominee for U.S. attorney in Illinois, but that confirmation blocked by then-Sen. J.D. Vance. She was instead appointed to the Chicago federal bench.

Perry said a full written decision would be issued Friday.",https://media.nbcchicago.com/2025/10/GettyImages-2239650965.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-10 16:57:59.596041

“For years, Washington talked about border security but failed to deliver. This President changed that,” said CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott. “The Smart Wall means more miles of barriers, more technology, and more capability for our agents on the ground. This is how you take control of the border.”

The Smart Wall is a border security system that combines steel barriers, waterborne barriers, patrol roads, lights, cameras, and advanced detection technology to give Border Patrol agents the best tools in the world to stop illegal traffic. In total, these projects will add 230 miles of Smart Wall and nearly 400 miles of new technology. The technology additions will further secure existing wall in areas where the Biden Administration policies cancelled contracts to do so.

These 10 contracts, which were awarded Sept. 15-30, are the very first to be funded by President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill and also include minimal prior year funding from Fiscal Year 2021 wall appropriations, funding which was on hold during the Biden Administration.

To cut through bureaucratic red tape and expedite the construction of the Smart Wall, Secretary Noem also issued two new waivers for approximately nine miles of Smart Wall in the Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector and approximately 30 miles of new Smart Wall located in New Mexico within the El Paso Sector.

And the Portland Police Bureau said its officers arrested two people around the facility. One person was arrested on a harassment charge, and the other one had a warrant for his arrest.

It was not immediately clear why the federal agents arrested the three people.

Two of the federal arrests happened shortly before 9:30 p.m. The gate to the ICE facility opened, and federal officers came out into the street. Someone started playing “The Imperial March,” Darth Vader’s theme song in the “Star Wars” movies.

Protesters and agents faced off in the street as a helicopter circled overhead, and then several agents took the two people into custody.

As federal agents led a man away, he yelled, “I’m innocent. I didn’t do anything.”

As the federal officers went back into the facility, officers fired pepper balls from the roof.

KATU was live streaming outside the facility as part of its ""24 Hours Outside ICE"" initiative and captured the federal agents taking the three people into custody. Watch the recorded stream below.

Later, federal agents appeared to try and arrest another person, but they were unsuccessful. That happened at about 11 p.m. Federal officers came out of the facility and then a group of them chased someone about a block east, but they did not catch up to that person.

At about 11:45 p.m., federal officers came out again and made their third arrest. The officers also took the man's guitar.

Other than during the arrests and the agents' unsuccessful apprehension of the other person, it was a party atmosphere outside the facility most of the night. People danced to music in inflatable costumes, like frogs, a polar bear, and other characters.

KATU reached out to ICE for additional information about the arrests.

Portland police have increased presence

There was a noticeable increase in the number of Portland police officers Thursday.

Protesters like Bianca Barrett took notice of the increased presence by Portland police.

""Yes, it definitely got a lot more aggressive and more cars and like patrols and bike police,"" she said.

One man, who would only give his first name, Horace, was a counter-protester from Illinois. He thought Portland police are taking sides.

""Sometimes I feel like they do let stuff get out of hand on some occasions. They don't pay attention that much to situations,"" he said.

Portland Police Chief Bob Day told reporters earlier there is ""no cover-up or collaboration.""

""Our job doesn't change. It's the same today as it was yesterday as it was six months ago,"" he said.

According to Portland police, officers have made 47 arrests since the protest began in June. Twenty-eight of those were in June.

Day said the police bureau has increased enforcement.

""So we have more officers in the area. We're also working closely with the state police,"" he said.

In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R.","The American Civil Liberties Union and two Colorado law firms sued federal immigration officials Thursday in an effort to stop what the legal groups call the agency’s “indiscriminate stops and arrests” across the state.

The lawsuit brought in federal court in Colorado alleges that Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents are arresting and detaining people because of their skin color, accent or perceived nationality to fulfill arrest quotas set by the Trump administration without determining probable cause and flight risk.

The firms are bringing the lawsuit on behalf of four people, including Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah student who was brought to the U.S. as a child. ICE arrested Dias Goncalves in June after a Mesa County Sheriff deputy pulled her over in Fruita and asked about her accent and immigration status. She spent 15 days in ICE’s Aurora detention center.

“Our state’s 169,000 undocumented immigrants, and hundreds of thousands more Latine Coloradans, now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the lawsuit said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

The lawsuit, brought by the ACLU of Colorado, Meyer Law Office and Olson Grimsley Kawanabe Hinchcliff & Murray, LLC, names three defendants: Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons and Director of ICE’s Denver Field Office Robert Guadian.

ICE’s Denver Field Office referred questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE agents must have probable cause to believe the person they are arresting is living in the U.S. in violation of immigration laws and is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained, according to the lawsuit.

The plaintiffs in the case say they were arrested indiscriminately. All reported experiencing physical injuries, pain and hunger during their arrests or while in detention, according to the lawsuit.

Refugio Ramirez Ovando is a 43-year-old father and lawful permanent resident who has lived in Colorado for 20 years and is the father of four U.S. citizen children. ICE agents in unmarked cars pulled him over in May when he was on his way to work in Grand Junction at the construction concrete company where he has worked for 18 years. ICE held him at the detention center in Aurora for more than 90 days, according to the lawsuit.

A 36-year-old asylum seeker identified in the lawsuit as J.S.T. has lived in Colorado for 15 years. On Feb. 5, ICE agents raided the Whispering Pines Apartments complex, where he had lived for seven years. At the time, J.S.T. was leaving the apartment parking lot to drive to his job at a restaurant and grocery store when ICE agents arrested him. He spent four weeks at the Aurora detention center and lost his home as a result, according to the lawsuit.

That same day ICE agents conducted raids in at least seven apartment complexes and communities across Denver, Aurora, and Thornton, the lawsuit said. At some apartments, ICE agents knocked on every door, the lawsuit alleges, asking tenants to provide identification without a warrant.

A 32-year-old father and construction business owner identified in the lawsuit as G.R.R. has lived in the U.S. for 11 years. In April, ICE agents raided a nightclub in Colorado Springs, where the lawsuit said G.R.R. was waiting as a designated driver for a friend. G.R.R. spent seven weeks at the Aurora detention center, according to the lawsuit.

“Plaintiffs and their families were devastated by the unlawful captures and now live every day in a heightened state of fear of again being separated,” the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit asks a federal judge to consider the plaintiffs as representatives of a class of all people in Colorado who have been arrested since Jan. 20, 2025, or will be arrested without a warrant and without “a pre-arrest, individualized assessment of probable cause that the person poses a flight risk.”

The lawsuit describes the similar experience of many other people whom ICE has arrested since President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January.

Trump vowed during his presidential campaign to deport “vicious and bloodthirsty criminals,” but also promised to execute “the largest deportation program in American history.” The resulting roundups of immigrants working in fields, attending court hearings or walking in their neighborhoods have included those with work permits, permanent residency cards and even U.S. citizenship.

In May, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said, “we are looking to set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests for ICE every day” after reports from other news outlets that Miller and Noem had set the daily arrest quota. The administration later disavowed the quota after running into questions from federal judges about its constitutionality.",https://newspack-coloradosun.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSCF2614-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 14:57:24.404854

In campaign speeches, press conferences, and executive orders, President Donald Trump has relentlessly vilified Latin American immigrants as criminals, invaders, and burdens on the U.S. economy.[i] He has declared a “national emergency” at the southern border to justify authoritarian power grabs, deployed troops and razor wire against asylum-seekers, and fast-tracked deportations to countries like El Salvador — stripping people of due process and ignoring well-documented risks to their lives and safety.[ii] These tactics are not about border security; they are about scapegoating vulnerable people to obscure deeper systemic failure as corporations cash in.

As Trump and other politicians use immigration as a political weapon, the real crisis goes unexamined: the economic system that displaces people through trade and investment policies, exploits their labor upon arrival, and criminalizes their existence.

“This fight is ours, it’s our community’s, but it belongs to everyone. We all have to fight for them.” -David Huerta, President of the Service Employees International Union California. Original photo: David Crane, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG.

The consequences are felt beyond the border. Within communities, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency is detaining Spanish-speaking American citizens, sweeping up Native Americans in immigration raids, and even deporting U.S. citizens.[iii] This targeting stems from hate-fueled bias, and a recent Supreme Court ruling has effectively sanctioned racial profiling and the unjust treatment of individuals whose only “crime” is their heritage.[iv]

Trump’s criminalization of migrants does nothing to address the U.S. economic policies that displace people across Latin America and extract profit at every step of their journey. Instead, it lines the pockets of a powerful corporate lobby: the private prison industry.

In his second term, President Trump has directed his administration to intensify its efforts to crack down on immigration. In the early days of the administration, ICE arrests averaged around 660 daily, but just four months later, the agency arrested a record 2,300 individuals in a single day.[v] White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller made clear the administration’s goal is to increase arrests to 3,000 per day.[vi]

Detainment operations, conducted with militarized tactics and unmarked vehicles, have sparked widespread peaceful protests. In Los Angeles, community resistance was met with an unprecedented deployment of federal troops. The raids have affected diverse communities such as garment workers, day laborers, and local businesses, leading to mass arrests and heightened community unrest.[vii]

Private Prisons: Cashing In on Detained Migrants

The Trump administration’s xenophobic campaign rhetoric and ensuing ICE raids have proven highly profitable for private prison companies, especially GEO Group and CoreCivic. Since Trump took office, their stock value soared — GEO Group’s by 35% and CoreCivic’s by 57%.[viii] Their financial success is intricately linked to Trump’s policies, particularly his rescission of a Biden-era order aimed at reducing the use of private prisons.[ix] These companies run detention centers and create surveillance technology to monitor immigrants, capitalizing on the mass deportation strategy.

Lobbying

GEO Group and CivicCore have aggressively lobbied to expand immigration enforcement and detention to boost their revenue. Between 2008 and 2014, they collectively spent over $16 million on federal lobbying, targeting the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversees immigration detention funding and policies.[x]

In 2017, during Trump’s first administration, GEO Group significantly increased its lobbying expenditures, spending $1.7 million — a more than 70% increase from the previous year — to influence policies related to immigration enforcement and detention. This marked the highest amount on record for a private prison contractor at the time.[xi]

In 2024, GEO Group reportedly spent $1.38 million, and CoreCivic allocated $1.77 million to federal lobbying, continuing their efforts to influence immigration and detention policies.[xii] In the first quarter of 2025 alone, GEO Group invested $350,000, while CoreCivic spent $490,000 on lobbying efforts.[xiii] These expenditures help secure favorable government policies that align with their business interests.

Government Contracts

That lobbying has paid off. Following its surge in lobbying in 2017, GEO Group announced it had won the Trump administration’s first federal contract for a new immigration detention center: a $110 million, 1,000-bed facility in Conroe, Texas.[xiv] GEO Group and CoreCivic have continued to benefit directly from mass deportation efforts, securing lucrative ICE contracts to run detention centers and provide detention beds. GEO Groups secured $747 million in contracts in 2023 alone, and CoreCivic received an ICE contract worth $2.2 billion, representing 30% of its total revenue.[xv]

The companies’ profit model thrives on the detention of immigrants, with “bed quotas” mandating a minimum number of immigration detention beds, thus ensuring a steady demand for facilities.[xvi] This “bed quota” policy, which guarantees payment of $150 per detainee per day, is funded by taxpayer dollars.[xvii] This financial incentive to maintain high incarceration rates further fuels the cycle of mass detention, as private interests profit from the very policies that fuel the raids targeting the displaced.

Revolving Door

The revolving door between government officials and high-ranking roles within companies raises serious ethical concerns. For example, Pam Bondi, Trump’s Attorney General, previously lobbied for GEO Group.[xviii] Most recently, David Bible, a top ICE official, left his position to become Executive Vice President at GEO Group, shortly after advocating for more funding to expand detention capacity and technology to monitor migrants — efforts that directly benefited his future employer.[xix]

Forced Labor and Inhumane Conditions

A key element of the profit-driven model is the exploitation of detainees as cheap labor. GEO Group, which operates 16 ICE detention facilities, has faced multiple lawsuits over inhumane labor practices, including forcing detainees to prepare meals, wash laundry, and scrub toilets for just $1 per day.[xx]

Forcing detainees to do this work for so little avoids the costs associated with hiring paid employees. A federal court ruled that GEO must pay $17 million in back wages, plus $6 million for “unjust enrichment” — still accounting for less than 1% of GEO’s total revenues in 2024.[xxi] Nevertheless, GEO Group is refusing to pay and vowing to “vigorously pursue all available appeals.”[xxii]

Detainees spell “SOS” during a protest against inhumane conditions in the courtyard of ICE’s Krome Detention Center in Florida, 2025. Original photo: Paul Ratje/Reuters.

The company has also faced numerous lawsuits for mistreating detainees, including children.[xxiii] These conditions include moldy food, solitary confinement, and severe medical neglect, resulting in preventable deaths.[xxiv]

In 2023, GEO Group was sued for using toxic chemicals to clean its facilities, causing detainees to fall ill and suffer long-term health consequences.[xxv] Such inhumane conditions are unacceptable under any circumstances. Importantly, migrants detained in ICE centers are not criminals. They are held in legal limbo while an immigration judge determines whether they should be deported.

Booming Business

As the mass detainment of migrants following ICE raids intensifies, the financial incentives of this punitive system become increasingly apparent as corporations that house detained migrants profit from human suffering, funded by taxpayer dollars.[xxvi]

In 2022, the GEO Group reported $4 billion, accounting for approximately 43% of its revenue, from ICE contracts.[xxvii] This revenue stream has only grown as demand for detention space surges under the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda. In 2025, CoreCivic signed a new contract with ICE to expand its detention capacity, accommodating up to 784 additional detainees at correctional facilities that the company runs in Mississippi, Nevada, Ohio, and Oklahoma, including a maximum-security prison.[xxviii]

Criminalizing migrants does not protect national security — it protects corporate profits. It sustains a system in which workers displaced by trade are penalized for surviving, and where their legal precarity is exploited as a tool of wage suppression.

Our officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them and their families are being doxxed and threatened online.

Harassment at home: In September, three women were indicted by a federal grand jury for livestreaming their pursuit of an ICE agent to his home and then posting the victim’s home address on Instagram. Upon arriving at the law enforcement officer’s home, they began shouting “neighbor is ICE,” “la migra lives here,” and “ICE lives on your street and you should know.”

Direct threats to families: In Texas, an ICE officer’s spouse received a call saying, “I don’t know how you let your husband work for ICE, and you sleep at night. F*** you, f*** your family. I hope your kids get deported by accident. How do you sleep? F*** you. Did you hear what happened to the Nazis after World War II? Because it’s what’s going to happen to your family.”

When agents and their families are identified, they receive violent threats in their messages and even death threats. One agent’s spouse was sent this Facebook message by Robert Buckley of Lakeville, Massachusetts: “Your husband, the ICE man is a f*** and retribution will come your way eventually.”

Doxxing online: An investigation by the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility in San Diego led to the arrest of Gregory John Curcio, 68, who is accused of doxxing an ICE attorney by posting her personal information online and urging others to harass her. Court documents allege in February 2025, Curcio posted the attorney’s home address to social media and directed others to “swat” her; a tactic involving false emergency calls to provoke an armed law enforcement response. The documents further allege he used multiple accounts and conducted a harassment campaign against the attorney and her family dating back to January 2024.

Houston Halloween display: Effigies of ICE agents dressed in black shirts with red hats were hung from homemade gallows with zip ties in their pockets. The display, surrounded by coffins, barbed wire, and featuring a Mexican flag, was a mock execution ground.

In recent weeks, public demonstrations and policy debates have surged, highlighting concerns over the legal status of undocumented youth in Canada. With immigration a key topic, the push for inclusive policies is gaining momentum across North America.

The Push for DACA Canada Immigration Reform

Advocacy groups across Canada are intensifying their efforts for DACA immigration reform. The growing political and public interest stems from recent discussions about immigrant rights and legal protections. These groups are calling for policies that reflect Canada’s values of inclusivity and diversity. Research shows that an inclusive approach can lead to better social and economic outcomes, benefiting the country as a whole. In the past month, several rallies have taken place in major Canadian cities, drawing attention to the plight of undocumented youth. These events aim to galvanize public support and influence policymakers. Experts argue that reforming immigration policies not only upholds human rights but also enhances Canada’s international image. This push is part of a larger movement to align North American policies on immigration.

Challenges in Canadian Immigration Policy

While advocacy efforts intensify, challenges remain in reforming Canadian immigration policy. Current policies often leave undocumented youth without clear legal status or pathways to citizenship. This uncertainty impacts their access to education and employment, creating barriers to full participation in society. Recent reports indicate that over 200,000 undocumented people are residing in Canada, many of whom arrived as children. Advocacy groups stress that reform is crucial to address these pressing issues. Legal experts also point to the need for clearer frameworks that protect the rights of all residents, including the undocumented. Enhanced legal status would provide much-needed security for these individuals and their families.

How the Immigrant Rights Movement Influences Policy

The immigrant rights movement in Canada has gained traction as more people advocate for comprehensive reform. Social media has played a significant role in spreading awareness and initiating conversations about DACA and immigration policy. Platforms like X and Reddit have become hubs for discussion, where advocates share strategies and highlight personal stories. For instance, a recent report shows how these advocacy efforts are starting to influence political agendas. Politicians are increasingly acknowledging the need for policy adjustments to reflect Canada’s commitment to human rights. By leveraging public and policy support, the immigrant rights movement continues to pave the way for meaningful changes.

Conclusion: The Way Forward for DACA and Immigration Reform

Looking ahead, the momentum for DACA and immigration reform in Canada seems strong. Advocacy groups are rallying support not only from immigrants but also from broader communities. These efforts highlight an increasing awareness that inclusive immigration policies are vital for social cohesion and economic prosperity. Moreover, as Canada positions itself as a leader in human rights and inclusivity, aligning immigration policies with these values becomes imperative. The focus now is on translating public support into legislative action, so undocumented youth and immigrants can secure their future. Change may not be immediate, but each step taken by advocacy groups, individuals, and policymakers contributes to a more just and equitable system. Canada’s journey towards reforming immigration policy underscores a commitment to diversity and inclusion, offering hope for those who seek certainty and belonging.

Final Thoughts

As advocacy groups in Canada push for reform, attention is turning to the impact of uncertain legal status on undocumented youth. Their efforts emphasize the need for policies that reflect Canada’s commitment to inclusivity and human rights. As awareness grows, so does the potential for meaningful change in immigration policy. It’s crucial for lawmakers to heed the call for reform, providing pathways to legal status that ensure the well-being of all residents. This ongoing movement offers hope for a more inclusive future.

Friday morning's demonstration got underway after a federal judge granted the state's temporary restraining order, barring National Guards troops from taking part in immigration operations.

That TRO is in effect for two weeks and could be extended.

Chopper 7 captured dozens of National Guard members gathering outside the Army Reserve training facility in far southwest suburban Elwood on Friday morning.

Judge April Perry's decision came hours after the Guard arrived at the Broadview immigration facility on Thursday. Troops could be seen walking around and lingering near the facility.

The Trump administration has argued that the bolstered military presence is needed to protect federal property and employees. But the judge said the government's claims about an out-of-control public on the brink of rebellion were not credible.

The White House responded to the judge's move to grant a temporary restraining order, writing, in part, ""President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.""

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement, saying, ""President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Chicago following violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxed by left-wing rioters. The President's lawful actions will make Chicago safer. We have the law and supremacy clause on our side.""

Judge rules fencing surrounding Broadview ICE facility must come down

Meanwhile, a judge has ordered the removal of a fence surrounding the Broadview facility.

Attorneys for the federal government argued that the fencing across Beach Street was needed to conduct business and to protect vehicles and personnel, after conflicts erupted during protests of ICE action during operation ""Midway Blitz.""

The village of Broadview said the fence was put up without village approval, and it blocks emergency response.

The judge sided with Broadview officials, granting their request for a TRO.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson issued a statement, saying, ""This is a validation of local law and, most importantly, a decisive win for public safety. The judge's decision confirms that the illegal fence constructed by ICE is not only a clear defiance of Broadview's ordinance but an unacceptable and escalating risk to our Beach Street businesses, their customers, and our first responders. The law of probability dictates that the danger increases daily. The court has spoken clearly and unequivocally. Now, it remains to be seen if ICE will respect the judge's order and dismantle this hazard immediately, or if they will continue their pattern of defiance.""

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.
In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.
G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs.
In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver.","The ACLU of Colorado has sued the Trump administration, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials carried out unlawful, warrantless arrests as part of a broad effort to detain immigrants living in the United States without legal status.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a legal permanent resident, a “Dreamer” brought to the country as a child, and an asylum seeker, all of whom have lived in the country for more than a decade.

A “dreamer” is a colloquial term for an immigrant who was brought illegally to the United States as a child and is eligible for protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunction relief.

“They are going door-to-door, sweeping apartment parking lots, and confronting residents and neighbors walking near their homes or jobs,” the complaint claimed, referring to immigration agents. “They are pulling over workers and college students going about their daily lives. ICE agents are then arresting Latino people without warrants, without probable cause, and without assessing legal status and flight risk as required by law.”

Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has embarked on a mass deportation effort, a key campaign promise. That effort has drawn lawsuits.

Federal data suggest that arrests have more than doubled since the spring, according to TRAC Immigration at Syracuse University.

Nearly 60,000 people across the United States were being detained in August.

To make a dent in the 14 million immigrants estimated to be living illegally in the U.S. — according to the Pew Research Center — House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller instructed ICE in June to make 3,000 arrests a day.

That’s up from the 650 arrests a day in the first five months of Trump’s second term.

ICE agents arrested nearly 2,000 people in Colorado alone in the first half of the year, according to the complaint.

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.

Meyer represents the four immigrants named in the suit.

Meyer added: “They’re not going to change unless a court steps in and makes them change.”

Supporters of the immigration crackdown said they trust that federal immigration agents are following the law.

In an earlier interview, Aurora City Councilwoman Danielle Jurinsky said she was aware of at least one person detained and later released on bond by ICE at Whispering Pines, one of three troubled apartment complexes owned by CBZ Management, which nabbed headlines last year over the activities of a Venezuelan gang that gained a foothold in metro Denver.

Jurinsky said she doesn’t believe federal agents have acted inappropriately.

“If they are doing things without judicial oversight, that would be concerning to me,” Jurinsky said. “I have to trust that they are; that they are doing things the right way.”

Meanwhile, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, had noted ICE can lawfully enter if given consent or under other legal authorities, including criminal warrants, administrative code inspections or exigent circumstances.

“I would be shocked if ICE were attempting to forcibly enter private residences on an administrative warrant,” Matthew O’Brien, FAIR deputy executive director said in an email to The Denver Gazette, in reference to questions about the warrants used in Colorado.

The ACLU’s complaint relies on national media outlets that have reported a change from “targeted and investigation-based operations” to the administration encouraging “immigration agents to ‘turn the creative knob up to 11’ when it comes to enforcement including through arrests collateral to anyone actually identified in a warrant.”

The roughly 200,000 immigrants living unlawfully in Colorado “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the complaint said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

Two of the plaintiffs — Refugio Ramirez Ovando, a 43-year-old construction worker and Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah college student — were pulled over while driving.

In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.

Dias was pulled over by a Mesa County Sheriff’s deputy near Fruita on June 5.

J.S.T, a 36-year-old asylum seeker, was detained by ICE agents while pulling out of the parking lot at the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora on Feb. 5, while on his way to work. J.S.T was held in the Aurora Detention Center for four weeks, according to the complaint.

G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs. According to the complaint, G.R.R. was held for six weeks in the Aurora Detention Center.

None has a “criminal” record, the complaint maintained.

The Trump administration has said its operations target criminal aliens and, specifically, “the worst of the worst.”

As previously reported by The Denver Gazette, federal agents from a joint operation that included the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), ICE and the FBI earlier this year appear to have largely carried out immigration raids with limited judicial oversight.

DEA agents executed two judicial search warrants at a property, according to Steffan Tubbs, a spokesperson for the DEA’s Rocky Mountain Field Division. More apartments than that, however, were breached that day.

In the days following the Feb. 5 raid, The Denver Gazette submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to ICE, DEA and the FBI seeking copies of the warrants used to justify the forced entry into private residences.

After touting the immigration raids on social media, both the DEA and FBI have refused to release the warrants, citing what’s called a “Glomar” denial — a response that allows agencies to neither confirm nor deny the records exist.

One of the individuals represented in the lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Colorado was detained as part of the Feb. 5 raids, which included the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora, one of three said to have been overtaken by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).

Authorities have said TdA gang members have been involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering, extortion and human trafficking.

The organization has an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 members, according to Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist.

Trump cited the gang during a campaign stop in Colorado, in which he unveiled his plan to crack down on immigrants unlawfully staying in the U.S. and who have been found to be guilty of violent crimes or facing such charges.

“We are a country under tremendous distress” Trump said at a campaign stop in Aurora last year. “We will send elite squads from ICE to deport every single gang member.”

Roughly 600 miles from the southern border with Mexico, Denver hasn’t always been the magnet for immigrants that it became three years ago when the Mile High City began to see an influx.

In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver. About half, when considering the number of tickets for travel purchased, have stayed.

“I am more than Black, female, and even Conservative,” Badenoch told an overwhelmingly white audience.
In Britain, of course, Farage didn’t swallow up an existing party a la Trump — he forged his movement under its own banner.
Jillian Mortimer, who lost her seat in last year’s Tory wipeout, said Farage’s coalition was just too incoherent to last through a general election.
And when the mainstream parties ask the inevitable “how,” the answer is “by wanting it harder,” Cleverly said.","To say bluntly what was on most every mind here, it’s entirely plausible that Britain, Germany and France are led by far-right nationalist parties by the end of the decade, and it’s not clear the traditional parties and leaders know how to stop it from happening.

But before we consider that jarring future, let’s dip into the past.

In one respect, the Tory conclave had the “It’s a Wonderful Life” feel of an alternative past in the U.S., had Trump lost the primary or general election in 2016 and created his own populist splinter party.

Republicans before 2016 longed for another Reagan, decorating their conferences with his image and even cardboard cutouts, and surely would have continued to do so had Trump not taken over the party. So it was no surprise that Thatcher’s name was emblazoned on one of the conference forums, her dresses and campaign posters were on display and, yes, there was even a cardboard cutout of the Iron Lady.

Even the venue had the air of yesterday, taking place beneath the bones of Manchester’s renovated old central train station.

Swap out ill-fitting suits and missing collar stays for Barbour and tweed and this could have been a CPAC or RNC meeting in a world where Trump doesn’t define the modern Republican Party.

Beyond the nostalgia for what was — and airbrushing out of more recent, inconvenient party leaders — the Conservative leaders and rhetoric reflected the course Republicans surely would have taken had Trump walked. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch used her speech on the conference’s opening day to denounce identity politics from both flanks, Labour on their left, and the right-wing party that’s supplanted the Tories: Nigel Farage’s Reform.

“I am more than Black, female, and even Conservative,” Badenoch told an overwhelmingly white audience. “I am British, conference, I am British, as we all are.”

It doesn’t require much imagination to envision a Nikki Haley or Marco Rubio delivering their version of that same speech as they jockeyed to lead a non-Trump GOP after 2016.

Yet it’s what Badenoch said next that illustrates how desperate Conservatives here are to catch up with Farage’s Reform, which has made a hardline on migration its calling card. In Britain, of course, Farage didn’t swallow up an existing party a la Trump — he forged his movement under its own banner.

“Yes, Britain is a multiracial country,” Badenoch said. “That is part of our modern story. But it must never become a multicultural country where shared values dissolve, loyalty fragments and we foment the home-grown terrorism we saw on the streets of Manchester this week.”

Badenoch was alluding to the terrorist attack on a local synagogue on Yom Kippur, a tragedy which prompted a show of security that took longtime conference-goers by surprise. Manchester police wielding long guns were ubiquitous, and one of the officers told me that, until last week, his force hadn’t fired a service weapon in the line of duty for 14 years.

The incident has only accelerated the pressure Conservatives feel to keep pace with Reform here and Trumpism abroad, a task Tories have nobody to blame for but themselves, given the soaring migration that took place on their government’s watch following Brexit. The urgency was made clear on the conference’s opening day when Badenoch explicitly modeled her deportation proposal after ICE and even included a Stephen Miller-level quota by vowing to deport 150,000 migrants a year.

But why would Britons who are animated by immigration support the lite beer version of what Farage is offering when they can vote for full-bodied Reform? More challenging for the Tories in the UK’s multi-party system is that their lurch right isn’t cost-free. While they strain to slow the exodus of hard-liners to Reform by proposing an ICE-style crackdown, they lose more of their moderates to the centrist Liberal Democrats. It’s not hard to grasp why the governing party of the previous 14 years is in danger of not even claiming third today when you see how they’re being eaten away from the middle and far-right.

More to the point, Badenoch can attempt a third way-style criticism of the identity politics of both extremes, but the inescapable fact is that many would-be Conservative voters grow more enamored with right-wing identity politics when somebody named Jihad al-Shamie drives a car into pedestrians outside a synagogue and then stabs Jews celebrating the highest of holy days. And if that wasn’t apparent, then the crowds that racist rabble rouser Tommy Robinson are drawing to his rallies — with Elon Musk cameos! — should make it blazingly obvious. Which is to say nothing of the ever more frequent display of the British flag, a topic of frequent discussion here as some argue it’s being used to sow discord.

The famous former Manchester United footballer, Gary Neville, caused a stir this week by saying “the Union Jack flag being used in a negative fashion is not right” and lamenting the division being “created by angry middle-aged white men, who know exactly what they’re doing.”

Well, one of the middle-aged white men whom Neville clearly had in mind, Farage, emphatically does know what he’s doing. And he responded with a rejoinder video that has already racked up over 1.5 million views on Twitter. The Reform leader said Neville was insulting the sort of Brits who watch the athlete-turned-telecaster on Sky Sports — the same people “who pay his wages” — rather than faulting the real source of division: an “evil, crazed, mad Islamist.”

To say that Farage’s counter-attack on a Man U legend moved more quickly into the British bloodstream than, say, Badenoch vowing to pull Britain out of the European Convention on Human Rights is like saying images of Trump at that McDonald’s drive-thru got more attention than Kamala Harris’s campaign-concluding speech on the Ellipse. In other words, the Tories are using conventional weapons against Farage’s nuclear warheads.

Revealingly, the old guard is trying to mimic some of the same language that has vaulted Farage to the de facto leader of the opposition.

When The Guardian reported that top shadow minister, Robert Jenrick, had complained that he “didn’t see another white face” when he visited an area in Birmingham, lamenting he didn’t want to live in such a country, one of his Conservative colleagues defended him. “We’re a majority white country,” said Claire Coutinho, a shadow minister whose parents were Indian immigrants. “If you walk through an area and don’t see a single white face, it is a sign that integration has failed.”

Privately, Tories sound a lot like those less-than-MAGA Republicans explaining that, look, voters want this from us. As one Conservative told my colleagues this week, “The Overton Window has shifted” on immigration.

Yet that doesn’t mean they’re fully comfortable with the shift.

Sitting for separate interviews in the POLITICO Pub during the conference, two of the party’s most prominent shadow ministers shied away from the ICE comparison when it was posed directly to them.

“The way they do their border security is for them,” said shadow housing secretary James Cleverly, alluding to Americans.

“America’s model is very different,” said Priti Patel, the shadow foreign secretary.

Interviews with former members of Parliament turned up more hope than much of a plan. Farage wasn’t offering realistic solutions and, once faced with the real prospect of him as prime minister, surely Britons wouldn’t elect such a character — right?

“The big problem that Reform has is that, while they can definitely benefit from exasperation with the whole scene of the moment, by the time we come to the next election, it’ll be a job of work to do, and I don’t think that they will have demonstrated that they either have the team or the ability necessary given the scale of the challenge,” Michael Gove, the former minister in a series of Conservative governments, told me.

Jillian Mortimer, who lost her seat in last year’s Tory wipeout, said Farage’s coalition was just too incoherent to last through a general election.

“They’ve got left-wing labourites supporting socialist economic policies and those on the far-right because of immigration,” said Mortimer.

To my ear, after 10 years of watching Trump, it all sounded quite familiar.

The most realistic assessment was the one that Democrats in the U.S. should pay heed to: that the only way to defuse populism is for traditional parties to show an interest in and aptitude for the issues voters want addressed. And for all the talk about making the economy work again, voters here couldn’t be clearer that it is identity (and therefore immigration) that they’re focused on.

If Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer is able to bring order to the immigration process, that could drain some of the energy out of an issue that right now would vault Farage to Number 10.

“It depends on whether this government can make any progress,” is how Mark Harper put it when I asked him if immigration would be as central in the next general election, likely in 2029, as it is now.

As he pulled a frothy, pre-noon brew from the POLITICO Pub tap, Cleverly, who lost on the final ballot to be party leader in the Tories’ general election defeat last year, acknowledged that “disillusionment in the public is a real problem” across western democracies.

There is, he said, “this real desire for simple answers to complicated questions,” and populist parties like Reform here or the AFD in Germany or the National Rally in France are offering simple answers.

And when the mainstream parties ask the inevitable “how,” the answer is “by wanting it harder,” Cleverly said. “But wanting it harder, mate, is not a policy. That’s where it falls down.”

Looming over the conference — the demanding Ghost of Christmas Present to Thatcher’s inviting Ghost of Christmas Past — was Farage.

And his answer to the proceedings, to Cleverly and company’s demand for hard answers and specifics, was succinct.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fc9%2F8f%2Fcfae60cc43329d049cbf09bffed9%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2239929394,N,,2025-10-10 11:59:55.505580

The order went into effect just hours before the Merlos family were scheduled to board a flight.
Only when its hands were tied by the court did the government move to release Jackie’s kids.
The Merlos children, she says, “are strong, really, smart, confident kids, which is a tribute to how they’ve been raised.
Attached to a mirror are family photos of the Merlos children from the before times, clinging affectionately to their parents.","Jackie and her kids had been missing for four days.

When Mimi Lettunich, a family friend with powerful social connections in Portland, Oregon, learned of their disappearance, she spared no effort to locate the immigrant mother and her four U.S. citizen children.

It would take another eight days — and an unorthodox road trip by a hands-on member of Congress — before the Trump administration would even disclose where it was holding the family. And it would be four days after that before the children were released to Lettunich and set free from conditions likened in a congressional hearing to “psychological torture.”

The story of Jackie Merlos is singular and conscience-shocking. “They literally disappeared her — kept her from due process in the presence of her four U.S. citizen children,” Rep. Maxine Dexter, who serves Portland in Congress, tells Rolling Stone. But her experience is also emblematic of the full-throttle mass-deportation machinery put into motion by the Trump administration. “Our government is kidnapping people,” Dexter says, “and holding them in incredibly inhumane situations.”

The Merlos family nightmare began, ironically, with a hug, at Peace Arch Park.

Kenia Jackeline “Jackie” Merlos is the mother of four children under the age of 10. Although she arrived undocumented from Honduras more than two decades ago, Jackie was a model non-citizen, with a pending U-visa, a work permit, and no criminal record. She and her husband Carlos own a small business in Portland. Jackie had been the worship director in her church.

For the Merlos family, early summer was a season of reunion: Jackie’s parents had flown to the United States on valid tourist visas. With her mom, Juana, and her four kids, Jackie drove from Portland to the U.S.-Canada border for the afternoon of June 28 to have a picnic with Jackie’s sister, Flor, and her family, legal residents of Canada.

Peace Arch Park sits astride the border, near Vancouver. Maintained by both British Columbia and Washington state, the park doesn’t have a clearly delineated boundary between the two countries, and it has long functioned as a neutral space for cross-border reunions and international exchange. (During the pandemic, cross-border lovers canoodled in the park without attending to international quarantine controls.)

Editor’s picks

The Merlos family picnic took a devastating turn when Flor was giving goodbye hugs to her relatives. The family was intercepted by Customs and Border Patrol agents, who claimed Flor had crossed illegally into the United States. The CPB agents took the whole clan into custody. A spokesperson for CBP told Rolling Stone in a statement that its agents “arrested Kenia Jackeline Merlos at Peace Arch Park as she attempted to smuggle illegal aliens into the United States.”

To Jackie’s advocates, this notion is nonsense. Jackie’s father and her husband, Carlos, had remained in Portland because there wasn’t room in the family car for more passengers. “If you’re smuggling somebody, you’re certainly not bringing your four young children and your elderly mother,” Lettunich tells Rolling Stone.

The government never brought smuggling charges against anyone. Flor and her kids were soon released back to Canada. Jackie’s mother Juana, despite her tourist visa, was transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility. But Jackie and her four children disappeared into off-the-grid federal custody, while the Trump administration attempted to speed-run their removal from the United States.

The family remained hidden from friends, a lawyer hired on their behalf, and even Rep. Dexter, who made it a mission to physically track down her missing constituents. In the meantime, Carlos, the children’s father, was also seized and detained by ICE. This story has been pieced together from congressional and court documents, interviews with Dexter and Lettunich, as well as comment from CPB.

The mistreatment of the Merlos family — and in particular the citizen children — offers context for why the ICE building in Portland has become a hotspot of local protest, and a focal point for Donald Trump’s militarized crackdown on dissent.

At a moment when anti-immigrant hysteria affects the highest levels of our national government, likely hundreds if not thousands of similar stories are unfolding outside of public scrutiny, as law abiding immigrants and even their citizen children are being torn from the fabric of their communities and unjustly exiled from America.

Mimi Lettunich runs a creative agency and lives in a wooded, modernist home in Portland’s prosperous West Hills, where she invited Rolling Stone for an interview in late September. She had known Jackie and Carlos for nearly 20 years; the couple’s firm had done work on a remodel of Lettunich’s home, and the two women became fast friends. “Jackie and I are like sisters,” she says.

When Jackie and her children were first detained, Lettunich had been out of town attending to a death in the family. She returned home July 2 to news that her friends were missing. “I talked to Carlos that evening,” Lettunich recalls. For the Merlos family, the nightmare was about to widen. “By the next morning he was taken,” she says of Carlos, by federal immigration agents.

The following days, encompassing the 4th of July holiday, were a blur. “We started calling everybody we could. We got an attorney. We got some national groups involved. And we started navigating the chaos of the immigration system,” Lettunich says. “Make a phone call. Somebody tells you to call somebody else. You call — it’s a dead end. It’s very challenging. I feel horrible for people that don’t have other resources,” she says. “How they’re finding their loved ones has gotta be just a nightmare.”

The days ticked by. Jackie and her children didn’t turn up through any of the online locator tools maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. Lettunich reached out to Rep. Dexter through a mutual friend to see if the congresswoman — newly elected in 2024 — could help.

Dexter was all in. The freshman legislator is a medical doctor who has carved out a lane in Congress fighting for the due process rights of immigrants. Earlier this year she joined a congressional delegation that traveled to El Salvador demanding the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia from that nation’s foul gulag.

But even a member of Congress couldn’t get a straight answer from the Trump administration. “Nothing from CBP or ICE was helpful,” Dexter tells Rolling Stone. “They’re like, ‘We don’t know where they are. Maybe they’re in Blaine or Ferndale,’” she says, naming Washington state cities with immigrant detention facilities.

On Thursday, July 10, Dexter decided to take matters into her own hands. “Carrie, my chief, and I just got in the car, and we’re like, ‘We’re gonna go try to find them.’” As the congresswoman headed north, she and her staff were still gathering information, and leading a loose caravan up the interstate. “Mimi was a couple hours behind us.”

Dexter zeroed in on CPB lockups, because few ICE centers can hold children and they’re not supposed to hold U.S. citizens. By policy, CPB facilities are only supposed to hold detainees for 12 hours. “But it’s not illegal to do longer than that,” Dexter says. “And because Jackie was refusing to separate from her children, they couldn’t send her to an ICE facility. So they were caught in this sort of no man’s land, literally, near the border.”

Late in that afternoon, Dexter and her crew pulled up at the CPB facility in Ferndale, outside Bellingham, Washington, well north of Seattle. “We literally rang the bell. I said, ‘I’m Congresswoman Maxine Dexter. I’m here looking for a family.” The representative was told she’d have to wait for the arrival of the facility supervisor. Dexter persisted: “Can you just tell us if we’re in the right place? And he was like, ‘Yes, you are.’”

“That’s the first time somebody was recognizing that they had custody of these kids and their mom,” she says.

Dexter alone was allowed to enter the lockup, without her phone, to see where her constituents were jailed. “It’s a windowless cell to the outside,” she recalls. “But there’s a soundproof glass window that the guards can look through. There’s no privacy at all. The lights go on and off all night long.” The cell had a toilet, a “tiny sink,” and a cement bench. “They were the only people at this detention facility. They don’t have food facilities, they don’t have shower facilities. It is not meant for long term detention.” The conditions looked dismal: “There were a few mats on the floor and a couple blankets,” Dexter says. “They had been there 12 days at that point.”

The member of Congress wasn’t allowed to communicate with Jackie. She could only wave, as the mother sat on the floor with her children, praying. “Jackie had no idea who I was, or that we were trying to help her. She didn’t know if her family knew where they were. This is happening on our watch,” Dexter says. “With our taxpayer dollars.”

Attempting to talk sense into the officials in the scene, Dexter objected to the jailing of the Merlos children, insisting: “They didn’t do anything wrong. You can’t just detain them.” The officials countered that Jackie wouldn’t let herself be separated. “Would you?” Dexter shot back. “You don’t know if you’ll ever get to see your kids again.”

“I’m a mother,” she tells Rolling Stone during an interview from her district office in a federal building in Portland. “I wouldn’t agree to have my kids removed from me either.”

Locating Jackie and the children didn’t end the drama. Federal authorities were still attempting to rush the family out of the country. Dexter had arrived on a Thursday, and stayed overnight in a hotel. The next day she presented again at the facility with Jackie’s attorney. But the family was already being moved around by federal authorities, who were pressing forward with a plan to remove Jackie and the kids from the country. “They put them in a van and went to Portland to go try to find the paperwork that they needed to get them passports,” Dexter says.

The government claimed that Jackie had signed an order for voluntary removal — but would not produce that paperwork, even for Dexter. The children didn’t have passports, and to obtain them the government needed their father’s consent. Jackie’s team soon learned the government had taken pictures of the children to the ICE detention center in Tacoma where Carlos was being held, and had him sign documents verifying these were his offspring. “They showed him photos of each of his kids, and said, ‘Is this your child? Yes? Sign this form,’” says Dexter. “It was the form to get them passports.”

For Jakie’s advocates, it was time to pull out all the stops. Dexter dressed down the Congressional Affairs liaison for CBP, warning him that effectuating the involuntary removal of four American citizens would be an “enormous illegal maneuver, and I, as a member of Congress, will not stand silent on that.” Simultaneously, Jackie’s lawyer filed a request for a temporary restraining order in federal court to block Jackie and her children from leaving the country.

That restraining order came through Monday morning, with the judge detailing that Jackie had been “serially re-located and denied contact with counsel” in ruling to block her removal from the court’s jurisdiction. The order went into effect just hours before the Merlos family were scheduled to board a flight.

Only when its hands were tied by the court did the government move to release Jackie’s kids. “I got a call the day we got the TRO,” Lettunich recalls. “They say, ‘We have the Merlos children. Would you like to come get them?” It was the first time the idea had been floated, and suddenly the government was behaving, Lettunich says, as if the children had just wrapped up a play date. “Come get them.” Lettunich rushed to the pickup at SeaTac airport. ”I still didn’t get to see Jackie, but we picked up four children — with four new passports.”

Rolling Stone reached out to the Department of Homeland Security with a detailed list of questions about the Merlos family’s experience. A CPB spokesperson responded with a brief emailed statement about Jackie: “At her request, her children initially remained with her in CBP custody. She is now in ICE custody, and formal removal proceedings are underway.” The statement adds: “For clarity, DHS does not deport U.S. citizens. In cases involving minors, parents are given the choice to accompany their children during removal proceedings, or alternatively, to have the children placed with a designated guardian of the parent’s choosing.”

In the car with Lettunich, the kids revealed a secret. “Mimi, Mom wrote you a note.” One of the children had left the facility with a coloring book provided by the feds. On the first page was a handwritten note to Lettunich offering thanks and parenting pointers — asking that the kids be careful near the swimming pool and noting an upcoming orthodontist appointment. “I will miss my babies. Please take care of them. This is so hard,” Jackie wrote, adding: “We are on God’s hand.”

Lettunich and her husband were aspiring empty nesters. “I have two boys. They’re both drinking age,” she says. In her mid 50s, Lettunich has now been vaulted back into caregiving for nine-year-old triplets — two boys and a girl — and one younger brother, seven. The children share a bedroom, and have the run of the lower floor of the Lettunich home, which has a basketball hoop and a life-size sculpture of a bull by the covered pool.

Debriefing the children from the traumatic experience of their incarceration, Lettunich learned that they had been questioned by federal agents, away from their mother. She testified to this in an unsworn “shadow” congressional hearing held by Democrats in Washington D.C. in mid-September. Lettunich denounced “the state sponsored abuse the children endured.” As she described it, “Agents interrogated the children without Jackie. They were asked: Where did they live? Did they have any money? Did they have relatives? Did they have a father? Shortly thereafter, ICE took their dad,” Lettunich said. “The children believed that was their fault.”

Jackie is now being held in an ICE facility where she can be reached by phone and is an active part of the children’s parenting. “They talk every day,” says Lettunich. The Merlos children, she says, “are strong, really, smart, confident kids, which is a tribute to how they’ve been raised. That said,” she adds, “they’re in trauma. They’re seeing a psychologist. A couple of them have night constant nightmares.”

The four children have their clothes and possessions organized in a tidy series of bins with their names on them, spaced throughout their bedroom, and on shelves in the closet. Attached to a mirror are family photos of the Merlos children from the before times, clinging affectionately to their parents.

Here is also taped a handwritten note from Jackie to her children, in Spanish, decorated with an array of small pink hearts. “Pardon me for not being there,” it reads, promising the children that she is saving up all the hugs and little kisses she has not been able to give them directly. “What’s happening to us won’t last a lifetime,” Jackie adds. “I only ask, my children, that you be patient and that we trust in God that the best is yet to come.”

Jackie has so far been denied release, and her next court date is October 14. After weeks in detention, her mother, Juana, was finally set free in late September, telling The Oregonian: “I’m so traumatized that I have nightmares that I’m still there.” As detailed on the family’s Go Fund Me page, Carlos lost his own hearing in early October. Lettunich tells Rolling Stone he was deported to Honduras on October 7. “It’s hard to be optimistic,” she admits.

Dexter holds up the Merlos family story against the promises of Trump and his administration to to target violent offenders and drug dealers for deportation. “This story is so egregious and so cruel — and so clearly not what the American people thought Donald Trump was going to be doing,” she says. “He said he was going after the ‘worst of the worst’ — and cleaning up crime and getting fentanyl out of our communities.”

When helicopters descended on a Chicago apartment building last week with federal agents kitted out in military gear, locals saw a terrifying escalation in the federal government’s incursion into Chicago.

Department of Homeland Security officials saw a cinematic opportunity for a “Call of Duty”-style recruiting video with images from helmet cameras and dramatic music.

Flush with money from Republicans in Congress and on a hiring spree, Immigration and Customs Enforcement needs to recruit a lot of people.

It also wants to send a message to immigrants, as it did with a more traditional international ad campaign earlier this year. The message is stay out of the US and leave if you’re here.

From the DHS side of the camera lens, there are videos like the one with the hunting or military-style tag line “Bag it. Tag it. Take it down,.”

The behind-the-scenes versions are on CCTV, like this post from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute immigration expert David Bier, a critic of the administration, that shows agents, with a masked photographer in tow, sprinting after unidentified men who had been drinking coffee on the corner.

These videos borrow from the wartime Uncle Sam posters of yore to call for recruits as it has relaxed standards, waiving age requirements and offering a $50,000 signing bonus to bring in new people. And its videos might be intended to entice a certain type of young adult into the federal service.

At the same time, the underlying events behind the videos today could be traumatizing kids, including US citizens, who find themselves on the business end of raids.

“Imagine being a child wakened in the middle of the night by a Blackhawk helicopter on your roof,” said Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker at a news conference on Tuesday, as he complained about federal agents arriving with camera crews in tow.

Not the first propaganda films

The videos also dovetail with a long line of US government wartime propaganda efforts, albeit with a harder edge than Rosie the Riveter. During World War II, the Hollywood director Frank Capra produced a series of “Why We Fight” films in order to boost morale and instill loyalty.

The DHS videos, by contrast, are focused on action inside the US instead of protecting the country from foreign threats.

The videos also make questions about deploying the National Guard in US cities beside the point. There’s already a militarized force on the ground.

CNN Senior National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem said there is nothing strange about law enforcement recording their activities. Some jurisdictions in fact require the use of body cams. But these videos are different, she said.

“They do not look like police videos,” said Kayyem, who was assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs during the Obama administration. “They look like campaign ones.”

Rather than serve a policing purpose, Kayyem said, the videos seem more designed to “scare communities, pretend like they are fighting a dangerous threat, or, as I suspect, to be used in GOP campaigns.”

When the government trolls

DHS doesn’t just post action movie-style content. It also trolls critics who don’t like the image of masked agents arresting people without warrants in American streets.

When the country singer Zach Bryan published a snippet of a song that seemed to criticize ICE for kicking down people’s doors with the tag line, “the fading of the Red White and Blue,” DHS clapped back at the US Navy veteran by using another one of his songs, “All Night Revival,” as the soundtrack for a montage of its raids.

Bryan has since clarified that he falls on neither of the “radical sides” of the political aisle.

“Everyone using this now as a weapon is only proving how devastatingly divided we all are,” he said in an Instagram story. “We need to find our way back.”

“Please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos”

The DHS social media effort is hip to the social media age, loaded up with guns, “Cops”-style arrests, fit-looking agents in combat gear, and knowing jokes.

One video took out of a context a comment by the comedian and manosphere podcaster Theo Von, who was recorded by a fan saying, “Heard you got deported dude, bye.”

That snippet was used by DHS as the punchline of another video. In his own social media post, Von asked the government to take it down.

“Please keep me out of your ‘banger’ deportation videos,” Von said on X. “When it comes to immigration my thoughts and heart are alot more nuanced than this video allows. Bye!”

Surely the Von controversy only got more eyeballs on the video. A video featuring hard-hitting arrests over the Pokémon theme also got attention. The US government did not seek permission to use the theme, according to Pokémon.

Who is being arrested and deported?

The videos make use of the conservative media ecosystem by tapping influencers for ridealongs.

One recent video shared by the conservative content creator Benny Johnson showed DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, apparently talking to a man she identified as a pedophile, driving home the government allegation that they are first targeting criminals for deportation.

But the man being arrested was not identified, making it impossible to verify the story.

When DHS posted a release identifying the “worst of the worst” of the undocumented immigrants arrested in Portland, alleging they were hardened criminals and pedophiles, some of the names did not have Oregon or federal cases associated with their names. Others had recently been in prison, serving sentences.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

Their allegations about detainees must be verified, however — especially after allegations about Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador for a time earlier this year, turned out to be overstated.

Abrego Garcia is back in the US and the government has charged him with human smuggling, a charge a federal judge said recently may have been brought out of vindictiveness.

Stars of the genre

Abrego Garcia was initially taken to a supermax prison in El Salvador, a place that seems designed to go viral for its harshness, as CNN’s David Culver documented.

The initial transfer of deportees to that prison was the subject of multiple US government videos.

Noem is a frequent star of government deportation videos, including a trip to the El Salvador prison, after which critics accused her of playing to cameras.

Another star of DHS videos is Gregory Bovino, the border patrol chief leading efforts on the ground in Chicago.

During an interview for a recent profile, CNN’s Priscilla Alvarez asked him about the videos and social media strategy. Bovino argued they are “so real life they appear to be Hollywood.”

“You think it’s a Hollywood video? That’s real life”

The full exchange is interesting:

ALVAREZ: What is the message you want people to take from the videos and your general presence on, for example, X?

BOVINO: Transparency. Uh, I think the public sometimes doesn’t get transparency. We can go back to that reporter that misquoted me. That wasn’t transparent. That was agenda-driven. This is not agenda-driven. Our social media is designed to give the public a snapshot, a real-time snapshot of what is really happening, whether it’s on the border, or now in Los Angeles and or Chicago, what’s really happening. So they can take a look at that social media, those social media pages, and they’re getting an accurate snapshot of what’s happening. Now you might say, “Hey, that’s Hollywood. That looks like Hollywood.” Well, you know …

ALVAREZ: It’s highly produced.

BOVINO: Well, you know, it’s actually produced — there are Border Patrol agents that produce that. Those are border patrol agents that have learned their craft. Border Patrol agents right off the line — and they learn their craft — that are producing those, but you think it’s a Hollywood video? That’s real life. It might be so real life that it appears to be Hollywood, but a lot of that is real time.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-10-03t160559z-680349489-rc2d4hatbfze-rtrmadp-3-usa-trump-chicago-20251009210438411.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-10 12:00:35.017488

At a low-rent apartment complex on Chicago’s south shore, people started hearing the boots hit the roof around one in the morning. The oh-dark-thirty immigration enforcement raid in the early hours of 1 October featured an air assault from helicopters. Officers went door to door in the building, using charges to blow the hinges off doors and flashbang grenades to clear apartments. They hauled men, women and children from the building in zip ties and often little else, ostensibly to capture undocumented gang members.

The troubled apartment building at 7500 S South Shore Drive hadn’t passed an annual inspection since 2022. With the remains of doors and furniture and the bloodied, scattered belongings of former tenants in tatters, it may struggle to pass another.

“So many of these people remain without shelter or a place to live because it essentially rendered their homes and that entire apartment complex uninhabitable,” said Colleen Connell, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois. She described the apartment raid as a military-style attack. Days afterward, the building looked like a war zone, which may be the point.

Addressing an assembly of high-ranking military officers last week, Donald Trump in impromptu comments called for the military to use American cities as “training grounds for our military”. The comment was a continuation of his belligerence toward cities full of Democratic voters and nonwhite populations, delivered a couple of weeks after he meme-posted an image cribbed from the war movie Apocalypse Now about going to “war” in Chicago.

For those on the receiving end of federal force from masked agents in military fatigues, a flashbang grenade thrown by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agent or a soldier may be a distinction without a difference.

Mónica Solórzano was standing next to the mayor of Carpinteria, a farm town in southern California, watching Ice raid a marijuana farm when a flashbang grenade went off at her feet.

“The canister flashed and made a loud explosive sound, like a firecracker. The noise hurt my ears,” she wrote in a deposition for a suit filed by the Los Angeles Press Club in July, seeking an injunction against attacks on the press, protesters and observers there during the administration’s immigration enforcement surge. “When the flashbang detonated, the people around me started screaming and running. I fell to the ground and thought I was going to be trampled.”

Solórzano, a Carpinteria city council member, was one of dozens of witnesses who described homeland security officers wearing military-style fatigues, using armored personnel carriers and military equipment as they rolled through communities as part of Ice’s surge.

Flashbang grenades are standard tools for clearing a room when soldiers conduct military operations on urban terrain. But the use of them by civilian police officers has been sharply curtailed, with many jurisdictions banning them entirely.

“The use of flash-bang or stun grenades for crowd control is an example of the inappropriate, inadequately regulated use of military weapons for crowd management,” wrote California physician Rohini J Haar, offering expert testimony for the LA Press Club suit. “While the stated objective of stun grenades is to cause disorientation and a temporary sense of panic, the potential for severe blast injuries and even death caused by the pressure of the blast or by shrapnel from the fragmentation of plastic and metal constituents of the grenade is disproportionately high. The blinding light and deafening sound they produce can also cause injuries indiscriminately.”

Haar is the author of Lethal in Disguise: The Health Consequences of Crowd-Control Weapons, a report cataloguing deaths from flashbang use.

Federal agents used flashbang grenades both to disperse crowds of protesters in California in July, and as room-clearing munitions on the raid on an apartment building in Chicago last week.

“Treating a US city like a war zone is intolerable,” wrote a group of eight Democratic lawmakers on the US House homeland security committee, asking the Department of Homeland Security to produce arrest or search warrants for the operation, arrest figures, confirmation of anyone they claim was a member of Tren de Aragua, and a justification for the “heavy-handed” tactics employed. “Please detail why helicopters were needed for this operation,” they asked. “Which agency provided the helicopters and agents manning them?”

DHS has not responded to their questions, nor to those of the Guardian.

Gil Kerlikowske, former commissioner of Customs and Border Protection and former Seattle police chief, reviewed the testimony offered in support of the LA Press Club suit, concluding that DHS had regularly engaged in excessive use of force.

“Some of the agencies involved have no responsibility for urban crowd control, such as Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which is an investigative agency within DHS, that typically does fraud investigations and human trafficking investigations,” Kerlikowske wrote in an affidavit. “Similarly, the Special Response Team (SRT) is a tactical unit with DHS that is part of CBP Office of Field Operations that executes dangerous warrants. It also provided security for me, when I was head of CBP. These officers are not accustomed to policing urban civil unrest; nor are they trained to do so.”

A preliminary injunction was granted last month barring LA police from arresting journalists and limiting their use of force.

Even without reference to the use of national guard troops and equipment in support of enforcing the law – a proposition by Trump that federal courts have rejected multiple times this year – the use of military equipment and military tactics like armored vehicles, Black Hawk helicopters, Predator drones and military weapons by civilian law enforcement in the administration has drawn notice and condemnation.

The police agencies of large cities have experience with street protests, and the crowd-control tactics permitted to those agencies are often the result of arduous, deeply argued policy debates by locally elected leaders.

That’s not what Chicago is seeing on the ground.

“What we have seen in particular is the shooting of projectiles, so-called nonlethal rounds, at protesters and at members of the press,” said Connell of the ACLU. “Rather than shooting at the ground, we’ve seen actual incidents of protesters and the press being hit by those projectiles. … We’ve seen an exacerbation of the sort of display of military-style equipment and tactics, whether it’s an armored vehicle with an armed, masked, camouflaged Ice agent or other federal law enforcement agent atop the turret, armed with heavy military-style equipment.”

Journalists from Block Club Chicago, the Chicago Headline Club and other press organizations filed suit Monday in federal court, seeking an injunction against the federal government for actions against journalists outside the Broadview Ice facility. Four of Block Club’s journalists were “indiscriminately shot with pepper-spray bullets and tear-gassed by federal agents” while covering the raid. The lawsuit is an attempt to bar federal agents from, among other things, indiscriminately using chemical weapons against journalists asserting their first amendment right to report.

While federal agencies could fly a helicopter in for a raid on an apartment building in Chicago, many civilians in the Windy City have been locked out of their drones for two weeks.

Citing “special security reasons”, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a 12-day-long ban on drone flights by anyone without a special commercial operating exemption across a 15-nautical-mile radius around the Ice facility near Chicago. As a practical matter, it denies anyone except news stations with a helicopter from observing federal operations from the air. Practiced drone operators – and journalists – have little experience with this kind of airspace control.

“I’ve had a drone license basically with the FAA for almost as long as that program has existed – at least eight years – and I’ve never seen anything like that before,” said Adam Rose, press rights chair of the LA Press Club and deputy director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. “They’re trying to basically take their militarization techniques to the sky. They’re trying to keep the enemy out of the sky, the enemy being anyone who is observing them.”

Rose notes that the no-fly space above Los Angeles during the protests earlier this year was 900 times smaller than Chicago, but that DHS filled that airspace with Predator drones drawn from the border to surveil crowds.

“It doesn’t matter what uniform they wear, whether they are federal agents or troops, they are bound by the constitution,” said Hina Shamsi, director of the ACLU’s National Security Project. “People need to know that if any member of the federal force violates their rights, they need to be held accountable”.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb0b612c25ad32d87969d7a66d8df2faac2b9bfc/621_0_6211_4971/master/6211.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=47ad2d558c9cb006e34498ec9ec699fd",N,,2025-10-10 11:59:47.648965

Why it matters: In recent days, Trump has ordered National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago over the objections of local city officials — and he's steadily ramped up immigration raids around the country since taking office.

Zoom in: The Seattle Police Department ""will maintain functional independence"" should federal troops arrive in the city, and ""not act at the direction of the National Guard or federal authorities,"" according to the first executive order signed by Harrell Wednesday.

Seattle police will ""report daily"" to the mayor on the known actions of any deployed federal troops, the order adds.

It also creates a city task force aimed at preparing for troops to arrive, while directing Seattle officials to ready a lawsuit to challenge any such deployment.

What they're saying: ""As we've seen in Portland and now Chicago, President Trump is unilaterally ramping up his military occupation of American cities,"" Harrell said during a press conference.

""He is showing no respect for the rule of law,"" Harrell said. ""We are ready to fight in court.""

The order also addresses possible protests against federal troops, saying the city ""shall offer to work with organizers to keep protests peaceful"" and ""minimize the potential for conflict.""

In the other executive order, Harrell pledges to submit an ordinance to the City Council banning federal civil immigration enforcement activities on city property.

The mayor will also propose an ordinance to ban the use of face masks by federal law enforcement agents, the order says, citing recent ""warrantless arrests and detentions by masked and un-uniformed individuals"" under the Trump administration.

Between the lines: ""We'll continue to build trust and transparency to ensure that our immigrant and refugee communities continue to see Seattle as a true welcoming city,"" Hamdi Mohamed, director of Seattle's Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs, told reporters.

That will involve regularly requesting information about federal immigration enforcement actions in Seattle, to help ""identify any patterns of bias and overreach,"" per Harrell's order.

G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs.
In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver.","The ACLU of Colorado has sued the Trump administration, alleging that Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials carried out unlawful, warrantless arrests as part of a broad effort to detain immigrants living in the United States without legal status.

The lawsuit was brought on behalf of a legal permanent resident, a “Dreamer” brought to the country as a child, and an asylum seeker, all of whom have lived in the country for more than a decade.

A “dreamer” is a colloquial term for an immigrant who was brought illegally to the United States as a child and is eligible for protection from deportation under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunction relief.

“They are going door-to-door, sweeping apartment parking lots, and confronting residents and neighbors walking near their homes or jobs,” the complaint claimed, referring to immigration agents. “They are pulling over workers and college students going about their daily lives. ICE agents are then arresting Latino people without warrants, without probable cause, and without assessing legal status and flight risk as required by law.”

Since assuming office in January, President Donald Trump has embarked on a mass deportation effort, a key campaign promise. That effort has drawn lawsuits.

Federal data suggest that arrests have more than doubled since the spring, according to TRAC Immigration at Syracuse University.

Nearly 60,000 people across the United States were being detained in August.

To make a dent in the 14 million immigrants estimated to be living illegally in the U.S. — according to the Pew Research Center — House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller instructed ICE in June to make 3,000 arrests a day.

That’s up from the 650 arrests a day in the first five months of Trump’s second term.

ICE agents arrested nearly 2,000 people in Colorado alone in the first half of the year, according to the complaint.

“There’s no realistic way ICE can meet their quota numbers without breaking the law,” said Hans Meyer, a Denver immigration attorney.

Meyer represents the four immigrants named in the suit.

Meyer added: “They’re not going to change unless a court steps in and makes them change.”

Supporters of the immigration crackdown said they trust that federal immigration agents are following the law.

In an earlier interview, Aurora City Councilwoman Danielle Jurinsky said she was aware of at least one person detained and later released on bond by ICE at Whispering Pines, one of three troubled apartment complexes owned by CBZ Management, which nabbed headlines last year over the activities of a Venezuelan gang that gained a foothold in metro Denver.

Jurinsky said she doesn’t believe federal agents have acted inappropriately.

“If they are doing things without judicial oversight, that would be concerning to me,” Jurinsky said. “I have to trust that they are; that they are doing things the right way.”

Meanwhile, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, had noted ICE can lawfully enter if given consent or under other legal authorities, including criminal warrants, administrative code inspections or exigent circumstances.

“I would be shocked if ICE were attempting to forcibly enter private residences on an administrative warrant,” Matthew O’Brien, FAIR deputy executive director said in an email to The Denver Gazette, in reference to questions about the warrants used in Colorado.

The ACLU’s complaint relies on national media outlets that have reported a change from “targeted and investigation-based operations” to the administration encouraging “immigration agents to ‘turn the creative knob up to 11’ when it comes to enforcement including through arrests collateral to anyone actually identified in a warrant.”

The roughly 200,000 immigrants living unlawfully in Colorado “now live in fear and at daily risk because of federal immigration agents’ indiscriminate practices,” the complaint said. “ICE’s arrest scheme is tearing families apart and terrorizing communities.”

Two of the plaintiffs — Refugio Ramirez Ovando, a 43-year-old construction worker and Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old University of Utah college student — were pulled over while driving.

In the case of Ramirez, ICE agents pulled him over on May 19 looking for someone else.

Dias was pulled over by a Mesa County Sheriff’s deputy near Fruita on June 5.

J.S.T, a 36-year-old asylum seeker, was detained by ICE agents while pulling out of the parking lot at the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora on Feb. 5, while on his way to work. J.S.T was held in the Aurora Detention Center for four weeks, according to the complaint.

G.R.R., a 32-year-old was arrested on April 27 outside the nightclub raided by federal agents in Colorado Springs. According to the complaint, G.R.R. was held for six weeks in the Aurora Detention Center.

None has a “criminal” record, the complaint maintained.

The Trump administration has said its operations target criminal aliens and, specifically, “the worst of the worst.”

As previously reported by The Denver Gazette, federal agents from a joint operation that included the Rocky Mountain Field Division of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), ICE and the FBI earlier this year appear to have largely carried out immigration raids with limited judicial oversight.

DEA agents executed two judicial search warrants at a property, according to Steffan Tubbs, a spokesperson for the DEA’s Rocky Mountain Field Division. More apartments than that, however, were breached that day.

In the days following the Feb. 5 raid, The Denver Gazette submitted Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to ICE, DEA and the FBI seeking copies of the warrants used to justify the forced entry into private residences.

After touting the immigration raids on social media, both the DEA and FBI have refused to release the warrants, citing what’s called a “Glomar” denial — a response that allows agencies to neither confirm nor deny the records exist.

One of the individuals represented in the lawsuit brought by the ACLU of Colorado was detained as part of the Feb. 5 raids, which included the Whispering Pines Apartment complex in Aurora, one of three said to have been overtaken by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).

Authorities have said TdA gang members have been involved in drug trafficking, kidnapping, money laundering, extortion and human trafficking.

The organization has an estimated 3,000 to 5,000 members, according to Ronna Rísquez, a Venezuelan investigative journalist.

Trump cited the gang during a campaign stop in Colorado, in which he unveiled his plan to crack down on immigrants unlawfully staying in the U.S. and who have been found to be guilty of violent crimes or facing such charges.

“We are a country under tremendous distress” Trump said at a campaign stop in Aurora last year. “We will send elite squads from ICE to deport every single gang member.”

Roughly 600 miles from the southern border with Mexico, Denver hasn’t always been the magnet for immigrants that it became three years ago when the Mile High City began to see an influx.

In the ensuing months, roughly 43,000 immigrants — mostly from South and Central America, particularly Venezuela — came in Denver. About half, when considering the number of tickets for travel purchased, have stayed.

In an analysis published on 1 April 2025, Belgian newspaper Le Soir reported that foreign nationals account for about 43 percent of Belgium’s prison population, though only around 31 percent lack residence rights.

The paper noted that many inmates had valid permits before detention and lost them while serving their sentences, complicating assumptions about who could legally be transferred abroad.

Van Bossuyt argues that convicted offenders without the right to remain in Belgium should serve their sentences outside the country.

""Anyone staying illegally in our country and choosing to commit crimes must leave -- either to their country of origin or to a prison outside Belgium,"" she told Belgian media.

The government argues that transferring even part of this group could ease pressure on domestic facilities while reinforcing its policy of linking migration control with enforcement of criminal judgments.

Balkan option under study

Under the Belgian government's current coalition agreement, any new facility must be located outside the European Union but in a European constitutional state where the rule of law and human-rights standards are respected. An internal feasibility study by the Commissioner-General for Refugees and Stateless Persons concluded that Kosovo and Albania meet those criteria.

The idea draws on the Denmark-Kosovo agreement, under which Copenhagen is renting 300 cells in Gjilan prison for foreign inmates at a cost of about 210 million euros over 10 years. Implementation has been delayed until at least 2027 as Kosovo upgrades the facility to Danish standards.

Belgium also rented space in the Tilburg prison in the Netherlands between 2010 and 2016 to cope with similar shortages, but that arrangement ended amid financial and logistical difficulties.

Legal and human-rights issues

Any foreign-detention plan would have to comply with Belgium’s obligations under the 1983 Strasbourg Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and the EU Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA, both of which require agreement of the states involved and usually of the prisoner.

Existing bilateral treaties with Albania and Kosovo allow only case-by-case transfers. Establishing a prison abroad would therefore require new bilateral agreements and parliamentary approval.

Legal experts and rights advocates warn that moving prisoners outside Belgium could blur accountability. As the sentencing state and a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, Belgium would remain responsible for ensuring detention conditions meet international standards and that inmates have effective access to Belgian courts if their rights are violated.

Both Amnesty International and the Central Monitoring Council have urged the government to strengthen domestic capacity and maintain clear oversight mechanisms if any foreign facility is pursued.

A Justice Ministry briefing reported in Belgian media found that only about 255 cases were legally transferable under existing treaties -- less than 2 percent of the total prison population -- highlighting the limited short-term impact of such schemes.

Afghan returns and migration diplomacy

The prison initiative coincides with a broader tightening of Belgium’s migration policy, particularly concerning returns of irregular migrants and foreign offenders.

On October 3, 2025, Van Bossuyt announced that she would seek European Union support to explore ""technical cooperation"" with the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to confirm the identities of Afghans that Belgium intends to deport.

""At a diplomatic level, we need to look at how to deal pragmatically with the Afghan regime,"" she said in a statement released by her office.

Van Bossuyt said she had discussed the issue with EU Migration Commissioner Magnus Brunner during talks on the implementation of the European Migration Pact, and planned to raise it again at an informal ministerial meeting in Munich on October 4 with counterparts from Germany, France, Denmark, Austria, Poland and the Czech Republic.

According to the Flemish news agency VRT, Afghans remain among the largest groups applying for asylum in Belgium, yet less than half of the applications are approved. Returns and voluntary repatriations have been impossible since 2021 because Belgium has no diplomatic ties with the Taliban.

""This problem is not unique to Belgium,"" the minister’s office stated. ""Solutions for the voluntary and forced return of Afghans must be sought at a European level. For those that have no future in the European Union, the message must be clear: return is the only option.""

Van Bossuyt said she hopes to build a coalition of EU countries to address the European-wide impasse on Afghan deportations.

European and regional context

Several European governments are experimenting with ways to manage migration and detention externally.

In the United Kingdom, Politico reported that Prime Minister Keir Starmer is considering a ""migrant-return hub"" in the Western Balkans, with Kosovo viewed as a possible location for processing failed asylum seekers.

Both the Belgian and British discussions illustrate a shift toward regional partnerships for returns and detention, even as analysts warn that political fragility and foreign influence in the Balkans could complicate implementation.

Next steps

Belgium’s talks with Albania and Kosovo are exploratory; no binding agreements have been signed. A senior Justice Ministry official told The Brussels Times that even under favorable conditions, ""it would take at least three to five years before becoming operational.""

Any future plan will have to balance migration-control objectives with legal obligations and human-rights oversight.

By the numbers: 75% of Latino registered voters in California say President Trump is unfairly targeting everyday undocumented immigrants who are not violent, according to recent polling of 1,200 people by the Latino Community Foundation.

49% are in favor of deporting only undocumented people with a proven criminal record or a warrant for their arrest, while 37% say they don't favor any large-scale deportation policy.

Memphis Mr. Trump announced on Sept. 12 that he would send National Guard troops to Memphis, citing concerns about safety in the city.","President Trump has sent National Guard troops to several American cities, mostly heavily Democratic ones, this year as a way to help protect federal buildings and personnel amid protests against his immigration enforcement tactics and to address what he claims are rampant levels of crime.

Since June, Mr. Trump has sent soldiers — often over the objections of state and local leaders — to cities including Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago, Memphis and Portland, Ore.

The mobilizations represent a departure from the traditional role of the Guard, a state-based military force whose domestic deployments have historically involved humanitarian assistance. And they have prompted lawsuits across the country, several of them accusing the Trump administration of exceeding its legal authority.

Here’s how courts have landed on those cases so far.

Los Angeles

In June, the Trump administration sent nearly 5,000 troops, from both the National Guard and the U.S. Marine Corps, to the Los Angeles area, citing a need to quell protests over immigration raids. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California filed suit on June 9, accusing Mr. Trump of an “unprecedented usurpation of state authority and resources.”

On Sept. 2, Judge Charles R. Breyer of the Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled that the National Guard troops were being used illegally. He wrote that the Trump administration had violated the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that makes it illegal to use federal troops for domestic policing in most circumstances.

The ruling barred the federal government from using troops anywhere in California to engage in “arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, interrogation, or acting as informants.”

Mr. Trump has appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which agreed to pause the district court’s ruling for now, pending a hearing. In the meantime, the Pentagon has withdrawn most of the troops who were sent to Southern California, and Mr. Newsom has asked the court to send them all home.

Portland, Ore.

State and local leaders in Oregon filed suit against the Trump administration on Sept. 28, after it called 200 Oregon National Guard members into Portland. Mr. Trump called the city “war-ravaged” and cited protests against federal immigration raids.

On Oct. 4, a federal judge blocked the mobilization with a temporary restraining order. The judge, Karin Immergut of the U.S. District Court in Oregon, said the president had most likely exceeded his legal authority in calling up the troops. Judge Immergut, a Trump appointee, said the protests “were not significantly violent or disruptive in the days — or even weeks — leading up to the president’s directive.”

Mr. Trump then tried to deploy out-of-state National Guard troops to Portland. In response, Judge Immergut broadened her order to cover “the relocation, federalization or deployment of members of the National Guard of any state or the District of Columbia in the state of Oregon.”

The federal government appealed Judge Immergut’s ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Government lawyers argued that the protests in Portland amounted to a “rebellion” and that courts do not have the power to review the president’s decisions about when to deploy the National Guard.

Three judges from the Ninth Circuit ruled on Wednesday that Oregon National Guard members could stay under federal control until a broader legal ruling was issued, though they left in place a temporary order from Judge Immergut that barred the troops from being deployed. At a hearing on Thursday, the panel appeared to take seriously arguments by the administration’s lawyers that deployment would be legal, and they questioned Judge Immergut’s conclusion that a military presence was not needed.

It is not clear when the court will issue a ruling in the case.

About 200 National Guard troops were brought in from Texas. Earlier in the week, a federal judge declined to immediately block the deployment, setting a hearing in the case for Thursday.

After that hearing, the judge, April M. Perry, temporarily blocked National Guard operations in the area for 14 days. She said that she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois” and that the deployment of troops would “only add fuel to the fire.”

Judge Perry said a full written opinion was likely to be issued on Friday. The Trump administration is likely to appeal.

Washington

The case in Washington, filed earlier this year by Brian Schwalb, the District of Columbia’s attorney general, is a bit different from others.

The District of Columbia does not have a governor — the official who typically approves the use of federal military forces before they can be sent to a state — and the case and arguments over the deployment of National Guard troops there have largely hinged on the Home Rule Act. That law, from 1973, gives the federal government control of the District of Columbia National Guard, while the district is granted local governance rights, such as giving residents the power to elect their own mayor and a local council.

On Aug. 11, Mr. Trump, citing the Home Rule Act, took control of the District of Columbia police for 30 days and mobilized 800 National Guard troops to address what he called a “crime-infested wasteland” in the nation’s capital.

Mr. Schwalb sued the administration over the takeover, saying its actions had exceeded the law and would “sow chaos” in the police force. The case settled after lengthy negotiations in which the U.S. attorney general, Pam Bondi, agreed to allow the city’s police chief to maintain control of her department’s day-to-day operations while taking orders from the mayor. Ms. Bondi directed the mayor to order the Police Department to help with immigration enforcement.

On Sept. 4, Mr. Schwalb filed suit again, this time over the deployment of the troops, whose numbers peaked at about 2,400. He argued that the deployment without the mayor’s consent had violated the U.S. Constitution and Washington’s autonomy under the Home Rule Act.

Mr. Schwalb asked the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to block the deployment. A preliminary hearing for the case is scheduled for Oct. 24.

Memphis

Mr. Trump announced on Sept. 12 that he would send National Guard troops to Memphis, citing concerns about safety in the city. The State of Tennessee, which has a Republican governor, has not filed any legal challenges seeking to block the troops. The soldiers are expected to be deployed in Memphis on Friday.

Building on our client alert, ""Supreme Court Decision Continues Legal Battle Over Birthright Citizenship,"" we also explore how an implementation memo would operate in practice and what clients should anticipate while the Supreme Court considers whether to hear the case.

Recap of Supreme Court Ruling

In its June 27 decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc., the Supreme Court did not address the merits of the birthright citizenship EO ""Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship"". Instead, the Court narrowed the scope of the lower courts' nationwide injunctions that blocked its implementation, limiting them to the parties involved. SCOTUS directed the lower courts to revise their orders ""expeditiously,"" and pushed the EO's effective date back to July 28, 2025. While that date has now passed, subsequent lower court rulings have kept the EO on hold, as discussed below.

Subsequent Court Rulings & The Rise of Class Actions

In July 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld a nationwide preliminary injunction, agreeing that broad relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. This appeal arose from a February 2025 decision by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, which had blocked the EO in a suit brought by a coalition of states: Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington. In doing so, the Ninth Circuit sent a signal of its view on the merits, concluding there is a ""strong likelihood"" that the EO is invalid because it contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment.

Similarly, on October 3, 2025, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the nationwide injunction. The latest appeals court decision marks the fifth federal court since June to either issue or uphold orders blocking the EO.

Throughout the various cases this summer, the Trump Administration indicated that it planned to ask the Supreme Court to take up the question of the constitutionality of birthright citizenship imminently. On Friday, September 26, the Administration did so. Specifically, the Administration cited the ruling by the 9th Circuit, as well as the district court decision in New Hampshire.

The July 25 USCIS Memo

On July 25, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) released a memorandum outlining how the Trump Administration intends to implement its birthright citizenship policy in the event that it prevails in the courts. The memorandum provides new definitions of ""unlawfully present"" and ""lawful but temporary"" presence and specifies which categories of children would no longer be recognized as U.S. citizens at birth: changes that, if implemented, would have sweeping consequences for mixed‑status families, temporary visa holders, and other noncitizen populations.

The USCIS memo does not recognize the U.S. citizenship of certain children whose mother is ""unlawfully present"" or whose mother was present in a ""lawful but temporary"" status if the father is not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of birth. The ""lawful but temporary"" category broadly encompasses most nonimmigrant visa holders, TPS beneficiaries, and Visa Waiver Program entrants, among others.

Potential Impacts of Birthright Citizenship Restriction Policy

The USCIS implementation memo could affect a broad range of temporary visa holders, humanitarian beneficiaries, and mixed-status families. These include, but are not limited to:

A child born to a mother whose nonimmigrant status, such as an H-4, is pending might also have ""pending"" citizenship status.

A child born to an F-1 parent who violated their duration of status (D/S) by unauthorized employment might also be deemed in violation of immigration status and potentially subject to removal.

A child born to parents who applied to adjust status based on an employment-based sponsorship, who are waiting for a green card number to be available from their country, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a mother with DACA who has spent years in the United States and to a father on an H-1B visa leading a team at a tech company in Texas, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a Ukrainian mother living in the United States who fled Russia's invasion and was granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) as the father remains fighting for the Ukrainian army, would not have certainty of becoming a U.S citizen.

A child born to a Haitian mother who recently fled political violence and instability, paroled into the country only months ago, while her partner claims asylum, would have no certainty of becoming a U.S. citizen.

Concerns About Inconsistent Application

If the Supreme Court were to further restrict national injunctions and allow the implementation of this policy, it could take effect in some states but be blocked in others. As a result, if a mother traveling for work from Arizona to Nevada goes into labor unexpectedly, then her baby, delivered in a Nevada hospital, would not be recognized as a U.S. citizen, while a baby born a few days earlier at her home hospital in Phoenix would be recognized as a U.S. citizen. A family living near the New Jersey–Pennsylvania border could have two very different outcomes depending on which side of the state line their child is born on while visiting relatives.

Concerns About Stateless Children

This policy implementation could also result in some children being born stateless. Some countries do not automatically grant citizenship to children born abroad, or impose complex requirements that parents may be unable to meet. A stateless individual without a recognized citizenship may be denied a passport or public benefits and could lack certainty about where they could lawfully reside.

Concerns About Uncertain Enforcement

The USCIS memo also creates uncertainty about what would happen to children born without citizenship under this policy. It states that, ""to fill any regulatory gaps,"" the Department would propose to defer immigration enforcement against these children until new rules are in place. That language is unclear about whether it intends to only offer temporary protection from deportation or whether the government would ultimately seek to remove those children once that deferral ends.

Next Steps at SCOTUS

The Trump Administration chose not to fast-track its request, but instead allowed the case to move through the Court's normal schedule. If at least four justices vote to hear the case, oral arguments could occur sometime in 2026, with a decision by the end of the Court's term next summer.

We recommend that employers assess whether they have workers who may be affected, that families with pending or potential immigration applications seek legal guidance on available paths to permanent status, and that all stakeholders stay informed as litigation and additional agency actions unfold.

The overture was rebuffed by the head of the County Board, which also oversees the jail as the Board of Corrections. Board Chair Roger Garcia, an outspoken critic of ICE tactics, responded in a brief statement that the board had not been involved in related conversations with Sheriff Aaron Hanson.

Garcia said he does not anticipate the board entertaining an ICE contract “any time in the foreseeable future.”

The authority to bring forth an agenda item to the Board of Commissioners or Corrections of the state’s most populated county lies with the board chair (Garcia) or a four-commissioner majority.

Money source

Hanson, in his statement, said he has urged the County Board to reconsider entering into a detention agreement with ICE. Attached was an Oct. 7 memorandum addressed to Garcia and Vice Chair Mike Friend, which noted in part that nearly 80 workers detained in a June 10 Omaha immigration raid were transported to the Lincoln County jail in North Platte, which is more than four hours away.

Hanson said that, for those individuals, a Douglas County-ICE detention contract could have meant staying nearer to loved ones, with “real, in-person access to legal representation” and access to Omaha’s “premier healthcare system, legal and support services.”

Furthermore, Hanson said, an ICE detention contract would result in “millions of dollars of much-needed revenue.” He said his department’s proposed budget was trimmed by nearly a half-million dollars and said the safety of county residents will suffer.

Hanson’s proposal comes as the State of Nebraska is transforming a McCook-based state prison facility into a nearly 300-bed Midwest hub for ICE detainees. That proposal, backed by Gov. Jim Pillen and several state legislators, has sparked controversy and opposition from various organizations and some lawmakers.

“Ultimately we cannot control what the federal government does,” Hanson wrote to county commissioners. “What we can control is retaining our neighbors and shared constituents within our community as they navigate their due process.”

He contends the county jail is operating at “historic low capacity” and that space exists to “keep our neighbors in our community.”

LULAC’s role

Hanson’s statement also announced that his office and the LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) Nebraska, had started discussions on “humane and accountable detention practices.”

The sheriff said that while his office and LULAC Nebraska hold different perspectives on whether the county should enter into a detention agreement with ICE, their dialogue “reflects a commitment to transparency and community input.”

Elsa Aranda, LULAC Nebraska state director, said she has offered to help develop independent oversight structures and detainee support frameworks to ensure fairness.

However, national LULAC spokesman David Cruz told the Nebraska Examiner that the sheriff’s statement was “premature” and that “any inference that LULAC is either supporting or endorsing or approving such a project would be inaccurate.”

He said the civil rights organization’s national leadership did not approve “a public statement using the name of LULAC in such a context.” LULAC describes itself as the largest and oldest Hispanic and Latin-American civil rights organization in the U.S.

Three months after Omaha raid: One ICE detention chapter winds down, another heats up

Cruz said LULAC’s national president Ramon Palomares and advisor Hector Flores did speak with Hanson and his chief deputy at a conference they all attended in Dallas — as the sheriff wrote in his memo to the County Board.

But he said that the LULAC representatives did not know beforehand the topic to be discussed. “They went and listened,” he said, and said they’d take it back to the organization’s attorneys.

Aranda, in remarks included in the sheriff’s statement, said her role as Nebraska state director was “to ensure that if detention occurs, it happens under humane, fair and transparent conditions – and that the rights and dignity of every person are protected, just as the sheriff is proposing.”

Cruz, however, said the national network’s stance is “staunch” opposition to detention centers for “detainees who are being held on immigration-related issues.” He added, “Any use of the name LULAC or the appearance lending weight to this decision would be inaccurate.”",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/MaskICE.jpg,N,,2025-10-10 12:00:08.195249

Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

The ceasefire in Gaza is now in effect and Israeli forces are pulling back from parts of the territory in accordance with the deal approved by the Israeli government overnight, the Israeli military said today. The IDF troops positioned along the “updated deployment lines” will “continue to remove any immediate threat,” the IDF said. BBC News reports.

Thousands of Palestinians have started moving from southern Gaza toward Gaza City following the withdrawal of Israeli troops from the area. According to an IDF spokesperson, “movement from the south to the north of Gaza is permitted” as the ceasefire came into effect at 12 p.m. local time. CNN reports; Alexander Cornwell and Nida Al-Mughrabi report for Reuters.

The Israeli forces’ partial withdrawal has now triggered a 72-hour countdown for Hamas to release the hostages it is holding. Separately, Israel has published the names of 250 Palestinian prisoners set for release as part of the agreement and Hamas leader Khalil Al-Hayya said he received guarantees from the United States and other mediators that the war is over. Jeremy Diamond reports for CNN; Tamar Michaelis reports for CNN; Reuters reports.

Eyewitnesses in Gaza told BBC News of Israeli airstrikes in Khan Younis and artillery shelling and gunfire in the Netzarim corridor early this morning. According to the IDF, the ceasefire agreement came into effect at midday local time. The IDF said they were looking into the reports of airstrikes. According to Gaza’s Hamas-run health ministry, a total of 17 people have been killed in Gaza in the past 24 hours. Tom Bennett and Hugo Bachega report; BBC News reports.

In a televised address, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today thanked President Trump “for his global leadership and his relentless efforts to put together this plan to return the hostages” and “great friendship toward our people and country.” Netanyahu also thanked the U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. Tamar Michaelis and Catherine Nicholls report for CNN.

ISRAEL HAMAS WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

U.S. officials said yesterday that the United States will send 200 U.S. troops to Israel to monitor the implementation of the cease-fire deal in Gaza. The U.S. soldiers will join troops from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey and the UAE to provide oversight and will work to establish a civil-military coordination center in Israel to provide security and humanitarian support. The U.S. soldiers are not intended to enter Gaza, one official said. Tyler Pager and Eric Schmitt report for the New York Times.

European and Arab politicians met in Paris yesterday to discuss further details on the reconstruction and administration of Gaza after the war. “We discussed the major fields to which we intend to contribute: security, governance, reconstruction and humanitarian aid,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel reporters said this morning. Barrot said that the details would be shared with the United States “so that they can integrate them” into future plans. John Irish reports for Reuters.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Russian drone and missile strikes overnight have wounded at least 20 people in Kyiv and caused blackouts across Ukraine, Ukrainian authorities said today. Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko called the attack “one of the largest concentrated strikes” against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. Russian attack drones, missiles and guided bombs over the Zaporizhzhia region killed a 7 year old and wounded his parents, military officials said. AP News reports.

23 Ukrainian children have been brought out of Russian occupied areas of Ukraine and into territory under Kyiv’s control, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s chief of staff said yesterday. Reuters reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are drawing up contingency plans to respond to the possibility of mass displacement of their citizens following a Russian attack, officials told Reuters. The town of Kaunas in Lithuania has plans to house 300,000 people in schools, universities and churches. “It’s a very reassuring message to our society that we are ready and we are planning,” Lithuanian Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said. “We have done our homework.” Andrius Sytas reports.

Peru’s congress voted yesterday to remove Peruvian President Dina Boluarte from office. Boluarte refused to attend the vote which approved her removal on grounds of “permanent moral incapacity.” Boluarte has denied all allegations against her, which include bribery and involvement in a deadly crackdown on protesters in 2022. Mauricio Torres and Jessie Yeung report for CNN.

Sudanese Rapid Support Forces paramilitary reportedly killed 13 people on Tuesday night in an attack on the Saudi hospital in the besieged city of El-Fasher, a source told BBC News. The source said that 16 others were injured by the shelling, including a doctor and a nurse. A group of Sudanese medics called the attack a war crime. Richard Kagoe and Wedaeli Chibelushi report.

Taiwan President William Lai announced today that Taiwan will build a dome-like air defence system to guard against “hostile threats.” Lai said there was also “clear necessity” to boost defense spending, confirming plans to increase spending from 3% to 5% of GDP by 2030. Kelly Ng reports for BBC News.

Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday acknowledged Russia’s responsibility for the downing of an Azerbaijani jet last year, which killed 38 people. Putin indicated that Russia would be willing to pay unspecified damages to the victims’ families. Nataliya Vasilyeva reports for the New York Times.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Venezuela’s government yesterday requested an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council to focus on U.S. military strikes in the Caribbean sea in recent weeks. Venezuela’s U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada accused the United States of seeking “regime change” in Venezuela in “order to seize control of the vast natural resources found in the Venezuelan territory,” adding that the Trump administration is threatening “peace, security and stability regionally and internationally,” in a letter addressed to the Security Council president. AP News reports.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent yesterday announced that plans for the United States to provide $20 billion to Argentina had been finalized, adding that the United States had also directly purchased Argentine pesos in an attempt to stabilize Argentina’s financial market. Bessent did not confirm how many pesos were purchased. The $20 billion “currency swap” framework gives Argentina’s central bank the ability to exchange pesos for U.S. dollars with the Treasury. Michael Stratford reports for POLITICO; Elisabeth Buchwald reports for CNN.

“We import from China massive amounts and maybe we will have to stop doing that,” Trump said yesterday following Beijing’s announcement of export restrictions on rare-earth materials. A White House official said that China’s new rules were announced without notice to the United States and appear to be an attempt to control the world’s technology supply chains. Amrith Ramkumar and Lingling Wei report for the Wall Street Journal.

China’s Ministry of Transportation announced today that a special port fee will be imposed on vessels owned by U.S. companies, organizations, or individuals docking at Chinese ports. U.S. vessels will be charged $56 per net ton from October 14, with planned increases from 2026 to 2028. The Wall Street Journal reports.

The United States is trailing behind Russia and China in the development and deployment of hypersonic weapons, fostering “battlefield asymmetry,” according to an Atlantic Council study shared with Axios. Incremental improvements are “not enough,” Hypersonic Capabilities Director Stephen Rodriguez said. “We need to act decisively now.” Colin Demarest reports.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Teams of customs officers at major ports in China have been carrying out stringent checks on semiconductor shipments, according to three sources. The sources said that the inspections started to ensure that local companies stop ordering Nvidia’s China-specific chips following guidance from the Chinese regulators to discourage their purchase. Zijing Wu and Cheng Leng report for the Financial Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

A grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, yesterday indicted New York Attorney General Letitia James yesterday on felony charges of bank fraud and making false statements to a financial institution regarding a mortgage loan. James’ first court appearance is scheduled for October 24. “These charges are baseless, and the president’s own public statements make clear that his only goal is political retribution at any cost,” James said yesterday. Kristen Holmes, Hannah Rabinowitz, and Kara Scannell report for CNN.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week fired Navy chief of staff Jon Harrison, without providing a public explanation. Five former and current officials said that there is a deepening sense of uncertainty in the department and concerns about Hegseth’s objectives. One official spoke about a “culture of fear; there’s a culture of intimidation and retaliation.” Another said, “It’s better just to keep your head down.” Paul McLeary and Daniel Lippman report for POLITICO.

The Internal Revenue Service yesterday pivoted on its position that furloughed workers would be “compensated on the earliest date possible” after the Government shutdown ends, according to an email obtained by POLITICO. The email sent to employees yesterday states that IRS’s initial memo on furlough guidance “incorrectly stated the nature of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019” and that further guidance will be provided on the issue. Danny Nguyen reports for Axios.

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children is running out of money, despite a White House pledge earlier this week to use tariff revenue to support the program during the government shutdown. “We have gotten no information about how much money would be available, when it would be available to states or what states would be able to use it for,” National WIC Association policy director Ali Hard said. Several sources said that lawmakers and their staff had not been informed of the administration’s plans. Marcia Brown reports for POLITICO.

FEDERALIZATION OF DOMESTIC POLICING

Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) yesterday criticized the deployment of Texas National Guard troops to Illinois, adding that he “believe[s] in the federalist system – that’s states’ rights.” “Oklahomans would lose their mind if Pritzker in Illinois sent troops down to Oklahoma during the Biden administration,” Stitt told the New York Times. Stitt expressed support for Trump’s effort to protect ICE agents but raised concerns about the precedent that was being set by guard deployment. J. David Goodman reports.

Tennessee National Guard troops will begin patrolling Memphis today, providing additional “eyes and ears” to Memphis police officers, the city announced in an online update. It is unclear how many troops will be deployed. Emily Cochrane reports for the New York Times.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Officials in Los Angeles County are considering declaring a state of emergency to provide relief for immigrants who have suffered financially from fear of ICE raids. The county board voted 4 to 1 on Tuesday to put an emergency declaration up for a vote on October 14. “Families are now afraid to go to work, to attend school or even to buy groceries,” a county supervisor said on Tuesday. A declaration would allow the LA County Board of Supervisors to put in place an eviction moratorium and other protections. Orlando Mayorquín reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

Appeals court judges yesterday appeared sceptical of Oregon’s case that Trump did not have the authority to deploy National Guard troops to Portland during oral arguments. “What I’m struggling with is, the president gets to direct his resources as he seems fit, and it just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the City of Portland can come in and say ‘No, you need to do it differently,’” Judge Ryan Nelson said. It is unclear when the court will issue a ruling. Kale Williams reports for Axios.

A federal judge yesterday temporarily blocked Trump from federalizing or deploying the National Guard from Illinois or any other state for use in Illinois for two weeks. The judge said that “there is overwhelming evidence submitted that the provocative nature of ICE’s enforcement activity, the repeated constitutional violations, has itself caused a significant increase in protest activity.” The judge added that her full written order will be made available today.

A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.
Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.","“You took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city, safe,” the narrator says, as images of the cities targeted and ICE agents arresting people move across the screen. “But in sanctuary cities, you’re ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The campaign — airing in more than a dozen cities, including Chicago, Seattle and Atlanta — is part of ICE’s $30 billion initiative to hire 10,000 more deportation officers by the end of the year to supercharge deportations.

The money is part of the $76.5 billion sought by Trump’s Republican administration for ICE, a 10-fold increase in its current budget, as part of the sweeping, multitrillion-dollar tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted in July.

ICE is already offering bonuses of up to $50,000 for new recruits and other benefits such as tuition reimbursement as it seeks to fast-track hiring.

And while some parts of the federal government are shut down as a result of the Republican dominated Congress and its failure to pass a spending measure by October 1, the ICE ads reflect that the push for mass deportations, one of Trump’s top priorities, is still flush with cash.

MILLIONS SPENT ON THE 30-SECOND ADS

The ads open with video of each metro’s familiar skyline and the narrator’s voice announcing, for example, “Attention, Miami law enforcement.” Beyond that, the spots are identical, inviting officers to “join ICE and help us catch the worst of the worst. Drug traffickers. Gang members. Predators,” according to a review of the ads on the ad-tracking service AdImpact.

The 30-second spots began running in mid-September in Albuquerque, New Mexico; Boston; Chicago; Denver; New York; Philadelphia; Sacramento, California; Seattle; and Washington DC. Adding to the list: Atlanta; Dallas; El Paso, Texas; Houston; Miami; Salt Lake City; and San Antonio.

As of October 6, total spending on the ads had topped $6.5 million, with the most spent since mid-September being $853,745 in the Seattle area. However, Atlanta saw the most in October, more than $947,000, according to AdImpact.

It was unclear why ICE targeted those locations and not others. There is no standard definition of what is a sanctuary jurisdiction although it generally refers to cities or states that limit their cooperation with ICE. Some but not all of the cities appear on a Justice Department list of cities that “that impede enforcement of federal immigration laws.”

Asked in an email to explain why specific areas were chosen as advertising targets, Department of Homeland Security officials declined to provide an explanation. Instead, they replied with a September 16 press release, near the beginning of the ad campaign, reporting that it had received more than 150,000 applications and had extended 18,000 tentative job offers.

Some cities where the ads have been playing, particularly Boston and Chicago, have been repeatedly criticized by the Trump administration for their policies that limit how much they can work with federal immigration enforcement. ICE has launched immigration crackdowns in both of those cities. Local officials in Chicago have been particularly outspoken against the stepped-up enforcement.

Albuquerque is among the smallest metropolitan areas where the ads are airing, though the city’s mayor, Tim Keller, has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration’s immigration policy. In July, Keller signed an executive order barring city employees from assisting federal authorities with civil immigration enforcement “unless legally required.”

LOCAL POLICE CAN’T COMPETE WITH ICE PROMISES

The AP reached out to police departments in areas where the ads were running. Most departments either did not respond or said they did not comment on actions of outside agencies. A few, including Sacramento and Miami, said they had not noticed any of their officers leaving for positions at ICE or DHS.

Four of the markets where the ads are playing are in Texas, including San Antonio.

Danny Diaz, the president of the city’s Police Officers Association, said he’d seen the ads and was concerned about prospective recruits who might be thinking of joining the city’s police department joining ICE instead.

“We can’t compete with a $50,000 signing bonus,” Diaz said. “I do think that the younger generation will jump on that.”

The government shutdown could dampen ICE’s recruitment hopes, he said.

“They’re furloughing federal employees, and I don’t think individuals want to leave one department to go work for a federal agency when they don’t know if they’re going to receive a check or not,” he said, referring to the lapse in funding that has led to federal law enforcement officers going without pay.

Philadelphia police Captain John Walker said it’s too early to tell whether the ad campaign has had an impact on the city’s recruiting. Instead, he suggested, the ads appeared more geared toward reassuring viewers that the Trump administration was addressing illegal immigration.

“It’s the psychological feel. You want to know that there are cops out there because it makes you feel good,” said Walker, who’s in charge of Philadelphia police recruiting. “That’s all this is, strengthening the belief that they’re doing something.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)

LAKE NORDEN — The names on the list included some of Dorothy Elliott’s best employees: hardworking, reliable, honest.

Most had been working at Drumgoon Dairy for years. Some worked there for nearly two decades, playing a role in the operation’s expansion and success.

But after an audit of the dairy at the end of May by the federal Department of Homeland Security, 38 of those employees are gone.

The department said they each had inaccurate, outdated or incomplete proof of U.S. citizenship or permission to work in the country.

Elliott co-owns the farm near Lake Norden, 5 miles from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s eastern South Dakota home. Elliott asked the affected employees for updated documentation but ultimately had to fire those who weren’t able to adequately resolve the problems with their documents. One person returned home because his visa was expiring, and another quit.

The audit decimated Elliott’s workforce, once more than 50 employees, dropping it to just 16.

Audits at dairy farms under the Trump administration’s escalated immigration enforcement efforts have “created unrest” among workers and owners, Elliott said. It’s made for a tough summer in an industry that was flourishing after decades of support from state government.

Elliott’s remaining employees have been working without breaks, she said. Without a pathway or plan to create a sustainable workforce in agriculture and by “removing everyone working in it,” she worries some agricultural operations will go out of business. She hopes Drumgoon isn’t one of them.

“Basically, we’ve turned off the tap, but we’ve done nothing to create a solution as to how we find employees for the dairy industry,” she said.

Never previously audited

Elliott is required to file I-9 forms with documentation proving her workers’ identity and eligibility to work in the U.S. It puts employers in a difficult position, said Scott VanderWal, president of the South Dakota Farm Bureau, because applicants may present fraudulent documents an employer doesn’t catch. Yet employers could also be sued for mistakenly rejecting valid documents.

“If employers are presented with documentation that looks real and legitimate, they’re obligated to accept it,” VanderWal said. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services offers similar guidance, saying employers must accept documentation if it “reasonably appears to be genuine.”

Elliott could use the federal government’s web-based system, E-Verify, that allows employers to confirm their employees’ eligibility to work in the country. But E-Verify is not mandated for new hires in South Dakota, and Elliott said she doesn’t use it because of “unreliable results.” Organizations ranging from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute to the American Civil Liberties Union have opposed the use of E-Verify, citing reasons including errors that cost people jobs because the system wrongly flagged them.

So Elliott evaluates applicants’ documents herself. If their IDs are out of date or if they have a visa and are applying from another farm without returning home, she passes on hiring them. She’s turned people away a dozen times over the years, she said.

Lack of action on immigration is ‘holding SD back,’ dairy farmers say

Drumgoon was never audited before. In her past dealings with the Department of Homeland Security during nearly two decades of running the dairy, Elliott said, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents would merely tell her they were searching for a person and ask for a notification if the person applied for a job.

This time was different. After an audit, employers are required to terminate unauthorized workers who can’t prove their employability, according to a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson. Audits — which are distinct from raids or other immigration enforcement operations — are meant to ensure businesses comply with federal employment laws.

Elliott does not know where her 38 former employees went. They could be working at other dairies in the U.S. They could have left the country. They could be anywhere.

Because the dairy is near a farm owned by Noem, the former governor of South Dakota, and because Noem was in the state during the month of the audit to receive an honorary degree, South Dakota Searchlight asked the Department of Homeland Security if Noem had a direct role in the audit. The department didn’t respond to the question.

Elliott declined to talk about Noem, saying she recognizes that federal immigration authorities “have a job to do.”

South Dakota Farmers Union President Doug Sombke called federal dairy audits “stupid,” because they needlessly displace workers.

“Why the heck can’t we continue to use them there as an intern or apprentice or whatever you want to call it and make it legal? Why is it so important we grab them and call them a criminal? No one wants those jobs,” Sombke said. “I don’t understand why you’d cripple or cause problems for a labor shortage when all you have to do is get them legalized.”

Immigrants hiring immigrants

Elliott’s connection to immigrants isn’t limited to her employees. She was born in the United States but married her husband, Rodney, in Northern Ireland, where they had their children.

Eliott worked in health care and her husband operated their 140-cow dairy farm in Northern Ireland when a newspaper ad, “Wanted: Dairy farmers in South Dakota,” caught their attention. Moving to America meant fewer regulations, cheaper land, cheaper feed and the ability to grow their business, she said.

The couple used the EB-5 investment-for-visa program to secure backers for their operation, opened the dairy in 2006, paid off the investors within a few years and have been expanding ever since. They started with about 1,500 cows in 2006 and have grown to 6,500.

Elliott’s children got their citizenship shortly after moving to the U.S., and her husband became a citizen about eight years after they moved. That experience helps her empathize with her workers, many of whom are Hispanic. She said everything they’re doing is to support their families back home, even though many aren’t able to see their families for years at a time.

“All they’re guilty of is working and doing a job that isn’t currently being filled by an American,” Elliott said.

Taneeza Islam advocates for immigrants as executive director of South Dakota Voices for Peace. She’s spoken to immigrant workers in other industries who were scared and confused after being terminated due to stricter immigration enforcement.

“We have two very separate worlds right now: the community that’s impacted and worried about getting detained and deported, and the community that doesn’t know this is happening here,” Islam said.

State recruited dairies

The Elliotts are among many new South Dakotans who’ve helped the dairy industry boom in the last two decades. Then-governor and now-U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, a Republican, focused on supporting the industry in the early 2000s, which included efforts to recruit farmers from overseas.

In 2010, South Dakota’s dairy industry had an economic impact of $1.27 billion. By 2023, that had grown to $5.67 billion.

“We’ve achieved our goals we set out for ourselves: build a dairy, milk cows and grow the dairy industry in South Dakota,” Elliott said. “Is it a sustainable goal if there’s nobody to work on these dairies? No. So all the time, money, effort, investment and hard work that has gone into it will be null and void if there isn’t a workforce.”

Sombke, the state Farmers Union president, said the state’s investment in dairy “has been a good thing,” but he isn’t surprised by the recent disruption in the industry.

South Dakota Searchlight requested the number of audits conducted in South Dakota so far in 2025, but a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the department “does not disclose specific data on audits or enforcement actions by state or industry.”

Sombke said dairy audits are “way up” in the state compared to last year. He said nobody should be surprised to find workers at dairies without permission to be in the country.

“What do you expect? The unemployment rate is less than 2% in the state,” Sombke said. “You’re going to be looking for labor anywhere you can find it.”

Aftermath of an audit

Drumgoon Dairy’s remaining employees have made mistakes because of the long hours they’ve had to cover — like reversing a payloader into a manure pond — or because they’re new to working on the farm.

“Some of them only get one or two days off in a 15-day period,” Elliott said. “But what else do you do? Do you just let cows starve or calves die because there’s no one there to take care of them?”

Some nearby farms sent workers to help at Drumgoon for a couple of days at a time this summer after the audit. Elliott and her husband have spent over $110,000 on recruiters and transportation so far to hire 22 visa workers from Mexico. But the visas come with restrictions on the types of jobs workers can do, so Elliott hired a dozen or so new employees locally, and still wants to hire another 10 to 15 people to replace terminated staff.

Elliott is struggling to find local applicants, which she is required by law to attempt before hiring visa workers.

“If raising wages even more will bring Americans to work on the farm, we can try it,” Elliott said, “but there is a limit to how high you can raise wages when you don’t get to set the price of milk. Can I afford to pay a milker $25 an hour? At some point, you’d produce milk for more than you’re receiving for it.”

Trump could lead immigration reforms, Thune says

After a panel discussion at the annual Dakotafest agricultural trade show in Mitchell in August, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight that he believes President Donald Trump is interested in legal immigration and work visa reforms.

“If we can find some willing partners in the Democrats, some sort of an immigration policy or a piece of legislation that we could pass is not outside the realm of possibility,” Thune said. “Ultimately, that’s the best long-term solution, and I’ve heard him talk about it.”

Sen. Rounds told Searchlight that as more people are deported and industries are disrupted, “we will get enough support from the administration to begin looking at a legal system again.”

Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who is running for South Dakota governor next year, said some visa programs should be modified to meet the needs of the dairy industry. Some visas are seasonal programs that require participants to return home after a few months. The programs don’t fit the needs of dairy operations that require workers year-round.

Elliott has broached the issue for years to Thune, Johnson, Rounds and other federal officials.

“All I hear is, ‘I’ll mention that. We’ll talk about that.’ But nothing,” Elliott said. “What we hear is there is absolutely no passion for any kind of change to the status quo.”

Farmers suggest solutions

Lynn Boadwine of Boadwine Farms in Baltic has “run out of gas” trying to advocate for visa and immigration policy changes to support the dairy industry. But he was heartened to hear the congressional delegates’ comments.

“There’s rhetoric, but are you really working on it?” Boadwine said. “I hope they are, because the clock is really ticking on all of these issues and we’re going to start to run out of people.”

Boadwine shared immigration reform ideas with congressional offices but hasn’t heard back on the topic. His hope is to modernize and simplify the H-2A visa program for dairies. His proposal would remove the seasonality requirement and allow workers in the country without legal permission to transition to guest-worker status. Long-term guest workers would have a path toward permanent residency by proving they are law-abiding, hardworking employees.

VanderWal, with the South Dakota Farm Bureau, said he met this spring with Noem in Washington, D.C., in his capacity as vice president of the American Farm Bureau Federation. He urged Noem and the Trump administration to back off on audits in the agricultural industry in hopes that Congress would “fix the system.”

“We wanted to impress upon the administration that if they started removing illegal workers up and down the food chain, from production to processing to transportation to grocery stores to restaurants, we’d see a disaster worse than the pandemic,” VanderWal said.

The administration has since “backed off ag,” VanderWal said, but the consequences linger for producers like the Elliotts and their employees. He said that unless President Trump “gets real forceful and goes after it,” he doesn’t expect Congress to undertake legal immigration reforms.

Economic consequence predicted

At Drumgoon Dairy, Elliott has tried automating aspects of her operation. She and her husband put in 20 robots a few years ago with the expectation they could hire students from nearby Lake Area Technical College’s robotics program to maintain them.

They posted robotics maintenance positions to attract graduates, but the response was deflating.

“To date, no one,” Elliott said.

She plans to remove the robots because the cost of running and servicing them is too expensive. So far, they’ve sold three.

Nawrocki, a conservative who became president in August, had already declared during his election campaign that he would seek to unilaterally withdraw from the EU’s flagship migration deal, the Migration, and Asylum Pact. He lacks, however, the constitutional authority to do so as president.

“I will not consent to the implementation of the Pact on Migration and Asylum in Poland,” he wrote in the letter.

While agreeing that irregular migration is a European problem, Nawrocki said the answer is not to send migrants to Central and Eastern Europe. Instead, he called for action at the source, including cracking down on smugglers

Earlier this year, pro-EU Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said that Warsaw would not implement any migration pact, nor any provisions of such projects that would force Poland to accept migrants identified in other European countries.

Still, Nawrocki said he was ready to work with other EU countries on border security, joint operations, sharing information, and giving technical help to countries facing strong migration pressure.

He added that Poland already carries a heavy load by defending the EU’s eastern flank, and sheltering nearly one million refugees from Ukraine after Russia’s 2022 invasion.

In 2025, Poland spends as much as 4.48% of GDP for defence, according to NATO data – the largest percentage in the Alliance. Three years after Russia’s attack on Ukraine, 993,000 Ukrainians were under temporary protection in Poland, according to the office for foreigners.

Nawrocki also cited “the reluctance of the vast majority of Poles, regardless of political views”, to accept the forced relocation of migrants to Poland without providing data.

As many as 75% of Poles oppose Poland accepting migrants under the so-called solidarity mechanism, according to an Opinia24 survey for RMF FM. One in five respondents supported taking in migrants.

The lawsuit was filed on behalf of immigrants in Colorado, including Caroline Dias Goncalves.

On June 5, Dias Goncalves, a Brazilian national and University of Utah student, was stopped by a Mesa County sheriff's deputy on Interstate 70 for following a truck too closely.

Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office said Dias-Goncalves had an expired visa but no criminal history, and the deputy used a Signal group chat with other law enforcement agencies to alert ICE agents of Dias Goncalves’ location.

The deputy let Dias Goncalves go, but ICE detained her shortly afterwards. She then spent two weeks at the ICE facility in Aurora, run by The GEO Group.

Weiser filed a civil lawsuit against the Mesa County deputy for violating Colorado laws that prohibit state and local officials from assisting federal immigration enforcement.

The ACLU said Dias Goncalves' case is yet another in which ICE agents made no effort to evaluate whether she was a flight risk. If they had, they would have learned she was a scholarship student in college with a stable home and family life, according to the lawsuit.

Denver7 anchor Shannon Ogden spoke with Hans Meyer, a co-counsel in the case, about the ACLU lawsuit. He said before making an arrest, ICE is required by law to have probable cause and to have determined the person is a flight risk. ICE agents in Colorado are doing neither, according to Meyer.

""ICE is breaking the rules and breaking the law when it's going out and conducting immigration enforcement,"" Meyer said. ""And that's why we're seeing these videos and reports showing that ICE is doing basically de facto racial profiling in communities throughout Colorado. That practice needs to stop and stop immediately.""

Meyer believes this lawsuit will work to get the missing guardrails back in place for immigration agents.

""We do think that if a court steps in and forces ICE to follow the law, it will restore balance with lawful law enforcement and respect for our constitutional protections,"" he said.

Ogden reached out to ICE for comment on the allegations and lawsuit.

And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Pritzker wrote.
The deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois’ sovereignty and right to self-governance,” the AG filing stated.
Marshals Service, and there are no plans for the National Guard to be at the courthouse,” the declaration read.
He also took a jab at how National Guard members stationed in Washington, D.C., ended up cleaning litter.","A federal judge in Chicago on Thursday blocked the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to the city and state as part of its ongoing immigration enforcement push, saying she had no faith in the government’s claims of out-of-control violence and that it was federal agents who started it by aggressively targeting protesters with tear gas and militaristic tactics.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry is the latest setback for President Donald Trump, who has claimed ongoing violence and clashes between protesters and immigration agents in Chicago and other U.S. cities justified sending federalized troops onto the streets as a security force, even as local and state officials accused the president of manufacturing a crisis to justify unnecessary — and unprecedented — force.

The temporary restraining order issued by Perry, which took effect immediately, bars the president from deploying federalized National Guard troops from any state to any location in Illinois. A written ruling would be issued Friday, she said.

Gov. JB Pritzker cheered the ruling in a statement on social media, writing, “”Donald Trump is not a king — and his administration is not above the law.”

Perry’s ruling “confirmed what we all know: there is no credible evidence of a rebellion in the state of Illinois. And no place for the National Guard in the streets of American cities like Chicago,” Pritzker wrote.

A spokesperson for Trump, meanwhile, said the judge got it wrong — and there will be an appeal.

“Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders like Pritzker have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson wrote in an emailed statement. “President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.”

It was not immediately clear what would happen with National Guard troops already working at sites around Chicago, including Broadview.

In her oral ruling from the bench, Perry, a Biden appointee, said National Guard troops are “not trained in de-escalation or other extremely important law enforcement functions that would help to quell these problems,” and that allowing troops to come into Chicago “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

The judge also said the Trump administration’s attempts to cast protesters as violent rebels “cannot be aligned” with the view of local officials. Perry said she had no faith in the declarations of federal officials submitted to the court ” due in large part of a growing body of evidence that the Department of Homeland Security’s views are “simply unreliable.”

Perry cited several assault cases that had been dismissed against protesters and other orders from federal judges in Chicago entered against DHS and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“In the last 48 hours in four separate unrelated legal decisions from different neutral parties, they all cast significant doubt on DHS’ assessment of what is happening on the streets of Chicago,” Perry said.

Perry also said a rebellion is defined as “a deliberate organized resistance openly opposing the laws and government as a whole” by means of armed violence. “I have found no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Standing in front of a bevy of cameras Thursday evening in the federal court lobby — a building he noted that “doesn’t need the protection of the National Guard right now” — Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul’s voice broke as he praised prosecutors he called “true American heroes.”

The judge’s ruling, Raoul said, “is an important decision not just for the state of Illinois but for the entire country. The question of state sovereignty was addressed in this decision. The question of whether or not the president of the United States should have unfettered authority to militarize our cities was answered today.”

The ruling came down after hours of arguments in court that came to an emotional end Thursday with a lawyer for the Illinois attorney general choking up as he talked about the American tradition of public virtue that puts the common good of the republic ahead of self-interest.

“This case is replete with evidence of bad faith, of an abandonment of public virtue, of a lack of honest devotion to the public interest and a grave risk of usurpation or wanton tyranny,” attorney Christopher Wells said in his closing argument in a shaky and halting voice.

Wells argued that Trump’s plan to put federalized National Guard troops in the Chicago area, ostensibly to protect federal personnel and property during his “Operation Midway Blitz” immigration enforcement push, was a dangerous prelude to his real endgame: a federal takeover of Democrat-led cities like Chicago that have long been among his favorite political targets.

A Trump administration lawyer, meanwhile, argued strenuously that the president was well within his constitutional authority to mobilize troops given the violence perpetrated against federal immigration officers by protesters that he characterized as “rioters” and criminals bent on rebellion.

“This federalization happened to respond to an urgent and serious ongoing threat to officer safety and to the protection of property,” said Eric Hamilton, a civil litigation attorney for the Department of Justice, citing the boxing in of vehicles, assaults and even an alleged bounty put on a border patrol official’s head by a reputed gang member.

Hamilton said the operation was limited in scope and entirely within the president’s powers to ensure the ability to execute federal laws, and that the state’s motion for an injunction blocking the National Guard deployment “entirely meritless.”

“There is no possible irreparable injury from 500 members of the National Guard protecting federal property in a state of 13 million people,” Hamilton said.

The extraordinary back-and-forth between the lawyers capped a landmark day at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, where Perry’s 17th floor courtroom quickly filled to capacity in advance of the hearing, as did an overflow courtroom three floors below.

The hearing also featured a remarkably detailed question-and-answer session between Perry and Hamilton, with the judge trying to pin him down on everything from what the troops would be doing in Chicago to the president’s own public statements about sending the military to the city to end crime.

Near the end of his remarks, Hamilton said that if the judge was inclined to issue an injunction it should be limited and narrowly tailored. He also asked that she put an administrative stay on any injunction so that it can be appealed quickly to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

Arguments got underway shortly after 11 a.m. with the lawyers sparring over what constitutes a “rebellion” that such troops might be sent to quell.

Wells, the attorney for Illinois, said the country’s founders did not use words such as “rebellion, insurrection, or war” lightly.

“The president of the United States believes there is a rebellion brewing in the United States? That is such an audacious claim,” Wells argued. “Who are the rebels? Are the rebels well armed? … There is no rebellion in Illinois.”

“There doesn’t have to be an actual rebeller,” Hamilton said. “It is enough that there is a danger of a rebellion here. Which there is.”

In requesting the emergency restraining order, Kwame Raoul’s office asked the federal court on Monday to find the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops unconstitutional and to block Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth from deploying troops to the state over the objections of Pritzker.

“The Trump administration’s illegal actions already have subjected and are subjecting Illinois to serious and irreparable harm. The deployment of federalized National Guard, including from another state, infringes on Illinois’ sovereignty and right to self-governance,” the AG filing stated.

But Department of Justice lawyers argued in a filing late Wednesday that escalating violence against immigration officials during “Operation Midway Blitz” justify the deployment of National Guard troops to protect against “a danger of a rebellion against federal authority” that impedes “the ability of federal officials to enforce federal law.

In their 59-page filing, the Justice Department cited the recent protests at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, charges against people accused of ramming Border Patrol vehicles on the city’s Southwest Side that led to a woman being shot by agents, and a case brought against an alleged Chicago gang member accusing him of putting a $10,000 bounty on the head of Bovino, the Border Patrol boss in charge of the Chicago operation.

The defendant in the Bovino case is scheduled to have a detention hearing Friday — apparently one of the cases that the Trump administration claims the National Guard was called in for.

“The violent actions and threats by large numbers of protesters, directed at those enforcing of federal immigration laws and at federal property, constitute at least a danger of a rebellion against federal authority and significantly impede the ability of federal officials to enforce federal law,” the Justice Department said in the filing.

Controversy was brewing before the hearing began Thursday. The Trump administration’s late-night filing included a declaration from a U.S. Army official claiming the National Guard had been requested to help secure the courthouse for two “high-profile cases” involving Department of Homeland Security personnel on Friday.

But in an apparent response, U.S. District Chief Judge Virginia Kendall said in a letter Thursday morning that the U.S. Marshals Service has jurisdiction over courthouse security.

“At no point did I, nor the Building Security Committee, authorize or request the National Guard’s assistance to secure the Dirksen Courthouse,” Kendall wrote.

During the hearing Thursday, Perry grilled Hamilton, the Justice Department lawyer, about the claim, saying she’d been assured that it was “not an accurate statement.” She told Hamilton to go back to the Army official and either “provide further details for the factual basis” or withdraw it.

Before Perry came back to the bench to issue her ruling, the defense filed an updated declaration from the Army official clarifying that it was Federal Plaza, not the courthouse, that was at issue. “To date, there are no requests from the U.S. Marshals Service, and there are no plans for the National Guard to be at the courthouse,” the declaration read.

Perry spent well over an hour pressing Hamilton for specifics on the administration’s plans for the deployment. Would armed patrols be sent to neighborhood streets, she asked, or inside hospitals and schools? Would troops be able to search people or chase vehicles?

“You’re the ones who are deploying them,” she replied. “What are they being trained and deployed to do?”

Hamilton said it was too early to say exactly what Guard members would be asked to do and where they might be sent. Still, he said the mission would center on protecting federal buildings and federal agents who have been subjected to “very tragic and serious acts of violence,” including what he classified as coordinated attempts to block and ram DHS vehicles and an improvised explosive device described in court documents as “a round, green ball with a wick” found last month outside the ICE detention facility in Broadview.

But Perry noted at least some of that violence appeared to be instigated by federal agents. The judge referenced evidence of ICE agents “indiscriminately gassing” peaceful protestors outside the Broadview center as well as several recent cases in which citizens had been charged with assaulting immigration agents only to have a grand jury later find no probable cause that a crime had been committed.

She also pushed Hamilton to reconcile the administration’s legal arguments for the deployment with public statements made by Trump, who in the past has said Guard troops would be asked to tackle Chicago’s endemic crime.

“Frankly,” she said, “there’s a very large disconnect between those two bodies of evidence.”

As with much of the questioning, Hamilton fell back on the position that the president’s authority to federalize the National Guard is not for a judge to decide. And even when the question has been put to judicial review, the president has been given “great deference” to determine when the Guard should be deployed.

In this case, he told Perry, Trump has decided the Guard is needed to protect federal property in Illinois and to ensure that DHS agents are able to enforce federal immigration laws.

“I am very much struggling to figure out where this would ever stop,” Perry said. “The plaintiffs really believe it’s not going to stop with that. You haven’t told me it’s going to stop after that.”

Perry later questioned whether the level of violence reportedly faced by federal agents was enough to deter ICE agents from making arrests, which have dramatically spiked this year.

Acts of vandalism — slashed tires and keyed cars — sounded “a bit like a Carrie Underwood song,” she joked, eliciting a brief chuckle in a packed court room that, until that moment, had been silently tense. “I struggle to say you can’t execute laws because you can’t do it as quickly as you’d like,” Perry said.

Ahead of Perry’s expected ruling, Mayor Brandon Johnson appeared outside Funston Elementary School, near the scene of ICE’s tear gas deployment last week, and affirmed that Chicago police will protect protesters’ rights outside the Dirksen Courthouse and citywide.

“It is the local police department’s responsibility to ensure that we keep the peace, and that’s what they’ll do, and that’s what their assignment is,” Johnson told reporters.

He also took a jab at how National Guard members stationed in Washington, D.C., ended up cleaning litter.

“I mean, you saw them in D.C. They were streets and sanitation workers,” Johnson said. “Here’s the thing, that you don’t need a uniform to volunteer to pick up trash.”

Johnson watched much of the hearing in a back pew. He sat quietly, leaning forward as he intently watched Perry question the sparring attorneys.

He left before closing arguments, praising the judge to reporters in the courthouse lobby, but adding concerns that even with an order from her Trump might still break rules.

“This administration has made it very clear that its sole intent is to be an authoritarian government, versus a democracy,” he said. “I believe that we all should be concerned about that.”

The Defense Department has moved in recent days to federalize 300 members of the Illinois National Guard as well as 400 Guard members from Texas. Approximately half of the Guard members from Texas ultimately are expected to be sent to Illinois, with the support of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.

Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, Trump suggested he could invoke the Insurrection Act if needed to sidestep court orders or uncooperative officials.

“If I had to enact it, I’d do it, if people were being killed and courts were holding us up, or governors or mayors were holding us up,” he said.

A White House spokeswoman repeated that Trump was exercising “his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets.”

Given Trump’s weekslong flirtation with sending troops to Chicago and his shifting rationale, which at first was ostensibly about combating violent crime in the city but has since turned to protecting immigration enforcement operations amid “Operation Midway Blitz,” “the manufactured nature of the crisis is clear,” the state argued in its filing.

“The American people, regardless of where they reside, should not live under the threat of occupation by the United States military, particularly not simply because their city or state leadership has fallen out of a president’s favor,” the Illinois attorney general’s office wrote.

The state’s filing noted Trump’s long history of “threatening and derogatory statements toward” Illinois and Chicago, as well as city and state leaders, dating to even before he entered the 2016 presidential race.

“The supposed current emergency is belied by the fact that Trump’s Chicago troop deployment threats began more than ten years ago,” the state argued. “In a social media post from 2013 Trump writes ‘we need our troops on the streets of Chicago, not in Syria.’”

The state lawsuit also turned the Trump administration’s braggadocio to undermine its argument that troops are necessary, citing statements touting the successes of recent immigration enforcement activities and a “confident show of force” on Sept. 28, during which “dozens of DHS agents dressed in tactical gear and carrying semi-automatic rifles walked the streets of downtown,” as evidence that no emergency exists that would require the deployment of federalized troops.

In a show of unity, U.S. Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, a veteran wounded in combat in Iraq, and all 14 Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation sent a letter to Trump that urged the president to reverse course.

During a cabinet meeting Thursday, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said her department is looking to purchase additional facility space in the city.

Noem visited Portland on Tuesday, meeting with state and local leaders like Mayor Keith Wilson, Gov. Tina Kotek, Portland Police Chief Bob Day and Oregon State Police Superintendent Casey Codding. The discussions centered on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in South Waterfront, which has been the site of frequent protests since June.

In Thursday’s cabinet meeting, Noem called the local leaders ""lying and disingenuous and dishonest people.""

""As soon as you leave the room, then they make the exact opposite response, so we're looking at new facilities to purchase there in Portland, too, and we're gonna double down,"" she said. ""I told them if they didn't meet our demands for safety and security on the streets and work with us then we were going to bring in more federal law enforcement.""

Following her visit, Noem said in a FOX News interview that she wanted more security at the facility, including a larger ""buffer zone,"" claiming that Portland police had been ""leaving (federal) officers hung out to dry."" She also wants designated ""free speech zones"" where people would be allowed to protest.

In that interview, Noem threatened to send ""four times the amount of federal officers"" to Portland if Wilson didn't comply with her demands in the FOX News interview.

In addition to Portland, Noem said Thursday that the federal government is looking to expand facilities in Chicago, where National Guard troops were recently deployed.

""If we have to do it the hard way in Portland and Chicago, we will,"" she said.

'It hurts our hearts to the core'

Outside the South Waterfront ICE facility on Thursday, protesters signaled that they aren't going to let up, no matter the administration's characterizations.

""I've been here pretty close almost close to 100 days myself,"" said Shadow, one of the protesters.

""This is not some battleground that we have here; there's nothing on fire,"" said Nancy Burris. She explained her handmade sign. ""It says, 'We the people are ashamed of ICE.' We are — our whole nation is embarrassed right now.""

Shadow acknowledged that things get more ""hectic"" at night. More anti-ICE protesters come down, but so do supporters of the Trump administration — and federal officers always make an appearance.

Over Wednesday night, the Portland Police Bureau said they arrested three people on harassment charges, booking them in the Multnomah County jail. Just before 11 p.m. they arrested another person who allegedly shined a laser at the PPB surveillance plane circling overhead.

The FBI said that federal law enforcement made no arrests at all Wednesday. In general, they've been responsible for the bulk of arrests there since June — 179, by their count. But only 31 of those arrests, or 17%, have resulted in any federal charges. The rest were released with a citation or without charge.

As for who's making trouble when trouble does flare up, it depends on who you ask.

""Just a lot of agitation from both the right wingers, mostly the right-wingers,"" said Shadow.

Conservative influencers who spoke with KGW earlier in the week denied being agitators, saying it's the other way around.

Margaret Salazar is CEO of REACH Community Development, which runs an affordable housing complex directly across the street where more than 200 people live. For her tenants, the problem has less to do with the protesters and counter-protesters, and more to do with the feds.

""Really, the prominent thing that we are hearing about is the tear gas that is actually encroaching into residential units and making it difficult for folks to breathe,"" Salazar said.

The Portland Housing Bureau is now giving REACH $55,000 toward buying air cleaners. The city also sent a crew Thursday to clean the sidewalks outside.

""What we are seeing is that there's debris from the pepper balls and tear gas canisters that is basically littered here by federal agents, and the federal agents are not cleaning up their toxic trash,"" Salazar said. ""It hurts our hearts to the core to know that residents are experiencing this.""

'No interest in facts'

In statements on Wednesday, Mayor Keith Wilson signaled that he does not intend to comply with the administration's requests to expand the security perimeter or restrict protest areas around the ICE facility.

Meanwhile, as of Thursday, a city spokesperson said that they've received no indication thus far that the federal government intends to buy property in Portland. The spokesperson added that Wilson stands by his earlier statement:

""The federal government's actions in Portland are deeply disturbing. They undermine local authority, erode public trust, and escalate tensions rather than resolve them.""

The spokesperson also said Wilson urges federal partners to ""engage constructively"" and to ""refrain from rhetoric that misrepresents our city's leadership and values.""

In response to Noem's comments, Kotek said in a statement:

""I met with Secretary Noem during her visit to stand up for Oregonians' safety, deescalate the situation perpetuated by the Trump administration, and raise concerns about the aggressive tactics that federal officers are using against peaceful protesters such as tear gas and unprovoked physical force.

""It is clear from Secretary Noem's continued false narrative about what's happening in Portland that the Trump Administration has no interest in the facts, no interest in public safety, and that we cannot take them at their word. I support the Mayor's decision to hold the line in response to the Trump Administration's lies and aggressive tactics. I am calling on President Trump and his administration to focus on real problems, not made-up ones.""

The Portland Police Bureau said in a statement:

""Chief Bob Day is a 35-year law enforcement veteran who came out of retirement out of a deep commitment to help lead the Portland Police Bureau through this period of renewal for our city. He continues to serve with integrity, honesty, and genuine curiosity. Chief Day requested the meeting with the secretary in the spirit of respectful dialogue.""

Trump's cabinet meeting

During Thursday’s cabinet meeting, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi referenced the ongoing federal case over deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland.

""The (local) government doesn't want it there, but we do. We're gonna keep those citizens safe,"" she said.

""The people want it,"" President Donald Trump said in response. ""I don't understand the politics of it.""

""I asked the mayor (Wilson) that himself (regarding troop deployment),"" Noem said. ""'He said that Portland was 'perfectly safe, a beautiful city, no problems.' And I said then why did you clear the streets for me today (Tuesday) then and build out a four-block radius to make sure that I could get in and out of here and these people on the street screaming death to ICE?""

A one-block radius was blocked off around the ICE facility during Noem's visit and into the next morning. In a news release Wednesday morning, PPB said the blockade would likely stay that way for now — but that same evening, barriers were removed and all roads around the facility reopened.

PPB, in an email to KGW, said in part, ""We have removed the area closure and people are free to move through that space again. As always, PPB has the authority to restrict access to certain areas whenever a threat to the public health or safety is created by any emergency. We continue to evaluate the situation and consult with city leadership.""

The city also brought in crews from Rapid Response Bio-Clean, its contractor for clearing homeless camps, to remove a small protest encampment that's persisted across from the ICE facility for weeks. They were done clearing the camp by noon Wednesday.
