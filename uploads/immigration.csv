The shutdown is making it harder - Roll Call,Justin Papp,,,,,https://rollcall.com/2025/10/20/congressional-casework-shutdown-making-harder/,"Now many of those agencies have stopped responding, effectively bringing some forms of constituent services to a screeching halt.
In at least one instance during the shutdown, her office received a profanity-laced email from someone they were trying to help.
Essential services While not every federal agency has stopped responding to congressional staffers, multiple caseworkers described inquiries going unanswered this month.
And unlike some of his colleagues, Lawler’s message was that constituent services continue despite the shutdown.
Casework, he said, “too often doesn’t get enough attention — the work congressional offices do every day to help people, even when Washington grinds to a halt.”","For most of this year, caseworkers in Rep. Suhas Subramanyam’s office have struggled to get through to federal agencies, as mass layoffs rippled through the Trump administration.

His staff was starting to make inroads again with certain agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service, the Virginia Democrat said.

Then, the shutdown came.

“They have gone back to not being responsive. And when I say not responsive, I mean you can’t get a hold of a human being on the phone,” Subramanyam said. “You’re just getting answering machines saying that we’re in a shutdown.”

The current lapse in government funding has taken what’s already a tough job and raised the stakes, said Anne Meeker, a former congressional caseworker.

“This is probably one of the worst and most difficult shutdowns that most caseworkers working today will have seen,” said Meeker, now managing director at POPVOX Foundation.

Caseworkers are the unsung group of congressional aides who deal directly with constituents, trying to help them with problems ranging from immigration cases, to veterans benefits, to Social Security payments and more. They guide ordinary people through the maze of government bureaucracy — and to do so, they rely on their relationships with liaisons at federal agencies.

Now many of those agencies have stopped responding, effectively bringing some forms of constituent services to a screeching halt. As the government shutdown stretches into its fourth week, that interruption in service has spurred cross-party tension and left some constituents without a valuable lifeline.

“Because of the Schumer Shutdown, our caseworkers are not able to assist constituents with their cases because agency workers are furloughed,” Nebraska Republican Rep. Don Bacon said in a statement, blaming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer for the funding stalemate that began Oct. 1. “We have constituents waiting for answers from the IRS, Veterans Affairs and Department of Labor, and they shouldn’t have to wait because Senate Democrats won’t open the government.”

Some of this is not new. When the government partially shuttered in 2018–19 for 35 days, caseworkers had to navigate a patchwork of contacts depending on which congressional liaisons were still at work.

But this time around, they are dealing with an executive branch already thinned out by an aggressive push earlier in the Trump administration, led in part by Elon Musk, to cut jobs and shrink the civil service.

And while the legislative branch was already funded during the previous partial shutdown, meaning congressional staff were still collecting paychecks, this time they are showing up to work without pay, like other essential workers across the government.

Meanwhile, they’re dealing with a climate of heightened fear in the wake of two high-profile political assassinations this year and rising threats against members of Congress and their staff.

According to one Senate Democratic aide, who worked through prior shutdowns in 2013 and 2018, many caseworkers are anxious about potentially being targeted by an angry constituent. In at least one instance during the shutdown, her office received a profanity-laced email from someone they were trying to help.

“It’s frustrating, it’s disheartening, it’s sad. People are definitely discouraged,” said the aide, who was granted anonymity because she is not authorized to speak to the press. “I think the people who answer the phones … are definitely feeling abused a bit.”

While caseworkers have traditionally operated above the political fray, the aide said that dynamic has started to change.

“I’ve just seen a really sharp withdrawal of Republicans participating in these casework chats that we have and the meetings that we have, and any kind of collaboration. They’ve just kind of disappeared,” the aide said.

Essential services

While not every federal agency has stopped responding to congressional staffers, multiple caseworkers described inquiries going unanswered this month. One auto-response email from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office of Congressional Relations states that until the government reopens, “staff are currently out of the office and unable to respond to emails, phone calls, or [perform] other work-related duties.”

Other messages are more political in nature.

“Because Senate Democrats decided to block a clean, routine government funding bill, OPM was forced to halt all non-shutdown-related work — including congressional constituent services — at the close of business on September 30, 2025,” reads one auto-reply from the legislative affairs division of the Office of Personnel Management. “We hope Senate Democrats come to their senses and pass a continuing resolution to end the government shutdown.”

At least at the moment, there seems little hope of the GOP-led continuing resolution passing. The bill continues to go down in the Senate, largely along party lines.

In the meantime, Rep. Joseph D. Morelle, D-N.Y., and other Democrats have urged the Trump administration to restore some staffing in the executive branch to allow casework to proceed.

“When these channels of communication are disrupted, the consequences are immediate and personal — delayed benefits, financial hardship, and increased frustration among the American people who depend on their government to function effectively,” Morelle and 22 other House Democrats wrote to President Donald Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought earlier this month. The letter cites reports that the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and IRS had ceased constituent casework operations.

“These are effectively essential services. Let’s say you have a visa or a passport problem. Those offices may be barebones, but they should continue to function,” Morelle said on Monday. “I think it’s the administration’s way of causing pain.”

Meanwhile, House Republicans have been mostly in their home districts since the start of the shutdown, a decision that Democrats say has to do with fear of a vote over releasing documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Speaker Mike Johnson, who has sought to place blame for the shutdown on Senate Democrats, said last week that members of the House GOP were home to help their constituents.

“They’re helping the American people navigate the mess that the Democrats have created,” Johnson said at an Oct. 16 press conference. “Staying back to work with our constituents was a decision that we made very thoughtfully and we made collectively as a group.”

New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler held a press conference in his home district on Monday that featured a group of constituents that had been helped by his office. He touted more than 7,500 cases closed since he came to Congress in 2023. And unlike some of his colleagues, Lawler’s message was that constituent services continue despite the shutdown.

“If you’re struggling to get help from a federal agency, reach out. We’re here to serve you,” he said.

For some months now, there's been plenty of anticipation that ICE agents and National Guard troops would be deployed in San Francisco. And now the word appears to be - they're coming. This despite protests from Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie.

At a Florida press conference, Noem doubled down on the National Guard presence in Chicago and Portland and indicated San Francisco is next, following comments from President Trump on Fox News Sunday.

RELATED: President Trump says he has 'unquestioned power' to send troops to San Francisco

""We're going to San Francisco and we'll make it great. It'll be great again. San Francisco is a great city. It won't be great if it keeps going like this,"" said Trump. ""We're gonna go to San Francisco. The difference is they want us in San Francisco.""

California Attorney General Rob Bonta responded to the threats, saying we're ready to be in court in hours, if not minutes, if the National Guard is deployed to San Francisco.

""San Francisco is not asking for the National Guard to come here, no matter what he says,"" said Bonta.

Mayor Lurie released a statement Monday weighing in on Trump's threats to send the National Guard to his city, saying that deploying troops wouldn't help with the city's ongoing efforts to combat drug dealing.

""I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers--and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,"" he said.

The mayor didn't refer to Trump by name in the statement. Lurie instead focused on the crime trends in the city, saying the violent crime rate ""has fallen to levels not seen since the 1950s,"" and that tent encampments were at record lows.

""There is no question we have more work to do. I ran for mayor because I see the impact of fentanyl use on our streets--when I drop my son off at school, when I talk to our business and community leaders, when I walk through the city in between meetings,"" Lurie said.

San Francisco law enforcement has already partnered with state and federal officials to shut down open-air drug markets, the mayor said.

According to Lurie, the city would welcome stronger coordination with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to carry out targeted operations, arrest drug dealers, and disrupt drug markets and multinational cartels.

""Under my leadership, we will always protect the people and the values that make San Francisco the greatest city in the world,"" the mayor said. ""That means welcoming people in our city and standing up for every member of our community and for the longstanding policies that have kept our communities safe. As your mayor, that has been and always will be my north star.""

Lurie's statement on Monday comes a day before the San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting, where District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder announced plans to make a motion to ask the mayor about city preparedness in the event that the National Guard was deployed to the city.

Last week, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff apologized for comments he made in which he welcomed the deployment of National Guard troops to San Francisco.

But not before San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins pushed back on Benioff's comments, vowing that if federal law enforcement were to be sent to San Francisco, she would not hesitate to hold them accountable if they broke the law.

""We don't need your help here. San Francisco's crime rates have been dropping for the last three years. We are at historic lows in many categories,"" Jenkins said.

As for when the National Guard arrives? There's still no timetable.

""There is no lawful basis to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco. Period. Full stop. End of story. So what can we do?"" said Bonta. ""We'll see him in court. As we always do when he wrongfully and unlawfully deployed troops to Los Angeles, we saw him in court. We got two orders. One blocking the federalization and two the actions on the ground that violated the Posse Comitatus Act. We'll do it again immediately. We're ready. We see this coming.""

AG Rayfield: “The law is clear as to what Marion County should do. There is simply nothing for the court to resolve here.”

Attorney General Dan Rayfield today asked a federal court to dismiss Marion County’s lawsuit regarding Oregon’s sanctuary laws because the law is already clear as to what Marion County must do: Like other public bodies and law enforcement agencies in Oregon, the county cannot release immigration information to federal officials in response to administrative subpoenas unless and until a court issues a judicial order, requiring them to do so. The law is clear on that point and, as a result, there is nothing for the federal district court to clarify in Marion County’s lawsuit.

“Oregon law is straightforward,” said Attorney General Rayfield. “The Ninth Circuit has already ruled that there is no conflict between our sanctuary law and federal law. Public bodies can’t use state resources to help enforce federal immigration law. That’s been the law for nearly four decades, and it is a law that has coexisted peacefully under seven presidential administrations. There’s nothing confusing about that.”

Under Oregon’s sanctuary law framework—first enacted in 1987 and reaffirmed by voters in 2021—state and local officials must decline to produce certain immigration information in response to an administrative subpoena from Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless ICE initiates an enforcement proceeding and obtains a judicial order enforcing that subpoena. That safeguard ensures a neutral judge has had an opportunity to first review and determine whether the subpoena meets legal requirements before state and local officials must comply.

Despite this clear process, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed a lawsuit seeking “clarity,” instead of following well-established processes under state and federal law. The Attorney General’s motion to dismiss that lawsuit argues that no such clarification is necessary, because:

The law is clear on what Marion County must do—it cannot lawfully provide immigration information to ICE without a court order. Because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies with the subpoenas, it lacks standing to litigate the hypothetical “conflicts” between state and federal law identified in its complaint.

In any event, federal courts have already made clear that federal laws do not displace Oregon’s sanctuary laws. In other words, no conflict exists.

Federal courts have repeatedly held that counties, as political subdivisions, cannot sue states in federal court for constitutional challenges to state laws.

“Our system respects state sovereignty, federal authority, and public safety while keeping local resources focused on local priorities. There is simply nothing for the court to resolve here,” said Attorney General Rayfield.

By requiring issuance of a judicial order, Oregon’s sanctuary laws are similar to many other processes in which states and localities protect sensitive information through judicial oversight. Federal courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have repeatedly affirmed that states are not required to assist in federal immigration enforcement.

The motion, filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, asks the court to dismiss Marion County’s complaint in its entirety.",,N,,2025-10-20 22:17:21.593539

The agents forced their way into the home without showing a warrant, Magaña told CBS News.

The raid occurred on Oct. 15. Magaña, a native of Mexico, said she got a call from her children, who told her the agents were shouting for someone named Israel, but nobody in their home goes by that name. She said she told her children to lock themselves inside a room.

With guns drawn, agents broke open the room's door. Magaña's daughter took a video of the heavily-armed agents telling them to put their hands up as her daughter, a three-month-old baby, cried. One of the agents asked if any of the men inside the room were named Israel.

Outside of the home, witnesses asked the federal officers for information.

""Stop watching TikTok. We don't have to identify ourselves to you,"" one agent was heard saying on video recorded by a witness.

While federal officials have since admitted they were looking for someone else, agents still detained Magaña's 20-year-old son and her partner, saying they were in the U.S. illegally. Magaña said neither has a criminal record. Federal records reviewed by CBS News also indicate the men do not have any criminal charges or convictions.

ICE's online detainee system indicated on Monday that Magaña's son, Napoleon Magaña, was being held at the agency's detention facility in Tacoma, Washington. Her partner, Arturo Garcia Cabrera, was transferred to the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi, the system showed.

A senior Homeland Security official told CBS News the federal agents who entered Magaña's home on Oct. 15 were looking for an individual with a criminal history who they say had evaded arrest and fled into the apartment complex. The target of the operation remains at large, the official said.

""Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene,"" the official said, adding that no federal agents were hurt during the incident.

As millions took to the streets over the weekend for ""No Kings"" protests, federal agents in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside and ICE facility, where for months there have been demonstrations denouncing the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.

In an interview with CBS News in Portland, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, Enforcement and Removal Operations, denied those charges.

""They're not indiscriminate,"" he told CBS News. ""We do our surveillance. If you're in the country illegally, we're gonna arrest you.""

Charles also downplayed concerns that ICE's tactics have become too aggressive.

""We use the force necessary to affect an arrest,"" he said. ""If people interpret that as being aggressive, so be it.""

Since President Trump took office again and launched a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE agents have been given a broad mandate to detain and deport those in the U.S. illegally, with Biden-era limits on arrests of non-criminals reversed.

Charles said ICE is still primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes. But he said anyone in the U.S. illegally who is found by his agents will be arrested, even if they lack a criminal record and have been in the country for 40 years.

On Monday, an appeals court said the Trump administration could deploy National Guard troops to Portland to protect the ICE facility there while the legal battle over their deployment plays out.

Some in the local community are seeking to help those who could be targeted by immigration agents, including Pastor Mark Knutson, who has put up signs saying ICE agents need permission to enter his church.

""We're not gonna hide people. What we're gonna create is a space to be safe,"" explained Knutson, who is a reverend doctor at the Augustana Lutheran Church. ""And then we work the systems to help them get their amnesty or get the documents.""

""ICE cannot come in here … This could be a standoff if that happens,"" he added.

Knutson said he prays he never has to face that reality.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/20/1ba59d48-2ea5-4f61-a3ae-e1e4deaca7f5/thumbnail/1200x630/b39590238acfe866d21e87a0d2b55ce9/ap25293815472167.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 23:16:54.265734

In response to a shifting immigration landscape, seven students from the University of Miami School of Law's Immigration Clinic held a ""Know Your Rights"" workshop for approximately 70 people detained at the Federal Detention Center in Miami. The student participants included Amy Mantilla, Kadia Mohammed, Sienna Rodriguez, Hannah Liu, Micah Zebersky, Maria Alonso, and Joe Korzeb.

The event marked the first time such a presentation has been offered at the facility. The students advised detainees of their rights, screened them for potential legal remedies, and gave them pro se materials to help them learn about immigration benefits. Following the session, the clinic offered to represent some individuals with upcoming court hearings.

Through the workshop, students acquired firsthand skills in immigration law advocacy—a unique opportunity available in Miami with the FDC, located thirty minutes from the law school, and near two immigration courts and two other immigration detention centers.

Uncovering systemic barriers

During the workshop, students observed the significant legal hurdles that unrepresented individuals face while in FDC custody. These challenges include difficulties gathering evidence, coordinating with witnesses, and filing applications with the Immigration Court.

“The experience reminded me that there is an extremely high unmet need for legal representation in immigration cases,” said 3L immigration clinic fellow Korzeb. “The system is overwhelmed to the point that people with meritorious claims simply are not able to get the representation they need.”

Alonso, another 3L fellow, was surprised by the backgrounds of the detainees. “I was struck by how many of the people I met were actually legal permanent residents—green card holders—who have lived in the U.S. for many years,” Alonso said. “It was heartbreaking to see so many lives turned upside down.”

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons began detaining immigrants at the FDC earlier this year after immigration enforcement increased in Florida.

A history of advocacy

Established in the fall of 2009, the Immigration Clinic allows students to advocate for immigrants in a variety of complex legal proceedings. Students in the clinic represent clients in immigration court and collaborate with immigrant rights organizations on projects aimed at legal reform and social justice. The clinic is an active part of the human rights advocacy community in South Florida and nationwide. It has previously conducted similar ""Know Your Rights"" presentations at other facilities, including the Baker County Detention Center, the Monroe County Jail, and the Glades County Detention Center.

“I’m very impressed with the enthusiasm of the students to hit the ground running so early in the semester,” said associate director and lecturer Andrea Jacoski. “I found their solidarity with directly impacted people to be moving.”

Currently, the county commissioners' contract with ICE allows the agency to hold detainees at the Cumberland County Jail in Portland.
Portland city council member Pious Ali said he believes continuing the contractual agreement between Cumberland County and the U.S.
Ali said Cumberland County shouldn't be allowing ICE to use county facilities while breaking the law.
It doesn't represent who we are as a city and as a county,"" Ali said.","PORTLAND, Maine — Cumberland County commissioners are set to vote on whether to amend its contract with U.S. Marshal Prison Operations to exclude Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

While the meeting was happening, a crowd of more than 100 people gathered speaking against ICE and demanding that commissioners vote to end their agreements with ICE.

Currently, the county commissioners' contract with ICE allows the agency to hold detainees at the Cumberland County Jail in Portland.

Portland city council member Pious Ali said he believes continuing the contractual agreement between Cumberland County and the U.S. Marshal Service does more harm than good.

Ali said ICE is detaining people illegally, often without warrants and with no due process. As a naturalized citizen, Ali said he knows the fear immigrant communities are feeling.

""We've seen ICE pick up, kidnap people from all around the country, and they're doing the same here,"" her said. ""I had coffee with a parent who about four of their friends have been taken. And the sad part of it is, there's absolutely nothing I can do.""

Ali said Cumberland County shouldn't be allowing ICE to use county facilities while breaking the law.

""Allowing our county facility to be used for that, I think, is unacceptable. It doesn't represent our values. It doesn't represent who we are as a city and as a county,"" Ali said.

Leaders from the Department of Homeland Security have consistently said that their tactics are making Americans safer and strengthening the border, citing a decrease in the number of immigrants trying to cross the southern border from Mexico into Texas as a win.

In a letter to Cumberland County commissioners, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree said, ""As elected officials, we have an obligation to ensure that any partnership between local and federal entities meets the highest standards of accountability and respect for due process.""

She added that both ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents are causing ""undue terror"" with no regard for the rule of law.

Pingree noted that Cumberland County excluding ICE from its agreement with U.S. Marshals Service could lead to immigrants from Maine being sent to larger out of state facilities far away, increasing separation.

Despite those concerns, she said limiting detention space at local facilities may push DHS to return to alternatives to detention programs like letting people pursue legal pathways to citizenship.

Reports document citizens being held for extended periods, being denied access to counsel, and other civil rights violations.

Robert Garcia then joined Mayor Karen Bass and local immigration rights leaders at an event in Los Angeles to demand justice and accountability from the Trump Administration following reports of the unlawful detention of U.S. citizens and immigrants by federal agents. Last week, ProPublica documented(link is external) that 170 American citizens have been arrested by the Department of Homeland Security.

“American citizens are being dragged off the streets by masked men and thrown into detention cells without access to a lawyer or even a phone call,” said Ranking Member Robert Garcia. “No one, regardless of their background or appearance, should be living in fear of being thrown behind bars by their own government because of their race or what they look like. This is not the America we know and love. Every person in this country has rights, and DHS must stop trampling on our civil liberties. Their actions are unconstitutional, unacceptable, and completely un-American, and we will not stop fighting until this Administration is held accountable.”

In the letter to Secretary Kristi Noem, Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Senator Blumenthal wrote, “The impact of these arrests has not been evenly distributed across the country, and cities like Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles have been targeted heavily by ICE and CBP. Troublingly, the pattern of U.S. Citizen arrests coincides with an alarming increase in racial profiling—particularly of Latinos—which has been well documented in Los Angeles. Justice Kavanaugh justified this policy on the false grounds that ‘[i]f the officers learn the individual they stopped is a U. S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.’ In a pattern symptomatic of a disregard for civil rights by DHS, U.S. citizens have faced extended periods of detention.”

Almost three in four transgender immigrants reported living near or under the federal poverty line; additionally 40% indicated that they were homeless.
She called these statistics on poverty for transgender immigrants “striking.” The survey also found that 41% of transgender Latina immigrants reported having less than a high school or GED level of education and 54% were unemployed.
For more than 15 years, her nonprofit has been offering services to transgender Latino immigrants in LA County.
“Trans immigrants are particularly vulnerable because they’re directly delegitimized by the federal government in many ways, and also the ability to obtain legitimizing documents is restricted,” she said.","As everyone in Los Angeles knows, housing is expensive. In one of the most pricey places to live in the world, almost one in 10 residents has experienced homelessness. The scarcity of affordable housing is even more challenging for marginalized communities.

Immigrants are more likely to face eviction and live in overcrowded conditions, and LGBTQ people have higher rates of poverty and homelessness than the general population.

A new study published this month by the UCLA Williams Institute and TransLatin@ Coalition put numbers to the intersection of these communities in Los Angeles County. In surveying 98 immigrants who identified as transgender or nonbinary in 2023 and 2024, the study’s authors found major poverty and homelessness challenges among transgender and nonbinary immigrants. Almost three in four transgender immigrants reported living near or under the federal poverty line; additionally 40% indicated that they were homeless.

“There’s just such a direct relationship between economic stress and homelessness,” said Elana Redfield, the primary researcher and director of the Williams Institute. She called these statistics on poverty for transgender immigrants “striking.”

The survey also found that 41% of transgender Latina immigrants reported having less than a high school or GED level of education and 54% were unemployed. In comparison only 8% of transgender people overall reported not graduating high school and 22% overall were unemployed. Redfield said immigration status and discrimination were the main barriers to education and employment opportunities.

Barriers to education and employment

“It’s important to recognize the different intersections that contribute to the quality of life of people,” said Bamby Salcedo, one of the study’s authors and the founder of TransLatin@ Coalition. For more than 15 years, her nonprofit has been offering services to transgender Latino immigrants in LA County. “Even though we are in a diverse county, there’s still a lot of discrimination and a lot of violence that we experience.”

It’s not just economic stress. The study noted that 40% of all immigrants stated that safety and fear of violence was a major concern.

Earlier this spring, a 61-year-old transgender business owner in the MacArthur Park neighborhood was repeatedly brutalized at her shop in a series of attacks by three men. Sabrina De la Pena told the Los Angeles Times in Spanish and English that the attacks were based on her trans identity. The Human Rights Campaign has called the national rise in fatal hate crimes against trangender women of color an “epidemic violence.”

Since the survey was conducted two years ago, Redfield said, “a lot has changed and likely gotten worse,” under the current federal administration’s hardline policies on immigration and executive orders erasing the existence of transgender people.

“Trans immigrants are particularly vulnerable because they’re directly delegitimized by the federal government in many ways, and also the ability to obtain legitimizing documents is restricted,” she said.

On a community-level, Salcedo is seeing this stress in the number of trans people reaching out for help. Every kind of service from free food and clothes to violence prevention has been inundated at their office.

“Since June, when all the craziness happened with the federal administration, our calls have increased 100%. We’re getting double the calls,” Salcedo said.

Many of the women who seek services from TransLatin@ are fleeing violence in their home countries, Salcedo said. A 2012 study from the TransLatin@ Coalition found that 99% of transgender women from Latin America were seeking better opportunities in the United States.

“A lot of people want support with legal services for their immigration cases,” Salcedo said. “About ten of our clients have been impacted by the [immigration] raids that we know of.”

Redfield said that the study is an essential part of addressing the needs of transgender immigrants across LA. The survey was conducted with funding from LA County Supervisors Hilda Solis, Holly Mitchell, Lindsey Horvath and Janice Hahn.

“The supervisors have definitely been a national model, over the past few years, in trying to shift resources to community leaders to figure out how to solve these problems,” Redfield said.

Last year, the Board of Supervisors announced a two-year, $7 million investment in the Trans, Gender-Expansive, and Intersex Wellness and Equity Initiative to address systemic inequities in trans communities.

“Research helps us understand what’s going to be most effective,” Redfield said.","https://cdn.lapublicpress.org/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Photo_by_Paolo_Riveros_BAMBY_SALCEDO_032-1.jpg",N,,2025-10-20 20:01:20.078333

Trump has claimed the right to deploy national guard troops to Portland for the purported purpose of protecting federal property and agents.
Trump tried to circumvent Immergut’s order by deploying federalized California national guard troops to Oregon.
Immergut, a Trump appointee, imposed a second order prohibiting the deployment of any national guard troops to Portland.
“No legal or factual justification supported the order to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard,” Graber wrote.","Oregon governor Tina Kotek, has called on a federal appeals court to review and overturn a decision made by a three-judge panel on Monday that would permit Donald Trump to deploy federalized national guard troops to the streets of Portland against the wishes of state and local officials.

Kotek said that she hopes the full ninth circuit court of appeals vacates the panel’s 2-1 decision, as the dissenting judge, Portland-based Susan Graber, urged her colleagues to do.

“I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek told reporters. “I still urge the Trump administration to send all the national guard members home.”

The ninth circuit panel earlier on Monday decided to lift a lower court’s recent ruling that had prevented Trump from sending troops into the Democratic stronghold. Trump has claimed the right to deploy national guard troops to Portland for the purported purpose of protecting federal property and agents.

Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, also called on the full appeals court to follow judge Garber’s dissent and reverse the decision made by the pane.

“Oregon joins Judge Graber in urging the full ninth circuit to ‘act swiftly’ en banc ‘to vacate the majority’s order before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur’,” Rayfield said. “And, like her, we ‘ask those who are watching this case unfold to retain faith in our judicial system for just a little while longer’.”

This ruling allows Trump to maintain control over the state’s national guard until litigation proceeds completely through court. The decision does not mean that troops will arrive to Portland right away, the Oregonian reported.

Graber, the dissenting judge, described the ruling to allow the deployment as having “no legal or factual justification”. An appointee of Bill Clinton, Graber said efforts to describe the city as a “war zone” were absurd, noting protesters wearing inflatable frog costumes.

The secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, issued a memorandum on 28 September stating that 200 members of Oregon’s national guard would be “called into Federal service effective immediately for a period of 60 days”. The memo came after Trump’s demand for a military deployment to Portland.

Kotek, said previously at a news conference that she had been notified by the Pentagon that the US president had seized control of the state’s reservists, claiming authority granted to him to suppress “rebellion” or lawlessness.

City and state officials filed suit shortly thereafter to block the deployment.

“When the president and I spoke yesterday,” Kotek said at the time, “I told him in very plain language that there is no insurrection, or threat to public safety that necessitates military intervention in Portland.”

Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said that Trump’s deployment was unlawful. Portland had neither seen a foreign invasion nor sprawling anarchy – rather, there was one minor protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland.

“Let’s be clear, local law enforcement has this under control,” Kotek also said. “We have free speech demonstrations that are happening near one federal facility. Portland police is actively engaged in managing those with the federal folks at the facility, and when people cross the line, there’s unlawful activity, people are being held accountable.”

The judge presiding over this lawsuit, Karin Immergut, blocked Trump’s effort to deploy Oregon national guard troops and said his contentions about Portland’s atmosphere were “simply untethered to the facts”. Trump tried to circumvent Immergut’s order by deploying federalized California national guard troops to Oregon.

Immergut, a Trump appointee, imposed a second order prohibiting the deployment of any national guard troops to Portland.

The decision lifting Immergut’s order said that at this stage of litigation, “we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority … which authorizes the federalization of the National Guard when ‘the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.’”

The judges who decided against Immergut’s decision, Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, are Trump appointees.

In her dissent, Graber takes issue with Trump’s portrayal of Portland as a hotbed of civil conflict where roving residents impeded Ice’s operations. “No legal or factual justification supported the order to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard,” Graber wrote.

“Given Portland protesters’ well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority’s ruling, which accepts the government’s characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,” she also said. “But today’s decision is not merely absurd.

However, in practice, ICE is likely to continue large-scale raids on employers as they remain a more resource-efficient method for ICE enforcement.","On April 7, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) enabling ICE to request and receive taxpayer identity information from the IRS for immigration related enforcement without needing to obtain a court order. Since then, the MOU has been subject to multiple legal challenges, one of which is on appeal before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and oral argument occurred in early October 2025. Employers should be aware of the potential implications of this information-sharing arrangement. Without this MOU, ICE would have to rely on other channels to gather address information, such as the National Crime Information Center, DMV databases, or information sharing agreements with police departments.

For employers, this MOU signals a more directed approach to leveraging employees’ data in order to achieve more aggressive immigration enforcement, which may include criminal enforcement directed at employers.

The MOU establishes a framework for ICE to access a taxpayer’s last known address when investigating violations of designated criminal statutes. Notably, the MOU highlights persons under investigation for violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1253(a)(1), which criminalizes willfully remaining in the United States more than 90 days after a removal order becomes final. This MOU represents a shift from prior IRS practice and tests the boundaries of the Internal Revenue Code, which generally protects taxpayer data from easy access by other agencies.

How the MOU Changes Enforcement

Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code contains broad confidentiality rules surrounding the disclosure of specific taxpayer and tax return information. However, the MOU relies on an exception that permits disclosure of certain taxpayer information to a requesting agency that is either preparing for a criminal proceeding or when an investigation may result in a proceeding.

This exception creates a formal channel for ICE to cross-check immigration enforcement targets against IRS records, allowing ICE to quickly identify a taxpayer’s home address for immigration enforcement efforts. The process for ICE obtaining these tax records from the IRS requires ICE to submit a written request to the IRS identifying the following information:

The targeted individual;

The relevant taxable periods;

The specific criminal statute under investigation by ICE (i.e. 8 U.S.C. § 1253(a)(1));

The date of the final order of removal and related case number;

A statement showing why the identification and address information is relevant to ICE’s pending criminal investigation; and

An attestation that the address information will only be used by officers/employees of ICE solely for reasons articulated in 8 U.S.C. § 6103(i)(2)(A) pertaining to the enforcement of 8 U.S.C. § 1253(a)(1).

The IRS then will review the requests for “completeness and validity” and transmit the requested information to ICE, if identifiable.

Importantly for employers, the MOU only permits release to ICE of identity information – not full tax returns, financial details, or employer information. Additionally, ICE can only use the information for the preparation for judicial and administrative proceedings, in the designated investigation that may lead to such proceedings, or in any subsequent criminal proceedings. ICE must also comply with IRS Publication 1075, which provides standards for safeguarding sensitive taxpayer information.

Legal Challenges and Criticism

Since its execution in April 2025, the MOU has faced multiple challenges in federal court and drawn sharp criticisms from both privacy advocates and members of Congress. As an example, in Centro de Trabajadores Unidos v. Bessent (No. 1:25-cv-00677, D.D.C.), advocacy groups sought a preliminary injunction to block implementation of the MOU. They argued that the MOU would in practice be used for civil deportations despite the stated focus on criminal investigations. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the MOU’s language limits disclosures to criminal matters and aligns with the plain text of § 6103(i)(2). On appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, 93 members of Congress argued in an amicus brief that the MOU could erode taxpayer trust, deter voluntary compliance, and blur the lines between tax administration and immigration control. The amicus brief emphasizes that § 6103 was designed to shield taxpayer information from political or unrelated enforcement use – a safeguard the members of Congress state it established to protect against the very kind of cross-agency integration the MOU now formalizes. The DC Circuit held oral argument in the case on October 3, 2025 (No. 25-5181, D.C. Cir.), and a decision is still pending.

Potential Risks for Employers

While the MOU is focused on criminal immigration investigations, it remains to be seen how broadly ICE will interpret its authority to obtain tax information and to what extent this new discovery mechanism for immigration enforcement may impact employers. Nevertheless, the current Administration remains focused on immigration enforcement and is seeking to use all the tools in its toolkit to advance its goals. In this context, employers face heightened risks for criminal enforcement against their companies, in addition to workplace sweeps, audits, inspections and other administrative requests.

As we previously described, the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocates $170 billion to immigration enforcement, which includes over $75 billion allocated for ICE. This signals a significant expansion of ICE’s capacity extending beyond the scope of the MOU to include immigration audits, site visits, and notices of inspection.

The MOU theoretically allows for a more targeted enforcement approach by giving ICE access to specific home address information that does not extend to employer information. With this data, ICE could shift its focus from broad workplace raids to more precise neighborhood-level operations. This approach may offer employers some relief from large-scale disruptions. However, in practice, ICE is likely to continue large-scale raids on employers as they remain a more resource-efficient method for ICE enforcement.

As a result, employers will likely continue to deal with workforce reduction given ICE’s increased capacity and the opening of alternative avenues of enforcement like the MOU. Employers across all sectors should proactively review hiring, payroll, and compliance protocols, develop an internal enforcement response plan, and monitor the outcomes of pending legal challenges regarding the MOU.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-10/ice%20immigration%20customs%20enforcement%20dept%20homeland%20security%20website%20smaller.jpg.webp?itok=N4RLWhGx,N,,2025-10-20 19:21:13.187066

Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C. — argues that DHS violated the Antideficiency Act when it reassigned those Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency staff to roles within Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Protective Service and Customs and Border Protection.

The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from spending or obligating funding without congressional approval during a government shutdown. Amid the ongoing lapse in federal funding, the moves “raise serious concerns” about the Trump administration’s motives, the lawmakers say in the missive, which was first viewed by Nextgov/FCW.

“It is difficult to understand how defending the nation’s cyber and physical infrastructure could be viewed as inconsistent with the president’s stated goal of protecting the homeland,” the letter says.

It also argues recent termination notices issued to staff in CISA’s Stakeholder Engagement and Infrastructure Divisions are “the very teams responsible for coordinating with public and private partners to identify, mitigate and prevent cyberattacks.”

The lawmakers urge Noem “to immediately reclassify DHS personnel transferred away from CISA back into cyber defense roles.”

The reassignments have been occurring over the course of several weeks now. Many, but not all, of the reassignments direct staff to ICE, CBP and FPS, two people familiar with the matter previously said.

The Trump administration has steered tens of billions of dollars toward DHS immigration and border security agencies as part of a renewed push to expand detention capacity, accelerate deportations and fortify barriers along the U.S. southern border. Several of those detainments have ensnared U.S. citizens and have raised major legal and ethical questions about ICE’s handling of immigration enforcement.

The Monday letter asks Noem about whether impact assessments were conducted before firings and reassignments, how the cuts square with CISA’s mandate to reduce cyber-infrastructure risks and what concrete mitigations exist to sustain cyberdefenses.

“Firing or reassigning CISA’s cybersecurity experts in the middle of a shutdown isn’t just wrong — it’s illegal and dangerous,” Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW in a statement. “These personnel protect our power grids, hospital networks and water systems from cyber attacks. Diverting them to serve a political agenda puts American lives at risk and violates the very laws meant to protect the public.”

At any given time, foreign adversaries and criminal hackers could be targeting U.S. networks, including federal agencies that oftentimes possess high value data like national security plans, financial data and internal government communications.

CISA directed agencies just last week to patch various services offered by application delivery provider F5 after hackers penetrated the company’s systems. The intrusion has been linked to Chinese state-aligned hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

In an interview last month, prior to the ongoing lapse in federal funding, Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW that the Antideficiency Act “is very clear that, in a shutdown, the federal government can only do essentially two categories of things: functions that are necessary to preserve life and property, or functions required by the Constitution, fulfilling a constitutional duty.”

Cybersecurity has been historically a bipartisan matter in Washington, but CISA, the nation’s core civilian cyberdefense agency, has become a recent subject of political scuffles due to its work combatting mis- and disinformation.

The agency has faced scrutiny from the Trump administration for some time. Top officials have aimed to “refocus” its mission amidst GOP accusations that the agency engaged in censorship of Americans’ free speech. Those claims stem from CISA’s previous collaboration with social media platforms to remove false information online concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, elections and other divisive subjects around 2020.

A US federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for President Donald Trump to send National Guard troops to the Pacific Northwest state of Oregon, according to media reports.

The three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals 9th Circuit voted 2-1 to lift a lower court order that had blocked the president from sending troops on a mission, according to Trump, to protect federal immigration buildings and workers in Portland.

The ruling allows the mobilization and deployment of 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while the legal challenge of the deployment moves forward in court. In addition, the deployment of 300 guardsmen from California will also be allowed.

The decision to allow the deployment was handed down despite objections by city and state leaders, who argued that Trump is violating the US Constitution's Tenth Amendment, which limits federal oversight of local policing enforcement in each individual state.

Trump has ordered multiple National Guard deployments in Democratic-led cities across the country, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Illinois, and Washington, DC, citing crime or violence, which his critics call a pretext to establish his authority to deploy troops whenever he wants, especially ahead of next year’s pivotal midterm congressional elections.

Leaders in those cities and states have also filed lawsuits to block the deployment of guardsmen, citing an 1878 federal law called the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of US military forces for domestic law enforcement purposes.

Appeals court split

Portland-based US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term as president, ruled on Oct. 4 that Trump likely acted unlawfully when he ordered troops to Portland.

Immergut had blocked Trump from sending any National Guard troops to Portland at least until the end of October and has scheduled a trial for Oct. 29 to determine whether to impose a longer-term block.

The lawsuit accused Trump of exaggerating the severity of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities in Portland in order to justify illegally seizing control of state National Guard units.

On Sept. 27, Trump referred to Portland as a ""war-ravaged"" city and said: ""I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""

Police records provided by the state showed that protests in Portland were ""small and sedate,"" resulting in only 25 arrests in mid-June and no arrests since June 19.

Immergut is one of three district court judges who have ruled against Trump's use of the National Guard, and no district court judge has yet ruled for Trump in the National Guard cases.

The appeals courts, however, have been split over the issue so far, with the 9th Circuit previously backing Trump's use of troops in California and the 7th Circuit ruling that troops should stay out of Illinois until all the legal proceedings have played out.

Legal experts have said that the state of Oregon and the city of Portland could ask for an 11-judge panel of the 9th Circuit to review Monday's decision or appeal directly to the US Supreme Court.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/10/21/thumbs_b_c_2306f54ebd77f6f5393ca76ee570044f.jpg?v=000745,N,,2025-10-20 18:17:24.406843

The 287(g) program allows ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement in the arrest and deportation of immigrants.

Police Chief Daniel Comeaux told the Community Police Oversight Board last week that he turned down $25 million to let the department join the program.

Now Johnson says that money could ""provide significant financial benefits to the city"" and has requested a joint meeting between the city's Public Safety and Government Efficiency committees to discuss joining the program.

""As the elected body charged with setting City policy and overseeing its budget, the City Council should be briefed on all the relevant information that went into Chief Comeaux’s decision in a public meeting and with an opportunity for input from residents,"" Johnson said in a memo.

Johnson's memo was sent to the council members who chair those committees. Public Safety Chair Cara Mendelsohn did not respond to request for comment. Government Efficiency Chair Maxie Johnson said in an email that he would save his comments for the meeting.

But other members of the Dallas City Council say immigration enforcement should be left to the federal government, not the local police.

Council members Chad West, Adam Bazaldua, Jaime Resendez, and Paula Blackmon said in a joint statement that joining the program would ""undermine progress"" made in building trust between the police department and residents.

""We remain concerned with the practices being deployed by ICE agents through federal directives,"" the council members said in a joint statement. ""The 287(g) program would turn local law enforcement into an arm of federal immigration enforcement and could result in a betrayal of trust between the Dallas Police Department and the very communities they are sworn to protect.""

Mayor Pro Tem Jesse Moreno and Council Member Laura Cadena said in a separate joint statement that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government.

""Local law enforcement agencies, including ours, are committed to maintaining trust with the communities we serve — trust that is essential to effective policing and public safety for all residents,"" Moreno and Cadena said in the statement.

Both Moreno and Cadena encouraged residents to contact elected officials to share concerns, experiences, and perspectives to ensure community input remained at the center of the discussion.

Building trust

Comeaux told the Police Oversight Board that transparency and community engagement are among his priorities.

Board member Jenny King, who represents District 10, said last week that some residents are fearful and distrustful of the police.

Community engagement initiatives to educate business owners and residents on ways to stay safe and prevent crime are part of the work Comeaux wants Dallas police to do. That includes keeping neighborhood police officers, or NPOs, who engage with community members to handle causes of crime in their neighborhood.

But Police Oversight Board members say residents remain fearful because of social media posts showing local police departments working with ICE in other cities.

The shooting at a Dallas ICE facility last month — which left two detained people dead and one injured — sent additional fear through the local migrant community and raised concerns by advocates at a time when they are already fearful of being targeted due to anti-immigrant rhetoric.

Dallas police are required to cooperate with federal agencies, Comeaux said, but so far, they have not been asked to assist.

""We don't need that attention, we don't want to deal with that smoke,"" Comeaux said during the board meeting. ""So I don't understand why we're doing this when nothing has happened.""

Budget concerns

Police pay was one concern during this year's budget season, with Mendelsohn saying the pay was not competitive.

Several Dallas residents were also concerned the now-approved salary rate did not comply with Proposition U.

Prop U, which was voter-approved last year, requires the city to spend no less than 50% of new, annual revenue to fund the police and fire pension. It also mandates that the city increase the number of sworn police officers to a minimum of 4,000, which the department has not yet met.

The ICE 287(g) program fully reimburses participating agencies for the annual salary and benefits of each eligible officer in the program. This includes overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer's annual salary.

Mayor Johnson said DPD could use the funds toward hiring more officers with no impact on the budget.

""Dallas might be forfeiting significant direct financial benefits by declining ICE’s offer,"" Johnson said.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Justice Department's request to put on hold a judge's order that had blocked the deployment while a legal challenge to Trump's action plays out. Portland-based U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term as president, ruled on Oct. 4 that Trump likely acted unlawfully when he ordered troops to Portland.

One judge dissented while the other two ruled in Trump's favour.

Immergut had blocked Trump from sending any National Guard troops to Portland at least until the end of October, and she has scheduled a non-jury trial set to begin on Oct. 29 to determine whether to impose a longer-term block.

Democratic-led states seek to halt deployments

In an extraordinary use of the U.S. armed forces for domestic purposes, Trump has sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Memphis, and announced plans for deployments to Portland and Chicago.

Democratic-led states and cities have filed lawsuits seeking to halt the deployments, and courts have not yet reached a final decision on the legality of Trump's decisions to send the National Guard to U.S. cities.

City and state officials sued the administration in a bid to stop the Portland deployment, arguing that Trump's action violates several federal laws that govern the use of military forces as well as the state's rights under the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment.

The lawsuit accused Trump of exaggerating the severity of protests against his immigration policies to justify illegally seizing control of state National Guard units.

Trump on Sept. 27 ordered 200 National Guard troops to Portland, continuing his administration's unprecedented use of military personnel in U.S. cities to suppress protests and bolster domestic immigration enforcement. Trump called the city ""War ravaged"" and said, ""I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""

Police records provided by the state showed that protests in Portland were ""small and sedate,"" resulting in only 25 arrests in mid-June and no arrests in the three-and-a-half months since June 19.

A federal law called the Posse Comitatus Act generally restricts the use of the U.S. military for domestic law enforcement purposes. In ordering troops to California, Oregon and Illinois, Trump has relied on a law — Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code — that allows a president to deploy state National Guard to repel an invasion, suppress a rebellion or allow the president to execute the law.

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces that answer to state governors except when called into federal service by the president.

The 9th Circuit panel that ruled in the Portland case consisted of two judges appointed by Trump in his first term as president and one appointed by Democratic former President Bill Clinton.

During arguments in the case on Oct. 9, the two Trump-appointed judges suggested that Immergut had focused too closely on protests in the city in September without fully considering more serious protests two months before the troop deployment. Circuit Judge Ryan Nelson said that courts should not engage in a ""day by day"" review of whether troops were needed at any given time.

Immergut issued decisions against the administration on Oct. 4 and Oct. 5, first ruling that Trump could not take over Oregon's National Guard and then ruling that he could not circumvent that decision by calling in National Guard troops from other states.

The judge said there was no evidence that recent protests in Portland rose to the level of a rebellion or seriously interfered with law enforcement, and she said Trump's description of the city as war-ravaged was ""simply untethered to the facts.""

More particularly, he uses them to enforce his immigration policies when other police departments are not willing to bend to his will. His ICE agents even attacked Chicago police officers with tear gas for trying to protect peaceful protesters. Indeed, this is how Trump stops crime — by attacking police officers. The Capitol police can surely attest to Trump’s crime fighting tactics after suffering from a Trump-aroused MAGA mob.

I had long predicted that Trump would first turn on immigrants before proceeding to attack all minorities. That moment has come, as 170 U.S. citizens have been arrested and detained by ICE. These U.S. citizens have been beaten, dragged, kicked, tased and incarcerated. ICE has dragged U.S. citizens out of their beds and held them outside in the rain. Three pregnant women have been manhandled by ICE, one of who had the door of her home blown off while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched.

The fact that these individuals were U.S. citizens did not protect them from being treated like immigrants, who are treated as less than human by ICE. Reportedly, 20 citizens have been detained for more than 24 hours without being allowed to call their family or a lawyer. In addition, 130 citizens, including elected officials, have been arrested by ICE for protesting against the agency or trying to inspect an ICE facility. Every congressperson has a right, as part of Congress’ oversight duties, to inspect federally owned or run facilities. ICE does not let this happen, so congresspersons have been arrested for trying to enter a federal-funded ICE facility in New Jersey.

Trump’s Supreme Court has exacerbated this problem by allowing ICE to use racial profiling in sweeps. Justice Brett Kavanaugh stated that U.S. citizens should not be concerned — you’ve got to love how a white man thinks. Of course he has no concern, because he is white. But God help you if you look or are Hispanic. How many U.S. citizens walk around with their passport? Most do not. So if you get caught up in an ICE sweep, then you should anticipate on being incarcerated.

In the era of Trump, I walk around with my passport card to provide evidence that I am a citizen. I will use this if an ICE officer gives me time to speak or cares whether I am a U.S. citizen.

The advertisements for ICE officers are attracting people who want to beat up immigrants. A lot of these ICE officers would not make it through a police background check, because they are not psychologically fit to be officers.

Ladies and gentlemen, Trump continues to follow the Adolf Hitler playbook, and now he has his ICE Police Department to serve as his Gestapo.

Organizers with the Lake-Geauga Fights Back Network are planning a protest for Monday evening outside of the Lake County Sheriff’s Office. The demonstration is in response to recent agreements signed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a limited partnership.

In mid-September, Sheriff Frank Leonbruno announced his office had signed two agreements to assist ICE with immigration enforcement.

Lake County Sheriff's Office to partner with ICE on immigration enforcement

RELATED: Lake County Sheriff's Office to partner with ICE on immigration enforcement

A section added to federal immigration law in 1996, known as 287(g), allows ICE to partner with local law enforcement agencies. The sheriff said his office received the signed agreements last week, and deputies will need to complete special training before they can officially participate in the program.

One agreement, known as the “Task Force Model” (TFM), allows deputies to enforce immigration laws during routine duties, such as traffic stops. If deputies encounter a person with an ICE detainer, they can take the person into custody and bring them to an ICE detention facility.

A second agreement, called the “Warrant Service Officer” (WSO) program, authorizes trained jail staff to serve and execute ICE warrants on current Lake County jail inmates. If a person set for release is found to be in the country illegally, the jail will hold the inmate for up to 48 hours until ICE agents retrieve the person.

Leonbruno said that the agreements will not change how the county jail operates, explaining the facility will not become an ICE detention center or house immigration detainees under a pay-for-stay model.

He also said the sheriff’s office will not initiate independent immigration violation investigations, nor will it participate in ICE raids unless specifically asked to help with high-risk violent offenders or cartel members.

The agreements have drawn criticism from some who believe they could erode trust with Lake County’s diverse population and encourage profiling.

“People are being asked consistently about their immigration status if they appear to be Hispanic, if they’re playing Spanish music. People have been asked to get out of their car, they’ve been asked to consent to searches in ways that wouldn’t have been expected before,” said Connor Marrott, an organizer with the Lake-Geauga Fights Back Network.

The sheriff has defended the agreements, saying they’re not politically motivated and simply codify the agency’s legal authority to uphold the law.

“It’s our job to ensure that our deputies, our corrections officers, follow the constitution and give the civil rights to individuals that everyone is due. And I believe we do that as a sheriff’s office,” Sheriff Leonbruno told News 5 in September.

A protest is planned for 6 p.m. Monday outside of the Lake County Sheriff’s Office in downtown Painesville.

A victim of illegal behavior by a federal law enforcement officer might sue the United States and seek compensation.
A law enforcement officer, or perhaps a senior law enforcement official, might be criminally prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has cut off the most effective ways of ensuring that federal law enforcement officers comply with the law.","By now, you’ve probably seen some of the videos of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as other federal law enforcement agencies, attacking immigrants and unarmed Americans protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. In one, officers shoot a pastor in the head with a pepper ball. In another, an officer sprays pepper spray directly into the air vent of a protester dressed in an inflatable frog costume — in an apparent attempt to fill the suit with noxious gas.

This administration’s abuse of immigrants, protesters, and Trump’s perceived enemies appears to be systemic. An August report by Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) office identified 510 “credible reports” of human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities since Trump took office in January. ProPublica found that over 170 US citizens have been held by immigration officials, some of whom were beaten or worse.

Even high-ranking elected officials are victims. Last May, for example, federal law enforcement forcibly arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) after Baraka sought a tour of an immigration detention facility. After those charges fell apart, the Trump administration indicted US Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who attempted to shield Baraka from arrest. In a video cited by McIver’s attorneys, one of the officers claims that Baraka’s arrest was ordered by US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Worse, the Supreme Court — or, at least, its six Republicans — appears to be entirely on board with these tactics. In September, the Republican justices voted to block a lower court order that, among other things, forbade ICE from targeting suspected undocumented immigrants solely because of their race. That case is known as Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo.

The Republican justices rarely explain their decisions when they rule in Trump’s favor, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh did write a concurring opinion explaining why he voted the way he did. His assertion that someone targeted by ICE’s “apparent ethnicity” was “relevant” to law enforcement deciding whom to stop has received the most attention, as Kavanaugh seemed to blow off fears that federal law enforcement is targeting Latinos because of their race. But Kavanaugh also strongly implied that no one victimized by ICE may seek an injunction prohibiting ICE from engaging in illegal tactics in the future. (In the wake of this decision, many commentators are now referring to ICE’s tactics as “Kavanaugh stops.”)

So are there any legal avenues left to challenge abusive tactics by ICE, or by other law enforcement agencies controlled by Trump? The short answer is that a few narrow pathways still exist, but they are unlikely to provide a meaningful check on ICE’s behavior.

Broadly speaking, there are five ways that the law could constrain federal law enforcement:

A federal court might issue an injunction against a law enforcement agency, barring it from continuing to engage in a particular illegal practice. Kavanaugh’s opinion in Vasquez Perdomo, however, suggests that this Supreme Court will not allow such an injunction to stand.

A court might order an individual law enforcement officer to compensate the victim of that officer’s illegal action. The Republican justices, however, have largely cut off this avenue in two decisions handed down in the past five years.

A victim of illegal behavior by a federal law enforcement officer might sue the United States and seek compensation. The Supreme Court’s unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013) suggests that this avenue remains open — although it is unlikely that either Trump or any individual officer will change their behavior because they fear that the US Treasury may have to pay out some money at some future date.

A law enforcement officer, or perhaps a senior law enforcement official, might be criminally prosecuted. Such a prosecution would depend on whether an existing criminal law already prohibits the officer’s activity (or potentially, whether it prohibits an order to an officer given by a senior official). And it is unlikely that any such prosecutions will happen for as long as Trump controls the Justice Department.

Finally, until recently, Trump himself could potentially have been prosecuted if he gave an order that violates federal criminal law. But the Republican justices gave Trump sweeping immunity from prosecution in Trump v. United States (2024).

Let’s look at each of these options in a bit more detail.

“Kavanaugh stops,” and injunctions against law enforcement

It is quite difficult to obtain a court order prohibiting a law enforcement agency from committing an illegal action in the future, and it has been for more than four decades. The seminal case is City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983), which held that Adolph Lyons, a man who was allegedly placed in a chokehold by police officers without provocation, could not obtain a court order forbidding the Los Angeles Police Department from using these chokeholds in the future.

Lyons held that “past exposure to illegal conduct” does not permit someone to seek an injunction prohibiting similar conduct in the future. Instead, the Court concluded that “Lyons’ standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.”

To prevail, in other words, Lyons had to show that he personally was likely to be choked a second time, at some point in the future, by a Los Angeles police officer.

In Vasquez Perdomo, Kavanaugh claimed that the plaintiffs’ argument challenging ICE’s actions in that case “largely tracks the theory rejected in Lyons.” The plaintiffs in Vasquez Perdomo alleged that they were stopped by ICE for impermissible reasons, including because they are Latino. But Kavanaugh claimed that they have “no good basis to believe that law enforcement will unlawfully stop them in the future based on the prohibited factors.”

As a factual matter, Kavanaugh’s claim is dubious. A federal appeals court found that “at least one individual with lawful status was stopped twice by roving patrols in just 10 days.” So the fact that ICE targeted this one individual twice in such a short period suggests that they were likely to be targeted again unless a court intervenes. The Trump administration also repeatedly targeted certain businesses where they believed that undocumented people worked — one car wash was hit four times in nine days, according to Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent. So the workers in that car wash sure seemed to be likely to be targeted again in the future.

Ultimately, however, the real facts underlying a Supreme Court case matter a whole lot less than what a majority of the justices say about the facts of a case. Both the Court’s decision in Vasquez Perdomo, and Kavanaugh’s reliance on Lyons in his defense of that decision, suggest that this Court is unlikely to allow anyone who is illegally targeted by ICE to seek an injunction against that law enforcement agency — even if in reality, these very decisions give the Trump administration permission to target the same people over and over again.

The death of Bivens: Why ICE officers can no longer be sued for breaking the law

More than half a century ago, in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1971), the Supreme Court held that the victim of an unconstitutional action by a federal law enforcement officer could sue that officer and potentially collect money damages directly from them. Bivens explained that an officer who acts unlawfully “in the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.” And so it follows that there should be a meaningful remedy to discourage officers from abusing their power.

But this view of accountability has long been out of favor with a majority of the justices. And, in two recent cases, the Court’s Republican majority have come very close to overruling Bivens outright.

In Hernández v. Mesa (2020), the Republican justices ruled that a US Border Patrol agent who allegedly shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican boy in cold blood could not be sued, even if the boy’s parents could prove that the shooting was unjustified. And, in Egbert v. Boule (2022), the Republican justices immunized Border Patrol agents who allegedly used excessive force against an innkeeper from lawsuits.

Both decisions were exceedingly hostile to Bivens. In Egbert, for example, Justice Clarence Thomas’s majority opinion concluded that courts should reject Bivens suits if there is “any rational reason (even one)” to do so.

Given these decisions, it is safe to say that the current slate of justices will not allow an ICE officer to be sued by their victim, even if the officer clearly violated the law or the Constitution.

Suits against the United States: A weak, but still viable, remedy

The Federal Tort Claims Act frequently permits the United States to be sued if a federal law enforcement officer engages in “assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.” And the Supreme Court took a fairly expansive view of how this law applies to bad actions by law enforcement in its unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013), a case about a prisoner who sued corrections officers who allegedly threatened and sexually assaulted him.

So it is likely that even this Supreme Court would allow some victims of illegal activity by ICE, or similar agencies, to sue the federal government and seek compensation from the United States Treasury.

That said, it is doubtful that this remedy will do much to deter future lawless behavior by ICE. Neither an individual law enforcement officer, nor the senior Trump administration officials giving them orders, are likely to change their behavior because, maybe a year from now, a federal judge might order the US Treasury to pay money to someone who was victimized by ICE.

The whole point of Bivens was to impose consequences personally upon rogue officers, so that they will be deterred from breaking the law. A lawsuit requiring US taxpayers to compensate victims is unlikely to achieve the same goal.

Criminal prosecutions: Maybe in the next administration?

Finally, to the extent that any individual law enforcement officer violates a federal criminal statute, they might be prosecuted for doing so. That’s highly unlikely to happen, however, for as long as Trump rules the Justice Department. Any future prosecutions are likely to turn on who wins the 2028 election.

One person who will suffer no criminal consequences, however, no matter how many laws he breaks, is Donald Trump. The Republican justices’ decision in Trump v. United States (2024) held that Trump is immune from prosecution for his official acts as president. That decision even said that he is immune if he orders law enforcement to target someone “for an improper purpose.”

Moreover, even if some law enforcement officer — or maybe some Trump political appointee — is prosecuted for unlawful actions, there is always some risk that the same Republican justices who invented the concept of presidential immunity from prosecution will also decide to immunize officers who were carrying out Trump’s orders. Trump could also use his pardon power to protect them.

So if you hope that ICE officers, and other federal officials who have abused their powers, will someday be held to account for their actions, the news is not good. The Supreme Court has cut off the most effective ways of ensuring that federal law enforcement officers comply with the law.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZOwwaI8iueznh5j.fKKzHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vox_384/047f8ce87f7bc5a3a661fdd296bba27b,N,,2025-10-20 19:21:17.578336

The 36-page ruling lifted a temporary block on the deployment of Oregon and California National Guard soldiers by Judge Karin J. Immergut of the Federal District Court for the District of Oregon. It was not immediately clear whether the order, also allowed the president to use National Guard soldiers from Texas or other states, as he has suggested he might do.

The ruling came from two members of the three-judge panel, Judge Ryan D. Nelson and Judge Bridget S. Bade, both appointees of President Trump. Judge Susan P. Graber, a Clinton appointee, dissented.

The ruling opened the door to some federal troops being stationed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in South Portland that has been the site of street protests since June.

A memo in September from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Guard troops could be stationed anywhere that protests “are occurring or likely to occur” and could accompany federal agents enacting Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda in the field.

The memo came a day after a social-media post by Mr. Trump stating that he would send “all necessary troops” “to protect war-ravaged Portland from “domestic terrorists.”

Such incendiary descriptions do not reflect the reality in Portland, Judge Immergut had written, and have been at odds with law enforcement agencies’ own assessments of protest activity. But that has not stopped the president and other officials from misrepresenting conditions in Portland and in other Democratic-led cities where he wants to send federal forces.

Much of the litigation prompted by his deployment efforts in Portland and in the Chicago area has turned on whether the Trump administration’s accounts of violence at anti-ICE protests are accurate, and whether there is a basis for invoking a federal law that allows the president to deploy the National Guard if “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion,” or if the president is unable to execute U.S. law.

In a preliminary ruling, Judge Immergut, who was nominated to the bench by Mr. Trump, found that while there had been some “violent behavior,” including the construction of a “makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials,” most of it occurred before June 25, and none of it amounted to a rebellion.

The two Ninth Circuit judges who ruled on Monday disagreed with her conclusion.

However, their ruling is unlikely to be the final word in the dispute over the Portland deployment. The state of Oregon and city of Portland, which filed the lawsuit, could ask for an 11-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit to review the decision or appeal directly to the Supreme Court.

Mr. Trump has some additional options as well.

Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, Monday called for a congressional investigation into what they described as the ""unlawful and unconstitutional"" detainment and alleged abuse of U.S. citizens and immigrants by federal agents without a judicial warrant or probable cause.

Bass, alongside Garcia and a group of city workers and immigrant rights activists, said she's worried the continued immigration raids are no longer getting the attention they need.

""What is happening to undocumented immigrants is also happening to U.S. citizens, which means that this can happen to anyone, to all of us, at any period of time,"" Bass said.

Bass once again criticized the federal government for its aggressive and widespread immigration tactics. Democratic leaders representing the greater Los Angeles Area have denounced federal immigration enforcement since operations began in June.

They're asking the public to record ICE activity when they see it and upload the videos to a new master ICE tracker site that they plan to launch within the next few weeks.

Garcia, a ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said American citizens are being dragged off the streets by masked men and thrown into detention cells without access to attorneys.

""No one, regardless of their background or appearance, should be living in fear of being thrown behind bars by their own government because of their race or what they look like,"" Garcia said.

Bass and Garcia said there is evidence that more than 170 U.S. citizens have been detained by federal agents.

""This is not the America we know and love. Every person in this country has rights, and DHS (Department of Homeland Security) must stop trampling on our civil liberties.

The Trump administration has maintained that federal immigration enforcement focuses on the removal of ""violent criminals"" and the ""worst of the worst."" Officials have also denied allegations that detainees are mistreated or held in substandard facilities while in custody.

As for the new investigation, Garcia says Democrats plan to hold a congressional field hearing in Los Angeles so people affected by the ICE sweeps can testify. No date for that hearing has been set yet.

Rather, discussion focussed on the question of whether the protesters have in recent weeks and months rendered the Trump administration unable to enforce federal law.","A federal appeals court on Monday afternoon overturned a lower court’s order that had blocked the Trump administration from deploying the military in Portland.

Two judges on the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that in federalizing Oregon National Guard members, President Donald Trump appeared to be in compliance with a U.S. law which allows such an action when “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Evaluating whether such conditions are met is “inherently subjective,” the majority wrote. But they argued that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut had erred in failing to defer sufficiently to the president’s assessment of the situation on the ground in Portland.

“Rather than reviewing the President’s determination with great deference, the district court substituted its own determination of the relevant facts and circumstances,” the judges wrote, criticizing the lower court order they were overturning.

What immediate effect the order will have is unclear, but the court case is likely far from over, and the core legal questions remains contentious. The third member of the 9th circuit panel, Judge Susan P. Graber, dissented from her colleagues in strong terms.

“Given Portland protesters’ well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority’s ruling, which accepts the government’s characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,” she wrote in her dissent. “But today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions.”

The majority’s order is the latest twist in a winding and high-stakes legal dispute over when the military can be deployed into U.S. cities—and what deference courts should give the president to make that judgement.

Trump and his backers say he needs the National Guard to maintain order in Portland amid persistent protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city.

Critics, like the Oregon governor and the Portland mayor, say the Trump administration is creating fantastical pretexts to bring in the guard to harass and bully Democrat-run jurisdictions.

Early this month, Immergut sided with those critics. She assessed the record of generally small protests outside the ICE facility, and seriously doubted it gave Trump legal justification for a military deployment.

On Monday though, the majority of the appeals court disagreed. The judges were moved by federal officials’ statements that they had to divert significant law enforcement resources to Portland amid the protests. And they argued the lower court had improperly focussed on the nature of the protests in the days and weeks leading up to Trump’s announcement that he would federalize the National Guard, discounting “the violent and disruptive events that occurred in June, July, and August.”

The lower court judge, the majority wrote, should have given more deference to the president’s judgements.

“The district court substituted its own assessment of the facts for the President’s assessment of the facts,” they wrote.

Versions of this fight have been boiling nationwide for months now. Despite local opposition, the Trump administration earlier this year sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Focus turned to Portland late last month, when Trump said he would deploy 200 Oregon National Guard members to restore order to a lost city, whose citizenry was allegedly besieged by by criminal elements and Antifa domestic terrorists.

Suing to block the move, Oregon and Portland officials said the president was acting on the basis of a ridiculous fiction. The law the Trump administration had invoked said he could take command of state national guard troops in circumstances of invasion or rebellion, or when federal laws cannot otherwise be executed. Oregon leaders argued that the small-scale protests that have ebbed and waned since June outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Facility in south Portland clearly met none of those conditions.

Immergut’s opinion in Oregon’s favor included a lengthy factual record of recent events outside the ICE facility. Protests in June indeed featured violent behavior, the judge found, but in recent months, demonstrations were generally peaceful and small, easily managed by law enforcement. Assessing various reports, she found that, despite the Trump administration’s claims of chaos in the weeks leading up to his move to sent troops to pacify Portland, in reality not much during that period had happened there at all.

The president, Immergut wrote, “is certainly entitled ‘a great level of deference,’ in his determination that he ‘is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States. But ‘a great level of deference’ is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.”

With this, she issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump-directed Oregon National Guard mission while litigation proceeded.

But the Trump administration had other plans.

One of these was to swiftly deploy National Guard troops from other states to Portland. Less than 24 hours after the first restraining order kicked in, the Oregon governor reported that federalized troops from the California National Guard had arrived in the state without her consent (or that of the California governor). Soon after came the news that the Texas National Guard was planning to come as well.

Immergut was displeased. The Trump administration, she said in an emergency hearing late Sunday, was operating in direct contravention of her earlier order. The judge then issued a wider restraining order, blocking troops from other states from coming to Oregon too.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration awaited its pending appeal with a higher court, where it argued Immergut had erred in her decision to block the deployment.

Soon after, the appeals court heard oral arguments over Zoom. An attorney for Oregon and the Trump administration each presented to a three judge-panel, who in turn peppered them with questions.

The hearing featured no mention of a notable wrinkle: the argument made by the City of Portland and others that physically aggressive federal agents were in many cases making the situation more, not less combustible—and that the arrival of military was likely to make things worse.

Rather, discussion focussed on the question of whether the protesters have in recent weeks and months rendered the Trump administration unable to enforce federal law.

Questions from the two Trump appointees in particular seemed to suggest they though the president had a solid case on this front, especially if they expanded their lens back to June, when the protests were so violent and disruptive that officials said they had to temporarily close the ICE facility entirely.

Then there was a headier question: Were courts in a position to question Trump’s military judgements at all?

A skeptical Judge Ryan D. Nelson told Oregon’s Assistant Attorney General Stacy Marie Chaffin that she seemed to want to focus on what’s going on with the protests outside—whether they rose to a certain level.

But this, the judge suggested, was perhaps the wrong lens. Whether protests are making it so the president can’t enforce federal law was a matter, the judge said, of “internal decision making.” He added that, “Whether there is a ton of protest or low protest—they can still have an impact on his ability to execute the laws.”",https://www.wweek.com/resizer/v2/IM7OFPDOVNG2JG75OKWUPO3ROQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=6d0bbc5f39573766f53b90ba514b68f2c22088a97a7952e7c626ef82aa4b1aef&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-20 16:17:03.506193

Trump federalized 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to protect an Immigration and Customs Enforcement building. The state and city filed a lawsuit challenging the move and U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut in Portland blocked the action temporarily by ruling that Trump likely acted unlawfully.

A 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled 2-1 on Oct. 20 that Trump is authorized to deploy troops when ""the President is unable with the regular forces to executive the laws of the United States."" Judges Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, who were both appointed by Trump, said he acted within ""a range of honest judgment.""

Judge Susan Graber, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, disagreed. She wrote that Congress authorized calling up the National Guard only to repel a foreign invasion, quell a rebellion or overcome an inability to execute the laws, not to combat protesters in chicken suits and inflatable frog costumes.

""Consequently, no legal or factual justification supported the order to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard,"" Graber wrote.

The two judges in the majority said they didn’t agree with Trump’s assessment that Portland was a ""war zone"" for him to act.

""The dissent erroneously asserts that we 'accept the government’s characterization of Portland as a war zone,'"" Nelson and Bade wrote. ""Clearly, we do not.""

Democratic-led states seek to halt deployments

The decision is the latest in disputes between Trump and local officials about deploying troops to quell protests against immigration enforcement. Three federal judges have ruled against Trump in California, Illinois and Oregon but appeals courts have split.

The 9th Circuit previously backed Trump’s use of troops in Los Angeles. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that troops should stay out of Chicago for now.

Trump on Sept. 27 ordered 200 National Guard troops to Portland, continuing his administration's unprecedented use of military personnel in U.S. cities to suppress protests and bolster domestic immigration enforcement. Trump called the city ""War ravaged"" and said, ""I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""

The lawsuit from Oregon and Portland accused Trump of exaggerating the severity of protests against his immigration policies to justify illegally seizing control of state National Guard units. Police records provided by the state showed that protests in Portland were ""small and sedate,"" resulting in only 25 arrests in mid-June and no arrests months since June 19.

Immergut has scheduled a non-jury trial set to begin on Oct. 29 to determine whether to impose a longer-term block.

A federal law called the Posse Comitatus Act generally restricts the use of the U.S. military for domestic law enforcement purposes. In ordering troops to California, Oregon and Illinois, Trump has relied on a law that allows a president to deploy state National Guard to repel an invasion, suppress a rebellion or allow the president to execute the law.

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces that answer to state governors except when called into federal service by the president.

We go now to California, where immigrant rights/labor icon Dolores Huerta addressed the “No Kings” rally Saturday in Watsonville.

DOLORES HUERTA: People here that are right now being arrested, deported and terrorized, they are not immigrants. They are the Indigenous people of the continent. The real immigrants to the United States came from Europe, right?

AMY GOODMAN: That was Dolores Huerta. She is 95 years old. Amidst intensifying immigration raids, she’s joined with People for the American Way and the Dolores Huerta Foundation to release a short film that shows neighbors joining together in nonviolent civil disobedience to protect a dramatized immigrant elder from being zip-tied and disappeared by ICE. It’s a dramatization. At the end of the video, the ICE agents hear protesters outside, including Dolores Huerta, and stop their arrest. She released this right before the No Kings rally and is joining us from her home in California.

Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Dolores. Talk about what you told the crowd and how large that gathering was for Watsonville and the significance of Watsonville, the center of migrant worker organizing in California.

DOLORES HUERTA: Yes, we had a really great rally. We had a lot of farmworkers that were there. And, of course, people lined the streets with their signs. And it was just amazing. And as you know, here in California, we were some of the first people hit by the Border Patrol and ICE, and they arrested 90 people. And of those 90 people, only one person out of the 90 had any kind of a criminal record, which could be a traffic ticket, some kind of misdemeanor.

And we just have to say to everyone, this is not about going after immigrants. This is about going after people of color. This is ethnic cleansing. This is what — exactly what is happening now in the United States of America. And God knows that we have to put a stop to it. We have never seen such horrific, horrific attacks on our people.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about ICE targeting day labor centers in Los Angeles, for example, the Van Nuys center being raided 14 times since June, the focus on labor, on workers who are out at work when they are taken?

DOLORES HUERTA: Yes, not only farmworkers, but we know our hospitality workers that work in our hotels, people who are laborers that work on construction sites. I mean, absolutely no one is safe. If you happen to be just anybody on the street that happens to be a person that looks Latino or Asian or Black, you are subjected to the kidnapping and all of these tortures. And as we know, people have already been killed. You know, this is the kind of horrific, horrific terrorism that the Latino and the people of color community are now living. And God knows that it has to stop. It has to stop.

And so, it’s so important, here in California, we’re working on Proposition 50, which will be voted on on November the 4th, and so that we can change the Congress, because we know that our Congress is the one that has allocated the funding. The millions of dollars that they’re giving to ICE and for the detention centers, this is all coming from our own government, not only the president, but the Congress right now. The current Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, is putting all of these horrible maneuvers in place right now to terrorize our community. And God knows it’s got to be stopped. And we know we have elections in 2026, and so we are now preparing the ground so that we can get more Democrats, more progressive people in the Congress, so that we could stop the madness that is happening to our community.

AMY GOODMAN: Dolores Huerta, you, Maxine Waters, other U.S. citizens have filed a petition with the Carrillo Law Firm to the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the Trump administration for potential human rights violations, denouncing these ICE raids as a form of ethnic cleansing. Can you talk about the significance of this petition?

DOLORES HUERTA: The petition itself is actually — and the law firm is representing several U.S. citizens that have been detained, arrested or attacked by ICE agents. And so, they are actually representing U.S. citizens and people that have the documented right to work here in United States of America, and yet they have been detained, and they have been attacked by the ICE agents. And we are hoping that we can get many more people here in the United States to also sign on to that petition.

And we are asking the United Nations to please send an envoy to the United States, as ridiculous as it sounds, but to think that we have to petition the United Nations to come in and investigate what is happening to people of color here in the United States of America, just like they did in Guatemala when all of the assassinations were taking place in Guatemala and the people that were being attacked. You know, we have a similar situation here in United States, and we need — we need help. And we’re not — we can’t get it from our own government. Maybe people in the United Nations can help and assist us.

AMY GOODMAN: There were many around the country who called for a general strike, you know, bringing together the issue of labor and immigrant rights. You are a leading labor/immigrant rights activist. In your final comment in these 30 seconds, do you endorse this?

DOLORES HUERTA: Absolutely, but we know it has to take a lot of good planning to make sure it’s effective. And we also want to say to people, you can go to aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights to help you get more information, and also to nilc.org/resources. Everybody has rights. Everybody —

Charles E. Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump’s immigration policies had a major role in the reduction of immigration cases, including encouraging migrants to self-deport.
Congress over the past decade has provided funding for additional immigration judges and support staff to boost the overall capacity of the asylum and deportation system.
“We still have a massive backlog, so we still need quite a few immigration judges be able to get caught up completely on the backlog,” Lankford said.
“There have been proposals to try to dramatically increase the funding when it comes to immigration judges.
“So we need more immigration judges.”","The Trump administration’s tough-on-immigration policies are on pace to reduce the backlog of cases in the nation’s immigration courts, reversing a long-running trend that has raised concerns from lawmakers of both parties.

The number of pending cases in the asylum and deportation system reached an all-time high of 3.7 million cases at the end of fiscal 2024, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, which compiles data on immigration enforcement.

But the number had dropped to 3.4 million, a decrease of about 8 percent, with one month remaining in fiscal 2025, the data shows, the first decline in the backlog since at least 2012. As of March, the average wait time for those in the backlog was 636 days, TRAC reported.

The decrease comes as President Trump Donald Trump has instituted restrictive policies on immigration that cut off entryways for migrants, effectively ending asylum applications and bringing the total number of apprehensions of illegal crossers to all-time lows, immigration experts said.

Andrew R. Arthur, a former immigration judge and fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for limiting immigration, identified “shutting off that valve at the border” as a main reason for the reduction in the backlog, pointing out 140,000 more immigration cases were completed than were filed in the first nine months of 2025.

But Arthur also attributed the decline to an influx of cases being decided against applicants in absentia because they didn’t show up in court. Nearly 219,000 cases in the first nine months of 2025 were decided without the applicant appearing in court, compared to 91,356 cases in 2019, Arthur said.

“I mean, if you don’t show up, it’s really easy to complete your case,” Arthur said.

Asylum applicants who have had their cases decided against them after they didn’t show in court, Arthur said, are subject to a fine and “if they come across you, or they go out and pick you up, you’re basically on your way out of the United States.”

Greg Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has an estimated 18,000 immigration attorneys affiliated with his network, also acknowledged attorneys have observed an increasing number of cases being decided in absentia.

Chen said that’s the result of applicants being afraid that if they come to court a judge will unfairly dismiss their case and leave them vulnerable to immediate deportation, pointing to reports that found officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement were asking judges to dismiss the cases so they could detain those people immediately.

“I am concerned that people are afraid now to appear in court, even if they believe they have a valid case, because they do not think the courts are going to give them the fair due process that Americans expect out of our courts,” Chen said. “And the courts are making decisions to find them to be deportable, removal from the country, in absentia, without them being present.”

The number of pending immigration cases remains at a staggering high compared to fiscal years past. The number more than doubled during Trump’s first term, from 620,000 in fiscal 2017 to 1.3 million in fiscal 2020. Then the number nearly tripled during the Biden administration, to 3.7 million at the end of fiscal 2024, which was just ahead of the 2024 presidential election where immigration enforcement was a main topic.

Sen. Charles E. Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump’s immigration policies had a major role in the reduction of immigration cases, including encouraging migrants to self-deport.

“My common sense tells me it’s because we’ve had people willingly leave the country that were here illegally,” the Iowa Republican said.

Congress over the past decade has provided funding for additional immigration judges and support staff to boost the overall capacity of the asylum and deportation system. The number of immigration judges increased to around 700 in recent years.

Both Republicans and Democrats during that time proposed an increase in judges when they controlled the appropriations process, and as part of bipartisan proposals on border security.

The latest increase was in this year’s reconciliation package, which included $3.3 billion for the Justice Department, a portion of which would go to the Executive Office for Immigration Review to hire immigration judges and staff. The law also caps the number of immigration judges at 800.

Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a Republican and member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the decrease in the backlog of immigration cases was “significant,” but that doesn’t change the need to add more immigration judges to the roster.

“We still have a massive backlog, so we still need quite a few immigration judges be able to get caught up completely on the backlog,” Lankford said. “That is very long.”

Lankford was among the senators who assembled and pressed for passage of a bipartisan border bill last Congress that included $440 million for more immigration judges.

Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat and also a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the decline in immigration cases may be because “people feel under attack in many different ways,” but also said the remainder of cases demonstrates the need for more immigration judges.

“The huge backlog that we’ve had when it comes to immigration cases, just shows maybe it would take well over a decade to even just get through some of the backlog that we’ve already had,” Kim said. “There have been proposals to try to dramatically increase the funding when it comes to immigration judges. I would support an effort like that.”

Arthur said the decline in the immigration backlog does “absolutely not” indicate a change in the need for adding more immigration judges to the bench, saying he’s “confident” the cap on immigration judges at 800 will be taken out in the next congressional omnibus package.

“Because you still got a huge number of cases, and some of those cases are taking years to complete,” Arthur said. “So we need more immigration judges.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238189274.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 15:57:07.579679

Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.","When the Supreme Court recently allowed immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to take race into consideration during sweeps, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that citizens shouldn’t be concerned.

“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote, “they promptly let the individual go.”

But that is far from the reality many citizens have experienced. Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched.

About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.

Videos of U.S. citizens being mistreated by immigration agents have filled social media feeds, but there is little clarity on the overall picture. The government does not track how often immigration agents hold Americans.

So ProPublica created its own count.

We compiled and reviewed every case we could find of agents holding citizens against their will, whether during immigration raids or protests. While the tally is almost certainly incomplete, we found more than 170 such incidents during the first nine months of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

Among the citizens detained are nearly 20 children, including two with cancer. That includes four who were held for weeks with their undocumented mother and without access to the family’s attorney until a congresswoman intervened.

Immigration agents do have authority to detain Americans in limited circumstances. Agents can hold people whom they reasonably suspect are in the country illegally. We found more than 50 Americans who were held after agents questioned their citizenship. They were almost all Latino.

Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers. We compiled cases of about 130 Americans, including a dozen elected officials, accused of assaulting or impeding officers.

These cases have often wilted under scrutiny. In nearly 50 instances that we have identified so far, charges have never been filed or the cases were dismissed. Our count found a handful of citizens have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors.

Among the detentions in which allegations have not stuck, masked agents pointed a gun at, pepper sprayed and punched a young man who had filmed them searching for his relative. In another, agents knocked over and then tackled a 79-year-old car wash owner, pressing their knees into his neck and back. His lawyer said he was held for 12 hours and wasn’t given medical attention despite having broken ribs in the incident and having recently had heart surgery. In a third case, agents grabbed and handcuffed a woman on her way to work who was caught up in a chaotic raid on street vendors. In a complaint filed against the government, she described being held for more than two days, without being allowed to contact the outside world for much of that time. (The Supreme Court has ruled that two days is generally the longest federal officials can hold Americans without charges.)

In response to questions from ProPublica, the Department of Homeland Security said agents do not racially profile or target Americans. “We don’t arrest US citizens for immigration enforcement,” wrote spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

A top immigration official recently acknowledged agents do consider someone’s looks. “How do they look compared to, say, you?” Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino said to a white reporter in Chicago.

The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted. “Interfering with law enforcement and assaulting law enforcement is a crime and anyone, regardless of immigration status, will be held accountable,” said the Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson. “Officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens, and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism.”

A spokesperson for Kavanaugh did not return an emailed request for comment.

Tallying the number of Americans detained by immigration agents is inherently messy and incomplete. The government has long ignored recommendations for it to track such cases, even as the U.S. has a history of detaining and even deporting citizens, including during the Obama administration and Trump’s first term.

We compiled cases by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We did not include arrests of protesters by local police or the National Guard. Nor did we count cases in which arrests were made at a later date after a judicial process. That included cases of some people charged with serious crimes, like throwing rocks or tossing a flare to start a fire.

Experts say that Americans appear to be getting picked up more now as a result of the government doing something that it hasn’t for decades: large-scale immigration sweeps across the country, often in communities that do not want them.

In earlier administrations, deportation agents used intelligence to target specific individuals, said Scott Shuchart, a top immigration official in the Biden, Obama and first Trump administrations. “The new idea is to use those resources unintelligently” — with officers targeting communities or workplaces where undocumented immigrants may be.

When federal officers roll through communities in the way the Supreme Court permitted, the constitutional rights of both citizens and noncitizens are inevitably violated, argued David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. He recently analyzed how sweeps in Los Angeles have led to racial profiling. “If the government can grab someone because he’s a certain demographic group that’s correlated with some offense category, then they can do that in any context.”

Cody Wofsy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, put it even more starkly. “Any one of us could be next.”

When Kavanaugh issued his opinion that immigration agents can consider race and other factors, the Supreme Court’s three liberal justices strongly dissented. They warned that citizens risked being “grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.”

Leonardo Garcia Venegas appears to have been just such a case. He was working at a construction site in coastal Alabama when he saw masked immigration agents from Homeland Security Investigations hop a fence and run by a “No trespassing” sign. Garcia Venegas recalled that they moved toward the Latino workers, ignoring the white and Black workers.

Garcia Venegas began filming after his undocumented brother asked agents for a warrant. In response, the footage shows, agents yanked his brother to the ground, shoving his face into wet concrete. Garcia Venegas kept filming until officers grabbed him too and knocked his phone to the ground.

Other co-workers filmed what happened next, as immigration agents twisted the 25-year-old’s arms. They repeatedly tried to take him to the ground while he yelled, “I’m a citizen!”

Officers pulled out his REAL ID, which Alabama only issues to those legally in the U.S. But the agents dismissed it as fake. Officers held Garcia Venegas handcuffed for more than an hour. His brother was later deported.

Garcia Venegas was so shaken that he took two weeks off of work. Soon after he returned, he was working alone inside a nearly built house listening to music on his headphones when he sensed someone watching him. A masked immigration agent was standing in the bedroom doorway.

This time, agents didn’t tackle him. But they again dismissed his REAL ID. And then they held him to check his citizenship. Garcia Venegas says agents also held two other workers who had legal status.

DHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about Garcia Venegas’ detentions, or to a federal lawsuit he filed last month. The agency has previously defended the agents’ conduct, saying he “physically got in between agents and the subject” during the first incident. The footage does not show that, and Garcia Venegas was never charged with obstruction or any other crime.

Garcia Venegas’ lawyers at the nonprofit Institute for Justice hope others may join his suit. After all, the reverberations of the immigration sweeps are being felt widely. Garcia Venegas said he knows of 15 more raids on nearby construction sites, and the industry along his portion of the Gulf Coast is struggling for lack of workers.

Kavanaugh’s assurances hold little weight for Garcia Venegas. He’s a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, who speaks little English and works in construction. Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.

“If they decide they want to detain you,” he said. “You’re not going to get out of it.”

George Retes was among the citizens arrested despite immigration agents appearing to know his legal status. He also disappeared into the system for days without being able to contact anyone on the outside.

The only clue Retes’ family had at first was a brief call he managed to make on his Apple Watch with his hands handcuffed behind his back. He quickly told his wife that “ICE” had arrested him during a massive raid and protest on the marijuana farm where he worked as a security guard.

Still, Retes’ family couldn’t find him. They called every law enforcement agency they could think of. No one gave them any answers.

Eventually, they spotted a TikTok video showing Retes driving to work and slowly trying to back up as he’s caught between agents and protestors. Through the tear gas and dust, his family recognized Retes’ car and the veteran decal on his window. The full video shows a man — Retes — splayed on the ground surrounded by agents.

Retes’ family went to the farm, where local TV reporters were interviewing families who couldn’t find their loved ones.

“They broke his window, they pepper sprayed him, they grabbed him, threw him on the floor,” his sister told a reporter between sobs. “We don’t know what to do. We’re just asking to let my brother go. He didn’t do anything wrong. He’s a veteran, disabled citizen. It says it on his car.”

Retes was held for three days without being given an opportunity to make a call. His family only learned where he had been after his release. His leg had been cut from the broken glass, Retes told ProPublica, and lingering pepper spray burned his hands.He tried to soothe them by filling sandwich bags with water.

Retes recalled that agents knew he was a citizen. “They didn’t care.” He said one DHS official laughed at him, saying he shouldn’t have come to work that day. “They still sent me away to jail.” He added that cases like his show Kavanaugh was “wrong completely.”

DHS did not answer our questions about Retes. It did respond on X after Retes wrote an op-ed last month in the San Francisco Chronicle. An agency post asserted he was arrested for assault after he “became violent and refused to comply with law enforcement.” Yet Retes had been released without any charges. Indeed, he says he was never told why he was arrested.

The Department of Justice has encouraged agents to arrest anyone interfering with immigration operations, twiceordering law enforcement to prioritize cases of those suspected of obstructing, interfering with or assaulting immigration officials.

But the government’s claims in those cases have often not been borne out.

Daniel Montenegro was filming a raid at a Van Nuys, California, Home Depot with other day-laborer advocates this summer when, he told ProPublica, he was tackled by several officers who injured his back.

Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw the LA raids and has since taken similar operations to cities like Sacramento and Chicago, tweeted out the names and photos of Montenegro and three others, accusing them of using homemade tire spikes to disable vehicles.

“I had no idea where that story came from,” Montenegro told ProPublica. “I didn’t find out until we were released. People were like, ‘We saw you on Twitter and the news and you guys are terrorists, you were planning to slash tires.’ I never saw those spike tire-popper things.”

Officials have not charged Montenegro or the others with any crimes. (Bovino did not respond to a request for comment, while DHS defended him in a statement to ProPublica: “Chief Bovino’s success in getting the worst of the worst out of the country speaks for itself.”)

The government’s cases are sometimes so muddied that it’s unclear why agents actually arrested a citizen.

Andrea Velez was charged with assaulting an officer after she was accidentally dropped off for work during a raid on street vendors in downtown Los Angeles. She said in a federal complaint that officers repeatedly assumed she did not speak English. Federal officers later requested access to her phone in an attempt to prove she was colluding with another citizen arrested that day, who was charged with assault. She was one of the Americans held for more than two days.

DHS did not respond to our questions about Velez, but it has previously accused her of assaulting an officer. A federal judge has dismissed the charges.

Other citizens also said officers accused them of crimes and suddenly questioned their citizenship — including a man arrested after filming Border Patrol agents break a truck window, and a pregnant woman who tried to stop officers from taking her boyfriend.

The prospects for any significant reckoning over agents’ conduct, even against citizens, are dim. The paths for suing federal agents are even more limited than they are for local police. And that’s if agents can even be identified. What’s more, the administration has gutted the office that investigates allegations of abuse by agents.

Bass and the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), announced that Congress will open up “a broad investigation” into arrests of U.S. citizens by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, as well as another investigation into immigration raids overall. The announcement was made Monday at a news conference at L.A. City Hall.

“Donald Trump and [Department of Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem are terrorizing immigrants, working people, the people of Los Angeles and of our state every single day,” Garcia said. “They violate the law and they violate the constitution.”

Garcia said that his House committee would investigate “every single brutal misconduct” that immigration authorities have committed in Los Angeles as well as across the country.

Simultaneously, the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will conduct an investigation into reports of the detention of at least 170 U.S. citizens by immigration authorities, which was reported by ProPublica last week.

“Troublingly, the pattern of U.S. Citizen arrests coincides with an alarming increase in racial profiling — particularly of Latinos — which has been well documented in Los Angeles,” Garcia and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote in a letter to Noem. “In a pattern symptomatic of a disregard for civil rights by DHS, U.S. citizens have faced extended periods of detention.”

For months, agents have roamed the streets of Los Angeles toting guns and chasing down immigrants. The scenes that have played out on the streets — protesters being arrested, immigrants dragged out of their cars — have been repeated in Chicago and other cities with largely Democratic leadership.

Mayor Bass said the arrests of American citizens means that no one in the country is safe.

“This can happen to anyone, to all of us, at any period of time,” she said.

Garcia said that the first hearing of the House committee will be held in Los Angeles and that Angelenos should attend and be heard on immigration enforcement issues.

The congressman did not give a date for the hearing, but said he hoped it would be soon.

In the letter that Garcia and Blumenthal sent to Noem on Monday, the legislators called on the Department of Homeland Security to report the total number of U.S. citizens who have been detained by immigration authorities, as well as how long each individual was detained. They also asked for information regarding the training that CE and Customs and Border Protection agents receive on use of force, among other things.

The total spending by ICE in the small arms category between January 20 and October 18, 2024, was $9,715,843.
Spending by ICE on guns and other weapons this year not only dwarfs spending during the Biden administration but also during Trump’s first term.
Average ICE spending on small arms during Trump’s first four years was about $8.4 million.
More weapons, more violence The surge in spending on ICE weaponry has coincided with a wave of violent incidents by ICE officers.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has sharply increased its spending on weapons in 2025, according to an analysis of federal government contracting data by Popular Information. Records from the Federal Procurement Data System reveal that ICE has increased spending on “small arms, ordnance, and ordnance accessories manufacturing” by 700% compared to 2024 levels.

New spending in the small arms category from January 20, 2025, the day Trump was inaugurated, through October 18, totaled $71,515,762. Most of the spending was on guns and armor, but there have also been significant purchases of chemical weapons and “guided missile warheads and explosive components.”

On September 29, 2025, ICE made a $9,098,590 purchase from Geissele Automatics, which sells semi-automatic and automatic rifles. The total spending by ICE in the small arms category between January 20 and October 18, 2024, was $9,715,843.

Spending by ICE on guns and other weapons this year not only dwarfs spending during the Biden administration but also during Trump’s first term. In 2019, for example, ICE spent $5.7 million on small arms through October 18. Average ICE spending on small arms during Trump’s first four years was about $8.4 million.

The data likely understates new spending on weaponry deployed in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, since many other federal agencies beyond ICE have been involved. But it provides a window into how ICE and other agencies are bringing an unprecedented number of high-powered weapons into American cities.

More weapons, more violence

The surge in spending on ICE weaponry has coincided with a wave of violent incidents by ICE officers. Several dangerous situations have been captured on video.

Last month in Illinois, a pastor, Reverend David Black, was shot in the face with a pepper ball by an ICE officer. In another September incident, an ICE officer dropped his gun while violently making an arrest and then pointed it at bystanders.

An ICE officer also allegedly shot a pepper ball at the vehicle of a CBS News Chicago reporter in September. The reporter’s window was open, allowing chemical agents “to engulf the inside of her truck,” which “caused her to vomit.”

In August, US Marine Corps veteran Daryn Herzberg was hospitalized “after being tackled from behind by ICE agents while protesting outside a federal facility in Portland.”

At the time he was attacked, Herzberg was criticizing ICE officers “for firing down on unarmed protesters.” A video shows “an agent grabbing Herzberg by the hair and slamming his face into the ground multiple times while saying, ‘You’re not talking shit anymore are you?’”

In July, an aggressive ICE raid of a California cannabis farm left several workers injured and one dead. Jaime Alanís Garcia, who was not a target of the raid, climbed onto a greenhouse roof to escape the chaos and fell 30 feet to his death.

“What we’re seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers,” Ed Yohnka of ACLU Illinois told NPR. Yohnka has filed a lawsuit on behalf of protesters, including Pastor Black, arguing that ICE’s tactics violate their constitutional rights.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S0mI!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0597981-eec5-4bd2-8b7b-aa85d365bad2_1024x683.jpeg",N,,2025-10-20 18:17:16.441594

“Mahmoud Khalil should never have been targeted or detained by the U.S. government in the first place,” said Justin Mazzola, Deputy Director of Research at Amnesty International USA. “The Trump administration must respect the rights to freedom of expression and assembly and abandon its efforts to punish Mahmoud Khalil for protesting Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza through its relentless pursuit to detain and deport him.

“Targeting and threatening peaceful protesters and their immigration status for speaking out on the human rights of Palestinians, or any other issue, is a clear violation of human rights. This policy is intended to send a chilling warning: that anyone exercising their rights will be subject to arbitrary arrest, detention, and deportation by this administration. The Trump administration must stop it’s targeting of students and activists to instill fear and silence dissent.”

Khalil’s case is not isolated. At least ten other international students or activists were similarly targeted for deportation by the government for their advocacy on Palestinian human rights. This includes Leqaa Kordia, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman, who was targeted for her participation in a 2024 protest outside Columbia University. She has been arbitrarily detained since March 13, 2025. Amnesty International is also calling for her release.

“The Trump administration must stop using threats, intimidation, detention, and other authoritarian practices as political weapons to silence dissent,” said Mazzola. “This cruel attack on human rights must stop and the Trump administration must stop targeting Mahmoud Khalil and end its efforts to deport him.”

Background:

On March 8, 2025, U.S. immigration authorities unlawfully arrested and arbitrarily detained Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, Palestinian activist and student organizer who recently graduated from Columbia University. Mahmoud was targeted for his role in student protests at Columbia University.

After more than three months of being unjustly detained, on June 20, 2025, Mahmoud was released on bail, and has been reunited with his wife and newborn child as his immigration case proceeds. At that time, U.S. authorities informed him his permanent residency status was revoked and that he was being placed in deportation proceedings.

As Mahmoud’s legal challenges continue, a federal magistrate judge eased his travel restrictions within the U.S. on October 16, 2025, which will allow him to speak publicly on his case.

In the oral argument set for October 21, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments about whether the government can re-detain him as his case proceeds.

Amnesty International has also called on colleges and universities to take steps to ensure their students and faculty can exercise their right to protest in support of Palestinian rights and other issues and is supporting students working to pass a firewall for freedom resolution on their campuses.",https://www.amnestyusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Mahmoud-Khalil-e1756325153526.png,N,,2025-10-20 14:58:01.987340

Speaking to GBH News from Guatemala, Mejia said he was first arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on September 17th. He was driving his sister to her job at Market Basket in Revere when they were pulled over by three black SUVs.

He said he was anxious after seeing news reports about aggressive ICE agents and that he complied with their commands.

“The guy said, ‘Sergio, I know who you are. So open the door. Open your windows and open doors. And you know what happens next if you don’t do that,’” he said. “I was in shock — I didn’t even hear what exactly they said but I’m sure they, I’m kind of sure like they said, like, if I have papers basically.”

At one point, an agent told him he had an order for removal for failing to appear at a court hearing years before, which he said didn’t initially make any sense to him.

Mejia was arrested and sent to a detention center in New York, and then on to another one in Louisiana. The conditions at both were inhumane, he said. His attorney filed an appeal in Boston on September 25th, arguing that the circumstances warranted having his immigration case reopened. But within days, as a judge was still considering his appeal, Mejia was deported to Guatemala, leaving behind a partner, an infant, a toddler and a daughter with autism.

Arrest and Deportation

Mejia crossed into the U.S. at the Mexican border in mid-2006 as an unaccompanied minor at the age of 16.

In a signed declaration to the court, Mejia said he was threatened in his home country by MS-13 gang members, who approached him three to four times a week when he was leaving school.

“I didn’t feel safe living in Guatemala, because when I told them I would not join them, they started to threaten and harass me,” he said in the declaration.

After crossing the border, he was detained and released into U.S. He moved in with an uncle in Lynn and provided that address to immigration officials. Without an attorney and not yet knowing English, Mejia attended two immigration hearings with his uncle in 2007. But that year, he was ordered removed in absentia when he didn’t show up to a third immigration court date that he now says he didn’t know about.

Attorneys argue in court documents that his failure to appear as a 17-year-old should be “imputed” on his uncle, who Mejia accuses of withholding immigration documents from him and abusing him.

The motion to re-open his case was filed on September 26th and cited “exceptional circumstances beyond his control” as a youth. His attorneys also asked for a stay of his removal from the U.S. and filed an asylum claim while he was detained.

Still, he was deported on October 1st, with little notice and no ability to call anyone. Mejia was led onto a plane he described as packed with people, including a family with children.

On that same day, immigration Judge Michelle Kahan granted his motion to reopen his case, rescinding his 2007 removal order. But by that point, Mejia was already on his way to Guatemala.

“The day he was removed from the United States was the day it was granted, which makes things even worse,” said Nael, his attorney. “Now this realization was like, they’re probably already on notice that it was granted and they still wrongfully removed him.”

Nael said she has never seen a client deported while a motion to reopen a case is still pending. She said he has no criminal record or interaction with police here or abroad.

“This is technically going against the client’s due process rights. They should have waited to see if the judge was going to grant or deny the motion to reopen instead of just removing him out of state without a decision,” she said.

U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, whose district includes Chelsea, issued a statement calling for Mejia’s immediate return. She called the deportation “a brazen violation of his right to due process and another damning example of the Trump administration trampling on the constitutional rights of Massachusetts residents.”

Pressley indicated that the federal shutdown was complicating her ability to get more information about the case due to the closure of ICE’s congressional relations office.

Impact on Family

In Guatemala, Mejia is living with a family member and says he has fallen into depression. He had to take a bus to another town to borrow a phone with a signal to talk to GBH News.

“I don’t know what’s going to happen with my kids. I’m far away from them, like I miss them every day, every minute,” he said.

Mejia is worried about the strain on his wife, who must now take care of the children but also find a way to pay the bills.

“She’s doing really bad — worse and worse. I’m afraid that something can happen to her and the kids because I can hear her like … in depression, it’s the pressure,” he said.

His partner, who GBH News is not naming due to her own deportation fears, said “every day has been difficult — my oldest can’t be alone at home, and I’m dedicated to taking care of her. I think … what am I going to do with three children?”

Mejia has a 3-year-old, Liam, and an infant, Ailany, who was just over two weeks old when he was detained. He also has been the long-time parent to his partner’s 14-year-old daughter, Ashley, who was abandoned by her biological father as a baby. She was recently diagnosed with autism, according to medical records shared with GBH News.

“The kids keep asking ‘Why isn’t dad coming? When will be home?’” she said.

The partner told GBH News that the impact of Mejia’s deportation on the kids has been devastating. Liam won’t eat much, and Ashley is afraid to go to school, worried her mom will be gone when she returns.

Her educational records from Chelsea High School show that she requires speech therapy, motor skill training, and a “high level of adult support and supervision.”

Mejia’s aunt, Julia Ayala, has been driving down from Lynn to help care for the children, and bring food. She told GBH News that the day Mejia called from Guatemala, his deportation came as “a shock”.

“I started crying, because I knew he was out of the country, it’s hard to come back, and he has children,” Ayala said. “They depend on him for everything.”

Mejia was working full time as a painter to pay all of the family’s expenses. Julia tried speaking to their landlord to delay paying the rent with little luck, but family members chipped in for October rent.

Records shared with GBH News show that Mejia has paid taxes for at least the last ten years. A number of support letters, including from colleagues, friends and family called him a “role model,” an “honest man, trustworthy” and that he works “tirelessly to support his partner, toddler and newborn baby.”

A Mass General Hospital-Chelsea Healthcare Center doctor who cares for Ashley also wrote to the government saying he plays “an important role in her ongoing care and is essential to supporting her overall health.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/bc95f31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1080x567+0+69/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2Fec%2F78c95bb548f1b0bac8766652d04f%2Folder-kids-and-sergio.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:58:29.454451

Castro also suggests people think about selling their property or transferring their financial assets to someone they trust in Chicago.
“We will explain to them it’s going to be a difficult situation.” Many Mexican immigrants have built a life in the Chicago area despite their immigration status.
They tell her, after working hard for so many years in Chicago, “It’s OK to take a break.” Castro tells her that seeking emotional support is important.
The Mexican Consulate in Chicago did not respond to questions about the repatriation process.","Manuel Castro says his phone has been ringing nonstop with calls from people in the Chicago area who want to return to Mexico rather than risk being caught up in an aggressive immigration raid, sent to detention and deported.

“They are starting to see the violence where ICE agents are coming to [homes] without warrants, where they break your [car] windows, basically they are terrorizing [people],” says Castro, a coordinator with Coalicion de Migrantes Mexicanos, a grassroots organization that advocates for Mexican immigrants. “They are starting to say this is not OK. I’m done.”

But the decision to go back to Mexico after years — or in some cases, decades — in the United States isn’t as simple as packing up a suitcase and buying a plane ticket. It’s why Castro has been hosting free online workshops to help people understand and navigate the practical steps and emotional aspects of starting over.

Castro begins the workshop by telling participants to slow down and make sure they have a detailed plan. This includes thinking about everything from their finances to obtaining the right documents they’ll need to access basic services in Mexico. It also means getting familiar with Mexico’s cumbersome repatriation process.

“If you want to enroll your child in school, for example, you must prove that he or she is your child,” he tells the workshop participants. They’ll also need to fill out paperwork and obtain various ID cards if they want to be able to work, access health care, pay taxes or simply open a bank account.

He recommends parents with American-born children apply to get them dual citizenship. This makes it easier to navigate the Mexican public education system, he explains.

Castro also suggests people think about selling their property or transferring their financial assets to someone they trust in Chicago. People relying on savings when they return should create a budget, he adds.

“Talk with your family, talk with your friends, try to make an assessment of how much money you have,” Castro advises. He recalls some people telling him, “‘I don’t have anybody over there, and I have just a little bit of savings — $5,000 to $10,000.’”

He said that’s not a lot of money, especially if people don’t have a support network back home. “We will explain to them it’s going to be a difficult situation.”

Many Mexican immigrants have built a life in the Chicago area despite their immigration status. Chicago is home to 227,715 people who were born in Mexico, according to census data analyzed by WBEZ, although this is likely an undercount.

But this year, more Mexicans than any other nationality were deported from the Midwest under President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, a WBEZ analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project found.

That’s something participants in Castro’s workshop want to avoid.

“I’ve already shipped everything to Mexico,” a participant who identified herself as Luz said in Spanish during the session with 28 others. Luz says she lived and worked in the United States for decades but is now planning to leave in November. “I’ve sent blenders, computers, printers, TVs.”

But she still had many questions about what else she needed to do in preparation for returning to her native city of Veracruz.

And she is feeling the stress of this decision. She says her adult children are helping her prepare emotionally for the difficult transition.

“They tell me, ‘Mom, we are all grown up now, and it’s going to be different back there,’” she says.

They have reassured her that they will help support her. They tell her, after working hard for so many years in Chicago, “It’s OK to take a break.”

Castro tells her that seeking emotional support is important. He also urges Luz and others to get better informed about a new program established by the Mexican government in January this year called México te abraza, or “Mexico welcomes you.” It’s aimed at assisting deported and repatriated Mexicans during their reintegration, with a focus on access to basic services, economic stability and social inclusion.

But some Mexicans who’ve already made the decision to leave voluntarily say the process of getting any support from the Mexican government can be confusing and complicated.

Christian Vázquez says it’s been hard to find clear, accurate or consistent information about the repatriation process, either online or through the Mexican Consulate in Chicago.

Vázquez has lived in Chicago for 20 years. He and his wife have two children.

But he says the anti-immigrant rhetoric created a lot of anxiety, especially for his kids.

“They lived with the worry that at any moment something could happen to us due to immigration issues.”

Vázquez’s wife and kids are already back in Mexico. The couple made the decision to return before running the risk of being abruptly separated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Vázquez is still in Chicago, closing that chapter before he, too, goes back to Mexico.

The Mexican Consulate in Chicago did not respond to questions about the repatriation process.

In the last few weeks, Castro has spoken with about 50 people. As devastating as it can be to uproot a life and leave a country that’s been home for years, he expects he’ll be hearing from even more people making this difficult decision.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9fca9cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4676+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F62%2F1a%2F6c9eebf94c33b39de8630c7a4a69%2F3d8a5346.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:58:17.701818

The ICE building outside Chicago has been the site of confrontations as protesters have come out to decry immigration arrests.","Trump administration officials are defending themselves in court as a federal judge demands explanations for their response to tense protests against immigration enforcement actions in Chicago.

Monday’s hearing began with a promise Customs and Border Protection is taking seriously the judge’s order for its agents to wear and use body-worn cameras: Every CBP agent on duty in Chicago – more than 200 – has a body camera and knows they are required to use it, Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick said.

US District Judge Sara Ellis then calmly peppered Harvick with questions about how agents working on Operation Midway Blitz are trained and respond to protesters in and around Chicago, the latest target of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. The hearing was called in response to news reports suggesting agents were violating her order to avoid less-lethal munitions and tear gas.

Ellis, an Obama appointee, initially had called for the interim head of Chicago’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, Russell Hott, to appear Monday “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.” After seeming to agree to her request, the Department of Homeland Security told Ellis on Friday that Hott had left the city to return to his permanent job as field operations director in Washington, DC.

The Trump administration instead offered Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, and Ellis agreed – as long as the officials would disclose how the agencies are deploying riot control tactics against protesters and journalists.

“I’m looking at it from the outside,” Ellis said in court Monday.

The judge last week added mandatory body-worn cameras to her earlier restraining order, saying it appeared agents were not warning demonstrators before deploying tear gas and firing pepper balls on them.

“That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” Ellis said then.

Operation Midway Blitz is Trump’s recent ICE deployment across Chicagoland, yielding more than 1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois between September 8 and October 3, DHS said.

Harvick on Monday reiterated the White House’s denials of news coverage of tear gas used on protesters without warning in a recent demonstration in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood, although he acknowledged he had not seen it personally. A government attorney last week said the judge was relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”

Judge wants answers

Ellis early this month issued a sweeping order restricting agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists documenting protests in Chicago. During last week’s hearing, she said she had concerns about her order being followed.

The judge indicated recent news reports had led her to believe the Trump administration may not have been following her instructions.

“I’m not happy,” Ellis said in a stern tone. “I’m really not happy.”

“At least from what I’m seeing, I’m having serious concerns that my order’s being followed,” she said from the bench.

The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras. But her order doesn’t require them if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt by Customs and Border Protection, ICE or DHS policy.

Federal officials claimed Harvick would be the most appropriate person to testify after DHS determined it was “mostly, if not entirely” Border Patrol personnel who were involved in recent tear gas incidents, CNN affiliate WTTW reported.

During a telephone hearing that day, the judge said she had no desire to “micromanage” who the government presents at Monday’s hearing but that she’s been “very clear” she wants to hear from someone who can fill her in on “what’s been going on over the last week,” the station reported.

“Whoever comes has to be able to answer these questions,” Ellis said, according to WTTW. “And if the government chooses … to bring someone in and that person’s answers to me are ‘I don’t know’ and ‘It’s not my responsibility’ … then we’ll come in Tuesday with a different person until I get the answers I want.”

Protests continue at Broadview

This weekend marked the first since a fence was ordered removed at the Broadview ICE facility, the center of anti-ICE protests in the Chicago area.

The ICE building outside Chicago has been the site of confrontations as protesters have come out to decry immigration arrests.

Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.

At least 15 people were arrested on Saturday in connection with another demonstration at the facility, the agency said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2241106678.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-20 14:58:25.888606

“Snatching people off the street is un-American,” said one marcher, referring to Trump’s ICE agents and their violent seizures of people—migrant or not, citizen or not.
To chants of “No More Kings!” he responded “President Trump, we don’t want you or any other king to rule us.
Trump’s ICE agents previously arrested Newark, N.J., Mayor Raz Baraka, Rep. Lamonica McIver, D-N.J. and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.
GOP President Trump all but openly backs Cuomo.","WASHINGTON—A record seven million people turned out nationwide October 18 in some 2,600 “No Kings Day” protests against would-be dictator, President Donald Trump, targeting his attacks on democracy, his attacks on immigrants and many of his domestic policies including the trashing of healthcare for millions.

In addition to the 7 million pouring into the streets of the nation’s cities and towns from coast to coast and in Alaska and Hawaii there were hundreds of thousands more marching in solidarity with them around the globe including in cities from Stockholm, Sweden to Sao Paolo Brazil.

Key causes included demands that Trump stop trampling on the U.S. Constitution, especially its First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and his ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents’ violent and vicious kidnapping and disappearances of immigrants and others grabbed off the streets and at workplaces. Another major concern of the millions out on the streets was the impact of the Trump-GOP’s megadollar giveaway to billionaires and corporations, to be paid for by massive cuts in health care.

Across the country many thousands are already receiving notices of huge increases in their health care premiums due to refusal of the GOP to come out in support of continuing subsidies that keep down the costs for people.

Large contingents of unionists marched, notably in D.C., where the Government Employees, who have particular reason to do so, urged their 325,000 members nationwide to hit the streets. The union represents—or represented—more than a million federal workers until Trump unilaterally trashed their collective bargaining agreements. He has called federal workers, and AFGE by name, enemies, too.

The marches and rallies were peaceful and positive, giving the lie to GOP leaders who predicted it would be a turnout of people who “hate America.” There were no arrests even in cities where the turnout was well into the hundreds of thousands.

Only in Los Angeles was there a reported arrest of “nearly 100 agitators” according to the police who said those arrested were not at all part of the main demonstration of hundreds of thousands. The LAPD tweeted that the No Kings Day demonstrators “were peaceful people exercising their First Amendment right of free speech.”

The massive peaceful outpouring across the nation contrasted sharply with the violent attack on January 6, 2021 by Trump supporters who trashed the Capitol, tried to kill the Vice President and the House Majority Leader and attacked the police with five people eventually ending up dead.

New York City marshalled its police force for marches which drew, according to MSNBC, at least 400.000. There were no arrests at all.

Trump-supporting Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., activated the National Guard to cover protests in his state’s D.C. suburbs. They had nothing to do.

The more than 200,000 people who jammed D.C.’s Pennsylvania Avenue from curb to curb and from the White House to the Capitol turned that march into what the Associated Press labeled “a giant block party”—with bands, balloons, air horns and people costumed as Trump “toads” or as the Statue of Liberty.

In Chicago, which has been the site of some of the most vicious attacks by ICE, including landing on top of an apartment building on the South Side with Blackhawk attack helicopters and dragging residents out into the streets in the middle of the night, it seemed that the entire city was involved in the demonstration.

In Hyde Park, which is several miles south of the main rally location at Grant Park, at 8 a.m. in the morning the sidewalks were full of people headed to the Metra Station in the neighborhood in what looked like feeder marches to the main event. Chicagoans young and old, carried their homemade cardboard signs as they poured into the Metra stations already overflowing with people headed to the march.

Immigrants on the South Side from Honduras, Nigeria and the Philippines, living near the apartment building that was raided, went to the demonstration. One immigrant said “I haven’t felt better since Trump took over again, seeing now how many people are turning out to oppose what he is doing to us.”

Hundreds of police benignly looked on at the peaceful crowds in states and locations where National Guard troops were called in.. Some National Guards from “red states,” previously provided to the Nation’s Capital by Republican GOP governors, having nothing to do, gave differently abled people rides in golf-cart-like vehicles down a dedicated middle lane reserved for emergency vehicles and police patrols.

In contrast to the prior week, when Trump and other Republicans fumed at the coming rally-goers, calling them “communists” and “antifa” and saying they “hate America,” GOP lawmakers—also a target of many of the protesters—laid low. There are splits in MAGA now as vulnerable Republican legislators become increasingly fearful that their stance against healthcare may endanger their reelection prospects as will the GOP shutdown of the federal government. Millions of demonstrators, most of who are registered voters, does little to reduce the fear of vulnerable Republicans.

Trump himself retreated to his Mar-a-Lago Florida estate, where he hosted a million-dollar-a-plate corporate fundraiser. His staff sarcastically posted an artificial intelligence image on Trump’s social media channel of him wearing a cape and a crown.

The crown predominated among the crowds, the signs and the slogans, and was even spelled out by a human crowd declaring “No Kings” on Ocean Beach in San Francisco.

Like prior anti-Trump protests, some marchers linked Trump to his corporate backers or to the capitalist system he not only symbolizes but is busily enriching through sweetheart deals, rollbacks of regulations, the federal shutdown, intimidation of dissent and a $4.5 trillion 10-year tax cut for the 1%, paid for by the rest of us through losing medical care.

Keynote speaker Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ind-Vt., addressing the D.C. crowd, emphasized all those things.

“This is about a handful of the wealthiest people on earth, who by their insatiable greed have hijacked our economy and our political system. These are the same billionaires who funded his [Trump’s] campaign,” the senator said.

“Billionaires are the minority destroying America,” one member of the Baltimore Teachers Union/AFT told People’s World. Her union enthusiastically co-sponsored the march. Union President Randi Weingarten, a New York City civics teacher, was one of its prime advocates.

“There was ICE in our school in Highlandtown,” the Baltimore fourth-grade teacher continued. “Two masked men attempted to grab a couple of my kids. They [the kids] got away.” Added her companion, another fourth-grade teacher, but of the Washington, D.C., Teachers Union/AFT Local 6: “Teaching with ICE” in the city “is emotionally wrenching.

“The kids are coming with a lot of horror stories at home. They’ve lost their parents.”

“You have patients” in health care facilities, notably nursing homes, “who don’t have families and who get Medicaid” to pay for their care, a Service Employees 1199NE member named Reeba said in an interview. When they lose Medicaid, because of that tax cut for the rich, “What happens?” she asks.

“Who will take them in? They’re thinking about money,” she said of Trump and the Republicans, who jammed that Medicaid cut through on party-line votes in Congress. “We’re thinking about our patients.”

Individual marchers and a top Los Angeles union leader had their own takes on Trump and the carnage he’s caused, to the Constitution and the country, since he reoccupied the White House on January 20.

“America has no kings and working Americans will not stand by as a wannabe dictator wages war on our rights and our democracy,” David Green, president and executive director of L.A.’s Service Employees Local 721, told local media.

“Enough is enough. We will stop this authoritarianism in its tracks and work to revitalize and enhance our democracy, our rights, and our nation. We will not accept a regime that aims to put the interests of billionaires ahead of our families, workers and communities.”

“Where do we begin?” asked one D.C. marcher named Ken, who toted the Communications Workers’ banner during the D.C. march. “The whole immigration thing and the human rights umbrella. Just today, a man was abducted” by ICE “in front of his three kids.

“He had his green card on him,” showing he’s a permanent U.S. resident. “But he was thrown to the ground and was going to be sent to a San Francisco detention center.”

And Trump and his MAGA backers turn “the bathroom issue”—which bathrooms transgender people can use–into making them into traitors, Ken added. That’s led Pride At Work and the AFL-CIO, among many unions which endorsed the march, “to train people on what to do if they’re detained.”

Under Trump, “Families are told how to parent their children, doctors are forced to ignore their oaths, and the government is ripping apart families and hurting our people,” Jay Brown, a transgender person and deputy director of the Human Rights Campaign, told the D.C. crowd. Trump and the

Republicans are “cutting funding for HIV treatment, banning our books, and firing teachers who use a student’s nickname.”

Chants were common and often repeated: “No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist U.S.A” “This is what Democracy looks like” “Free DC No ICE” and so on. Many of the signs were individual and inventive in their criticism of Trump, his GOP henchmen and his government. One D.C. march, which came down from uptown to join the main march, was themed “Replace the regime.”

Celia, a 10th grader from Yorktown High School in suburban Arlington, Va., summed up all the damage Trump has done to the country in just nine months with her sign: “Nuclear waste is more stable than America under Trump,” it read.

Celia got the idea while doing her chemistry homework, where the students learned about the impact—and the longevity—of radioactive waste.

“It’s so unstable, and it’s just like Trump. We don’t know what’s going to happen next,” she said,

Signs and marchers drew pointed comparisons, especially when discussing ICE.

“Snatching people off the street is un-American,” said one marcher, referring to Trump’s ICE agents and their violent seizures of people—migrant or not, citizen or not. Her sign read: “Immigrants—we get the job done. No to ICE.”

“1776, 1865, 1945 No Kings, No Confederates, No Fascists,” read one sign, referring to the Declaration of Independence, the Union victory in the U.S. Civil War and the joint Soviet-U.S.-U.K. victory over Hitler’s Germany and militaristic Japan in World War II.

Jenny, a New Zealand native who’s been in the U.S., since she was 11 in 1971, captured the ethos of the crowds, prefacing it by telling People’s World she still holds a New Zealand passport.

“We were able to vote and have freedom of choice for our bodies,” she said, highlighting two of the issues that brought the crowds into the streets: Trump-GOP plans to restrict and outlaw abortion and to impose massive restrictions, in law, in intimidation and in practice, against voting rights.

“I have watched this country from the first Trump administration. It’s ugly. It’s a rollback to the 1950s.” Trump cares “only about skin color,” she added, referring to his ICE agents/thugs and their targeted arrests of brown-skinned people. “I’m glad I have an escape hatch” to return to her homeland.

“’I’ve been protesting for 20 years,” said D.C. resident, Maggie, one of many who carried a “Sic Semper Tyrannis” sign. That’s the Latin motto of the Virginia state seal, “Thus always to tyrants.”

“This government is overreaching and infringing on our rights, and I’m always going to stand up to faceless agents of the state,” Maggie said. Trump’s ICE agents wear masks to conceal their identities.

“Sic Semper Tyrannis” was also what pro-Confederate actor John Wilkes Booth shouted from the Ford’s Theater stage after murdering “the tyrant” President Abraham Lincoln 160 years ago. For the marchers, Trump is the tyrant.

Unlike past marches, this No Kings Day protest also drew significant political support, even from prior reluctant lawmakers, notably Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. He marched in the Big Apple—a turnaround from May when he drew sharp and justified criticism from the Democratic left wing for caving in to Trump on a key law to keep the government running.

This time, Schumer and other Senate Democrats are holding out, and the money’s run out. Their price is restoring all the health care cuts. “Essential workers” such as airport screeners, are toiling without pay. Others have been sent home.

Trump’s Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, a notorious union hater, has already fired 4,000 of that group without cause and in defiance of court orders. He schemes to fire thousands more, with Trump’s blessing, during and after the closure.

Sen. Sanders keynoted the addresses to the D.C. marchers and he was the sole prominent speaker to link Trump to income inequality, class divisions and forcing people to live paycheck to paycheck. “They’re the worst government in modern history,” Sanders told the D.C. crowd. To chants of “No More Kings!” he responded “President Trump, we don’t want you or any other king to rule us.

“It is dangerous to have more power in his hands and in the hands of his fellow oligarchs. We have a president who threatens to arrest mayors and governors” who speak against him, Sanders continued.

“And we have a president who wants no criticism of him and who undermines the 1st Amendment to the Constitution—the very foundation of our democracy.” That amendment includes freedom of speech and “the right of the people to peaceably assemble and address the government for redress of their grievances,” which the seven million marchers nationwide did.

Trump threatens to arrest Govs. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., and J.B. Pritzker, D-Ill., and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. All reiterated slams at Trump at marches in California and Chicago. Trump’s ICE agents previously arrested Newark, N.J., Mayor Raz Baraka, Rep. Lamonica McIver, D-N.J. and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

The Chicago protests were peaceful, too, even at the ICE detention center in suburban Broadview, scene of raucous but peaceful demonstrations in recent weeks, and ICE arrests there of protesters and even reporters—now stopped by a federal court injunction.

“History will judge us by where we choose to stand right now, today,” Pritzker declared to people gathered in Grant Park downtown. “Future generations will ask: ‘What did we do when fellow human beings face persecution? When our rights were being abridged? When our Constitution was under attack?’ They’ll want to know whether we stood up or we stayed silent. Resistance starts with refusing to normalize cruelty.

“An attack on free speech, on immigrants’ rights, on due process is an attack on everyone’s rights,” Pritzker said. “It means understanding that we’re either building a society based on human dignity or one based on domination.”

Gesturing to the large crowd he addressed in Atlanta, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told CNN: “In this moment, in which we are seeing a president and an administration arrogating to himself power that doesn’t belong to him, our message is very clear. This is not about the people in power, it’s about the power in the people.”

The senator said Trump tries to “weaponize despair,” but is “getting his answer today.”

Many progressive demonstrators in downtown D.C. didn’t let the Democrats off the hook either. They faulted the party for failing to oppose Trump’s tyranny early enough and strongly enough, singling out Schumer in particular for blame for caving in to an earlier Trump-GOP temporary money bill that kept the government going through midnight on September 30, when the partial shutdown began.

Some of those interviewed said the party needs new blood and tough leadership, calling for senior Dems—Sanders excepted—to step aside and let younger and tougher leaders take over.

Some mentioned specific races where the Democratic establishment pushes an older candidate, such as Maine Gov. Janet Mills, 77—who has stood up to Trump—over the younger progressive military veteran and oyster farmer Graham Platner. Both want to unseat “moderate” veteran GOP Sen. Susan Collins.

Scott, a D.C. resident, discussed that Maine race and Schumer’s refusal to endorse New York City Democratic Mayoral nominee Zohran Momdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist running on an extremely progressive platform. Mamdani faces disgraced pro-corporate ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67. Cuomo lost the primary and now runs as an independent—backed by millions of dollars in campaign cash, including from Wall Street Republicans. GOP President Trump all but openly backs Cuomo.

“By and large, the Democratic Party is also bought by corporate interests, and they fail to stand up for the average working people,” Scott told NBC, referring to Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

In response to operations employed by immigration enforcement, Los Angeles Unified School District (L.A.U.S.D.) has expanded their policies in order to maintain the safety of marginalized students.

The District’s efforts to revise protective policy occurred after multiple hostile interactions between ICE agents and L.A.U.S.D. students, according to L.A.U.S.D. superintendent Alberto Carvalho during a press conference at Edward R. Roybal Learning Center August 11.

Incidents Over the Summer

Early this August, a 15-year old L.A.U.S.D. student was held at gun-point and briefly detained by ICE before eventually being released. This encounter occurred in front of Arleta High School, prompting widespread alarm and panic among L.A.U.S.D. students and families.

Another incident occurred when Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, an 18-year old senior at Reseda Charter High School, was arrested and detained by ICE agents while walking his dog. Although arrested in California, he was taken to Arizona without his family’s knowledge, and was planned to be later transported to Louisiana. According to the Los Angeles Times, he has been brought back to California, where he is still detained.

An anonymous Venice student expressed frustration at the rising climate of fear.

“Why should I feel afraid or have to be hyper-aware of my surroundings when I’m so young?” said the student.

According to principal Yavonka Hairston-Truitt, the decrease of schools being considered as sanctuary spaces is disappointing.

“There used to be a time when schools were safe havens…and it’s been really heartbreaking to see that transition,” she said.

“Schools should be exempt from this matter. I wish we weren’t even having to have a conversation because it wasn’t even a consideration in the first place.”

Most recently, the front lawn was closed off during lunch Tuesday due to the presence of immigration enforcement near the school.

“It has been verified that a car wash, within 1.2 miles from our school, had an ICE raid where three to five employees were removed from their work and the car wash was closed,” said Hairston-Truitt.

L.A.U.S.D. Responses

The rising urgency to protect students has prompted action from L.A.U.S.D.

During a press conference in early August, L.A.U.S.D. superintendent Alberto Carvalho informed families that they will not allow any federal officials to enter school grounds without a warrant.

Since then, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 49 which has turned this policy into a state-wide law.

To further protect students, many district bus lines have been rerouted. Additionally, new routes have been established to shield students from possible immigration enforcement activity within the city, and to reassure parents who worry about their children being out in public.

Spanish teacher Dr. Angela Fajardo, a co-magnet coordinator who oversees bus coordination, also explained that bus accessibility has increased for Venice students.

“Prior to this, the buses were mainly for students who were joining the World Language Magnet or STEMM,” she said. “Because of this change in policy, now the bus is available for all.” To request a bus with a route that best fits a student’s needs, call 1800-LA-BUSES.

In addition, L.A.U.S.D. is emphasizing the accessibility of their Virtual Academy, which is an online alternative to in-person schooling.

Superintendent Carvalho spoke about the increase of online enrollment at the start of the 2025-2026 school year.

“There’s nothing like face-to-face education,” he said, “but we understand that for some families facing a level of fear that is unacceptable for a child to experience, that virtual education may in fact be the preferred modality. We are here to support.”

L.A.U.S.D. has also launched “We Are One,” a campaign that “formalizes and amplifies the District’s efforts to cultivate welcoming learning environments for all students.”

This campaign includes hosting weekly workshops to inform students and their families about immigration rights, by covering important topics such as education, housing, and more.

These workshops, which began August 22, are alongside other online resources that the District has been providing to inform and support LAUSD families, such as the monthly parent and family webinars.

L.A.U.S.D. has also created the Family Preparedness Care Package, which provides resources such as information on legal rights for immigrant families and students to access.

Action at Venice High School

While the District has been further developing their policies and distributing resources, Venice High School has been taking its own initiative to protect students.

Multiple teachers at Venice have been volunteering in community safety patrols dedicated to keeping an eye out for immigration enforcement agents, as well as establishing a welcoming presence around school in order to facilitate a safe environment.

Fajardo commented on the patrols, saying, paraphrase here

“I am very proud of our teachers at Venice who have proactively taken on the patrolling really early. They’re probably here at seven, because I arrive at around 7:30 and they’re already here and patrolling.”

According to an anonymous teacher, these safety teams at Venice were initiated by teachers who attended workshops and trainings with Union Del Barrio—a non-governmental organization (NGO)—which has helped educate teachers on how to effectively protect their students. The teacher said these meetings have also been “very much focused on how to apply your rights to any given situation.”

The trainings have taught community members and teachers how to identify immigration enforcement vehicles, as well as the appropriate procedures when encountering immigration agents.

“Union Del Barrio gives resources to set up patrols and how to protect each other,” the teacher said. “Teachers and parents have come together to walk around school in the mornings to make sure there is safe passage for students and families.”

Union del Barrio hosts both in person and online meetings, which has allowed teachers from all states to join the training sessions.

“There’s teachers from all across the country that are attending these,” the anonymous teacher said.

Fajardo also acknowledged the responsibility that Venice has to the student population as a whole: “We have students not only that come to Venice, but we also have students from the Venice community that go to other schools.”

This model of community safety as well as rapid response networks have been established across the city, a direct effect of Union Del Barrio’s efforts to create a city-wide movement to protect Angelenos against immigration enforcement.

Furthermore, the school does not keep any records on a student’s legal status, which keeps students’ citizenship status confidential and prevents immigration enforcement from being able to obtain such information from the school.

“When a student enrolls here, we ask for certain information – proof of residency for example – but we don’t keep records on their citizenship status,” said Community Schools Coordinator Brian Bleser. “Even if ICE agents or immigration agents ask for that information, we don’t keep that type of information.

Hairston-Truitt also said that “Venice ensures that our staff, our families, and our students are aware of their rights.”

Anytime L.A.U.S.D.’s We Are One Campaign releases an update, “I send it back out to families… as soon as I am aware,” she said.

According to Hairston-Truitt, one of the best ways to keep students safe is to “train and help staff understand how to support their students in the classroom, because if everyone is prepared, it can increase the feelings of safety, especially when you feel like your teachers understand.”

“I’ll do everything to the fullest extent of my ability to support and maintain students’ and their family’s safety,” said Hairston-Truitt. “I am completely aware of the impact it has on multiple communities in LA.”

Student Walkouts and Experiences

Teachers and staff haven’t been the only ones to take action and respond to increasing immigration enforcement activity. In February, Venice students participated in the school walkouts against ICE.

Senior Marina Aguayo, a student organizer, said students were concerned about “the safety of immigrants in our country.”

As the Trump administration escalated the deportation process, mass immigration enforcement raids began and separated families, confirming Aguayo’s and other students’ anxieties.

“The walkout was about voicing students’ opinions on current political matters,” Aguayo said.

Aguayo expressed the need for clearer communication between the school and its students regarding immigration enforcement policies.

“I want to make sure they make it clear to students when they are safe and acknowledge when they aren’t safe.

“Although L.A.U.S.D.’s response could’ve been greater…The walkout was positive overall…L.A.U.S.D. did see it, and that was the point.”

Another student organizer, senior Gilbert Lopez said, “It helped start a chain of movement.”

“Student movements have the capability to create tangible change, but it isn’t something that will happen after the first try”, said Lopez. “It is something that should be carried on…To keep the movement alive for future students, collaboration with each other is necessary.”

A Historical Context for Current Events

Last year’s walkouts were not the first time L.A.U.S.D. has witnessed student-led protests. In the 1960s, Chicano students mobilized to fight against discrimination within schools.

These protests were known as the East L.A. Walkouts and paved the way for numerous changes within the school system to address systemic inequities. Along with numerous East LA students, the movement included Venice High School students, and this legacy of activism can still be seen through present-day student action.

“Students are the reason why we have these social justice movements,” Social studies teacher Isabel Cortes said. “When they see an injustice, when they’re fired up, when they create a collective to fight and organize, when they create solidarity movements with unions and with educators and with community members and with parents… that is what’s powerful.”

Cortes offers a hopeful outlook for our collective future.

“Resistance and the fight for liberation is still here, and it’s so beautiful- and the world is watching…There are changes happening and we need to keep fighting, because the struggle for liberation, the struggle for peaceful migration, the struggle for human rights; everything is intertwined,” she said.

“Migration is a human process,” said Cortes. “It’s part of who we are.”",https://veniceoarsman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ICE-Photo-Oliver-Mars-Cornelius.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:01:50.892175

“One thing I hate is bullies,” said Brent, a regular at the weekly protests who was also in Monona for its No Kings protest over the weekend.

In Monona, a suburban city of around 9,000 residents just outside the capital city of Madison, around 400 people lined one of the busiest corners of the main street of the city. Protesters held signs in opposition to President Donald Trump, took part in cross-street chanting, and encouraged vehicles to honk their car horns in support — which dozens of cars did.

While some members of the administration and other allies of the president have tried to suggest these protests are unpatriotic, the residents here would largely disagree with that charge. Monona hosts the largest (and longest-running) annual Memorial Day parade in the entire state of Wisconsin, and its Fourth of July Festival regularly draws in crowds more than five times its population size every year.

The street corner where Saturday’s demonstration took place has also been the site of a protest against the Trump administration every Tuesday for most of his second term so far.

“One thing I hate is bullies,” said Brent, a regular at the weekly protests who was also in Monona for its No Kings protest over the weekend. “The Trump regime, they’re the worst of the worst.”

“I’m here to counteract that [bullying from Trump],” he added, “and try to bring joy to other people and get them involved.”

About a 30-minute drive south of Monona, in Stoughton, a crowd of around 500 protesters marched up and down both sides of its main street. Although the protest disrupted traffic, most who were held up by their march honked their car horns in support and gave thumbs-ups as they drove past.

Barbara, a participant in Stoughton’s No Kings protest, indicated that she felt Trump was “a big, big mistake for our country,” and that it was important “to stand up for what we believe in.”

Specifically, Barbara indicated she opposed Trump’s anti-immigration policies.

“I don’t like the idea that he’s sending ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] in and taking people without any warrant, they don’t get any trial or have lawyers or anything,” she said.

Craig and Laura, a married couple who had traveled to a No Kings protest in Delavan, also expressed frustration with the president’s refusal to abide by constitutional norms.

Around 1,500 participants took part in this small city’s No Kings protest. Located in Walworth County in the southeastern corner of the state, it is perhaps an unlikely spot for a demonstration against Trump — the county voted with 60.5 percent support for Trump in the 2024 presidential election (more than 10 points higher than the rate the president won across the state overall). Delavan is also the hometown of far right former Gov. Scott Walker.

Despite this, participants expressed outrage with the current administration’s actions, especially its refusal to follow checks and balances.

“The Constitution is not being abided by. He thinks he’s above it,” Laura said about Trump. “I just kind of see him as being a fake and a con.”

Craig also derided Trump’s “vision” for the country, saying that he believes deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller’s intended “direction” for the administration is “not best for this nation.”

But Craig also said it was “great” to see hundreds of people from a traditionally Republican area coming out to express opposition to the president.

“I guarantee you, there are people in this group that are Republicans that have said, ‘enough is enough,'” he added.

Laura also noticed that, since the first No Kings protest they had attended in June, participation seems to have gone up. “You can see the numbers increasing,” she said, with her husband nodding in agreement.

Later on Saturday, a much larger protest took place in Madison, the state’s capital and its second-largest city. Demonstrators held signs in support of LGBTQ rights, expressing solidarity with Palestinians in the face of Israel’s genocide, and affirming the right of immigrants to live in the U.S. and be afforded due process.

Speakers at the event condemned the Trump administration’s attacks on the media and free press, and encouraged attendees not to give in to the temptation of complacency.

John Nichols, executive editor of The Nation, called on news media to stand steadfast against Trump, and to continue reporting the truth rather than cower to the White House’s demands to be more “balanced.”

“Some media outlets have decided to go soft, and not tell the story of what’s happening in America,” Nichols said. “Brothers and sisters, there are others that will keep telling the story, because we know this: Donald Trump doesn’t want the full report of what is happening in America today, to the American people, because if it happened, the American people would know that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people have gathered to say today, ‘No Crowns, No Kings!'”

Rowan Attala, co-host of a local radio program called Salamat, also spoke at the rally, decrying the administration’s attacks on free speech.

“We need to speak out loudest when our constitutional right to free speech is under threat. Especially when, after two years of constantly protesting and speaking up, we have what, quite honestly, may only be a lull in a genocide paid for with your tax dollars,” Attala said, referring to Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.

Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell — who recognized that his presence at the rally may get him “in trouble on Monday” — said it was important for him to be there.

The current administration’s methods are overwhelming, Mitchell noted, stating that “the anxiety being built after every five-minute news cycle or tweet and breaking headline changing from one controversial and consequential issue to the next is leaving the most passionate advocate grasping for breath, with little or no time to organize.”

“I’m witnessing immigrant families living in the shadows of a nation built upon the DNA of the enslaved, the blood of the Indigenous, the sweat of the Asian community, the hands of the immigrants and the whip of injustice,” he continued.

Mitchell also warned against people sitting back or taking a break in this moment:

The temptation in this moment is to sit idle, staring at the television and scrolling on your phone, tapping at the screen, just hoping that if we keep our heads underwater long enough, the shadow will pass and normal will return to our shores. But let me be the bearer of bad news: Whatever normal was, is or could be, is not returning to us. We are not going back. The only way is for us to go forward.

At each of these protests, participants expressed a desire to build community and to organize, showcasing that those in attendance, whether at large or small No Kings gatherings, were ready to heed Mitchell’s advice to “go forward.”

There may be a reason for their cautious optimism. Studies have demonstrated that, even when a small portion of people participate in protests, they are often successful at bringing about positive social change. One examination of nonviolent social movements has found that, when at least 3.5 percent of the population takes part in protests, serious political change typically results.

The cities listed above not only reached that threshold but likely exceeded them.

Survivors may be triggered by recounting memories of traumatic events and are at risk of retraumatization. 1 Allowing patients to control how they communicate their narrative can help them engage with less anxiety.1 If retraumatization occurs, the provider should acknowledge this and attempt techniques (e.g., redirection or breathing exercises) to mitigate retraumatization.1

Accurate medicolegal documentation is important for helping survivors gain and maintain legal acknowledgement of their past1

Medical reports help to validate refugee claims.1,2 Any psychological or physical injuries should be investigated and documented appropriately. Accessing the Basis of Claim legal document (which factually outlines why an individual is claiming refugee protection) and narrative (the personal story behind the individual’s claim, which is more focused on lived experience and provides emotional context) can help the care provider gain a comprehensive history.

Different cultural norms and trauma contexts can influence a patient’s understanding of health and suffering1

Many refugees have experienced torture due to cultural, religious, or ethnic conflicts, and increasingly due to domestic violence and 2SLGBTQI+ discrimination. Therefore, narratives may be mitigated by experiences of shame, stigma, and fear of reprisal.1 Providers should avoid assuming that a patient’s place of reticence correlates with torture not having taken place. Cultural humility and sensitivity training is essential for those involved in this type of clinical work.

Survivors of torture require a primary care provider

Primary care providers can address many patient concerns and are a point of access to mental health resources and other specialists. Although survivors may experience mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, or anxiety,3 routine screening is not advised, as this has not been shown to provide clear benefits and could be harmful.4 The role of a medical examiner documenting torture for legal purposes differs from that of a primary care provider, although overlap may occur. See Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250389/tab-related-content) for recommended resources.

Providers should know the date of a patient’s Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada hearing

The hearing is often scheduled virtually and will determine whether the refugee is permitted to stay in Canada.5 If practitioners believe the patient’s medical status may influence their hearing or affect their attendance, their lawyer must be informed.

Targeting Immigrant Communities with Detention and Deportation

We believe in a moral agenda that stands against systemic racism, labor exploitation, poverty, xenophobia, and any attempt to promote hate towards any members of the human family. The Trump-Republican agenda targets immigrants and their communities, ruthlessly and lawlessly detaining and deporting people of many immigration statuses, and militarizing and terrorizing communities at great cost to us all.

As of September 2025, there were more than 59,000 people in immigration detention in the United States, up more than 22,000 since last September — a nearly 60 percent increase. Immigration detention hit an all-time high in August 2025, with 61,226 people held in detention.

Another 181,210 individuals and families were under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) monitoring through means like location trackers on their ankles or wrists.

In September 2025, 71.5 percent of current immigration detainees had no criminal conviction. Many of those with convictions were for minor infractions like traffic violations.

The largest 17 immigrant detention facilities that hold more than 1,000 immigrants each are all privately operated and stand to profit from mass deportation. A CEO of one private detention company in August praised the “unprecedented growth opportunities” related to Trump-Republican mass deportations.

The Trump administration is detaining children and plans to open up two more family detention facilities by the end of the year.

The Trump administration has deported somewhere between 234,000 and 400,000 immigrants as of early October 2025, and claims that its campaigns of threats and harassment have led another 1.6 million people to self-deport.

Abusive Conditions and Violations of Civil and Human Rights

As of September 2025, 16 immigrants had died in ICE custody this year, including one killed by gunfire outside a detention facility. A second death from that incident brings the total to at least 17. In another incident, a single father of two was shot and killed by ICE during an attempted detention.

Inhumane and abusive conditions in detention facilities include overcrowding, lack of food, and denial of medical treatment — including for children.

In March and April, the Trump administration sent 280 immigrants to El Salvador’s infamous CECOT mega-prison without due process. As of August, 252 of those men had been released and deported to Venezuela, still without due process.

Amid the changing status of the notorious immigrant detention facility the administration has dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” hundreds of immigrants were moved to undisclosed locations and have been untraceable by family and legal representatives.

Due to racial profiling and a disregard for legal rights, U.S. citizens are also being wrongly detained.

Weaponizing the U.S. Military Against Immigrants and their Communities

The administration has deployed military troops, including the National Guard and the Marines, to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to squash protest, back up heavy police presences, and aid in its mass deportation and detention agenda.

More than 2,000 National Guard troops were deployed to Washington, D.C. at an estimated cost of $1 million per day — more than four times the cost of operating enough public housing for all of the city’s unhoused population. The Trump-Republican surge of law enforcement into the city instead dismantled encampments and displaced unhoused people without providing any alternatives.

As of October 2025, courts have ruled that the deployment of troops to Los Angeles and the federalization of the National Guard to Portland, Oregon for these purposes are not legal.

Pentagon resources including bases and planes have been used to hold immigrant detainees, transport immigrants for deportation, and provide additional militarization of U.S. cities and the southern border.

Making Legal Immigration Harder

The Trump administration and the Trump-Republican budget bill have launched multiple attacks on legal immigration, from revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of current residents with Temporary Protected Status to attempting to end the legal refugee and asylum systems and instituting prohibitive fees on legal immigration applications.

Taking from the Poor to Fund Mass Deportation and the Military

The Trump-Republican budget bill that will take health care and food stamps from millions of Americans and provide more tax breaks for the wealthy also poured $170 billion in new funds into the mass deportation and detention system through September 2029.

That $42.5 billion per year in new funding for mass detentions, deportations, and border militarization is the funding equivalent of the 13th largest military in the world. That’s enough to keep Medicaid health insurance for 8.6 million people, or half of those expected to lose health insurance under the Trump-Republican budget.

Raising Inflation and Joblessness and Hurting Us All

Economists expect mass deportations to reduce overall employment by almost 7 percent. That’s because employers may replace immigrant workers with less labor-intensive technology, or not at all, and because immigrants’ purchasing power also generates jobs. The effects could be felt in service industries, agriculture, and manufacturing.

Mass deportations could result in spikes in inflation ranging from 1.3 percent to 9 percent, potentially higher than the rate of inflation from 2019-2021 under COVID.

Undocumented immigrants paid $96.7 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022, including for Social Security and Medicare, even though they are barred from accessing those programs. Extending legal work authority to undocumented immigrants would raise their tax contributions by $40.2 billion per year in federal, state and local taxes.

With shortages of essential healthcare personnel, one million immigrants work in essential healthcare jobs. One-third of them are undocumented, and many more hold threatened legal statuses.

Immigrants are our neighbors and strengthen our communities. Instead of inflicting policy violence on the most vulnerable, Congress should harness America’s abundant wealth to create a moral economy that works for all of us.

The official DHS account posted the video on Friday, which features an on-screen message that reads: “ICE We’re on the way. Word in the streets cartels put a $50k bounty on y’all.”

Noem herself claimed that drug cartels were placing bounties on agents’ heads in an interview with Fox and Friends earlier this month.

The department’s own comment in its post declared: “FAFO. If you threaten or lay hands on our law enforcement officers we will hunt you down and you will find out, really quick. We’ll see you cowards soon.”

However, social media users soon claimed to have tracked down the original version of the video and alleged it was first uploaded with an entirely different caption, in which the participants jokingly threaten Iran, not U.S. federal immigration agents.

California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell was reportedly one of the first to rebuke Secretary Noem over the post but has since deleted a tweet that read: “Kristi – DELETE THIS TWEET or answer for it in Congress. It’s FAKE. You’re the Queen of Photoshopping.”

Democratic congressional candidate Danny D Glover was among those to subsequently share a new TikTok video by the young man featured most prominently in the clip in which he explained that he had been notified about the controversy the DHS post had stirred up and said: “I saw the caption and I was like, ‘I didn’t do that!’”

He continued: “I’ve still got the video saved in my drafts on TikTok. Here’s the messed-up part: the federal government is involved with something that I didn’t do. What?”

A DHS spokesperson has since told The Independent in response: “This young man posted violent threats of murder against our law enforcement. He then deleted it when he was called out and attempted to deny all wrongdoing. We have the receipts, and the internet is forever.

“DHS did not edit, change, use AI, or in any other manner or form alter this video. It was downloaded directly from this individual’s account on Friday, October 17th after it had already acquired over 40,000 likes and hundreds of comments urging individuals to target our ICE officers.

“The willful ignorance and intentional blindness by leading Democrats to the massive increase in violent rhetoric against our agents due to their actions is both disgusting and disappointing. Violence against our agents and officers MUST STOP.”

The DHS has received regular criticism this year for its social media output under Noem’s leadership, which has often seen it mix memes with aggressive posturing against undocumented migrants.

It received a savage response from the creators of South Park after it attempted to repurpose a still from a recent episode satirising ICE, the Trump administration and Noem herself, while the pop star Jess Glynn said she felt “sick” when one of her songs was used in a video about mass deportations.

Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the estates of Woody Guthrie and Tom Petty have similarly complained about their songs being used in DHS posts and the painter Morgan Weistling and the estate of another artist, Thomas Kincaid, have also complained about their work being appropriated.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has previously said of the DHS’s online messaging strategy: “The Department of Homeland Security is bypassing the mainstream media to give Americans the facts, debunk the lies, and unapologetically celebrate our homeland, heritage, and the rule of law.

“We are pleased that the media is highlighting DHS’s historic successes in making America safe again.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/05/17/41/Screenshot-2025-10-05-at-1-10-10-PM.png?trim=8,0,8,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-20 15:57:29.859179

MIGRANT INSIDER IS SPONSORED BY:

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings found that ICE agents violated the terms of a consent decree by detaining people without proper warrants, following a surge in such arrests amid increased enforcement activity. According to the judge’s order, ICE agents must now wear body cameras and have them turned on. They also cannot arrest anyone complying with their appointment dates at immigration courthouses.

The latest order expands protections for immigrants, mandating rigorous reporting and retraining requirements for agents and creating court-backed avenues for legal consequences—including possible arrest—for those found violating the judge’s directive.

The ruling stems from heightened scrutiny over “collateral arrests” made in the Chicago area, which often occur during street stops or raids without pre-issued warrants. Under the new decree, ICE agents must document and justify every warrantless arrest; failure to comply could result in agents being named and referred for prosecution or contempt proceedings.

Several months ago, Noem issued a memo requiring all Department of Homeland Security personnel to get her personal approval on all spending in excess of $100,000. In theory, the secretary said she was positioning herself as a responsible steward of taxpayers’ money. In practice, Noem quickly made DHS agencies slower, less responsive and less efficient.

This has been especially problematic at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where critically important FEMA resources have been slow to reach disaster-struck areas because of Noem-imposed bureaucracy. Even congressional Republicans aligned with the Trump administration are sick of it.

There’s one area within DHS, however, where money appears to be flowing quite freely. The New York Times reported:

The Department of Homeland Security has purchased two Gulfstream private jets for Kristi Noem, the secretary, and other top department officials at a cost of $172 million, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. The jets, which a department official said were needed for safety, are the latest expenditures on behalf of Ms. Noem to draw scrutiny from Democrats and other critics who have noted her lavish spending on living and other expenses during her time in public life.

Though the Times’ reporting hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson acknowledged the purchase to the Times.

The Coast Guard originally requested $50 million to buy a jet to replace the plane Noem is already using. Now, however, DHS is spending $172 million to purchase two jets.

Two key House Democrats, Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, and Lauren Underwood of Illinois, the ranking member overseeing its homeland security panel, apparently want to know where the money came from.

“In addition to raising serious questions about your ability to effectively lead an agency whose procurement strategies appear to vary on a whim, the procurement of new luxury jets for your use suggests that the [U.S. Coast Guard] has been directed to prioritize your own comfort above the [U.S. Coast Guard’s] operational needs, even during a government shutdown,” the lawmakers wrote. “We are deeply concerned about your judgment, leadership priorities, and responsibility as a steward of taxpayer dollars.”

Time will tell how and whether the secretary responds to the request for information from Capitol Hill, but as the burgeoning story unfolds, it’s the latest installment in a series of controversies surrounding Noem.

ProPublica reported last month, for example, that a community in Florida awaiting FEMA assistance found itself stuck in “bureaucratic purgatory,” right up until one of Noem’s wealthy supporters reached out to her, at which point the process dramatically improved.

A month earlier, The Washington Post reported that the secretary was living for free in a military home typically reserved for the Coast Guard’s top admiral. “Other Cabinet officials, including during both Trump administrations, have paid to use military housing that otherwise would be occupied by top generals and admirals,” the article added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251020-kristi-noem-zz-65e2e1.jpg",N,,2025-10-20 12:58:05.093222

Callais, a case whose implications extend far beyond the borders of Louisiana. Though nominally focused on that state’s congressional map, the legal principles at stake could profoundly affect Mississippi and other states with sizable Black populations, particularly in how they structure electoral districts in the coming decades.

Mississippi’s political geography remains emblematic of the broader Southern struggle over race and representation. Of the state’s four congressional districts, only one—the Second, anchored in the Delta and represented by Democrat Bennie Thompson since 1993—possesses a Black voting-age majority, roughly 61 percent. Given that African Americans constitute about 38 percent of Mississippi’s population—the highest proportion of any state—the legal scaffolding that has long sustained such a district stands in question under the issues raised in Callais.

The path of the Callais case has been anything but conventional. Initially argued in March 2025, the Supreme Court later took the unusual step of ordering re-argument, expanding the scope of review to a question with sweeping constitutional ramifications: Does the deliberate creation of majority-minority districts to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act violate the Equal Protection or Fifteenth Amendment?

This shift marked a pivotal moment. Louisiana, which once defended a map including two majority-Black districts—reflecting its 30 percent Black population—reversed course. The state now argues that any race-conscious districting is inherently unconstitutional, a position endorsed by the Trump administration. This stance contrasts sharply with the historical approach of previous administrations, which recognized the necessity of race-aware remedies to ensure equitable representation.

The case itself arose from Louisiana’s response to a federal court mandate requiring an additional district in which Black voters could elect candidates of their choice. When the legislature complied, producing a map that sent two Black Democrats and four white Republicans to Congress in 2024, a new set of plaintiffs challenged the result as unconstitutional racial gerrymandering—thus setting the stage for the current dispute.

At its core, Louisiana v. Callais forces the Court to reconcile three overlapping yet sometimes conflicting legal principles: the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment’s explicit prohibition on racial discrimination in voting, and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, Congress’s statutory instrument for enforcing those constitutional guarantees.

Since the 1986 decision in Thornburg v. Gingles, federal courts have relied on a tripartite test to determine whether redistricting practices violate Section 2. The criteria focus on whether minority populations are sufficiently large and cohesive to form a majority district, whether their political preferences are unified, and whether white bloc voting typically thwarts their candidates of choice. Federal courts have repeatedly found that Mississippi meets all three conditions, documenting a persistent pattern of racially polarized voting throughout the state.

The October arguments revealed a Supreme Court deeply divided. Several conservative justices questioned the legitimacy of race-conscious mapmaking. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who only two years earlier upheld Section 2’s vitality in an Alabama case, raised concerns about whether such remedies should remain indefinite. Chief Justice John Roberts, author of that very opinion, appeared more skeptical this time.

The Trump administration’s brief proposed a new evidentiary standard: plaintiffs must demonstrate that racial voting patterns are independent of partisan preference. In Mississippi—where Black voters overwhelmingly support Democrats and white voters favor Republicans—such a rule would render much of the state’s electoral geography immune from Section 2 scrutiny, redefining racial discrimination as partisan alignment.

In contrast, the court’s liberal bloc defended the established framework. Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned Louisiana’s abrupt shift, while Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund warned that curtailing Section 2 would decimate minority representation, particularly in the Deep South, where nearly every Black member of Congress holds a seat created through Voting Rights Act enforcement.

The ramifications for Mississippi hinge on the breadth of the Court’s eventual ruling. A narrow opinion might leave the existing structure intact, but a sweeping reinterpretation could force a reexamination of all majority-minority districts. If Section 2’s constraints are weakened, Mississippi’s legislature could redraw the Second District—currently stretching over 300 miles—without regard to racial composition. Such redistricting could dilute Black voting strength and jeopardize the state’s lone Black-held congressional seat.

Mississippi’s ongoing litigation over state Supreme Court districts underscores the broader stakes. A federal court in August 2025 found that the current districts, virtually unchanged since 1987, unlawfully dilute Black voting power. Should the Supreme Court narrow Section 2’s scope, challenges to these and similar districts across local governments could falter.

Analysts estimate that up to 19 congressional districts nationwide could shift under a weakened Section 2 regime, with repercussions not only for racial representation but also for partisan balance.

The issues before the court resonate deeply within Mississippi’s long struggle for racial equality in politics. After the Civil War, Black Mississippians briefly held significant political power during Reconstruction, only to be systematically disenfranchised through violence, literacy tests, and poll taxes. Not until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did federal law restore genuine political participation for the state’s Black citizens.

Yet progress has remained contingent on judicial enforcement. From local school boards to Congress itself, litigation has been the engine sustaining Black representation against recurring attempts at dilution. Decisions such as Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which nullified the preclearance requirement for states like Mississippi, and subsequent rulings in 2021 and 2023 have incrementally reshaped the terrain. Now, Louisiana v. Callais may determine whether Section 2 endures as a viable safeguard or becomes a relic of a fading civil rights era.

A New York Times map captures with striking clarity the historical stakes of the current battle over Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In its juxtaposition of two electoral landscapes—the present configuration and a speculative future absent federal protection—the map reveals both the persistence and fragility of Black political representation in the Deep South. The existing map reflects the cumulative impact of half a century of litigation and federal oversight: 24 Democratic seats, many anchored in majority-Black districts deliberately drawn to comply with Section 2. These enclaves, scattered across Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and neighboring states, stand as the legal and political inheritance of the civil rights era. The projected map, by contrast, imagines the consequences of a Supreme Court retreat from race-conscious districting. In this scenario, Republicans would gain a dozen additional seats, nine directly tied to the dismantling of Section 2 protections. The map of the South goes from red interlaced with blue to almost solid red.

The court’s ruling, expected by June 2026, will likely define redistricting policy for the remainder of the decade. Depending on its reasoning, Mississippi and its Southern counterparts may either retain, revise, or relinquish their obligation to consider race in crafting electoral districts. The outcome will influence not only who represents Mississippi in Congress but also the broader trajectory of American democracy’s relationship to race and representation.

In this moment, Mississippi once again stands at the intersection of constitutional interpretation and historical memory—a reminder that the struggle for political equality, though transformed in form, remains very much alive.

General Assembly signal a shift in U.S. refugee and asylum policy. USCRI examines what these changes mean for America’s humanitarian commitments.

Last month, on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly, officials from the U.S. State Department led a discussion on the global refugee and asylum system. The Administration’s emerging approach undermines decades of bipartisan commitment to protecting refugees and upholding international law. Reassessing refugee protection could be constructive, but any reforms must strengthen—not weaken—safeguards for those fleeing persecution.

The discussion was opened by Spencer Chretien, Senior Bureau Official of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, and hosted by Christopher Landau, Deputy Secretary of State. During the panel, Landau articulated principles intended to define the Administration’s new approach:

Sovereignty: “We get to decide who comes in and under what circumstances and for how long.”

First country of asylum policy: “There is no right to immigrate or to receive asylum or refugee status in the country of an individual’s choice.”

Extreme narrowing of asylum eligibility: “Economic privation is not a basis for asylum.”

Formalizing “temporary” asylum status: “Refugee status is temporary,” and this will prevent people “from abusing the system.”

Returns: “Every country … must agree to accept expeditiously the return of its nations.”

These principles mark a significant shift in how the United States interprets and applies longstanding refugee and asylum commitments. Earlier in the week, UNGA high-level representatives were told that migration is “destroying your country,” and that “countries are being ruined” by “uncontrolled migration.” For his part, Landau asserted that asylum and refugee protection are being used to bypass legal immigration pathways, acting as a “substitute” for immigration and fueling mass migration to the United States. Landau also stated, without presenting any supporting evidence, that there is wide abuse of the system.

Let’s be clear: Upholding refugee rights does not lead to uncontrolled migration. The right to seek asylum or refugee status is a fundamental human right. Protections for refugees and asylum seekers have been endorsed and expanded by international treaties and national laws for decades.

Consider the historical record of refugee and migrant protection:

Human mobility is constant and driven by war, persecution, climate impacts on livelihoods, or the pursuit of opportunity and safety. International cooperation on the protection and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons has occurred for centuries.

Intergovernmental organizations coordinating global responses to large-scale displacement such as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) and its predecessor the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), have existed for over 80 years.

The Refugee Convention, an international treaty protecting the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, has been in force since 1951. A protocol reaffirming and expanding those rights has been in force since 1967. Countries that haven’t signed or ratified these instruments are still bound by universal human rights norms, including the principle of non-refoulement, or returning someone to a country where their life is in danger.

The U.S. refugee program, established by the Refugee Act of 1980 and passed unanimously by Congress, has provided a framework for admitting and resettling refugees ever since. The program reflects a longstanding U.S. commitment to providing refuge to those fleeing persecution and danger.

Seeking Asylum is Not a Loophole

During the panel, Landau claimed that asylum is a loophole in U.S. immigration laws, asserting that “90-plus percent of people are found not to be eligible for asylum”. This is not true. While the latest U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) report shows that around 10 percent of affirmative asylum applications were granted between October to December 2024, a 10 percent grant rate does not mean that 90 percent of applications were fraudulent. Around 80 percent of asylum applications were administratively closed or dismissed before adjudication. Reasons for closure could include withdrawal of the application by the applicant, death of the applicant, change in immigration status, involuntary transfer to immigration court, failure to appear at scheduled interviews or hearings, or incomplete documentation. There are many reasons that cases are closed. What is clear is that Landau’s framing was misleading and did not seem to reference grant rates in defensive asylum cases, which has fluctuated between 25 and 49 percent during the past ten years.

Asylum grant rates are also strongly correlated with legal representation. However, having an attorney is not a right in immigration court, despite what’s at stake. Asylum seekers, if deported back to their country, may face years-long detention, torture, or even death. Retaining an attorney can be difficult because the process can take years, due to backlogs at USCIS and immigration courts. Children and infants are also not guaranteed an attorney, despite efforts to do so both in Congress and from non-governmental organizations. If not for governmental programs, which are at grave risk, many more children would be forced to file applications, prepare evidence, and argue for themselves in immigration court.

Some claims overlook that asylum outcomes are highly sensitive to political changes. The Executive Branch has significant discretion in implementing asylum policy and can issue guidance affecting eligibility and adjudication without formal rulemaking, though fundamental changes to the law or regulations still require proper procedural steps. For example, the Executive Branch recently imposed higher barriers for survivors of domestic violence to be granted asylum. Nationality, age, and gender can significantly impact asylum claims—a topic that has been the subject of extensive academic research. Additionally, the Executive Branch controls interviews, staffing, access to lawyers, and the cost of applying.

In short, the Government has significant control over who is granted asylum. Grant and denial rates should be viewed as an outcome of policy decisions, rather than a judgment about who is truly in need of asylum protection.

Finally, individuals seeking a loophole in the U.S. immigration system would not choose to exploit the arduous asylum process. Applying for asylum is a marathon process that re-traumatizes applicants, their families, and everyone involved in the process. People who apply for asylum are also forced to gamble for their future, since the final decision usually rests on a single asylum officer or immigration judge.

The United States has already started to implement policies that has resulted in decreased refugee admissions and significantly impaired access to asylum. The United States’s stance may embolden more countries to adopt restrictive refugee and asylum policies. This month, the European countries are clashing over new asylum policies due to many countries’ reluctance to welcome more refugees. Furthermore, the current Administration has already recruited nations to participate in its third-country deportation scheme, despite human rights concerns over refoulement.

On a global scale, the proposed reinvention of the refugee and asylum system is particularly harmful considering the present reality. At a time of unprecedented levels of displacement, countries should be working together to upscale solutions. Tearing down the system risks more instability and increased displacement—all at the cost of people who are fleeing death, torture, and harm.

Background

USCRI joined Refugee Council USA (RCUSA) in urging the Administration to uphold refugee protections, and separately joined over 260 faith-based, non-governmental, and other civil society organizations calling on UN Member States to uphold international refugee treaties. Also, 117 refugee-led organizations from 41 countries urged UN Member States to reaffirm commitments to refugee protections.

In a following speech, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi urged countries to recommit to multilateralism. While assuring countries that UNHCR appreciates challenges posed by population flows, Grandi clearly stated that the problem is not one of principles codified in the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol: “In an environment where everything is highly politicized, putting the Refugee Convention and the principle of asylum on the table would be a catastrophic error. It would lead us down blind alleys and, ultimately, it would make the problem more difficult to address. Beware, please, the easy fix!”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) today filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to challenge a rule that threatens the livelihoods of nearly 200,000 people. Under the rule, issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) on September 29, 2025, asylum seekers, refugees, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients who have work authorization are barred from holding commercial driver’s licenses based on their immigration status. These licenses are necessary for truck drivers, bus drivers, and delivery drivers, among others.

The lawsuit, titled Rivera Lujan v. FMSCA, was filed on behalf of Jorge Rivera Lujan, Aleksei Semenovskii, AFSCME, and the AFT, and will challenge both the substance of the rule and FMCSA’s failure to follow rulemaking procedures required by law.

“This unlawful rule seems intended to put people authorized to work in the United States out of work, solely because of the prejudices of the Trump administration,” said Wendy Liu, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group. “We are asking the court to promptly invalidate the rule to prevent devastating consequences for our clients and the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who depend on commercial driver’s licenses for their livelihoods.”

Issued without the required notice and comment period, the rule states that it is effective immediately. When Rivera Lujan, a DACA recipient and truck driver of 11 years who owns his own trucking company, went to renew his license on September 30, he was told that he could not do so because of the new rule.

“Without a commercial driver’s license, I will lose my business and the income that allows me to provide for my family,” said Mr. Rivera Lujan, who has lived in the United States since he was 2 years old. “I have followed all the rules and complied with all requirements set by the government.”

Mr. Semenovskii, an asylum seeker from Russia who has been driving trucks for more than five years, said. “Driving a truck is how I support my family. I’ve endured tremendous hardship but have fought to rebuild my life through trucking. For me and so many others, this rule will be a tragedy, destroying years of sacrifice and honest work.”

“The administration’s new rule prevents immigrants who are lawfully present in the country and authorized to work from supporting themselves and their families,” said AFSCME President Lee Saunders. “It also disrupts essential services communities rely on. Drivers who take our children to school, deliver food and medicine, and clean trash off the streets must have these commercial driver’s licenses, and denying them inflicts unnecessary pain on everyone their lives touch.”",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:22:15.345188

It wasn't a topic of discussion or conversation. It was an order. So, I will enter it today and then I will expect it will be followed.""

The second-in-command for CBP told U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis that as of Monday, all CBP agents in Chicago for Operation Midway Blitz have been equipped with and trained on body cameras. He said there are currently 232 CBP agents in the area, but a couple dozen will be leaving Tuesday with a remaining 201 CBP agents working on Operation Midway Blitz. He confirmed all of them have cameras.

U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis wants answers on how immigration enforcement is being carried out and why body cameras still aren't being used.

At the center of the hearing are scenes like what we saw in the city's East Side neighborhood last week: federal agents in riot gear dispersing crowds with chemical agents in residential neighborhoods. Agents were also seen throwing tear gas out of a car window on a busy Logan Square street near an elementary school.

In both cases, not just civilians but also Chicago police officers were exposed to the chemical agents without proper protective gear.

Judge Ellis previously ordered agents to stop dispersing peaceful crowds and banned the use of tear gas on people who aren't a threat. Now she's pressing ICE and Border Patrol over their noncompliance on her body camera order.

Friday, she reprimanded the federal government for ignoring the order and DHS pushed back, calling reports of a camera mandate false.

Legal experts like Kent College of Law Professor Richard Kling say the judge's frustration is about accountability.

""She was not satisfied that ICE was following her order,"" he said. ""She wanted TV like the rest of us and apparently realized that ICE was going to do what ICE wanted to do.""

Representatives from ICE and Border Patrol will have to explain their use of force and why they've failed to implement body cameras in court.

Monday is also a key deadline in the case over the deployment of the National Guard in Illinois.

Demand for Accountability in the Mishandling of Emmanuel Gonzales Case

To: Mayor Whitmire

From: A constituent in Houston , TX

October 20

I am writing to express deep outrage and heartbreak over the handling of the case involving Emmanuel Gonzales, an autistic teenager who was reported to ICE instead of being issued an Amber Alert. This failure represents not only a gross miscarriage of justice but a devastating breach of community trust. Emmanuel should have been treated as a child in need of protection, not as an immigration case. Dallas has shown that refusing to cooperate with ICE by turning down $25 million in federal incentives can be a moral stance that prioritizes human rights. Houston, instead, chose to hand an autistic teenager over to federal custody, where he was reportedly operated on without his mother’s consent or presence. The decision by the officers involved to involve ICE instead of following proper Amber Alert protocol is indefensible. Those responsible must be held accountable. Anything less communicates to Houston’s Hispanic and immigrant communities that they cannot trust local law enforcement to protect their children. This loss of trust will not only harm community relationships but will increase fear, isolation, and ultimately, crime rates. Houston deserves leadership that stands with its people, not against them. We need a mayor who values integrity, compassion, and justice over political appeasement. Right now, this administration is failing that standard. I urge your office to 1 Publicly explain why Emmanuel was reported to ICE instead of being treated as a missing child. 2 Take disciplinary action against any officer or department responsible. 3 Implement safeguards to ensure that no other child is ever subjected to such mistreatment again. This tragedy is unacceptable.

Slaughter, urging the Court to reaffirm that the President alone holds constitutional authority to remove executive officials.

For nearly ninety years, the Court’s 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States (Humphrey’s Executor) has stripped presidents of control over so-called “independent” agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—allowing unelected bureaucrats to wield executive power without accountability to the American people. The Constitution is clear: all executive power is vested in the President, and Congress has no authority to administer or execute the laws it enacts.

Humphrey’s Executor has stood as one of the most damaging precedents in American history. The decision allowed Congress to shield the FTC from presidential oversight by claiming it has “quasi-legislative” and “quasi-judicial” powers, whatever that means. The Constitution permits no such thing. The Framers vested all executive power in one branch—the Executive, and one person within that branch, the President—so that the law could be faithfully carried out and responsibility could be clearly fixed.

AFL’s brief explains that this case is not about expanding presidential power, but restoring constitutional order. The Supreme Court has not hesitated to correct its own constitutional errors—whether in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Janus v. AFSCME, or Seila Law LLC v. CFPB—and it should do so again here. Overruling Humphrey’s Executor would reaffirm the separation of powers, end Congress’s unconstitutional interference in executive functions, and return accountability to the American people.

“The Federal Trade Commission undoubtedly exercises executive power. The President necessarily must be able to remove any official who does so, and it is time for the Supreme Court to finally overturn Humphrey’s Executor for good,” said Gene Hamilton, President of America First Legal.

America First Legal will continue to fight to restore the rule of law, the separation of powers, and the principles of accountability that define our republic.

The Nebraska Examiner sought comments about the megabill’s impact on SNAP from all five members of the Nebraska delegation.
About 20% of commodities comes from the USDA emergency food assistance program and the rest largely from donors and companies.
Currently, able-bodied adults are limited to three months of SNAP benefits every three years unless they work 20 hours a week or qualify for an exemption.

Now age 46 with 10 children, the Afghan refugee works full-time in a Nebraska production job and says $2,100 in monthly public grocery assistance has helped his family make ends meet. He and his wife expected to gain financial independence as their kids got educated and into careers.

But any sense of stability has crumbled, the man said, as his family faces the impact of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law that Trump calls “big” and “beautiful” — and Nebraska’s implementation this week of related changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Mohsen, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation against family in the U.S. and abroad, is among an estimated 7,000 refugees, asylees and other Nebraska newcomers without permanent residency status who are poised to lose their SNAP benefits, according to Nebraska Appleseed, a statewide organization that advocates for low-income people and immigrants. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services put that number closer to 6,300.

Under the megabill approved July 4, the grocery benefits now will be limited to citizens and green card-carrying lawful permanent residents who also meet income guidelines. Also eligible are Cuban and Haitian newcomers and those in the U.S. as part of a compact of free association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Currently about 150,000 Nebraskans, nearly 8% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible for SNAP.

According to Appleseed, another 10,000 or so SNAP recipients in Nebraska — including veterans, homeless and people recently aged out of foster care — are at risk of reduced SNAP benefits under changes and stricter work requirements in the new law. Appleseed estimates are based on 2023 data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Supporters of more stringent restrictions have argued that they will increase accountability, self-sufficiency and help cut government spending.

While the changes were expected to squeeze out some participants — accommodating a reported $186 billion cut in SNAP spending over the next decade — Nebraska’s release last week of details on how the bill impacts local populations has advocacy agencies scrambling to try and ensure no one goes hungry.

Based on guidance received recently from the feds, DHHS issued a statement Friday on the changes to be enforced starting Oct. 20, 10 days before the federal deadline for full implementation.

State officials said they’ve started contacting recipients to alert them, and also have assembled a list of frequently asked questions. Eligibility for each person or family is to be reevaluated when they recertify for the program, which happens every six months, or when household characteristics are updated. So cutoffs won’t all happen at once. Mohsen, for example, recently recertified and faces SNAP loss in April.

DHHS spokesman Jeff Powell noted that Nebraska is mandated to enforce the changes. Due to the federal shutdown, the state is waiting for additional guidance and said it will provide updates as more information is received. Under the new law — backed by all five members of Nebraska’s congressional delegation — states will be subject to financial penalties based on error rates.

In addition, Nebraska will have to provide an estimated $17 million more in the coming fiscal year to administer the program, said Eric Savaiano, Nebraska Appleseed’s economic justice program manager.

“Monumental” changes, as he called them, have spurred formation of a Nebraska coalition of emergency food providers and refugee advocacy agencies to discuss ways to respond and fill gaps.

Hit from different directions

Some advocates say it is particularly jarring to know the loss for newcomers, such as Afghans and Ukrainians, who fled war. Refugees and people granted asylum typically left their homelands seeking safety from persecution and violence and have been vetted by the U.S. government to be granted that relief.

In the case of Mohsen, he said he was lawfully admitted to the U.S. in 2021, moved to Nebraska in 2022, and has applied for asylum. He said he previously had applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, based on service work with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, and was rejected. While the government has authorized him to work while his asylum application is pending, he does not have permanent residency or citizenship status, which is now grounds for losing SNAP benefits.

“Twenty years I worked with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. They promised they will help me,” Mohsen said. “We already had the hard life in Afghanistan — why make our life so hard here?”

He said hits are coming from other directions, too. Family members have been denied Medicaid benefits, he said. Bills from a few emergency room visits have piled up and haunt him as he has ignored them to pay others.

His three oldest children were denied federal financial aid to attend Nebraska’s public university system, and the reason given, the dad said, was “illegal” immigration status.

“We did not come here illegally,” he said. The three ended up enrolling at Metropolitan Community College.

Mohsen, interviewed this week after he finished parent-teacher conferences for his elementary-age kids, said his wife stays at home to care for their children. The youngest, 3 years old and a U.S. citizen, likely still could qualify for SNAP.

The Nebraska Examiner sought comments about the megabill’s impact on SNAP from all five members of the Nebraska delegation. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Nebraska, responded. He said he negotiated to reduce Nebraska’s cost of implementing SNAP by half.

“I tried to get the best bill possible, while also increasing funding for our military by $150 billion, modernizing our air traffic control and preventing a 20% tax increase on all families,” he said.

Pantries scramble

Hannah Vlach of Omaha-based Restoring Dignity says advocates have been trying to prepare for the changes but still hold out hope the state will create a program to help cover lost food benefits.

DHHS’ Powell said all options would be considered.

But the shifts come as Nebraska lawmakers struggle already with a state government budget shortfall.

Vlach said it feels particularly “immoral” to pull assistance from a refugee who fought alongside the U.S. She said it hints at something darker.

“When we look back at history, every time a targeted group had food taken away, it marked the beginning of something horrific,” she said.

Toby Rees of Kountze Commons in downtown Omaha said her food pantry already is short of proteins supplied by the Food Bank for the Heartland and has tried to compensate by, for example, using donor funds and grants to buy groceries at a discount from cooperating stores.

“The need is going to increase,” she said, noting the new faces among about 400 people that visited the pantry Monday. Kountze does not ask for income or other verification, nor does it limit visits, she said. More immigrant and refugee families are seeking a new and “safe” place to get food, she said.

“It’s really scaring them,” she added.

Vlach said the coalition is preparing documents in 13 languages that provide information and pictures on available Omaha area pantries and places where people can seek food.

“Everybody’s resources are limited,” said Rees. “But we are banding together.”

Tim Williams of the Food Bank for the Heartland says his organization provides food to about 500 pantries and other partners in 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa. About 20% of commodities comes from the USDA emergency food assistance program and the rest largely from donors and companies.

He called SNAP one of the most useful tools for families to access nutritious food. The food bank is worried about the added burden on pantries at a time of less federal emergency food assistance and greater demand.

“There is immense concern about how this will exacerbate the already really high food insecurity problem across the heartland,” said Williams.

Work requirements

Appleseed’s Savaiano fears that expanded work requirements under the new law will create more administrative paperwork that will “gum up” the process and lead to reduced SNAP benefits for populations beyond refugees and immigrants.

Currently, able-bodied adults are limited to three months of SNAP benefits every three years unless they work 20 hours a week or qualify for an exemption. The new law expands work requirements through age 64 (it was age 54 before), and excludes parents with children younger than 14 (it used to be 18).

DHHS said three groups no longer are exempted from work requirements: veterans, homeless individuals and those aging out of foster care. The state said those exemptions were temporary due to the Fiscal Responsibility Act and now are being removed. A new exception was added for Indians, Urban Indians, and others eligible for Indian Health Services.

Advocates are urging Nebraskans to lean on federal lawmakers to repeal SNAP changes or support alternative programs.

Confounding Mohsen, he said, is why his case seeking a more permanent status has moved so slowly through the immigration court system.

“I worked honestly for those 20 years,” he said of service to the U.S. military. “Sometimes it makes me crazy, it’s upsetting.”

Mohsen hopes to find other avenues to put healthy food on his family’s table, but he is bracing for the last resort. That would be for his older children to quit or delay schooling and help the family financially. He said education and hope for meaningful careers was always the lure of the U.S.

“Our big hope is education,” Mohsen said. “If they don’t get education, it’s not meaningful for us.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47648/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_8574-1024x6961760969119.jpg?h=3ac079aa&itok=gXxzrhqI,N,,2025-10-20 12:58:00.265100

These commissioned officers frequently work jobs that are difficult to fill with civilian health care providers — including at rural Indian Health Service clinics, prisons, and ICE detention facilities.
The report documents several instances of ICE health workers giving incorrect diagnoses, prescribing medication to people with contraindications, and delaying treatment during heart attacks, suicide attempts, and other emergencies.","The detention centers — which currently hold more than 60,000 people — are overcrowded and the use of hastily constructed facilities like tent cities makes it easier, public health officials said, for communicable diseases to spread and more difficult to manage chronic illnesses. At the same time, oversight of the centers has eroded, as layoffs hit the Homeland Security offices investigating allegations of abuse and neglect, and lawmakers attempting to visit facilities in their districts are turned away.

Frequent transfers of migrants between states have also disrupted medical treatments, and allowed prescriptions and other records to be lost in transit. Migrants have died in recent months of infections, Covid-19, injuries, uncontrolled diabetes, and suicide — according to government reports.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to several questions about staffing plans, deaths in detention, and accusations of medical neglect. In a recent New York court filing responding to a lawsuit by the ACLU, the agency argued that it “provide[s] adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care to individuals in custody” and that “all medication, whether brought by the detainee or later, is received by [the ICE Health Service Corps] and administered according to proper medical procedures.”

Independent watchdog groups that track health care access for detained migrants dispute those claims, but say increasing the health care workforce could help prevent further deaths by reducing delays in the dispensing of medications and ensuring a more thorough intake process that gathers detainees’ medical histories to avoid future emergencies.

Yet Jonathan White, a retired commander in the U.S. Public Health Service Corps who oversaw the detention of undocumented, unaccompanied minors during the first Trump administration, said that without more fundamental policy changes, people will continue to get sick and die.

“The larger problem is that this is a system to abduct and detain people without meaningful due process,” he said. “That is inherently harmful and cannot be made humane or healthy or safe no matter how many people you throw at it.”

More detainees, less oversight

Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security tried to to eliminate its offices that investigate complaints of discrimination, neglect and mistreatment of detainees — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman — calling them “internal adversaries that slow down operations.” DHS accused the oversight staff of “adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining [the department’s] mission.”

After human rights groups sued, the offices were restored in May, but hundreds of their staff were laid off a few months later as part of a government-wide reduction in force, hobbling oversight efforts. An ongoing lawsuit seeks to bring the fired workers back.

Trump also fired the independent inspectors general that investigated claims regarding the conditions of detention centers.

Rebekah Wolf, staff attorney with the Immigration Justice Campaign and Policy Department of the American Immigration Council, which represents immigrants in detention, said health care in ICE detention centers has always had problems. But now, she said, there’s less transparency and accountability.

“I have a client right now who has untreated diabetes — they just stopped giving her medicine,” she said. “And so we’re like, ‘Hey, detention center, why’d you stop giving this medicine?’ And there’s just no response.”

The ACLU and Detention Watch Network, two advocacy groups that focus on conditions for migrants, report that medical neglect is the most common complaint they hear from clients in ICE custody. Immigrants at the Louisiana State Penitentiary and California City Detention Facility launched hunger strikes in September, in part to protest poor access to medical care and mental health care, including difficulty accessing diabetes medication and receiving treatment for injuries. In August, in response to a class-action lawsuit in New York City, a judge ordered ICE to allow migrants to keep prescription medications they had on them when they were detained or that family members brought to detention centers. And in early October, a detainee in Michigan with chronic myeloid leukemia sued the Trump administration, saying his chemotherapy was suspended for several weeks after being detained, risking serious complications.

Some Democratic lawmakers are introducing legislation to address the deaths in custody. Jayapal partly attributes the reports of poor medical care to Trump tapping private prison companies to handle immigration detention centers while eroding government oversight. She plans to introduce a bill to mandate that all ICE facilities are run by federal employees, arguing that would help curb self-dealing and profit seeking at the expense of detainees’ quality of care.

“Now, with the massive increases in money that are going out, the firing of all the inspector generals and the corruption within the system,” she said. “I mean, you’ve got Tom Homan accepting bags of cash,” she added, referring to allegations that Trump’s border czar took a $50,000 bribe from undercover FBI agents last year.

Homan has denied that he took a bribe from federal agents, and the Justice Department reportedly shut down the investigation into the incident. “I didn’t take $50,000 from anybody,” Homan said in a Wednesday night appearance on NewsNation’s “Cuomo” town hall.

Staffing up

The health care-related job openings include posts at some of the detention centers where deaths have been reported and where watchdog groups have alleged unsafe conditions and medical neglect, including the facility in Jena, Louisiana, where multiple foreign students have been detained, as well as centers in Eloy and Florence, Arizona.

Most of the people providing health services to ICE detainees are private contractors, but the new jobs are open only to current members of the U.S. Public Health Service Corps — one of the country’s eight uniformed services made up of roughly 6,000 public health and medical professionals. These commissioned officers frequently work jobs that are difficult to fill with civilian health care providers — including at rural Indian Health Service clinics, prisons, and ICE detention facilities.

If ICE doesn’t get enough applications for the jobs, said White, public health officers could be ordered to deploy there temporarily or permanently. But he said avoidable deaths are likely to continue even with a few dozen more medical personnel because the detainee population is swelling by the tens of thousands and is being held in worse conditions with less oversight. He voiced particular concern about an uptick in self-harm and suicide.

“Compared to the population that is traditionally seen in the immigration system, the level of trauma and psychological distress of those caught up in this new abduction machine will be much greater,” he said. “These people are proportionally much more likely to have the most severe psychological reaction to being removed, because they have many years in this country, roots in their communities, and U.S. national children who they’re being separated from.”

A 2024 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, and American Oversight, based on thousands of pages of government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, argued that more than 90 percent of deaths in ICE custody could have been prevented with better medical care. The report documents several instances of ICE health workers giving incorrect diagnoses, prescribing medication to people with contraindications, and delaying treatment during heart attacks, suicide attempts, and other emergencies. The report examined the deaths of 52 people in ICE custody from 2017-2021, covering Trump’s first term and the first year of Biden’s presidency.

“The lack of medical staffing is a consistent theme,” but far from the only issue, said Eunice Cho, a senior counsel for the ACLU who has worked on several lawsuits related to conditions in ICE detention. “Specialist care is denied. People are transferred from place to place before they’re able to actually get their care. People are not given medication.”

Human rights groups are also concerned that deaths may be undercounted. “There is no standardized way in which ICE reports on deaths. It is quite possible that people have died and no one knows,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice president of U.S. advocacy and litigation at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, which is suing DHS alongside the Immigration Council and the ACLU, among other groups.

Enriquez said that families of migrants who died in detention have spoken out about a death before ICE has publicly accounted for it.

As ICE works to fill the new medical jobs, the agency’s surge in detentions is far outpacing its expansion of detention capacity. The administration aims to hold up to 100,000 people per day, and as the federal government increasingly houses migrants in tents and converted local jails heading into flu season, advocates and investigators are worried.

“My greatest fear is that we’re going to continue to see the number of people who unfortunately die as a result of being held in immigration detention grow,” Cho said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F70%2F5b%2F2da27fdc4d2a961dd553b27ad479%2Fimmigration-detention-centers-84000.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 10:16:53.342404

Here’s what you can do:

Family and immigration background

Leqaa Kordia is a 32-year-old Muslim Palestinian woman who came to the United States on a visitor visa to reunite with her mother after many years apart. She later obtained a student visa to study English, while her mother filed a family-based visa petition for her. Immigration authorities approved that petition in 2021.

Following incorrect advice, Leqaa ended her student visa, believing that the visa petition approval meant she already had legal status while waiting for her green card. This left her without lawful immigration status.

Grieving and speaking out

Leqaa has lost about 175 family members during Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. Motivated by grief and solidarity, she began attending protests in New Jersey and nearby areas in 2023.

On April 30, 2024, Leqaa joined a peaceful protest outside Columbia University in New York. Police ordered demonstrators to disperse and arrested Leqaa and several others. She was released the next day, and all charges were later dismissed.

Targeted under discriminatory orders

In January 2025, President Trump issued two Executive Orders calling for the arrest, detention, and deportation of non-citizens who showed support for Palestinian rights. Amnesty International condemned these orders as discriminatory and repressive.

Soon after, immigration authorities began identifying people they believed took part in pro-Palestinian protests, including Leqaa. They obtained her 2024 arrest record from the NYPD.

On March 6, 2025, immigration agents visited her mother’s home and questioned her in front of Leqaa over the phone. When Leqaa later met with officials at the Newark ICE Field Office with her lawyer, she was detained on the spot—even though ICE determined she posed no threat and had no criminal history.

That night, she was transferred to Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas, far from her lawyer and family. The facility has a record of serious human rights violations.

Ongoing detention and legal battles

Leqaa’s immigration case is now being handled in Texas. Since April 2025, two judges have ordered her release on a $20,000 bond, recognizing she should not remain in detention. However, ICE has blocked both orders by filing automatic and discretionary stays. She is now seeking release through federal court.

Violations of religious rights

While detained, Leqaa’s religious rights have been repeatedly violated. She has been served almost no halal meals, forcing her to eat food that doesn’t meet her dietary requirements and causing significant weight loss.

During Ramadan, staff refused to let her save food for when she could break her fast, forcing her either to go hungry or to break her fast early. She has not been provided with clothing suitable for prayer or a clean prayer space. Staff also ignore her requests to announce when male officers enter her dorm area while she is without her hijab.

Seeking safety and justice

Alongside her family-based petition for permanent residency, Leqaa has filed for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Before her detention, she lived in New Jersey and cared for two close family members with health issues and disabilities.

The judges sat down with NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit for a wide-ranging interview covering the termination of immigration judges, a wave of new policy memos concerning immigration court operations, and why they fear judicial independence is in jeopardy.

“Honestly, it’s not easy to speak out and it’s a little bit frightening,” said former Immigration Judge Kyra Lilien, who was abruptly fired in July from her post at the immigration court in Concord shortly before completing her two-year probationary period.

Lilien, who was appointed by the Biden administration in 2023, said more than a dozen other judges from her probationary class were fired the same day. The judge recalls being in the middle of a hearing when an email hit her inbox informing her that she was being terminated.

“It makes no sense to eliminate high performing expert judges in the name of efficiency,” said Lilien, noting her history of exemplary performance reviews. “It’s just ludicrous.”

Former Judge Elizabeth Young, who served as Assistant Chief Immigration Judge in San Francisco before being promoted to Regional Deputy Chief Immigration Judge last year, ultimately resigned shortly after President Trump took office for the second time.

Just 30 minutes following President Trump’s inauguration, Young says her bosses were fired and she was reassigned from her post supervising immigration judges in the court’s western region.

“I had no idea what to do,” Young said. “There was no precedent for this. It was shocking.”

After weeks of sitting at home without direction, Young said she decided to step down from the working group she had been moved to.

“All of us that were assigned to this working group quickly realized that it was just a way to kind of get us out of the agencies that we were in,” Young said.

While the mass firings of judges have sent shockwaves through immigration court, the judges said they believe the personnel moves are just one component of a larger plan: For the Trump administration, using the power of the executive branch, to reshape the country’s immigration system.

“This is one piece of a very complex web of policies, executive orders, and actions,” Young said. “It’s an end run around changing the law.”

The Trump administration has stated it’s merely enforcing existing immigration laws that were ignored by President Biden.

“Over the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, administered, and oversaw an unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States,” an inauguration day executive order from President Trump stated. “Millions of illegal aliens crossed our borders or were permitted to fly directly into the United States on commercial flights and allowed to settle in American communities, in violation of longstanding Federal laws.”

Young and Lilien are just two of the 139 immigration judges who have been fired, resigned, or involuntarily transferred, according to the union that represents them. Thirteen of the fired judges served in either San Francisco or Concord.

“San Francisco is one of the areas that’s been disproportionately targeted for firings by this administration,” said Matt Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE).

Biggs questioned the timing and scope of the firings, as immigration courts face massive backlogs and judges handle upwards of 700 cases each year.

To replenish the thinning ranks of immigration judges across the country, the Trump administration recently authorized up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges.

“Their strategy here is to remove the current immigration judges, as many as they can, and replace them,” Biggs speculated..

Immigration judges serve under the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is part of the executive branch. It means the Attorney General has the power to hire and fire them.

The judges say the administration is wielding that power to exert pressure on judges

“There’s a very strong idea that if you don’t follow the policy, you’ll lose your job,” Lilien said. “I think a lot of judges feel a lot of fear and pressure that’s unprecedented.”

Lilien said much of that pressure has come in the form of dozens of new EOIR policy memos, some of which have suggested how, and how fast, judges should rule on cases.

“The pressure to resolve cases quickly, the pressure to increase the number of cases you resolve, the pressure, frankly, to deny cases,” Lilien said. “There were so many pressures that came together that really pushed judges into a position where you felt you had to rule a certain way in order to preserve your job.”

Young said she never had to face those pressures directly, since she had already resigned, but has been closely following the influx of new policies, such as one that encouraged judges to throw out “insufficient” asylum applications without a hearing

“From the outside, I know that I would not want to be a judge right now because it would be very difficult to remain independent,” she said.

To alleviate the perceived pressure, Lilien said it’s worth considering removing immigration judges from Department of Justice control.

“There is no room for independent adjudication when we are hamstrung by the Attorney General,” Lilien said. “It’s just not possible with this structure.”

EOIR did not respond to NBC Bay Area’s request for comment, but a July EOIR policy memo on ""adjudicator impartiality and independence” reminded judges they are “inferior officers subject to both appointment and removal by the Attorney General.”

Acting EOIR director Circe Owen has also been critical of immigration judges for “not efficiently managing their dockets.”

Judges aren’t the only ones experiencing fear. Nearly every immigrant we’ve talked to at immigration court said they feel it as well.

Since May, ICE agents have had a heavy presence at the immigration courts in San Francisco and Concord and have arrested dozens of immigrants following seemingly routine hearings.

“The presence of ICE in the courthouse really exacerbated that [fear],” Lilien said. “There was just incredibly increased tension, and a couple of things happened as a result: A lot of people stopped coming to court, they missed their hearings, they lost their cases by not coming to court.”

Young said the agency’s enforcement operations within the hallways of immigration court are unprecedented.

“Historically, that had never been the practice,” Young said. “In fact, there was an emphasis on understanding that if ICE was able to come in whenever they want and arrest anyone, that would deter respondents from coming.”

An ICE spokesperson previously told NBC Bay Area that Secretary Noem is “reversing Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets” and that undocumented immigrants in the country for less than two years were being put into expedited removal, which fast-tracks deportation proceedings.

As they watch the wave of firings continue, the Young and Lilien have been searching for a common thread that might explain which judges are being selected for termination.

“The trend seems to be that people who at any point in their lives ever represented a noncitizen,” Lilien said.

Lilien said she believes judges hired by the Biden administration, like herself, were also particularly vulnerable.

Then there are judges’ asylum approval rates, which many attorneys and immigrant rights advocates have suggested could be a factor in the firings.

Some of the judges fired in San Francisco had asylum grant rates north of 90%, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University. Lilien’s was about 77%, according to TRAC, though she says those numbers are outdated.

Both judges said comparing asylum grant rates between judges can be misleading, and the numbers have never been used to measure a judge’s performance.

“In my case, I think it did not have anything to do with my firing,” Lilien said. “I was part of a class of judges who were fired and many of them had very, very low grant rates.”

Asylum grant rates, they said, can dramatically vary between judges based on several factors, including the types of cases on a judge’s docket, the percentage of immigrants in their courtroom who have attorneys, and the geographic location of the court.

San Francisco, the judges said, has a higher rate of represented respondents, hence higher asylum grant rates. It’s also within the 9th Circuit, where established case law is generally more favorable to respondents who are seeking asylum, according to the judges.

“So generally speaking, you’ll see a higher level of grants within the 9th circuit,” Lilien said.

In an August policy memo, however, the Department of Justice stated that judges with “outlier” asylum grant rates could face scrutiny.

“Adjudicatory outliers or statistically improbable outcome metrics, particularly relative to EOIR’s overall adjudicator corps and after controlling for sample size and relevant docket characteristics, may be indicative of a systematic bias or failure to adhere to applicable law that warrants close examination and potential action,” the memo stated.

While the judges puzzle over the firings, and what potential recourse they might have, they agree the entire immigration system is in urgent need of an overhaul. The country’s economy is dependent on immigrants, they said, and it’s important for Congress to update outdated immigration laws in a way that makes sense in the 21st century.

“I think we need to have a much more comprehensive review,” Young said. “We need to have a viable way for people to come here and temporarily work if that’s what our economics requires. Maybe we need a better system for addressing asylum. All those things are absolutely true, but it’s not within the purview of the executive branch to make those changes.”.",https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2025/10/1019-judges.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-20 12:03:22.703378

She said since January, the Department of Homeland Security has arrested over 480,000 criminal illegal immigrants and seized illegal guns and drugs.

According to Noem, 70 percent of those arrested have criminal charges against them or have been convicted of those criminal charges.

""We are focused on the worst of the worst,"" Noem explained. ""Bringing these people to justice. We’re not going to let individuals terrorize our streets anymore and we’re not going to let them make victims out of families that live in this country.""

In Sarasota, she said a convicted murderer who was an illegal immigrant from Cuba was arrested.

Noem explained that he had a prior removal order in 2008 and is now off the streets. He was also convicted of kidnapping and carjacking.

An illegal immigrant from El Salvador was also arrested. Noem said he was convicted of sexual assault against a child in 1995. He was deported twice and came back.

An illegal immigrant from Mexico was arrested for driving drunk, who was deported once re-entered and was issued a final order of removal in 2016. He was previously arrested for burglary, possession of cocaine, larceny, DUIs, and lewd acts against a minor.

An illegal immigrant from Honduras, who was convicted of domestic violence, had been deported twice before.

""These individuals are just a handful of people who’ve been in this country creating victims of American citizens,"" Noem stated. ""Now, those families no longer have to worry about them.

Noem touted the relationship Homeland Security has with law enforcement agencies across the state of Florida.

""Florida has been the state that has provided the most law enforcement agreements under the 287G than any other state. It shows that they recognize the importance of bringing individuals to justice who have committed crimes against people in their community,"" Noem said. ""But, also, ways that we can support our federal government in the work that we do as well. As far as enforcing our immigration laws, but also making sure these dangerous terrorists and criminals and gang members are brought to justice and removed out of our country.""

Noem said she is grateful for partnerships such as Alligator Alcatraz and Deportation Depot because it helped with detainment centers that allow Homeland Security to detain individuals until they can be removed.

""It’s more beneficial for the taxpayers, but it also provides the bedspace that we need until these individuals can be removed,"" she shared.

Self-deportation benefits

Noem explained that if people are in this country illegally, the United States will give them $1,000 and buy them a plane ticket to leave.

""Go home to your country and come the right way. If they wait until we detain them and have to remove them ourselves, they will never have the chance to come back to America,"" Noem explained.

However, if they have committed a crime in the United States, they will be prosecuted for those crimes.

""They will be prosecuted for their crimes first in this country and they will serve their time if convicted, which many of them have long histories of criminal activity and then they will be deported to their home countries,"" Noem said.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox13news.com/www.fox13news.com/content/uploads/2025/10/1280/720/snapshot-63.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-10-20 11:21:35.738816

Seattle’s Susana Reyes, just shy of finishing her two-year probationary period as an immigration judge, received a termination notice Sept. 19 amid the latest of several waves of firings across the country, according to the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, the umbrella union for a national immigration judges association.

The administration has fired more than 83 immigration judges since President Donald Trump took office, 24 of them in September, according to their union. Roughly 60 more have been forced out or left of their own accord. That leaves fewer than 600 immigration judges nationally to hear roughly 3.8 million pending cases.

Union President Matt Biggs said those quitting are fed up with pressure from the administration, as it carries out a mass deportation effort, to dismiss cases — allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to bypass judges and detain immigrants — or issue rulings unfavorable to immigrants.

The U.S. Department of Justice oversees immigration judges, who are not part of the independent judicial branch. An August Justice Department memo said “notwithstanding an oft-repeated myth to the contrary,” immigration judges can independently decide cases. Yet, the memo warned of “corrective action or discipline” if they do so at odds with the law or its interpretation by their boss: the U.S. attorney general.

The memo went on to say judges’ standards slipped under the Biden administration and the current one is “now forced to take numerous remedial actions.”

As Biggs sees it, the administration’s firing of judges runs counter to its aim of deporting as many people as quickly as possible. To do that, more judges are needed to work through the backlog. The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress in July calls for hiring up to 800 new ones. In addition, the administration is currently training military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges.

So getting rid of judges already serving strikes Biggs as “bizarre.” Termination notices, often effective immediately, have given no reasons.

“It does appear on its face that they are targeting judges that were hired during the Biden administration,” Biggs said.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to questions.

In the eyes of the Trump administration, Seattle’s Reyes may have had a couple of strikes against her. She was hired during the Biden administration. And, while many immigration judges previously served as ICE attorneys, she had worked as an immigration lawyer in Texas.

Her rulings were not, however, especially favorable to immigrants who appeared before her. She denied 71% of asylum applications in roughly her first year, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. That’s about average for Seattle’s immigration court, somewhat higher than the Tacoma immigration court’s denial rate of 66% and significantly above the national average of 57.7%.

“She wasn’t granting a whole lot of cases,” said Seattle immigration lawyer Adam Boyd. He said appearing before her was a pleasant experience. “She treated us with respect. She seemed pretty fair.”

“She was actually listening to my clients,” added Mill Creek immigration attorney Shara Svendsen, who said some immigration judges have been known to yell at immigrants and their attorneys.

Reached by phone, Reyes declined to comment.

Now that she’s off the bench, lawyers are wondering what will happen to cases that were on the judge’s docket. “It doesn’t seem like there’s any plan,” Boyd said. “We’re left guessing.”

Seattle immigration lawyer Brian Wolf said he has not been informed what will happen to a case Reyes was in the middle of deciding. He had a hearing last month before Reyes and she reserved judgment. Wolf doesn’t know whether a new hearing will be held or another judge will issue a decision by reviewing the records.

Seattle’s immigration court, which has more than 50,000 pending cases, according to TRAC, has seven remaining judges.

Meanwhile, uncertainty hangs over Portland’s immigration court. Immigration lawyers have found scheduled hearings before two of the court’s three judges have recently been canceled, according to Jordan Cunnings, legal director for Innovation Law Lab, a nonprofit immigrant rights group. And a member of an immigration lawyers association who liaisons with the court informed colleagues that it will have one judge for the foreseeable future, Cunnings said.

The umbrella union representing judges said no firings have hit the Portland court, and three judges were still listed on its website as of this weekend. It’s possible the judges were reassigned elsewhere, are hearing cases in different cities remotely or have quit or retired.

The Portland court handles not only all of Oregon’s cases but also all of Idaho’s and Alaska’s.

While judges working remotely from other cities could conceivably stand in, Cunnings wondered what will happen if only one judge is left to handle a backlog of nearly 42,000 cases. She said some immigrants have been waiting as long as seven years for a hearing.

“For a case to be set out again is just really devastating for a lot of people,” she said.

Compounding the pain, she said, the July budget bill implemented a new $100 fee for each year that an asylum application is pending. A family of four that waits seven years would have to pay $2,800.

Military lawyers could help tackle the backlog in the Northwest’s immigration courts. Some immigrant advocates don’t see that as a solution, fearing members of the armed services would be more swayed by administration pressure and less schooled in immigration law, an enormously complicated specialty.

Portland immigration lawyer Rachel Game doesn’t see it that way exactly. “I think if they have enough training and they come in with an idea of being neutral arbitrators of the facts … it’s OK,” she said.

The question for her is whether they can do so under the current administration.",https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/10172025_Immigration-Court_tzr_191208.jpg?d=1200x630,N,,2025-10-20 10:00:59.852573

“Hardened [Tren de Aragua] gang members are back in Venezuela.
MS-13 gang members are being prosecuted in the U.S. and El Salvador.
A top judge in Washington, D.C. had ordered the Trump administration to turn planes around after learning in an emergency lawsuit that officials were flying the men to El Salvador.
But former Justice Department officials appear frustrated that the Trump administration would effectively be blowing up cases involving alleged gang members that law enforcement spent years investigating to try to win over as cooperators.","Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly agreed to abandon confidential informants who were protected by the U.S. government to seal a deal with El Salvador’s president, who agreed to indefinitely detain dozens of Venezuelan deportees in a brutal prison.

The arrangement, inked in the days leading up to Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport alleged Venezuelan gang members, gave the administration access to the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, decried by human rights groups as a “tropical gulag” and concentration camp that has been central to a first wave of the president’s mass deportation agenda.

On a March 13 phone call, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele agreed to the deal, on the condition that MS-13 gang members Bukele wanted imprisoned in his jail were actually “informants” protected by the Department of Justice, according to The Washington Post.

Rather than dismissing the idea, Rubio agreed to speak with Attorney General Pam Bondi to abandon those protections, adding another layer to a secret agreement exposed in court documents and reporting in the wake of a months-long ordeal that ultimately led to a prisoner exchange and the release of 250 Venezuelans from CECOT to their home country this summer.

“Americans elected President Trump because they were tired of politicians making excuses,” State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement shared with The Independent.

“The Trump Administration’s results speak for themselves,” he said. “Hardened [Tren de Aragua] gang members are back in Venezuela. American hostages are home. MS-13 gang members are being prosecuted in the U.S. and El Salvador. And Americans are safer as a result of these incredible efforts.”

In his proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act in March, Trump stated that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of [Tren de Aragua], are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”

But government officials later admitted that “many” of those men did not have criminal records, and many were in the country with legal permission and scheduled to appear in court on their asylum claims.

A top judge in Washington, D.C. had ordered the Trump administration to turn planes around after learning in an emergency lawsuit that officials were flying the men to El Salvador. The administration resisted, provoking an extraordinary legal battle in which Trump himself demanded the judge’s impeachment.

According to The Washington Post, the White House feared that exact scenario if Venezuelans weren’t deported quickly enough.

Trump repeatedly called Rubio about the deal while the secretary was on a multiday trip to Saudi Arabia and Canada earlier this year, the newspaper reported.

While Trump sought a foreign country to facilitate his mass deportation scheme, Bukele needed support from the Justice Department to legitimize his leadership against global criticism for his threats to civil liberties, The Post noted.

Bukele appears to have held up his end of the bargain, effectively acting as a brutal pass-through for Venezuelan deportees. But only one of the nine men Bukele demanded were sent to El Salvador.

It is unclear whether they can keep up with legal battles to prevent their deportation.

But former Justice Department officials appear frustrated that the Trump administration would effectively be blowing up cases involving alleged gang members that law enforcement spent years investigating to try to win over as cooperators.

“It would be very disheartening if I worked my butt off for a year to collect that evidence … to get him into custody, to bring him to justice, just for the Department of Justice or the State Department to turn around and say, ‘OK we’re going to drop all charges,’” Daniel Brunner, a former FBI agent who worked on a joint task force investigating MS-13.

“It would gut me as a case agent,” he told The Washington Post.

After they were flown from immigration detention centers in the middle of the night to CECOT, roughly 250 Venezuelan men were shackled and gang-walked into the brutal maximum-security prison, where their heads were shaved, and then stuffed into jail cells where they lived for more than five months.

They were not allowed to speak with families or lawyers. They never stepped foot outside.

For months, government attorneys and administration officials claimed that the United States did not have jurisdiction over deportees that were locked up in El Salvador. But court filings revealed that authorities in that country told the United Nations that the “legal responsibility for these people lie exclusively” with the U.S. government.

Despite the administration’s claims that those deportees were no longer the responsibility of the United States, officials appeared to be using them as a bargaining chip in a prisoner exchange.

On July 18, following trilateral negotiations with the U.S., Salvadoran and Venezuelan governments, more than 250 Venezuelans jailed inside the facility were returned to their home country, and several Americans were returned from Venezuela’s custody to the United States.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/19/20/19/GettyImages-2210245912.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-20 12:04:14.485896

This administration’s abuse of immigrants, protesters, and Trump’s perceived enemies appears to be systemic. An August report by Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) office identified 510 “credible reports” of human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities since Trump took office in January. ProPublica found that over 170 US citizens have been held by immigration officials, some of whom were beaten or worse.

Even high-ranking elected officials are victims. Last May, for example, federal law enforcement forcibly arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) after Baraka sought a tour of an immigration detention facility. After those charges fell apart, the Trump administration indicted US Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who attempted to shield Baraka from arrest. In a video cited by McIver’s attorneys, one of the officers claims that Baraka’s arrest was ordered by US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Worse, the Supreme Court — or, at least, its six Republicans — appears to be entirely on board with these tactics. In September, the Republican justices voted to block a lower court order that, among other things, forbade ICE from targeting suspected undocumented immigrants solely because of their race. That case is known as Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo.

The Republican justices rarely explain their decisions when they rule in Trump’s favor, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh did write a concurring opinion explaining why he voted the way he did. His assertion that someone targeted by ICE’s “apparent ethnicity” was “relevant” to law enforcement deciding whom to stop has received the most attention, as Kavanaugh seemed to blow off fears that federal law enforcement is targeting Latinos because of their race. But Kavanaugh also strongly implied that no one victimized by ICE may seek an injunction prohibiting ICE from engaging in illegal tactics in the future. (In the wake of this decision, many commentators are now referring to ICE’s tactics as “Kavanaugh stops.”)

So are there any legal avenues left to challenge abusive tactics by ICE, or by other law enforcement agencies controlled by Trump? The short answer is that a few narrow pathways still exist, but they are unlikely to provide a meaningful check on ICE’s behavior.

Broadly speaking, there are five ways that the law could constrain federal law enforcement:

A federal court might issue an injunction against a law enforcement agency, barring it from continuing to engage in a particular illegal practice. Kavanaugh’s opinion in Vasquez Perdomo, however, suggests that this Supreme Court will not allow such an injunction to stand.

A court might order an individual law enforcement officer to compensate the victim of that officer’s illegal action. The Republican justices, however, have largely cut off this avenue in two decisions handed down in the past five years.

A victim of illegal behavior by a federal law enforcement officer might sue the United States and seek compensation. The Supreme Court’s unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013) suggests that this avenue remains open — although it is unlikely that either Trump or any individual officer will change their behavior because they fear that the US Treasury may have to pay out some money at some future date.

A law enforcement officer, or perhaps a senior law enforcement official, might be criminally prosecuted. Such a prosecution would depend on whether an existing criminal law already prohibits the officer’s activity (or potentially, whether it prohibits an order to an officer given by a senior official). And it is unlikely that any such prosecutions will happen for as long as Trump controls the Justice Department.

Finally, until recently, Trump himself could potentially have been prosecuted if he gave an order that violates federal criminal law. But the Republican justices gave Trump sweeping immunity from prosecution in Trump v. United States (2024).

Let’s look at each of these options in a bit more detail.

“Kavanaugh stops,” and injunctions against law enforcement

It is quite difficult to obtain a court order prohibiting a law enforcement agency from committing an illegal action in the future, and it has been for more than four decades. The seminal case is City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983), which held that Adolph Lyons, a man who was allegedly placed in a chokehold by police officers without provocation, could not obtain a court order forbidding the Los Angeles Police Department from using these chokeholds in the future.

Lyons held that “past exposure to illegal conduct” does not permit someone to seek an injunction prohibiting similar conduct in the future. Instead, the Court concluded that “Lyons’ standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.”

To prevail, in other words, Lyons had to show that he personally was likely to be choked a second time, at some point in the future, by a Los Angeles police officer.

In Vasquez Perdomo, Kavanaugh claimed that the plaintiffs’ argument challenging ICE’s actions in that case “largely tracks the theory rejected in Lyons.” The plaintiffs in Vasquez Perdomo alleged that they were stopped by ICE for impermissible reasons, including because they are Latino. But Kavanaugh claimed that they have “no good basis to believe that law enforcement will unlawfully stop them in the future based on the prohibited factors.”

As a factual matter, Kavanaugh’s claim is dubious. A federal appeals court found that “at least one individual with lawful status was stopped twice by roving patrols in just 10 days.” So the fact that ICE targeted this one individual twice in such a short period suggests that they were likely to be targeted again unless a court intervenes. The Trump administration also repeatedly targeted certain businesses where they believed that undocumented people worked — one car wash was hit four times in nine days, according to Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent. So the workers in that car wash sure seemed to be likely to be targeted again in the future.

Ultimately, however, the real facts underlying a Supreme Court case matter a whole lot less than what a majority of the justices say about the facts of a case. Both the Court’s decision in Vasquez Perdomo, and Kavanaugh’s reliance on Lyons in his defense of that decision, suggest that this Court is unlikely to allow anyone who is illegally targeted by ICE to seek an injunction against that law enforcement agency — even if in reality, these very decisions give the Trump administration permission to target the same people over and over again.

The death of Bivens: Why ICE officers can no longer be sued for breaking the law

More than half a century ago, in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1971), the Supreme Court held that the victim of an unconstitutional action by a federal law enforcement officer could sue that officer and potentially collect money damages directly from them. Bivens explained that an officer who acts unlawfully “in the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.” And so it follows that there should be a meaningful remedy to discourage officers from abusing their power.

But this view of accountability has long been out of favor with a majority of the justices. And, in two recent cases, the Court’s Republican majority have come very close to overruling Bivens outright.

In Hernández v. Mesa (2020), the Republican justices ruled that a US Border Patrol agent who allegedly shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican boy in cold blood could not be sued, even if the boy’s parents could prove that the shooting was unjustified. And, in Egbert v. Boule (2022), the Republican justices immunized Border Patrol agents who allegedly used excessive force against an innkeeper from lawsuits.

Both decisions were exceedingly hostile to Bivens. In Egbert, for example, Justice Clarence Thomas’s majority opinion concluded that courts should reject Bivens suits if there is “any rational reason (even one)” to do so.

Given these decisions, it is safe to say that the current slate of justices will not allow an ICE officer to be sued by their victim, even if the officer clearly violated the law or the Constitution.

Suits against the United States: A weak, but still viable, remedy

The Federal Tort Claims Act frequently permits the United States to be sued if a federal law enforcement officer engages in “assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.” And the Supreme Court took a fairly expansive view of how this law applies to bad actions by law enforcement in its unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013), a case about a prisoner who sued corrections officers who allegedly threatened and sexually assaulted him.

So it is likely that even this Supreme Court would allow some victims of illegal activity by ICE, or similar agencies, to sue the federal government and seek compensation from the United States Treasury.

That said, it is doubtful that this remedy will do much to deter future lawless behavior by ICE. Neither an individual law enforcement officer, nor the senior Trump administration officials giving them orders, are likely to change their behavior because, maybe a year from now, a federal judge might order the US Treasury to pay money to someone who was victimized by ICE.

The whole point of Bivens was to impose consequences personally upon rogue officers, so that they will be deterred from breaking the law. A lawsuit requiring US taxpayers to compensate victims is unlikely to achieve the same goal.

Criminal prosecutions: Maybe in the next administration?

Finally, to the extent that any individual law enforcement officer violates a federal criminal statute, they might be prosecuted for doing so. That’s highly unlikely to happen, however, for as long as Trump rules the Justice Department. Any future prosecutions are likely to turn on who wins the 2028 election.

One person who will suffer no criminal consequences, however, no matter how many laws he breaks, is Donald Trump. The Republican justices’ decision in Trump v. United States (2024) held that Trump is immune from prosecution for his official acts as president. That decision even said that he is immune if he orders law enforcement to target someone “for an improper purpose.”

Moreover, even if some law enforcement officer — or maybe some Trump political appointee — is prosecuted for unlawful actions, there is always some risk that the same Republican justices who invented the concept of presidential immunity from prosecution will also decide to immunize officers who were carrying out Trump’s orders. Trump could also use his pardon power to protect them.

So if you hope that ICE officers, and other federal officials who have abused their powers, will someday be held to account for their actions, the news is not good. The Supreme Court has cut off the most effective ways of ensuring that federal law enforcement officers comply with the law.",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/gettyimages-2240700506.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-10-20 10:01:08.162837

The hearing before Judge Sara L. Ellis of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois is shaping up as the latest in a series of confrontations between judges and officials over whether the government is flouting the courts’ authority.

As protests against the Trump administration’s deportation campaign have mounted in the Chicago area, Judge Ellis has ordered limits on how federal agents could use tear gas to disperse crowds.

Plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the administration say the tactics used by federal agents have violated their constitutional rights. Filings in the case document instances of federal agents using pepper balls, pepper spray and tear gas against protesters, journalists and members of the clergy with little or no warning.

Judge Ellis, who was named to the bench by President Barack Obama, found the plaintiffs’ case to be credible enough to issue a temporary order on Oct. 9, barring the use of tear gas and other munitions against protesters throughout the Chicago area “who are not posing an immediate threat.”

Since that order, though, federal agents have been captured on video using tear gas in Chicago neighborhoods, and Judge Ellis said she was “profoundly concerned” that the limits she had set were being violated.

On Friday, Judge Ellis ordered federal agents who have body cameras to turn them on while conducting immigration arrests and while interacting with protesters and other members of the public in the Chicago area. She imposed that requirement over objections from the government about the practicalities of using the cameras and about the extent of judge’s authority.

Judge Ellis has said she wants to question federal officials in court on Monday about their use of tear gas and about two tense incidents in which agents clashed with residents in Chicago.

One of those clashes occurred on Oct. 12 in the Albany Park neighborhood on the city’s Northwest Side, when agents stopped a resident and a crowd formed in reaction. Tear gas was used.

The other clash happened two days later on the South Side, when agents fired tear gas into a crowd that had gathered after a car crash involving federal agents.

Kyle C. Harvick of Customs and Border Protection is expected to appear before the judge on Monday. According to government filings, Mr. Harvick is deputy incident commander of the Trump administration’s Chicago-area deportation operation, which it calls Operation Midway Blitz. The operation began in early September.

In court last week, Judge Ellis sounded frustrated as she cited news reports suggesting that the limits she imposed on the use of tear gas were being disregarded. “I don’t live in a cave,” she said. “I’m seriously concerned that my orders aren’t being followed.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/20/multimedia/20NAT-CHICAGO-HEARING-hfpl/20NAT-CHICAGO-HEARING-hfpl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:27:12.531694

The Guardian has identified eight instances in which military veterans have been prosecuted or sought damages after being detained by federal agents.
One, 70-year-old air force veteran Dana Briggs, was charged with assault after a video of an incident showed Ice agents advancing on the elderly veteran and knocking him over.
The other, Afghanistan war veteran John Cerrone, was tackled by a group of Ice agents, another video shows.
Representative Maxine Dexter, a Democrat who represents Portland, said military veterans “are literally putting their lives on the line to protest”.","Some of the most decorated military veterans in Congress say they are outraged after a report in the Guardian revealed US military veterans have been arrested or injured amid protests over Donald Trump’s deportation campaign and his push to deploy the national guard to American cities.

“I went to war three times for this country to defend the right of Americans to say things I may not like,” said Representative Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado and former army ranger who was awarded the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq as a platoon leader with the 82nd airborne division. “Now is the time for every American to speak out.”

Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois who received a Purple Heart after her helicopter was shot down over Iraq, said: “No one – especially those who have already sacrificed so much for this country – should ever be assaulted, detained or thrown in solitary confinement for peacefully protesting government overreach”.

The Guardian has identified eight instances in which military veterans have been prosecuted or sought damages after being detained by federal agents. Two of those individuals were arrested in late September protesting outside a Chicago-area Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility.

One, 70-year-old air force veteran Dana Briggs, was charged with assault after a video of an incident showed Ice agents advancing on the elderly veteran and knocking him over. The other, Afghanistan war veteran John Cerrone, was tackled by a group of Ice agents, another video shows. Cerrone was detained, held for nine hours in solitary confinement and charged with disorderly conduct.

The justice department says Briggs committed assault when he “made physical contact with an agent’s arm while the agent attempted to extend the safety perimeter”. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said Cerrone had picked up a teargas canister fired by an Ice agent and thrown it back earlier in the day.

Duckworth countered that “the Trump administration’s meritless claims justifying the need for such excessive force simply aren’t supported by evidence, and even federal judges are recognizing they are not credible or ‘tethered to facts’”.

Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate judiciary committee, said: “Any improper use of force by federal law enforcement against Americans, including service members and veterans, undermines our democracy and is a betrayal to our military families who sign up to risk life and limb to protect our nation.”

Republican lawmakers contacted by the Guardian declined to comment or did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries.

In Portland, video shows an agent grabbing Afghanistan war veteran Daryn Herzberg by the hair and slamming his face into the ground multiple times while saying, “You’re not talking shit any more are you?” according to a Federal Tort Claims Act complaint filed by his attorney.

Herzberg, who has not been charged with a crime, was hospitalized and is seeking $150,000 in damages.

A DHS spokesperson said Herzberg, a former marine sergeant who was honorably discharged in 2012, “is well known for acts of violence outside the Ice facility” and had “used fake blood to falsify injuries”. His attorney denied the allegations.

Representative Maxine Dexter, a Democrat who represents Portland, said military veterans “are literally putting their lives on the line to protest”.

“We are seeing unjustifiable and excessive force at the Portland Ice facility,” said Dexter, a physician who practiced for eight years at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. She noted that on 4 October, an 84-year-old demonstrator sustained a concussion when she was rushed and knocked to the ground by federal agents during what the Oregonian newspaper described as a “peaceful protest.”

The woman’s husband, also 84 and a Vietnam war veteran, was also pushed to the ground, the Oregonian reported. According to the newspaper, he was leaning on his walker and wearing his Vietnam veterans cap when federal officers pushed him.

“Free speech and peaceful protest are fundamental rights in America,” said Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. “Few understand this better than the brave men and women who have given so much to defend these rights and freedoms for all of us. Trump’s goal is to incite violence to further his authoritarian grip and quash our fundamental rights. We must all continue to speak out against his un-American power grab and stand up for one another.”

Dexter said she hoped the Trump administration would “lower the temperature” so that the issues that currently divide Americans can be debated without violence.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9329e4ba506ce92b646ca60615f84e366543bf/960_0_5602_4480/master/5602.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6dc1ef8dde8c577e01fbd6f73563eca",N,,2025-10-20 08:01:20.020407

Court documents show that upon release from the hospital, Rodriguez was placed in medical isolation at the ICE detention center.","Cary López Alvarado, of Hawthorne, California, was nine months pregnant when she was arrested by immigration officials alongside her husband, an immigrant from Guatemala. Alvarado was held overnight but was never sent to a detention facility: After taking her into custody, ICE learned she was a U.S. citizen.

Immediately after her release, she began to experience sharp pains in her stomach, according to a claim she filed against the federal government. She gave birth a few days later.

Angie Rodriguez, an immigrant from Colombia, was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody following a routine check-in with immigration officials in July, and soon after found out she was pregnant. At the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center where she was held, Rodriguez could hardly bring herself to eat the small meals that the detention facility served because of how they looked and smelled, and her only other option was buying processed food like instant noodles and chips.

Rodriguez went on to miscarry while in custody, according to a lawsuit she filed against the federal government.

Antonia Aguilar Maldonano, a mother of two from El Salvador, was arrested by ICE on her way to work and detained at the Kandiyohi County Jail in Minnesota for almost a month. Her youngest child is 22 months old and still nursing; he has acid reflux and an allergy to other forms of milk. The jail was not equipped to house someone who was nursing, said Gloria Contreras Edin, her lawyer: It did not have a breast pump when Aguilar Maldonado arrived, forcing her to use her hands to massage milk out until the facility was able to buy a pump.

Lawyers successfully argued for her release on bond — $10,000, paid for by members of her church — while the government makes the case that she be deported.

A Biden-era policy restricts ICE from arresting or detaining immigrants who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing, except in extreme circumstances. While President Donald Trump has not formally rescinded the policy, it’s clear from lawsuits, news reports and advocates for immigrants who are detained that it’s not being followed.

Quantifying the exact number of pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants in custody has become impossible: This March, Congress let lapse a requirement that the administration report twice a year on how many of these immigrants are being held in immigration facilities. Since the fall of 2019,, Congress had required the Department of Homeland Security to publicly report the count every six months and include “detailed justification” for every single detained immigrant who was pregnant, postpartum or nursing.

ICE did not respond to The 19th’s request for this data.

While the agency said in a statement in August that pregnant immigrants are receiving sufficient care in custody, medical professionals say the conditions in these facilities can heighten the risk for complications. Limited food can impact nutrition at a vulnerable time; access to medical appointments is spotty and often not aligned with standards of care; and pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees also face the stress of arrest and separation from their families.

The impact of arrests and detention

In 2021, following public outcry against the first Trump administration’s immigration policies, the Biden administration directed ICE not to detain pregnant, postpartum or nursing people except in “exceptional circumstances” — they are a national security threat or pose immediate harm to themselves or other people. Those who are detained are supposed to be held in facilities suited to appropriate health care. ICE-employed medical professionals are supposed to provide weekly updates on those detainees to relevant agency directors. The ICE Health Service Corps is also supposed to keep consistent records of all pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees, providing monthly updates to the organization’s leadership.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has not formally rescinded that policy, but administration officials argued in court that he had done so implicitly through a sweeping anti-immigration executive order that supercharged immigration enforcement. A federal judge refuted that argument, but on its website, ICE says the policy is “not reflective of current practice.”

“We’re seeing more pregnant women detained again after not seeing much of that, at least not in ICE detention,” said Amanda Heffernan, a longtime nurse-midwife and professor of midwifery at Seattle University.

Rebecca Cassler, an attorney at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said her organization’s pro bono program has seen an increase in cases of detained pregnant, postpartum and nursing people. She says no one outside ICE really knows how many, but it’s enough to make her “very concerned.”

Though the federal government has not made public how many pregnant people have been detained, Democratic lawmakers have published multiple investigations documenting known cases.

One report, published this summer by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, identified 14 credible cases of pregnant women being mistreated in detention facilities. The report included a description of pregnant women sleeping on cell floors, one detainee being told to “just drink water” when needing medical support, and another miscarrying alone after days of bleeding.

ICE has disputed the report. ”Pregnant women receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care. Detention of pregnant women is rare and has elevated oversight and review. No pregnant woman has been forced to sleep on the floor,” ICE said in a statement on its website.

A September 18 letter signed by 29 Democratic senators and addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem directed federal officials to clarify just how many pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding people are being detained, how many have been deported and what health care is being made available to them. DHS has not acknowledged receipt, said a spokesperson for Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who organized the letter.

“We do not know how many pregnant women are in ICE custody, whether U.S. citizen babies have been born in ICE custody, and what provisions have been made for mothers’ and children’s health, safety, and wellbeing,” the senators wrote.

The Women’s Refugee Commission, an advocacy group, is seeking records from Homeland Security pertaining to pregnant, postpartum or nursing individuals who have been detained. It recently launched its own independent tracker, encouraging health providers, lawyers and family members to submit information about pregnant people who have been detained. The commission said it’s too early to provide an accurate count from its tracker.

Zain Lakhani, a lawyer and director of migrant rights and justice for the commission, said credible reports of pregnant people being detained suggest a frequency higher than ICE’s policy would suggest.

“It would be shocking that we would be able to have this level of detained pregnant people under the guidance,” she said. “We are seeing just this shocking number of detained postpartum and pregnant women.”

Workers helping integrate deported immigrants in Honduras told researchers from the Women’s Refugee Commission that nursing women who were deported had not received enough food and water to continue lactating.

“They arrive with hardly any milk — or milk that looks like water — and this affects the babies’ weight,” one worker said, according to a report published by the organization.

The impact of arrests and detention

By the time Aguilar Maldonado left the jail, her breast milk had started to dry up, Contreras Edin said. She is particularly worried about the impact of detention on her children, who were not with her and now follow her wherever she goes, including to the bathroom. Her boyfriend has been deported; she is asking a judge to let her leave voluntarily — a process that has fewer legal penalties than being deported — so she and her children can follow him.

“Her children were traumatized and her youngest was especially traumatized,” Contreras Edin said. “That bond was broken during detention and that left a permanent impression on her children.”

There is no way to ethically research how detention specifically may affect pregnancy outcomes, including whether it could increase the possibility of miscarriage, said Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins University who studies the reproductive health of incarcerated women. But evidence does show that physical and psychological strain — the kind people can suffer while detained — threatens the health of a pregnancy and can mean greater risk of preterm birth.

“I’m very concerned because of the conditions we’ve already heard about that could be increasing the risks of adverse outcomes,” Sufrin said. “I’m very concerned about the outcomes for these moms as well as for the outcomes for their babies.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on the conditions or available accommodations for pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants.

Alvarado, who is seeking $1 million following her arrest, citing “the unconstitutional conduct, unlawful arrest, and the tortious conduct of Border Patrol and ICE agents,” said her daughter is healthy and growing. But she’s still dealing with the aftermath of her detention.

Footage of the arrest shows federal agents holding her hands behind her — despite guidance advising that officers generally not use physical restraints on pregnant people and that, if they do, they should keep a pregnant person’s hands in front.

Her husband has now been deported, and Alvarado has no income. She’s watching her savings dwindle and relying on her family to help care for her little girl. She said she was unsure if she’d have to pick up multiple jobs to make ends meet — and if so, who would be able to care for her infant. She remembers the terror she felt while in government custody.

“Every time I see a news or video, it does rewind in my head,” she said. “It does get me very emotional, seeing stuff like that.”

Victoria Petty, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area who is representing Rodriguez — the woman who suffered a miscarriage in detention — said that she first connected with her client’s husband in late August, about a month after his wife’s detention.

He had left Petty a voicemail and text explaining that his wife was pregnant in a detention center and that he was really worried about her. Days later, he called again. “He’s crying on the other line, and he’s like, ‘She had a miscarriage. I don’t know what to do. She’s in the hospital. Help,’” Petty recalled.

Rodriguez described in court records being “unignorably hungry” inside the Bakersfield, California, detention facility and lacking prenatal health care and education for weeks after her pregnancy was confirmed. Eventually, she began to see brown discharge and was taken to an off-site hospital where, days later, health care providers confirmed she had miscarried.

Petty moved quickly to file a lawsuit claiming unconstitutional detention. Court documents show that upon release from the hospital, Rodriguez was placed in medical isolation at the ICE detention center.

“It was very scary. She was in pain. So after this really traumatic experience, and her going to the hospital and confirming that they did not see the fetus on the ultrasound — after all of that, they brought her back to the detention center and put her in medical isolation,” Petty said, adding that her client was distraught.

Petty said it’s hard to determine whether detention conditions caused or contributed to Rodriguez’ miscarriage, a very wanted first pregnancy. But, she said, it’s important to consider the stress of being suddenly detained in a van — her client is from Colombia; kidnappings and murders have left lasting scars on the Latin American nation — along with the strain and lack of food options in detention.

“These are the conditions that she was in when she was pregnant. And we cannot rule out that having been under that level of stress and fear and having that little care contributed to her pregnancy loss,” Petty said.

Heffernan, who has worked with several immigrants who were detained while pregnant, said she has seen pregnant immigrants get a few small accommodations: being placed in a lower bunk instead of the top bunk for sleep or getting extra milk with their meals and sometimes an extra sandwich or snack before bedtime.

Medical care, she said, can be “very haphazard and spotty,” with prenatal appointments often not happening on schedule.

“You do see people getting a prenatal visit here and there, but not in a timely fashion, and not according to the standard of care for people that are outside,” Heffernan said. “For instance, in a couple of people that I’ve been in contact with recently, one had been in detention for several months and had had no prenatal care at all. Another had had one visit.”

Pregnant immigrants are also more vulnerable to more severe cases of COVID-19, flu and other illnesses, which spread quickly in crowded places like detention centers.

There is an extensive list of best practices for detained pregnant and postpartum people, Sufrin said, including but not limited to regular access to comprehensive physical and mental health care, nutrition, the ability to exercise and adequate housing.

But from a medical standpoint, she said, “The best practices would be not to detain them.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ICE_detention_pregnancy_top.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:33:30.804264

“This is not like when you boycott any other major corporation, when you boycott Swap-O-Rama, you’re boycotting a lot of Latino families that depend on this income,” she said.","CHICAGO (WGN) — Vendors at the Swap-O-Rama Flea Market on Ashland Avenue in the Back of the Yards neighborhood say they are struggling, and they’re asking both the public and management for help.

They’re not only calling for better protection but also urging community members to continue showing up to support them.

On top of already low sales, which many vendors attribute to the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Chicago, they are now facing a growing boycott from people who believe Swap-O-Rama could have done more to stop federal agents from entering the property.

But vendors warn that the boycott will only hurt working families.

“Don’t punish the vendors for something that’s not their fault. Instead, call for action from the management of Swap-O-Rama,” vendor Maritza Jaimes said.

Jaimes’ parents have been selling boots at the market for decades. She says they, along with many others, are now feeling the impact of fear as low attendance, empty aisles and closed stands are becoming more common.

“Because we have seen how federal agents take no regard for what your immigration status is,” Jaimes said. “You’re just getting racially profiled based on the way you look, so I think people are scared, regardless of their immigration status, to come and open their stand or even to shop here.”

According to Alderwoman Julia Ramirez, it was around 10 a.m. Thursday when more than 20 federal agents arrived at Swap-O-Rama and detained at least 15 people.

In a statement she said, “Yesterday, Saturday, there were very few vendors and customers. It was chilling to see the vacancy. These forms of escalation are instilling fear throughout our city and it’s time for businesses and elected officials alike to work together to create safe spaces on private property.”

One vendor, who asked not to be identified out of fear of losing his stand, shared how serious the situation has become for those who rely on the market as their livelihood.

“It’s a difficult situation for us because we depend on this, on the sales. Some people don’t have a job; this is their life. I understand the community is mad, so are we,” he said.

In the days since the incident, a boycott movement targeting Swap-O-Rama has spread online. Jaimes hopes people think twice.

“This is not like when you boycott any other major corporation, when you boycott Swap-O-Rama, you’re boycotting a lot of Latino families that depend on this income,” she said. “At the end of the day, the vendors still have to pay the rent to management.”

In a statement, Swap-O-Rama responded:

For generations, Swap-O-Rama has been where families build their future and culture thrives. What happened on Oct. 16 caused real pain to individuals and families, to vendors, to customers and to all of us who believe in what this place represents.

Despite the statement, vendors say they haven’t seen any concrete changes.

“Some of those actions that we want to see from Swap-O-Rama is declaring that this is a private space because we know the law is on our side. It is a private space, that’s not even disputable,” Jaimes said.

Jaimes says her parents’ stand has not only supported their family but also helped send her and her siblings to college. Now, vendors are simply asking for protection so they can continue working and providing for their families.",https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/snapshot-2025-10-19T173811.915.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-20 08:01:42.895099

The large ICE facility that has drawn protests in Illinois, for example, isn’t in Chicago, but rather the suburban village of Broadview.
So the Portland City Council, eager to fill vacant real estate spaces, unanimously backed a compromise.
Portland leaders are trying to take advantage of how unique the situation is.
“Tacoma is an actual detention center,” said Angelita Morillo, a Portland City councilor, “so they can actually disappear people there.”","With President Trump and Portland, Ore., locked in a fierce battle over immigration policies, the city’s leaders face increasing pressure from their progressive constituents to become more creative in the fight.

So Portland leaders are trying the strategy they know best: land use.

Oregon has one of the most complex sets of zoning and land use laws in the nation. Supporters of the policies say they encourage neighborhoods to be walkable and filled with independent businesses while also preserving vast open spaces and farmland. Critics say the rules have stymied housing construction and kept home prices high.

But in the city’s fight against the Trump administration, those land-use rules may prove to be a not-so-secret weapon, in large part because the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland may be uniquely vulnerable to the codes.

“This is so Oregon of us, so Portland of us,” said Elana Pirtle-Guiney, president of the Portland City Council, “to distill a huge federal policy issue that is also a moral issue that is also about the fundamental question of who we are as a country into a land-use problem.”

The General Services Administration, which manages real estate for the federal government, typically leases space for ICE from other government agencies or private prisons in industrial areas that are away from residential centers or popular commuter routes. The large ICE facility that has drawn protests in Illinois, for example, isn’t in Chicago, but rather the suburban village of Broadview.

Yet when federal officials looked to move Oregon’s ICE “subfield office” from a historic post office near downtown Portland 14 years ago, they chose to lease privately owned property just three miles away in the South Waterfront, a showcase for the state’s history of innovative urban design.

That has kept ICE under the intense scrutiny of both protesters and city planners. In mid-September, city leaders issued the owner of the ICE facility, the developer Stuart Lindquist, a land-use violation notice, telling him ICE had breached the terms of their original agreement for the property.

ICE became contentious in the area long before Mr. Trump began his mass deportation campaign. In 2011, when the agency began negotiating to rent and expand a former Bank of America office building on the edge of the waterfront district, residents and business owners worried about what a federal building might look like, the presence of armed officers and “the possibility of demonstrations and/or protest activities,” according to notes from a hearing officer who ruled on the proposal. a .

But neighbors’ biggest concern was that ICE might release dangerous criminals in the neighborhood late at night after buses stopped running. So the Portland City Council, eager to fill vacant real estate spaces, unanimously backed a compromise. ICE was allowed to add 101 parking spots and a 5,198-square foot detention center on one condition: People could not be detained for more than 12 hours or overnight.

That covenant has become ICE’s biggest potential vulnerability. According to the land-use notice issued to ICE’s landlord last month, observers outside the facility who track who enters and leaves noted 25 instances over a 10-month period in which ICE detained people for too long.

“What I appreciate about this approach is that it isn’t a political conversation,” said Natalie Lerner, a board member with the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition. “This is about data.”

Representatives of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.

The property owner, who has filed paperwork contesting some of the city’s evidence, faces monthly fines that start at about $1,000 if he does not fix the problem. The federal government rents the building for more than $2.4 million annually.

The more serious conversation will come later this month, when city regulators are scheduled to begin reconsidering ICE’s conditional-use permit for the building. Eventually, the matter could end up in front of the full City Council, whose members have been outspoken in their opposition to the president’s plan to send the National Guard to Portland. For now, they said they must choose their words carefully about the ICE building’s future because they may have to rule on it.

Protesters are not so reticent. On Oct. 12,Holly Brown, an organizer, put the demands on city hall succinctly at an anti-ICE rally. “You can’t just sit there doing nothing. You must act to get ICE out of Portland.” She then led the crowd of 100 or so people in a chant of “revoke the permit.”

Leaders in other cities facing ICE protests and potential federal military force are also looking for ways to use the tools of local government to assert their authority. In Broadview, Ill., town leaders successfully convinced a court to force ICE to remove a fence around the immigration processing facility because it was erected without a permit.

But the Broadview facility and most of the buildings in which immigration officers detain people are owned by either the federal government, a private prison company or another government entity, according to records from the General Services Administration, and are thus harder to regulate through permitting and taxes.

Portland leaders are trying to take advantage of how unique the situation is. When the Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, visited the city earlier this month, she demanded that officers with the Portland Police Bureau close off a one-block radius around the building and limit how close protesters can go. Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson, said that was both against city values and simply not feasible in a quasi-residential neighborhood with few routes in or out.

Mr. Wilson said Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to Ms. Noem, suggested during their meeting that the city might consider buying the property or taking over ICE’s lease. The mayor rejected that idea.

“I would love for this facility to be somewhere else, because South Waterfront is about the worst place you could put it,” Mr. Wilson said. “But this is something the federal government has to figure out. We just want them to comply with our laws.”

It is not clear if Portland leaders actually have the power to fully revoke the permit or simply make detaining people much harder, if not impossible. Some immigration advocates wonder whether that’s even a good idea. If ICE cannot hold detainees in Portland, the next option is to send them two and a half hours away to the Northwest Immigration Detention Center in Tacoma, a 1,575-bed campus that can be hard for lawyers to access and even harder for detainees to leave.

“Tacoma is an actual detention center,” said Angelita Morillo, a Portland City councilor, “so they can actually disappear people there.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/20/multimedia/20nat-portland-ice1-cglh/20nat-portland-ice1-cglh-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:29:37.308728

The state of the Justice Department Reuveni is not alone in identifying a troubling pattern of behavior at the Department of Justice.
""The one entity, or person, or institution that gets hurt the most is the Justice Department,"" Goodman said.
He said he'd never advised a Justice Department attorney to violate a court order.","Erez Reuveni, a fired Department of Justice lawyer who's now blowing the whistle, says he witnessed a disregard of due process and for the rule of law at the DOJ.

Reuveni previously won commendations for his work and was so effective defending President Trump's first-term immigration policy that he was promoted quickly in Mr. Trump's second term. But he says he was put on leave and then fired after refusing to sign a brief in the mistaken deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Reuveni's whistleblower disclosure helped highlight a growing concern in many courts across the country that the Justice Department is allegedly abusing the limits of the law.

""I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. And my view of that oath is that I need to speak up and draw attention to what has happened to the department, what is happening to the rule of law,"" Reuveni said. ""I would not be faithfully abiding by my oath if I stayed silent right now.""

From devoted DOJ lawyer to shock over orders

Reuveni says he knew he wanted to be involved in public service before he started law school. He started at the Department of Justice in 2010 and was there for 15 years defending the policies of several presidents, regardless of political party. Reuveni specialized in immigration law and, during Mr. Trump's first term, he defended the controversial ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries, among many other cases.

""I defended everything they put on my plate. That was my job,"" he said.

Shortly after Mr. Trump's return to office, Reuveni was selected to be the acting deputy director of the Department of Justice's immigration section, overseeing about a hundred attorneys and every case that arose in the federal district courts.

On March 14, the same day he found out about his promotion, Reuveni and others were called to a meeting with Emil Bove, number three at the Justice Department. Bove was also once Mr. Trump's criminal defense attorney.

According to Reuveni, they were told the president would be invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a law not invoked since World War II, to allow rapid expulsion of citizens of enemy nations during a time of war. Without a declared war, the administration used it for a mass deportation of more than 100 Venezuelans the government said were terrorists.

The Venezuelans were to be denied the right to be heard by a judge and Reuveni said Bove expected a challenge.

""Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what,"" Reuveni said. ""Then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, 'f*** you.'""

Reuveni says he was shocked.

""I felt like a bomb had gone off,"" he said. ""Here is the number three official using expletives to tell career attorneys that we might just have to consider disregarding federal court orders.""

""A real gut punch""

The next day, a Saturday, lawyers for some of the prisoners sued. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia called a hearing and asked government lawyer Drew Ensign whether the planes were leaving that weekend.

Ensign told Boasberg he didn't know whether the planes were leaving that weekend, even though Reuveni says he was at the same meeting where they were told the planes would be taking off over the weekend, no matter what. Reuveni said that moment in court was ""stunning.""

""It is the highest, most egregious violation of a lawyer's code of ethics to mislead a court with intent,"" he said.

Ensign's intent is unknown. It was during the hearing that planes took off.

The judge issued an order and, immediately, Reuveni emailed the agencies involved, writing ""...the judge specifically ordered us to not remove anyone … and to return anyone in the air.""

But that didn't happen. Instead, more than five hours after that order, the deported prisoners arrived at a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

""And then it really hit me. It's like, we really did tell the court, screw you. We really did just tell the courts, we don't care about your order. You can't tell us what to do,"" Reuveni said. ""That was just a real gut punch.""

While the Department of Justice can disagree with and appeal orders, it is required to obey all court orders when they're in effect, according to Peter Keisler, who ran the department as acting attorney general for a time in 2007 for then-President George W. Bush.

Keisler said that detainees must be given the chance to contest the charges, even if those being deported are terrorists or gang members. He emphasized that there are lawful means to get terrorists out of the country.

""We have a saying in this country. It's deeply embedded in who we are. Everybody deserves their day in court,"" Keiseler said. ""And all of us want to know that if the government acts against us, we will at least have the opportunity to go to a neutral decision-maker, present evidence and legal argument, and make sure that the government stays within its legal bounds.""

What happened in the Abrego Garcia case

When more facts were known about the weekend flights, it turned out a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had been deported by mistake.

While people deported in error are normally returned, Reuveni said that in a phone call from a superior, he was ordered to argue that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member and a terrorist to prevent his return.

""I respond up the chain of command, no way. That is not correct. That is not factually correct. It is not legally correct. That is, that is a lie. And I cannot sign my name to that brief,"" Reuveni said.

Reuveni said what was important was not whether or not Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13 or a terrorist, but whether or not he received due process.

""What's to stop them if they decide they don't like you anymore, to say you're a criminal, you're a member of MS-13, you're a terrorist,"" Reuveni said. ""What's to stop them from sending in some DOJ attorney at the direction of DOJ leadership to delay, to filibuster, and if necessary, to lie? And now that's you gone and your liberties changed.""

Reuveni was fired after refusing to sign a brief that called Abrego Garcia a terrorist. In June, he filed a whistleblower complaint with the help of attorneys from the Government Accountability Project.

The state of the Justice Department

Reuveni is not alone in identifying a troubling pattern of behavior at the Department of Justice. Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor who heads a nonpartisan law journal, ""Just Security,"" said his team has analyzed hundreds of suits filed against the Trump administration. He published his team's study online.

""We found over 35 cases in which the judges have specifically said, what the government is providing me is false information. It might be intentionally false information, including false sworn declarations time and again,"" Goodman said.

In court records compiled by Goodman, Democratic and Republican appointed judges are critical of the Trump Justice Department's work. One judge described it as ""...highly misleading..."" Another judge warned that ""trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks.""

""The one entity, or person, or institution that gets hurt the most is the Justice Department,"" Goodman said.

60 Minutes requested interviews with Attorney General Pam Bondi, her former deputy Emil Bove, and Drew Ensign, the attorney who said he didn't know when the planes were taking off, according to the court transcript. All declined 60 Minutes' requests.

Bove, who was nominated for a judgeship, was asked in June about Reuveni's claims during a confirmation hearing. He said he'd never advised a Justice Department attorney to violate a court order. Bove said, in part, that Reuveni was in no position to tell his superiors what to do.

""There's a suggestion that a line attorney, not even the head of the Office of Immigration Litigation, was in a position or considered himself to be, to bind the department's leadership and other cabinet officials,"" Bove said.

Bove was confirmed for the judgeship. And in a statement to 60 Minutes he wrote, ""...Mr. Reuveni's claims are a mix of falsehoods and wild distortions of reality …""

Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. He's now charged with transporting illegal immigrants. He pleaded not guilty. A judge criticized the Justice Department's ""poor attempts"" to connect Abrego Garcia to MS-13. He was not charged with terrorism.

The Venezuelans that were sent to El Salvador were later released to their home country. This spring, the Supreme Court agreed, unanimously, that everyone deported under the Alien Enemies Act is entitled to due process.",https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/19/609a815a-cb62-4929-a4b8-fb0539c8d733/thumbnail/1200x630/f07705f040e4218e23bf28129c5f2469/reuveni-article.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:33:35.068115

While wary of compromising this independence, he said the ABS was prepared to step in when statements being made in the public arena using agency data was “flat-out contradicted by the statistical evidence”.

The ABS took the relatively unusual step on 22 August of issuing a press statement publicly contradicting rightwing claims which misused overseas arrivals figures in order to make “inaccurate conclusions” to support inflated claims of mass migration. The figures count people coming in and out of the country, but not necessarily staying.

The Institute of Public Affairs, a rightwing thinktank, in turn accused the Albanese government of “weaponising” the ABS in order to “censor” its views.

Gruen rejected those claims, saying the decision to release a clarifying media statement was made by ABS experts within the division responsible for issuing the data.

The Supreme Court of India recently ruled that Criminal Courts cannot review or recall their judgments except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors, while setting aside a Delhi High Court order that had reopened perjury proceedings in a corporate dispute.

A Bench of Chief Justice B. R. Gavai and Justice Augustine George Masih set aside the High Court order that had recalled its earlier decision dismissing a petition for initiating perjury proceedings in a long-running dispute.

“The Criminal Courts, as envisaged under the Cr. P. C, are barred from altering or reviewing their own judgments except for the exceptions which are explicitly provided by the statute, namely, correction of a clerical or an arithmetical error that might have been committed or the said power is provided under any other law for the time being in force. As the courts become functus officio the very moment a judgment or an order is signed, the bar of Section 362 Cr. P. C becomes applicable, this, despite the powers provided under Section 482 Cr. P. C which, this veil cannot allow the courts to step beyond or circumvent an explicit bar,” the Supreme Court observed.

Background Facts

The Bakshi and Khosla Groups entered into a December 2005 agreement to develop a resort at Kasauli through Montreaux Resorts Private Limited. A March 2006 agreement gave Vikram Bakshi a 51% stake and placed Vinod Surha and Wadia Prakash on the board.

Dispute Over Shareholding

Sonia Khosla claimed her shareholding was reduced from 49% to 36%.

She filed a company petition before the Company Law Board in 2007 alleging oppression and mismanagement.

She alleged that AGM minutes filed by the Bakshi Group were forged and sought prosecution for perjury under Section 340 Cr. P. C, first before the Company Law Board and later the High Court.

Supreme Court’s 2014 Direction

In 2014, the Supreme Court directed that both the company petition and the perjury application be decided by the Company Law Board (now National Company Law Tribunal) and restrained the High Court from proceeding further.

High Court Proceedings and Recall

In 2019, R. P. Khosla filed another application in the High Court alleging that the Bakshi Group had filed a false counter-affidavit in related contempt proceedings.

The High Court dismissed it in August 2020, citing the 2014 Supreme Court order.

The Khosla Group then sought recall, arguing that the Company Petition had been withdrawn in February 2020 but the fact was not placed before the court earlier.

The High Court accepted this and recalled its judgment on May 5, 2021, prompting the present appeal.

Arguments Presented

The Khosla Group defended the High Court’s order, arguing that it had exercised procedural review to correct a factual mistake and had not conducted a substantive review of the case.

Legal Provisions and Judicial Interpretation

The law relating to the power of a Criminal Court to review or alter its own judgment or order is governed by Section 362 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P. C), which is equivalent to Section 403 of the Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.

Text of Section 362 Cr. P. C

“362. Court not to alter Judgment.–– Save as otherwise provided by this Code or by any other Law, for the time being in force, no Court, when it has signed its Judgment or final Order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error.”

Comparison with the Code of Civil Procedure

The analogous provision of this Section 362 is found in Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. However, this section permits corrections of only clerical or arithmetical mistakes or errors arising from accidental slips or omissions. The scope is very much restricted and cannot go beyond the correction of accidental slips or omissions.

Judicial Interpretation by the Supreme Court

The comparison of the power of review of a Civil Court vis-à-vis the power of a Criminal Court to review or recall its own judgment or order arising out of criminal proceedings has been clarified by numerous decisions of the Supreme Court of India. These judgments have consistently held that Criminal Courts become functus officio upon pronouncement of the judgment and are barred from review except to correct clerical or arithmetical mistakes.

Conclusion

Thus, the law on the issue can be summarized as follows:

The Criminal Justice Delivery System does not empower the court to add or delete any words after pronouncement of the judgment.

Only clerical or arithmetical errors can be corrected under Section 362 Cr. P. C.

A clerical or arithmetical error is an error occasioned by an accidental slip, apparent on the face of the record, and not dependent on argument or disputation.

An arithmetical error is a mistake in calculation, and a clerical error is a mistake in writing or typing.

Legal Position

Case: Sankatha Singh Vs. State of U.P. (1962 AIR 1208)

In “Sankatha Singh Vs. State of U.P.” (1962 AIR 1208), when a Criminal Appeal came for hearing before the Trial Court, the Trial Court dismissed the appeal, noticing that the appellants had been absent and their counsel had not appeared to argue the appeal. The Court also observed that it had perused the Judgment of the Magistrate and seen the record, finding no ground for interference.

An application was filed before the Appellate Court for restoration of the Appeal which was allowed by the Learned Sessions Judge. However, when the Appeal was again listed for hearing, the Learned Judge took the view that the Appellate Court had no power to review or restore an Appeal which had been disposed of. The Appeal was dismissed. The Criminal Revision was filed in the High Court, which too was dismissed.

The Supreme Court in the above case considered Section 369 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (now Section 362 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973). The Hon’ble Supreme Court held that Section 369 of the Code prohibited the Courts from reviewing or altering its Judgment.

“It has been urged for the appellants that Shri Tej Pal Singh could order the rehearing of the appeal in the exercise of the inherent powers… Inherent powers cannot be exercised to do what the Code specifically prohibits the court from doing… when Section 369 of the Code definitely prohibited the court’s reviewing or altering its judgment, he had no jurisdiction to consider the point raised and to set aside the order dismissing the appeal and order its rehearing.”

Case: Smt. Sooraj Devi Vs. Pyare Lal & Anr. (AIR 1981 SC 736)

In “Smt. Sooraj Devi Vs. Pyare Lal & Anr.” (AIR 1981 SC 736), Section 362 Cr. P. C. came under consideration. The Hon’ble Supreme Court laid down:

“The appellant points out that he invoked the inherent power of the High Court saved by Section 482… It is true that the prohibition in Section 362 against the court altering or reviewing its Judgment is subject to what is ‘otherwise provided by this Court or by any other law for the time being in force’… The inherent power of the Court is not contemplated by the saving provision contained in Section 362 and, therefore, the attempt to invoke that power can be of no avail.”

Law Settled on Criminal Court’s Power to Recall or Review Judgment

A Criminal Court has no power to recall or review its own Judgment.

The only permissible action is to correct or rectify clerical errors under Section 403 BNSS (Section 362 CrPC).

Case: Simrikhia Vs. Dolley Mukherjee & Chhabi Mukherjee & Anr. (1990) 2 SCC 4379

In this case, the Court referred to earlier judgments and reiterated that the inherent power of the High Court cannot override the bar of review under Section 362 CrPC.

“The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be invoked to override bar of review u/s 362… The Court is not empowered to review its own decision under the purported exercise of inherent power.”

Case: State of Kerala Vs. M. M. Manikantan Nair (2001) 4 SCC 752

A Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court held that Cr. P. C. does not authorize the High Court to review its Judgment or Order passed in appellate, revisional, or original jurisdiction. Section 362 Cr. P. C. explicitly prohibits such review except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors.

Case: Hari Singh Mann Vs. Harbhajan Singh Bajwa & Ors. (2001) 1 SCC 169

The Supreme Court reiterated that once a matter is finally disposed of, the court becomes functus officio and cannot entertain fresh prayer for the same relief.

Case: State Vs. K.V. Rajendran & Ors. (2008) 8 SCC 673

The Supreme Court again discussed Sections 362 and 482 CrPC, observing:

“No court which has signed its judgment and final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the same except to correct clerical or arithmetical error save as otherwise provided by the court.”

Case: Sanjeev Kapoor Vs. Chandana Kapoor & Ors. (2020) 13 SCC 172

It was reiterated that Section 362 Cr. P. C. imposes an embargo on a Criminal Court to alter or review its own Judgment. Review or alteration is permissible only if:

Explicitly provided by the Cr. P. C. itself, or

By any other law in force.

Case: Grindlays Bank Ltd. Vs. Central Government Industrial Tribunal & Ors. (1980 Supp SCC 420)

The Supreme Court differentiated between:

Type of Review Description Procedural Review Inherent or implied in a court to set aside a palpably erroneous order passed under misapprehension. Substantive Review Correction of an error of law apparent on the face of the record; not permitted unless provided by statute.

Case: Budhia Swain & Ors. Vs. Gopinath Deb & Ors. (1999) 4 SCC 396

The Supreme Court clarified grounds on which a Criminal Court may recall or review its Judgment:

Proceedings suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction.

Fraud has been played upon the Court to obtain the order.

Mistake of the Court causing prejudice to a party.

Non-service to a necessary party or death of a party whose estate was not represented.

These exceptions apply only if such grounds were not available during the original action.

Case: Ganesh Patel Vs. Umakant Rajoria (2022 SCC OnLine SC 2050)

The Hon’ble Supreme Court held that an application for recall seeking a procedural review (not substantive review) is permissible. The High Court was justified in recalling an earlier order passed in absence of the Respondent based on false information.

Summary of Jurisprudence Under Section 362 Cr. P. C.

Criminal Courts are barred from altering or reviewing their own Judgments except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors.

Courts become functus officio once a Judgment or Order is signed.

Section 482 Cr. P. C. cannot be used to circumvent the explicit bar under Section 362.

Only procedural reviews are permitted in rare circumstances; substantive reviews are barred.

The bar under Section 362 Cr. P. C. is to be applied stricto sensu (strictly and literally).

Supreme Court Findings

The Supreme Court, while setting aside the High Court’s May 5, 2021 Order and restoring its August 13, 2020 judgment dismissing the petition for initiating perjury proceedings, held that proceedings under Section 340 Cr. P. C are criminal in nature and governed exclusively by the Cr. P. C. It found that a review application under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was not maintainable in such matters.

“Considering that the proceedings initiated under section 340 of Cr. P. C are of criminal nature and governed by the provisions of Cr. P. C which is a self-contained Code, and includes entire procedure within itself to deal with the proceedings initiated under its provisions, there is no scope for application of provisions of any other procedural law until specifically provided under such law”, the Court held.

Nature of Criminal Proceedings

The Supreme Court reiterated that Criminal Courts become functus officio once a judgment is signed and can only correct clerical or arithmetical errors or act in rare situations such as fraud, lack of jurisdiction, or denial of hearing. From various precedents, the Court outlined the following exceptional circumstances wherein a criminal court is empowered to alter or review its own judgment or a final order under Section 362 Cr. P. C:

Exceptional Circumstances Permitting Review under Section 362 Cr. P. C

Such power is expressly conferred upon the Court by Cr. P. C or any other law for the time being in force; or

The Court passing such a judgment or order lacked inherent jurisdiction to do so; or

A fraud or collusion is being played on the Court to obtain such judgment or order; or

A mistake on the part of the Court caused prejudice to a party; or

Facts relating to non-serving of necessary parties or death leading to estate being non-represented, not brought to the notice of the Court while passing such judgment or order.

None of these exceptions, the Court said, applied to the present case.

Case-Specific Findings

The Court also noted that the Khosla Group had withdrawn the Company Petition months before the High Court’s August 2020 judgment but stated that it was still pending. Since this fact was available at the time of the original hearing, it could not later be used to justify recall.

“Such an act to undermine the finality of the judicial proceedings cannot be permitted especially in such situations of deliberate omissions or misrepresentation on the part of the parties before the court and thereafter attempting to defend themselves and obtaining the verboten order dated 05.05.2021, substantially reviewing and recalling the Judgment dated 13.08.2020, under the garb of ‘procedural review’ which is impermissible”, the Court observed.

Conclusion

The legislative scheme as delineated by Section 369 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, as well as by Section 362 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is one and the same. Section 362 of the Cr. P. C. clearly provides that no Court, when it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error.

This is, however, subject to any other provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being in force. Thus, Section 362 of Cr. P. C. places an embargo prohibiting the Court from altering or reviewing its judgment or final order, and this embargo is relaxed only in two conditions:

Condition Description 1. When provided under the Code The review of a judgment or final order is expressly provided for within the Code of Criminal Procedure itself. 2. When provided by other law The review of a judgment or final order is authorized under any other law for the time being in force.

The embargo placed on Criminal Courts to alter or review their judgments serves a specific purpose and objective. The judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, as noted above, summarize the law to the effect that the Criminal Justice Delivery System does not clothe Criminal Courts with the power to alter or review a judgment or final order disposing of a case, except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors.

After a judgment is delivered or a final order disposing of the case is passed, the Court becomes functus officio. Any mistake or glaring omission is left to be corrected only by the appropriate forum in accordance with law.

Millies,,,,,https://www.ncronline.org/opinion/ice-turned-away-body-christ-catholics-must-keep-showing-anyway,"Bringing Communion in these ways is spiritually powerful among Roman Catholics, and it gives an extraordinary public witness.
Roman Catholics believe that Jesus Christ really is present in the bread and the wine offered in the Eucharist.
Scripture tells us that believers together are the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-27).

An apostolic constitution like this is one of the most authoritative ways the Roman Catholic Church teaches, all the more because Gaudium et Spes was the fruit of an ecumenical council.","Pope Leo XIV told United States Catholic bishops Oct. 8 that ""the church cannot be silent"" in the face of the Trump administration's brutal mass deportation efforts. The day before, Leo published the first document of his pontificate, Dilexi Te, in which he insisted the Catholic Church must assist ""the least among us,"" explicitly including vulnerable migrants because ""the Church has always recognized in migrants a living presence of the Lord.""

The church was not silent Oct. 11 near Chicago, as roughly 1,000 Roman Catholics processed in prayer, traveling a little more than a mile from a nearby Catholic parish to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Broadview, Illinois. They had hoped to send eight people into the facility to distribute Holy Communion. I spoke with several people who were there.

The procession was organized by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership, which is rooted in Roman Catholic faith and community organizing — both native flowers that bloom naturally in Chicago. Michael Okinczyc-Cruz, CSPL's executive director, explained to me that CSPL discussed potential responses once the Trump administration announced Operation Midway Blitz, the federal government’s Chicago-area immigration crackdown last month. He said, ""We discerned that we can bring Communion.""

One such example was holding a Mass on Sept. 13 outside the Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago, a military base serving as a staging spot for ICE agents, modeled after similar moments of resistance in Poland and El Salvador. Another was the Oct. 11 eucharistic procession.

Bringing Communion in these ways is spiritually powerful among Roman Catholics, and it gives an extraordinary public witness. Roman Catholics believe that Jesus Christ really is present in the bread and the wine offered in the Eucharist. The implications are complex. DePaul University professor William Cavanaugh argued in a 1998 book that the Eucharist is a specific response to violence against human beings — the humanity of the suffering person is restored and affirmed by bringing the suffering of Jesus close in a way that is present.

There is another sense in which Jesus becomes present for Catholics. Scripture tells us that believers together are the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-27). When Catholics assemble for Mass, or when 1,000 Catholics march in prayer led by the Jesus present in the Eucharist, they bring the suffering of Jesus in bread and their bodies to the suffering of ICE detention.

A group organized by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership distributes Communion near the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, Oct. 11, 2025. (Photo used with permission of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership)

Sr. Christin Tomy, who was part of the procession, said: ""To pair what is happening with the centrality of our eucharistic identity was very powerful. It felt very much like 'Become what you receive.' "" And, she said, it came from ""a deep respect for our call to be a eucharistic people.""

Once the procession reached the detention facility, Fr. Larry Dowling, a retired Chicago priest, told me, ""there was no one, zero Homeland Security standing outside."" Only Illinois State Police greeted the procession. Department of Homeland Security officials would not speak directly with the procession or its leaders, and messages would need to be relayed through state police, he said.

As messages were sent back and forth to see whether procession representatives might be allowed into the facility to distribute Communion, Okinczyc-Cruz said, the procession began spontaneously to sing ""Pan de Vida,"" which goes, ""We are the dwelling of God, fragile and wounded and weak. We are the body of Christ, called to be the compassion of God.""

Finally, a response came from ICE: an ""unequivocal no, with no reason or justification,"" Okinczyc-Cruz told me. ""They denied our invitation to bring Christ into the detention center.""

Still, Sister Christin, Father Larry and others distributed Communion to the procession. Fr. Dan Hartnett offered a prayer of spiritual communion for those inside the detention center. And, as peacefully as they came, the procession departed. They did not do all they went to Broadview to do, but accomplished a lot.

'They denied our invitation to bring Christ into the detention center.'

Spiritually, the reality of the church was present in a powerful way. God and God's people came to bear witness and show care for the vulnerable, suffering people in detention who were separated from their lives, their loved ones and even from their rights as believers. Among believers, this is important.

But something more practical and political was learned, too, as Dowling drew an additional conclusion about ICE's refusal to let clergy inside: ""They are afraid of people of faith,"" he said.

A few months ago, I wrote about how ICE was not honoring its own rules about granting detainees access to chaplains, pastoral care and religious services. Since then, and since Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski shined light on the problem, people I know in an ICE facility have gotten access consistently to a priest. Pressure from religious groups works, but there will need to be more of it.

This means the church must continue to show up. As another person who was there Oct. 11 told me, ""Saturday was life-giving. I wish we could do it daily until they let them in to share the Eucharist.""

Gaudium et Spes, the Second Vatican Council's Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, names ""arbitrary imprisonment"" and ""deportation"" alongside ""murder, genocide, abortion [and] euthanasia"" as ""infamies"" that ""poison human society"" and ""are supreme dishonor to the Creator."" An apostolic constitution like this is one of the most authoritative ways the Roman Catholic Church teaches, all the more because Gaudium et Spes was the fruit of an ecumenical council. The bishops of the world affirmed the text together with Pope John XXIII. This is not something Catholics can take lightly.

Still, some do. It is such a problem that Leo wonders in Dilexi ""why many people continue to think that they can safely disregard the poor"" and vulnerable like migrants. Scripture and church teaching are so consistent that, seeming nearly to be shaking his head, Leo tells us perhaps some people need to ""go back and re-read"" them.

Often, the problem is a partisan commitment. We place our political party ahead of giving consistent witness to our faith. Sometimes we hear arguments about the right of the nation to secure its borders, as though migrants seeking safety or a better life are like a military invasion. Instead, we should know that ""God intended the earth with everything contained in it for the use of all human beings and peoples,"" as quoted in Gaudium et Spes. God did not draw borders.

Some would urge us not to accompany the poor and the vulnerable because it could be dangerous. We do take risks when we oppose a regime that dehumanizes people created and loved by God. Our personal safety cannot always be guaranteed, even when Catholic leaders are doing the accompanying.

Yet the church must not be silent. Sometimes, it will not be safe. Sometimes we are called to take up our cross and follow (Matthew 16:24). That, too, is what it means to become what we receive.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-10/10.19.25%20Chicago%201.jpg?h=82f92a78&itok=OaM3nyJR,N,,2025-10-20 07:29:42.795411

“What does it mean to be a revolutionary? To be a revolutionary means that you wake up in the morning and you realize that something needs to change,” Anthony Bryson of SoCal Uprising said during the demonstration. “You realize that the Trump regime is a representation of the rise of fascism in America.”

A post shared by Long Beach Watchdog (@lbwatchdog)

Bryson and other protesters denounced immigration raids, capitalism, genocides around the world, including Palestine, Congo and Sudan, and moves by President Donald Trump and his administration to consolidate power through stacking courts, gerrymandering and skirting the checks and balances established by the U.S. Constitution.

“What does it mean to say no kings? It means no fucking kings,” Bryson said. “When the administration comes up and they stack everything against us, remember that we have the strength, we have the power. We outnumber the fascists, we outnumber the Nazis, we outnumber the white supremacists, we outnumber the oppressors. United through our struggle we can bring real change”

Organizers estimate that more than 7 million people gathered to protest at more than 2,700 demonstrations in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., which would make it the third largest protest in American history behind the George Floyd protests of 2020 and Earth Day 1970.

Saturday’s nationwide turnout surpassed June’s No Kings event by about 2 million people, according to estimates.

Trump on Sunday called the nationwide protest a “joke,” “small and ineffective.” He also alleged that the protest was paid for by ""[George] Soros and other radical-left lunatics.""

“I’m not a king,” Trump told reporters. ""I work my ass off to make our country great, that’s all it is. I’m not a king at all.”

Chris Kluwe, a former NFL punter and activist who found himself tossed into the political spotlight after being arrested earlier this year for protesting a MAGA plaque during a Huntington Beach City Council meeting, addressed the crowd.

“I know we feel fear. I know we feel disappointment at how our elected officials have not stood up for us. And I know for me personally, and I think for a lot of you as well, you feel anger,” Kluwe said. “It's not a violent anger. It's not what the right wing says. We're not violent terrorists. We're not paid protesters. We are here because we are angry at what is going on with our country, and it is okay for us to acknowledge that anger.”

Kluwe then invited the crowd to scream with him as a therapeutic and nonviolent way to alleviate stress and anger over Trump administration actions. But he asked protesters to hold onto that spark of anger as they continue to push back.

Kluwe, who was fired from his coaching job at Edison High School after his arrest, is now running for a seat in the California State Assembly for District 72.

Gray Wolf, 80, a member of the Yoeme tribe and an elder with the American Indian Movement, said he has been protesting since he was 15 years old, including Standing Rock and Oak Flat.

“I can see where we're heading. In 20 years or less, this will no longer be a white majority. It will be a white minority,” Gray Wolf told the Watchdog. “The white majority right now is trying to hang on to power as long as they can. It's obvious that Trumpo the Clown wants an all white nation, and it's not going to happen. People like us are just not going to let it happen.”

Wayne Theis, 64, a Marine Corps veteran and Long Beach resident, said it’s important for people to “stand up to the tyranny of Donald Trump.”

“Vets should know better than anybody. When we took that oath before we went to boot camp, that oath said that we were here to defend the Constitution, not to one man or any party,” Theis told the Watchdog Saturday. “I remember that every day, but it's not being followed.

On Saturday night, the San Jose Sharks hosted their ninth annual “Los Tiburones” game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The night was meant to celebrate the Bay Area’s Hispanic culture — “tiburones” is Spanish for “sharks” — and while there were quite a few events that did just that, an unfortunate error made the night take an entirely different context.

During the first intermission, the San Jose Sharks showed fan messages on their scoreboard, as they do for every game. During that time, a message slipped through which would be seen in bad taste under any circumstances, but took on an even darker context on “Los Tiburones” night.

ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a federal law enforcement agency that has been especially controversial over the last year for their overzealous enforcement of immigration laws, especially in the Hispanic community.

After the message was publicized on social media, the San Jose Sharks issued the following statement:

The protesters oppose the Italian government led by Giorgia Meloni and the European Union’s funding and training of the Libyan Coast Guard to intercept illegal immigrants attempting to cross to Europe.

The 2017 agreement has faced growing criticism after several investigations revealed that EU-funded detention centers in Libya are run by individuals described as “human traffickers.” The deal is set to be renewed next month.

During the protest, dozens of illegal immigrants from Sub-Saharan African countries shared their experiences in Libya, and participants observed a minute of silence to honor those who died trying to cross the sea.

But in his first television interview, Erez Reuveni told us, he's paid a price: speaking up cost him his dream.
Most lawyers at the Justice Department stay for years, even decades, defending the policies of one president after another.
Erez Reuveni: Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what.
Ryan Goodman: The one entity, or person, or institution that gets hurt the most is the Justice Department.","Erez Reuveni was on his way up. He was an attorney in the Department of Justice who was so effective defending President Trump's first-term immigration policy, that he was promoted right away in Trump's second term. But Reuveni's 15-year Justice Department career ended suddenly after, he says, he witnessed government lawyers lying in court and evading orders of a judge. These last few months have been a time of upheaval in the Justice Department. Now, Reuveni's claims are raising concern in courtrooms across the country. The administration has called Reuveni a leaker seeking five minutes of fame. But in his first television interview, Erez Reuveni told us, he's paid a price: speaking up cost him his dream.

Erez Reuveni: Even before I went to law school, I understood what I wanted to do as a lawyer was to be involved in public service. And everyone understood at the time. You do it at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. There's no better place as a young attorney to just do the sorts of cases where you're standing up in court as a first-chair attorney on behalf of the United States, doing things that law firm partners don't do.

Scott Pelley: And that meant what to you?

Erez Reuveni: That meant I was there on behalf of the American people, on behalf of the millions of citizens of this country to make sure that justice was done.

Erez Reuveni started in 2010 as a so-called ""career"" attorney. Most lawyers at the Justice Department stay for years, even decades, defending the policies of one president after another. Reuveni specialized in immigration law. And in the first Trump term he defended the controversial ban on travelers from Muslim countries, among many other cases.

Erez Reuveni: I was promoted. I received three awards for defense of fairly high-profile litigation. I defended everything they put on my plate. That was my job.

Scott Pelley: And at the beginning of the second Trump administration, you were promoted again.

Erez Reuveni: That's right. Very soon into the administration, I was selected to be the acting deputy director of the immigration section, overseeing about a hundred attorneys and every case that arose in the federal District Courts.

But it was the very day of that promotion, Friday, March 14th, that he, and others, were called to a fateful meeting with Emil Bove, President Trump's newly appointed number three at the Justice Department, who was once Trump's criminal defense attorney.

Erez Reuveni: And we were told at this meeting that over the weekend, the president of the United States would be signing a proclamation invoking something called the Alien Enemies Act. This is a wartime law from 1798 invoked three times in the nation's history, during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.

The Alien Enemies Act allows rapid expulsion from the U.S. of the citizens of enemy nations during a war. But without a declared war, Trump used it against more than 100 Venezuelans that the government said were terrorists. They were to be denied their right to be heard by a judge. Reuveni says above expected a challenge.

Erez Reuveni: Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what. And then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, 'f*** you.'

Scott Pelley: And when you heard that, you thought what?

Erez Reuveni: I felt like a bomb had gone off. Here is the number three official using expletives to tell career attorneys that we may just have to consider disregarding federal court orders.

The next day, Saturday, lawyers for the prisoners sued. Judge James Boasberg called a hearing and asked government lawyer, Drew Ensign, whether the planes were leaving that weekend.

Erez Reuveni: And Ensign says to Boasberg, I don't know. Now Ensign was at the same meeting that I was at the day before, where we were told in no uncertain terms that planes were taking off over the weekend, that those planes needed to take off no matter what. And he says, I don't know.

Reuveni says that moment in court was ""stunning.""

Erez Reuveni: It is the highest, most egregious violation of a lawyer's code of ethics to mislead a court with intent.

We don't know Ensign's intent. It was during the hearing that the planes took off. The judge issued an order and immediately, Reuveni emailed the agencies involved. ""...the judge specifically ordered us to not remove anyone… and to return anyone in the air."" But that didn't happen. Instead, more than five hours after Boasberg's order, the detainees, and other prisoners arrived at a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

Erez Reuveni: And then it really hit me. It's like, we really did tell the court, screw you. We really did just tell the courts, we don't care about your order. You can't tell us what to do. That was just a real gut punch.

Peter Keisler: The Department of Justice has the responsibility to obey all court orders. It can disagree with the order. It can appeal it. It can ask the judge to reconsider. But while the order is in effect, it's the obligation of the department to see to it that the government complies.

Peter Keisler should know. He ran the Justice Department as acting attorney general in 2007 for George W. Bush. He worked in Ronald Reagan's White House. And today, he's part of a law firm representing federal workers fired by the administration.

Scott Pelley: But some people watching this interview are thinking, if these people have been labeled by the administration as terrorists, as gang members, then we should get them out of the country as quickly as possible.

Peter Keisler: And there are lawful means to get people who are terrorists out of the country.

'Lawful means' that, Kiesler says, must include giving the detainees a chance, in court, to contest the charges.

Peter Keisler: Look, we have a saying in this country. It's deeply embedded in who we are. Everybody deserves their day in court. And all of us want to know that if the government acts against us, we will at least have the opportunity to go to a neutral decision-maker, present evidence and legal argument, and make sure that the government stays within its legal bounds.

Scott Pelley: But does the day in court apply to immigrants?

Peter Keisler: Absolutely. Nobody can be spirited out of the country without some opportunity to contest the factual and legal basis for that.

And it turned out, when the full facts were known, this Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had been deported by mistake. Normally people deported in error are returned. But instead, Reuveni says that in a phone call from a superior he was ordered to argue against Abrego Garcia's return by telling a judge that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 gang member and a terrorist.

Erez Reuveni: And I respond up the-- so up the chain of command, no way. That is not correct. That is not factually correct. It is not legally correct. That is-- that is a lie. And I-- cannot sign my name to that brief.

Scott Pelley: You're not saying Abrego Garcia is a choir boy. You're just saying that no one had managed to prove that he was a terrorist.

Erez Reuveni: Here's the really important thing here. Whether Mr. Abrego Garcia is or isn't a member of MS-13 or a terrorist or anything else is beside the point. What matters here is that they did everything they did to him in violation of his due process rights. What's to stop them if they decide they don't like you anymore, to say you're a criminal, you're a member of MS-13, you're a terrorist, what's to stop them from sending in some DOJ attorney at the direction of DOJ leadership to delay, to filibuster, and if necessary, to lie? And now that's you gone and your liberties changed.

After refusing to sign the brief that called Abrego Garcia a terrorist, Reuveni was fired. In June, he teamed up with lawyers from the Government Accountability Project to file a whistleblower disclosure. Making his story public helped expose a growing concern in many courts across the country that too often now the Justice Department is abusing the limits of the law.

Ryan Goodman: So the judges are saying some incredible things.

Ryan Goodman is a law professor at New York University who heads a non-partisan law journal. His team has analyzed hundreds of suits filed against the administration. And he didn't imagine what judges were saying to the Trump Justice Department.

Ryan Goodman: We found over 35 cases in which the judges have specifically said, what the government is providing me is false information. It might be intentionally false information, including false sworn declarations time and again.

In court records compiled by Goodman, Democratic and Republican appointed judges are critical of the Trump Justice Department's work. ""...Highly misleading..."" said one judge. ""...A serious violation of the court's order…"" wrote another. And a third warned, ""trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks.""

Scott Pelley: This isn't the way things normally proceed?

Ryan Goodman: It's not. In fact, I would say for some of the cases that we're looking at, maybe that would happen once every ten years.

Scott Pelley: Who gets hurt by this?

Ryan Goodman: The one entity, or person, or institution that gets hurt the most is the Justice Department.

We requested interviews with the head of the department, Attorney General Pam Bondi, her former deputy, Emil Bove and Drew Ensign, the attorney who said he didn't know when the planes were taking off, according to the court transcript. All declined the interview request. Bove was nominated for a judgeship and, in June, he was asked about Reuveni's claims.

Emil Bove: I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order.

Bove said, in part, that Reuveni was in no position to tell his superiors what to do.

Emil Bove: There's a suggestion that a line attorney, not even the head of the Office of Immigration Litigation, was in a position or considered himself to be to bind the department's leadership and other cabinet officials.

Bove was also asked if he had dismissed the courts with an expletive.

Sen. Adam Schiff: Well, did you suggest telling the courts 'f*** you' in any manner?

Emil Bove: I don't recall.

Bove was confirmed for the judgeship. And in a statement to 60 Minutes he wrote, in part, ""...Mr. Reuveni's claims are a mix of falsehoods and wild distortions of reality…""

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. He's now charged with transporting illegal immigrants. And he's pled not guilty. A judge criticized the Justice Department's ""...poor attempts..."" to connect him to MS-13. And he was not charged with terrorism.

About those prisoners sent to El Salvador, they were released to their home country, Venezuela. And in April, the Supreme Court agreed, unanimously, that they had been entitled to their day in court.

Scott Pelley: This interview is the first time that your face has been seen in such a public way, and I wonder if that concerns you.

Erez Reuveni: It does. At the same time, I think about what we're losing in this moment. I think about why I went to the Department of Justice, to do justice. And I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. And my view of that oath is that I need to speak up and draw attention to what has happened to the department, what is happening to the rule of law. I would not be faithfully abiding by my oath if I stayed silent right now.

Image left: Refugee issues covered by ECM over the years includes persecution of Iraqi Christians, Kurdish immigrations fleeing ISIS, a migrant crisis at the Mexican border, asylum seekers fleeing violence in Africa, efforts to help African women refugees, Afghan refugees starting new lives in East County--many after helping the U.S. military, Ukrainians in Santee after Russia's invasion of their homeland, and cultural celebrations of Asian immigrants in our region.

October 19, 2025 (San Diego, CA) – San Diego has admitted more refugees from around the world in the years just prior to the current Trump administration, welcoming people from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Europe. Our region has been enriched by these newcomers in many ways, such as the array of international restuarants and cultural attractions in the San Diego region.

But President Donald Trump, after already slashing aid to refugees, now proposes to sharply restrict admissions and prioritize admitting predominantly white, English-speaking Europeans who claim persecution due to opposing mass migration or support of “populist” political parties such as far-right neo-Nazi groups in Europe.

The New York Times reports that Trump aims to slash refugee admissions from 125,000 to just 7,500 this fiscal year---at a time when the world has 42.7 million documented refugees seeking safe havens.

After already announcing priority for White South Afrikaans (the racist former ruling class) despite no evidence of persecution, Trump now wants to prioritize Europeans with views that align with religious or racist extremist groups, according to Human Rights Watch, including a German “anti-immigrant party whose leaders have traffickedin antisemitism and Holocaust denial.”How many people claiming persecution due to opposing mass immigration are currently huddled in refugee camps? “There aren’t any,” Human Rights Watch reports. Yet refugee status is supposed to be defined as people who have fled their homelands due to credible fears of persecution—such as Sudanese refugees in Chad, Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh,and Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

The latter are now being deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan due to Trump yanking protected status from Afghans promised safe haven in the U.S. and now fear for their lives under Taliban rules.

Shan VanDiver, director of AfghanEvac, told the UK’s Independent, “When the U.S. signals that some identities are more deserving of safety than others,it diminishes our standing...It tells Afghan allies, persecuted minorities and families still waiting in danger that their sacrifices and their lives matterless. We see this firsthand: thousands of Afghans believed American when we said, 1Stand with us and we’ll stand with you.’ To now prioritize Europeans over them is not just inequitable—it is an unconscionable betrayal.”

The new actions come after the administration already slashed financial aid and healthcare for refugees. Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law restricts the eligibility of refugees for Medicaid, Medicare, children’s health insurance and even emergency food aid.

Moreover, Secretary of State Marco Rubio shifted over a quarter of a billion dollars out of the department’s Migration and Refugee Assistance Fund into paying immigrants to self-deport.

Naomi Steinberg, vice president of U.S. policy for Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the world’s oldest refugee resettlement agency, says Trump’s proposed to radically overall of the refugee system in the U.S. would “deliberately leave vulnerable people in danger all around the world, rendering it unrecognizable.”",,N,,2025-10-20 07:29:27.702968

I did some traveling last week. On Monday, Zach and I took Harlan (off from school) and Chase to the Please Touch Museum in Philadelphia. A good time was had by all—except for Chase on the carousel.

On Friday, I participated in Syracuse Law’s annual U.S. Supreme Court Preview. After delivering the keynote address, “The Supreme Court Clerkship: Evolution of an Institution,” I joined a panel discussion that covered some of the most notable cases of October Term 2025. Thanks to Syracuse Law for an excellent visit. Go Orange!

I’m working on a column offering advice to incoming associates starting up at law firms this fall (similar to my post from August, 4 Tips For Incoming Judicial Law Clerks). My own stint in Biglaw was relatively short, so I’m going to need some help. If you have a tip or two you can share, please email me at davidlat@substack.com, subject line “Associate Advice,” or post in the comments. My default approach is to keep sources anonymous—I’ll just pass off your insights and wisdom as my own, if that’s okay—so there’s no need to request anonymity.

Now, on to the news.

Lawyer of the Week: John Bolton.

The Trump administration continues to prosecute Donald Trump’s foes. The three latest targets are all lawyers: James Comey, a former FBI director, deputy attorney general, and U.S. attorney (S.D.N.Y.); Letitia James, the current attorney general of New York State; and now John Bolton, who served in the first Trump administration as national security advisor (NSA)—before he fell out of Trump’s favor, as a number of other administration alumni have, and became a prominent Trump critic.

Although the NSA doesn’t have to be a lawyer, Bolton is an attorney with impressive legal credentials. A graduate of Yale Law School (where he was friends with Clarence Thomas), Bolton served as an assistant attorney general at the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), in both the Civil Division and Office of Legislative Affairs, and practiced at Covington & Burling and Kirkland & Ellis.

On Thursday, a federal grand jury in Maryland indicted Bolton on charges of mishandling classified information. The 26-page indictment contains 18 counts: eight counts of unlawful transmission of national defense information, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 793(d), and 10 counts of unlawful retention of national defense information, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 793(e).

As explained in The New York Times, the gist of the indictment is that Bolton “us[ed] personal email and a messaging app to share more than 1,000 pages of ‘diary’ notes about his day-to-day activities as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser in 2018 and 2019.” According to the indictment, Bolton sometimes used AOL and Google email accounts to send these “notes” to two family members, who were helping him with a book project that later became his memoir, The Room Where It Happened. These relatives, reportedly his wife and daughter, did not have security clearances—and his unsecured email was subsequently hacked by “a cyber actor believed to be associated with the Islamic Republic of Iran.” Not great.

On Friday, Bolton pleaded not guilty to the charges, which he vowed to fight. Like a number of other Trump foes (including Tish James), Bolton retained one of Washington’s most well-known lawyers, Abbe Lowell—a former Winston & Strawn partner who now has his own boutique, Lowell & Associates. Lowell sent me the following statement about the charges against Bolton:

The underlying facts in this case were investigated and resolved years ago. These charges stem from portions of Ambassador Bolton’s personal diaries over his 45-year career—records that are unclassified, shared only with his immediate family, and known to the FBI as far back as 2021. Like many public officials throughout history, Ambassador Bolton kept diaries—that is not a crime. We look forward to proving once again that Ambassador Bolton did not unlawfully share or store any information. [Ed. note: Bolton is referred to as “Ambassador” because he served as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations from 2005 to 2006, under President George W. Bush.]

Bolton decried his prosecution as part of Trump’s “intensive effort to intimidate his opponents.” But while there are some similarities between Bolton’s prosecution and those of Jim Comey and Tish James, there are some differences as well, as noted by The Washington Post and Reuters—which led Reuters to opine that Bolton “faces a tougher defense than other Trump foes charged with crimes.”

First, the 26-page indictment against Bolton is far more than detailed than the bare-bones documents filed against Comey (two pages) or James (five pages)—and the Bolton indictment is more persuasive, according to legal experts consulted by The Times, The Post, and Reuters. Second, scrutiny of Bolton by prosecutors predated the current administration; he was investigated under Biden as well.

Third, while the Comey and James indictments were brought by Lindsey Halligan—a former personal lawyer to Trump with no prior prosecutorial experience, installed as U.S. attorney after career prosecutors wouldn’t bring the cases Trump sought—multiple veteran prosecutors were involved in the Bolton indictment. They include U.S. Attorney Kelly O. Hayes—initially picked by the Trump administration as interim U.S. attorney, but subsequently appointed by the judges of the district court—and Thomas Sullivan, chief of the national security and cybercrime section of the Maryland U.S. Attorney’s Office, who signed the indictment on Hayes’s behalf.

Bolton definitely has possible defenses. He could and surely will argue selective or vindictive prosecution—and he could cite the Trump administration’s inconsistency in investigating and prosecuting the alleged mishandling of classified information, including the apparent lack of any investigation or prosecution associated with “Signalgate,” the incident in which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other officials discussed a military strike in Yemen over Signal, a commercial messaging app, in a group chat that accidentally included a journalist from The Atlantic. But legally, prevailing on a selective or vindictive prosecution claim is a tough row to hoe (for reasons explained by Professor Rory Little in a thoughtful and thorough SCOTUSblog post).

So if I were in John Bolton’s shoes, I’d be afraid, very afraid. He’s 76 years old, the charges he faces could put him behind bars for the rest of his life, and he seems unlikely to be the recipient of (questionable) presidential clemency—unlike former congressman George Santos, discussed below (under Litigation of the Week).

Other lawyers in the news (links to The Times are gift links—you’re welcome):

Several prosecutors were fired in or resigned from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, in either the lead-up to or the aftermath of the Comey indictment. On Friday, another E.D. Va. prosecutor who opposed the Comey charges, Elizabeth Yusi, was terminated—along with her deputy, Kristin Bird—according to The Times.

The Times also conducted a deep dive into the departure of Todd Gilbert as U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia. Gilbert reportedly was forced to resign—and one of his deputies, Zachary Lee, was demoted (before leaving the office)—after Gilbert and Lee didn’t pursue an investigation, sought by the Trump administration, related to the FBI’s examination of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Caught in the middle of all this is Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche—who has, per The Times, “more often than not enabled the president’s effort to discard processes and restraints that once preserved the department’s independence.” But on a few occasions, he has “defended the [DOJ] against the most extreme efforts of Mr. Trump and his allies to pursue an intensifying campaign of retribution”—and is viewed with suspicion by some on the right for that reason.

Legal Academic of the Week: Professor Caleb Nelson of UVA Law School. A prominent originalist and former law clerk to Justice Thomas, Nelson wrote an article, “Must Administrative Officers Serve at the President’s Pleasure,” that “has complicated and perhaps upended the conventional wisdom” among conservatives about the “unitary executive” theory,” per Adam Liptak. Another well-known legal scholar, Professor Will Baude, dubbed Nelson’s article a “bombshell” on Bluesky.

Superstar trial lawyer Alex Spiro of Quinn Emanuel charges $3,000 an hour—which is, according to Jack Newsham of Business Insider, almost twice what he charged four years ago ($1,600). I’ve known about Spiro and his talents for years—which is why I picked him, more than three years ago, as my very first podcast guest. So you can think of that 40-minute interview as worth $2,000—making an Original Jurisdiction subscription quite the bargain.

Judges of the Week: Judges Emil Bove and Jennifer Mascott.

Last Wednesday, the Third Circuit held rehearing en banc in Association of New Jersey Rifle & Pistol Clubs Inc. v. Attorney General of New Jersey. It’s an interesting and important case, a Second Amendment challenge to a New Jersey gun law that bans AR-15 rifles (among other things).

It was noteworthy for another reason as well: it was the first appearance on the bench of two new Trump appointees, Judges Emil Bove and Jennifer Mascott. Their arrival is significant, as Jacqueline Thomsen noted for Bloomberg Law, because it gives Republican appointees an 8-6 majority on the Third Circuit (previously 7-7, before Judge Bove replaced Judge Joseph Greenaway Jr., an Obama appointee).

Chief Judge Michael Chagares began the session by welcoming his two new colleagues. You can listen to the proceedings here, including Chief Judge Chagares’s pronunciation of “Bove” consistent with what I previously shared, “BOH-vee.” (As for “Emil,” which Chagares did not have occasion to pronounce, I believe it’s “A-mill,” where “A” rhymes with “day” or “may.”)

During the argument, Judge Mascott was an active questioner, as you’d expect from a former law professor. And she showed keen interest in how to conduct the history-and-tradition analysis required under Brahimi, as you’d expect from a former law clerk to Justice Thomas. I predict that she’ll be a force to be reckoned with on the bench, whether or not you agree with her views. And I predict that Judge Mascott, who clerked for then-Judge Brett Kavanaugh as well as Justice Thomas, will become a Supreme Court feeder judge as well.

As for Judge Bove on the bench, he was like the pre-pandemic Justice Thomas: silent. But we did get a hint about what Bove might be like as a judge from a concurrence he wrote in Thomas Taysson Batista Ramos v. Attorney General United States of America, an immigrant’s habeas petition challenging the removal (deportation) proceedings brought against him.

The panel majority in this immigration case, consisting of Judges Cheryl Ann Krause and Richard Nygaard, issued an administrative stay on October 8, to freeze the proceedings—and prevent the petitioner’s deportation—while it considered the merits. On Friday, the majority denied the petitioner’s motion for an emergency stay; transferred the case to the Fifth Circuit, after concluding that it should have been brought in the Fifth Circuit in the first place; and lifted the administrative stay.

Judge Bove wrote a concurrence to explain why he dissented from the October 8 administrative stay, but concurred in the denial of an emergency stay and transfer order. In an opinion urging judicial deference to the executive branch on deportations, he argued that (1) the petitioner’s motion for a stay “should not have interfered with [Department of Homeland Security] operations for an instant,” and (2) “the harms of a stay to the Executive Branch outweighed the risk of unwarranted consequences to Petitioner.” Quoting prominent conservative jurists from other circuits—including Judges Patrick Bumatay (9th Cir.), Andrew Oldham (5th Cir.), and Lawrence VanDyke (9th Cir.)—Judge Bove also wrote critically about stays, especially administrative stays, and especially in the immigration context.

Based on this concurrence, I predict that Judge Bove will be, as most would have predicted, very conservative—and very deferential to the executive branch (at least as long as Donald Trump, Bove’s former client in private practice, is president). But his tone, interestingly enough, was restrained; instead of sharply criticizing his colleagues, à la Judge VanDyke, Judge Bove wrote that “there is no question in my mind that we all approached that task [of judicial review] in good faith.” So based on both his silence on the bench and non-barn-burning concurrence, Judge Bove might be less in-your-face as a jurist than we might have expected (at least based on allegations that as a Justice Department official, he told colleagues that the DOJ might have to tell courts, “f**k you”).

In other news about judges and the judiciary:

On Monday, the federal courts will start feeling the effects of the government shutdown, as reported by The Times and The National Law Journal. But it’s not clear what those effects will be—and they could vary from court to court. According to a statement from the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, “[e]ach appellate, district, and bankruptcy court will make operational decisions regarding how its cases and probation and pretrial supervision will be conducted during the funding lapse,” as will each federal defender’s office (because federal public defenders are funded by the judicial and not executive branch). Judges will continue to get paid—as required by the Constitution—but court staff, including law clerks, might get furloughed or asked to work without pay (but hopefully made whole when the shutdown ends, whenever that might be).

How will the shutdown affect SCOTUS? According to the Public Information Office, the building at One First Street “will be closed to the public until further notice,” but the Court “will continue to conduct essential work such as hearing oral arguments, issuing orders and opinions, [and] processing case filings.”

Speaking of the Court and its members, Justice Anthony Kennedy’s memoir, Life, Law & Liberty, was officially published on Tuesday. For highlights, check out my husband Zach’s SCOTUSblog post.

Who’s overseeing the John Bolton prosecution? That would be Judge Theodore Chuang, a former federal prosecutor and counsel at WilmerHale, who was appointed to the District of Maryland by President Obama in 2014 (as noted in this National Law Journal profile).

October 19, 2025 - WASHINGTON, D.C. — Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce filed a legal challenge to the administration’s $100,000 fee on H-1B visa petitions. The Chamber’s litigation argues that the new fee is unlawful because it overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including the requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas. In announcing today’s action, Neil Bradley, Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer at the U.S. Chamber, issued the following statement:

“The new $100,000 visa fee will make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program, which was created by Congress expressly to ensure that American businesses of all sizes can access the global talent they need to grow their operations here in the U.S.

“President Trump has embarked on an ambitious agenda of securing permanent pro-growth tax reforms, unleashing American energy, and unraveling the overregulation that has stifled growth. The Chamber and our members have actively backed these proposals to attract more investment in America. To support this growth, our economy will require more workers, not fewer.

“The president deserves credit for securing our nation’s border. With the border secure, we now have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to accomplish targeted legal immigration reforms, and we stand ready to work with Congress and the administration to make that happen. That includes working together on common-sense reforms to improve the visa process for skilled workers. The president has said he wants to educate, attract, and retain the world’s best and brightest in the U.S., and the Chamber shares that goal.”

The posts on Bluesky, a social network whose format is similar to that of X, continued a pattern of partisan attacks from the executive branch after Congress failed to reach an agreement on federal funding and the government shut down on Oct. 1.

The administration has repeatedly thrust normally nonpartisan agencies into the funding fight, including by posting politically loaded language on agency websites, even though the federal bureaucracy is ordinarily expected to stay out of the fray during political disagreements.

In a Bluesky post on Friday, the Transportation Department blamed what it called the “Schumer-Jeffries Shutdown,” referring to the Democratic minority leaders Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, for forcing air traffic controllers, who are required to work through the shutdown, to go without pay. The post was shared alongside a cartoon image of the men in sombreros.

For its part, the Health and Human Services Department repeated a falsehood shared by Republicans: that Democrats had shut down the government because Republicans would not agree to fund free health care for unauthorized immigrants. And the Homeland Security Department’s account posted a taunting message asking people to report “criminal illegal aliens” to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and included a phone number.

Inside the White House, officials continue to strategize about ways to alleviate harms on Republicans and inflict them on Democrats.
In a floor speech that was deeply unpopular with progressive Democrats, Mr. Schumer predicted the pain that Mr. Trump could inflict should a government shutdown occur.
He warned that Mr. Trump would use the shutdown to grab even more power from Congress, and would see the situation as an opportunity to make permanent cuts.
He warned that a shutdown would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought “the keys to the city, state and country.” But as Mr. Trump now carries out that very agenda, Mr. Schumer has said he is increasingly comfortable with Democrats’ position.","President Trump has repurposed money to fund military salaries during the government shutdown. He has pledged to find ways to make sure many in law enforcement get paid. He has used the fiscal impasse to halt funding to Democratic jurisdictions, and is trying to lay off thousands of federal workers.

Government shutdowns are usually resolved only after the pain they inflict on everyday Americans forces elected officials in Washington to come to an agreement. But as the shutdown nears a fourth week, Mr. Trump’s actions have instead reduced the pressure for an immediate resolution and pushed his political opponents to further dig in.

“We’re not going to bend,” Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, said on Friday, the 17th day of the shutdown. “We’re not going to break.” He added: “All of these efforts to try to intimidate Democratic members of the House and the Senate are not going to work.”

Unlike past presidents, Mr. Trump appears to feel little urgency to strike a deal to reopen the government. Instead, he has used the shutdown, which began Oct. 1, as an opportunity to further remake the federal bureaucracy and jettison programs he does not like, seizing on unorthodox budgetary maneuvers that some have called illegal.

Administration officials appear undaunted by the criticism, even after a federal judge temporarily blocked their efforts to conduct mass firings. On Friday, some agencies indicated in court filings that they might proceed with layoffs that officials suggested were not covered by the order.

Russell T. Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget and the architect of the effort to remake the government, has pledged to “stay on offense” throughout the shutdown.

“He now has this cover for doing what at least Russ Vought and that coalition has wanted to do all along,” Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University, said of Mr. Trump.

Asked in the Oval Office this week whether he would use his deal-making skills to bring the shutdown to an end, Mr. Trump said that he was instead working to lower health care costs without the help of Congress, by negotiating agreements directly with pharmaceutical companies for lower prescription costs.

“We have to take care of our health care,” he said.

White House officials say that the administration’s moves are meant to send the message that it is Mr. Trump, not congressional Democrats, who is helping Americans when government funding has lapsed.

“Any negative impacts felt by the American people have purely been caused by the Democrats,” said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman.

The administration has mitigated some of the fallout by using budgetary maneuvers to keep salaries flowing to some federal workers, including border agents and law enforcement officers, as well as members of the military. Mr. Trump has also pledged to use tariff money to fund a food aid program for low-income Americans.

It is a sharp contrast with the approach of past presidents, who expressed frustration during shutdowns and resolved to bring them to a close. Some entered into lengthy negotiations with congressional leaders.

The Obama and Clinton administrations were both forced to furlough hundreds of thousands of workers during shutdowns that lasted more than two weeks. The longest shutdown on record came during Mr. Trump’s first term, beginning in December 2018 and lasting 34 full days.

No previous president, including Mr. Trump, attempted to use a fiscal impasse to carry out layoffs or to freeze money appropriated by Congress.

Inside the White House, officials continue to strategize about ways to alleviate harms on Republicans and inflict them on Democrats.

“The Democrats are getting killed in the shutdown, because we’re closing up programs that are Democrat programs that we’re opposed to,” Mr. Trump said this week. “And they’re never going to come back, in many cases.”

While some polling shows that Americans blame Republicans slightly more than Democrats for the shutdown, White House aides believe public sentiment will turn in their favor.

In their view, the longer the shutdown goes on, the more pressure will build on Democrats to cut a deal. Voters will see Mr. Trump finding ways to pay the troops and law enforcement, they say, while Democrats refuse to reopen the government and federal workers miss paychecks.

Indeed, the White House has undertaken what Mr. Vought calls a game of “budgetary Twister” to keep Republican priorities funded.

But that game can last only so long, experts say. Eventually money will run out, and the pain will intensify.

It is unclear which side will be held responsible. In the past, the party insisting on a policy change — as Democrats are doing now with health care costs — has incurred a greater portion of the blame than the party backing a simple continuation of government funding. But shutdowns also carry risks for the president, who many voters see as responsible for keeping Washington functioning.

So far, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponents have shown little sign of yielding.

In March, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, was faced with the choice of voting to fund the government or fighting the Trump administration by refusing to pass a short-term measure.

In a floor speech that was deeply unpopular with progressive Democrats, Mr. Schumer predicted the pain that Mr. Trump could inflict should a government shutdown occur.

He warned that Mr. Trump would use the shutdown to grab even more power from Congress, and would see the situation as an opportunity to make permanent cuts. He warned that a shutdown would give Mr. Trump and Mr. Vought “the keys to the city, state and country.”

But as Mr. Trump now carries out that very agenda, Mr. Schumer has said he is increasingly comfortable with Democrats’ position. The party has found a popular issue on which to fight Mr. Trump, one that has an impact on voters whose health care bills are poised to rise in the coming months.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/17/multimedia/DC-TRUMP-SHUTDOWN-01-fkjp/DC-TRUMP-SHUTDOWN-01-fkjp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:28:26.282077

Trump was not at the White House during the protests but on a visit to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
Connecticut House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora told Connecticut Public that he considered the ""No Kings"" messaging of the protests ""divisive.""","One of the biggest days of protest against the Trump administration's policies happened on Saturday in cities around the U.S. The overriding theme of the marches was the accusation that President Trump is behaving more like a monarch than an elected official.

It marked the second massive wave of protests organized by No Kings — a network of progressive organizations fighting against Trump's agenda.

Organizers said about 2,600 No Kings events were planned across nearly every state, and that it projected a bigger turnout than the 5 million it said attended its previous nationwide action in June.

Energized by a slew of actions taken by the administration since the summer protests, the group cited widespread immigration detentions carried out by often-masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, the administration's aggressive slashing of federal education resources and environmental protections, gerrymandering and other concerns.

Here's a recap of how the protests unfolded.

1. United in protests to 'protect America'

Protesters showed up to oppose a wide range of issues, including the administration's immigration tactics and its push for federal and military intervention in Democratic-led states as a way to tackle crime. The diversity of concerns was strung together by the broader messaging of democracy, constitutional rights and the freedom the U.S. was founded on.

In Washington, D.C., demonstrators filled Pennsylvania Avenue near the U.S. Capitol, many holding signs that read ""No Kings, No Tyrants."" Many people wore yellow, a color organizers said is to show unity.

Uriah Kitchen of Delaware, who attended the protest with his son Elijah, told NPR ""we made a pledge of allegiance when we were in school and this is what it's all about.""

""This is why we're here, we're here to protect America,"" Kitchen said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, addressed D.C. protesters in remarks slamming tech billionaires who he said have become richer and more powerful since Trump became president. Sanders singled out Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg ""and the other multibillionaires who were sitting right behind Trump when he was inaugurated.""

On the West Coast in San Pablo, Calif., Maria Floriano attended a No Kings event with immigration on her mind. Wearing a hat and shirt decorated with butterflies, she compared immigration to butterflies and said ""migration is beautiful"" and ""an act of courage.""

""We want them to know that there are people fighting for them, that not everyone feels that they're not welcome here,"" Floriano said, noting the protest was held in a Bay Area community home to a large population of immigrants.

2. The Trump administration and Republican lawmakers weighed in

House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed Saturday's protests as a ""hate America rally,"" and other Republicans have derided the event as anti-American.

Responding to NPR's questions about the protests, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said: ""Who cares?""

Trump was not at the White House during the protests but on a visit to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Connecticut House Republican Leader Vincent Candelora told Connecticut Public that he considered the ""No Kings"" messaging of the protests ""divisive."" He also doesn't share protesters' concerns but supports their right to exercise their First Amendment rights.

""I think our democracy is still strong as ever — but, you know, they're free to express themselves,"" Candelora said.

3. Peaceful protesting with song and dance

Despite the many criticisms that anti-Trump protesters came to preach, there were displays of optimism, hope and whimsy in several cities.

Inspired by protesters in Portland, Ore., people in Los Angeles, Hartford, Conn., and elsewhere showed up to march in inflatable animal costumes. Song and dance broke out in Salt Lake City and other cities.

As with the previous mass No Kings protests, revolutionary messaging showed up in demonstrators' clothing, chants and signs as protesters sought to remind people that America was founded in opposition to monarchy.

In Macon, Ga., protesters belted ""The Story of Tonight"" from the musical Hamilton — a song about the importance of sacrifice and solidarity today for the sake of freedom tomorrow.

The protests were largely peaceful. Police in New York City and Washington, D.C., where rallies drew some of the day's biggest crowds, said no protest-related arrests were made.

Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Greg Abbott of Texas mobilized their states' National Guards in preparation for the protests.

""The Governor has authorized state active duty for training to help ensure the Guard will be ready to respond if needed to help keep people safe,"" Youngkin spokesman Peter Finocchio wrote in a statement to VPM.

The Texas Newsroom reported that Abbott said in a statement of sending the Guards to Austin: ""Violence and destruction will never be tolerated in Texas."" The newsroom also reported that state troopers were stationed at entrances to the Capitol grounds inspecting bags but protesters said the law enforcement presence felt smaller than the previous ""No Kings"" event in June.

Saturday's rally was peaceful and there were no arrests, according to the Austin Police Department.

Heavener said the community has remained vigilant for ICE activity — although Facebook shuttered local groups used to alert schools about ICE’s presence.","Maria Heavener had opened the windows of her first-grade classroom to let in the unusually warm October breeze when the sound of helicopters, sirens, and a flood of notifications compelled her to slam them shut. During a raid on a nearby grocery store, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents had hurled tear gas canisters into a parking lot across the street from Chicago’s Funston Elementary School, spreading a thick, choking smog toward the building while class was in session.

Heavener had heard rumors that ICE was planning to detain unaccompanied minors and that schools could be a target, but this scenario had never crossed her mind. “We definitely didn’t expect what happened,” she said. “We didn’t expect them to throw tear gas right outside of our school building.”

For the last month, the Trump administration has kept Chicago under siege. Customs and Border Protection agents arrested a 15-year-old U.S. citizen earlier this week after unleashing tear gas into a crowded residential neighborhood. Earlier in October, masked federal agents raided a five-story apartment building in a predominantly Black neighborhood of Chicago and zip-tied naked children as they dragged their parents away.

The Trump administration claims that Chicago is unsafe and needs order, despite the fact that the city experienced its lowest homicide rate in 60 years this summer. But instead of investing in underfunded schools or attempting to eradicate poverty, which have been shown to increase public safety, the administration is pouring millions into the militarization of American cities and fighting a court battle to federalize the National Guard in Chicago.

The Trump administration’s war on immigrants has had a disastrous impact on the city’s children, Chicago teachers told The Intercept.

“The smoke bombs that they dropped in front of school right at dismissal, the detainment of grown-ups after they drop off their children, or as they’re picking them up. All of that is violent. All of that is traumatic,” said Stacy Davis Gates, president of the Chicago Teachers Union. “And for the first time, that is what many students in this city are experiencing.”

Heavener said she struggled to explain the events that occurred on October 3 to her class of 6 and 7-year-olds. “A lot of them were sad, worried, scared, nervous,” she said. “Some of them said they’re scared because they don’t want their own family members to be taken away.”

One of her students became so overwhelmed that he had a panic attack. “It’s very scary because this is their normal,” said Heavener. “You start forming your memories more solidly around 4 or 5 years old, so they have some happy kindergarten memories. But now all of sudden, this is going to take over their experiences and worldview, and it’s going to shape a lot for them, and it’s traumatic, and they’re all going to hold that in their bodies as they grow up.”

The stakes feel even higher at schools with older kids, where Heavener and other staff fear students will become targets. The recent arrest of the 15-year-old, Heavener said, has had a particular chilling effect. His lawyers allege that the teenager was detained in a federal facility for five hours without anyone telling his family where he was being held. The Department of Homeland Security denied that CBP “kidnapped” the teen, noting that “a U.S. citizen teenager threw eggs and hit a CBP Officer in the head.”

“The media is sadly attempting to create a climate of fear and smear law enforcement. These smears are contributing to our ICE law enforcement officers facing 1,000% increase in assaults against them,” DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin wrote in a statement. “ICE is not conducting enforcement operations at, or ‘raiding,’ schools. ICE is not going to schools to make arrests of children. Criminals are no longer be able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense.”

“Attendance at a lot of [schools] is down,” Gates told The Intercept. “Senior nights have been cancelled. Fall sports and after-school activities have been sparsely attended … because of the unpredictability and the violence of Trump’s troops.”

“It makes me want to cry,” said Heavener. “Generally, the societal norm is that children are sacred, and we take care of our children. Now it seems like they’re being targeted.”

Amid the chaos, Gates said that teachers, parents, students, and community organizers had come together to help make students safer. At Funston Elementary, for example, community members lined the streets to form a safe walking corridor for students and their families after the tear-gas incident. Heavener said the community has remained vigilant for ICE activity — although Facebook shuttered local groups used to alert schools about ICE’s presence.

Kathryn, an elementary school music teacher who wanted to use her first name to protect her school from being targeted by ICE, has tried to make her classroom a safe space for her students.

“It’s even more important right now that we have stable, predictable classrooms and especially places where students can continue to be imaginative and experience joy and learn to work with other people,” she said, “and especially learn to work with people who are different from them.”

Still, she said normalcy and joy are difficult to achieve in the current environment.

“I’m worried every day,” said Kathryn. “I’m worried that we’ll have kids here waiting to be picked up and nobody will ever come for them, because we’ve seen it happen.”

A middle school student was recently at home when ICE came to detain their parents. Through the process, Kathryn learned how to navigate the fact “that you can set up temporary guardianship for a minor if it’s less than a year,” she said. “I would like to live in a world where that’s not a thing I need to know, but I do.”

Despite claims from the Trump administration that Chicago is unsafe, Kathryn argues they’re the ones who’ve turned the streets into a war zone. “I was born and raised in Chicago,” said Kathryn. “I’ve never seen the city as unsafe as it is right now with them here.”

What makes it worse is that the money the administration is spending to deploy federal agents to patrol outside of elementary schools could genuinely make a difference in Chicago Public Schools. An estimate from the National Priorities Project found that a National Guard deployment to Chicago, currently blocked in federal court, could cost roughly $1.59 million a day. The latest Republican spending bill added $29.9 billion to ICE’s enforcement budget — a boost that nearly triples the $10.25 billion operating budget for the entire Chicago public school system, which includes 630 schools.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2241106678-e1760718924719.jpg?fit=8256%2C4128&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-20 07:28:36.470591

Her cardboard sign highlighted the end of the Pledge of Allegiance: With liberty and justice for all.

“The Statue of Liberty became a sign of a haven for people, and it’s being trashed,” Whedbee said. “This administration needs to see how many people aren’t on board with the things they are doing.”

Whedbee was one of around 400 people packed along the four corners of U.S. 12 and Route 20, near the Miller train station, participating in the national No Kings protest.

The national No Kings movement opposes President Donald Trump and his administration’s actions, like targeting immigrant families, gutting healthcare, rigging Congressional maps, among other things, according to its website.

Whedbee, a Gary resident, said she’s horrified every time she sees news reports about Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers taking immigrants from their homes, jobs or outside their children’s school.

“It’s like the Gestapo. They are taking citizens. They are taking people who haven’t committed a crime,” Whedbee said.

Looking to the future, Whedbee said she’s concerned for farm workers, food quality and access, healthcare and the cost of living.

“It’s going to look bad for everybody who isn’t rich,” Whedbee said.

Erin Carreon, 39, who held a poster with the message “fight ignorance not immigrants,” said it’s hard to sleep at night because of all the things the Trump administration is taking away from the American people.

“People are being kidnapped from their communities. So much is happening. So I thought it was important to be here,” Carreon said. “It’s really terrible. We have to stand together with our neighbors.”

The protest gave her hope, Carreon said, because it shows that people are resisting. Carreon, a Gary resident, said people can get involved by protesting outside the Gary/Chicago Airport, which is used by ICE to deport people.

Linda Hart, 64, held a flag that read “We the People” and “No Kings in America” and waved it as cars drove by and honked in support.

“I’m tired of Trump and his people. They are tearing up America,” Hart said.

Hart, who grew up in Gary, said she is a former federal worker who retired before the government shutdown. Some of her friends and former coworkers have told her that they have been asked to reapply for their jobs, and they are concerned that they will not be rehired.

Further, Hart said she’s concerned about the pressure the Trump administration is putting on Indiana Republican legislators to redistrict ahead of the 2026 midterm election. Typically, redistricting occurs after census data is released.

“I think they are just trying to steal the election,” Hart said.

While no decision on a special session to address redistricting has been made, Gov. Mike Braun has signaled that the legislature could meet as soon as November to vote on redistricting. Braun signaled that to not redistrict would result in retribution from the Trump Administration. Vice President JD Vance has made two visits to Indiana to talk with Braun and Republican legislative leaders, and on Friday Trump called lawmakers including Senate President Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, according to a New York Times report.

Whedbee said Indiana’s redistricting efforts are “terrible” because the state is already heavily represented by Republicans. Currently, seven of Indiana’s nine Congressional districts are held by Republicans and two are held by Democrats, District 1 U.S Rep. Frank Mrvan, D-Highland, and District 7 U.S. Rep. André Carson, D-Indianapolis.

“We are already heavily Republican. That’s a part of cowardice and fear,” Whedbee said.

Charles VanCleef, 66, said potentially redistricting Indiana is “disgusting” because it will impact the first congressional district, which covers Northwest Indiana and is currently represented by Mrvan.

“Our little corner should have a voice,” VanCleef said.

VanCleef, a Portage resident, held a sign that said “no kings” on one side and “no kings, no fascists, no Nazis and no Trump” on the other side. He said he came to the protest to continue his grandfather’s legacy.

“My grandfather almost died in World War II fighting fascists. I think I owe it to him to be here,” VanCleef said.

Zachary Greenwood, 31, said he came to the protest because “there’s power in numbers.” After 10 months into the Trump administration, Greenwood said things aren’t looking good.

“The stuff is starting to hit the fan, and I’m starting to see what’s for what,” Greenwood said.

But, Greenwood said peacefully protesting and resisting bad policies is the way to move forward.

“If we take more action on it, we can fight it,” Greenwood said.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PTB-L-NOKINGS-GARY-1018-01.jpg?w=1024&h=727,N,,2025-10-20 07:28:40.574730

Marshals custody on Oct. 2 to face a federal firearms charge.","DES MOINES, Iowa — The former superintendent of Iowa's largest school district falsely claimed to be a U.S. citizen on a federal form and knowingly possessed several firearms illegally, according to a newly returned indictment that raises the prospect of a lengthy prison term.

A federal grand jury issued the two-count indictment Thursday charging former Des Moines schools superintendent Ian Roberts with one count of making a false statement for employment and one count of unlawfully possessing a firearm while being in the country illegally. Together, the charges carry a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

Roberts, who is originally from Guyana and worked for two decades in school districts across the U.S., was detained Sept. 26 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in a targeted operation that shocked the community.

Authorities said Roberts lacked authorization to work in the U.S. and fled from agents who conducted a traffic stop while he was driving his district-issued Jeep Cherokee. Roberts was later apprehended in a wooded area with help from the Iowa State Patrol. Authorities found a handgun wrapped in a towel inside his car, investigators said, along with $3,000 cash.

Des Moines Public Schools hired Roberts in 2023 to lead its district of about 30,000 students. Days after being detained, Roberts resigned from his job, which included an annual salary of $286,716.

The indictment alleges that Roberts made a ""false attestation"" on a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Eligibility Verification form, known as an I-9, claiming he was a U.S. citizen when he knew he was not.

Roberts' attorney Alfredo Parrish said his client was not surprised by the indictment and would fight the charges at trial.

""Dr. Roberts intends to enter a not guilty plea because he's innocent of these charges,"" he said. ""Our immigration system, as most Americans understand, is in shambles.""

The district on Friday refused to release the I-9 form in response to a public records request filed by The Associated Press, saying it was a confidential personnel record under Iowa law and also part of the federal investigation. District officials have said Roberts also submitted a driver's license and Social Security card as part of the verification process.

Authorities have said Roberts came to the U.S. in the 1990s and his work authorization expired in 2020. An immigration judge issued a final order for his removal last year after a hearing where Roberts failed to appear, and Roberts' request to reopen the proceedings was rejected earlier this year. Roberts' attorney has argued his client was led to believe by a former attorney that the appeal had been resolved in his favor.

After his detention by ICE, Roberts was transferred to U.S. Marshals custody on Oct. 2 to face a federal firearms charge. Roberts, 54, remains at the Polk County Jail in Des Moines.

In addition to the one in his vehicle when he was arrested, three other firearms were found during a search of Roberts' home, authorities said. The indictment describes the four weapons, including two pistols, a rifle and a shotgun.

The firearms charge carries a punishment of up to 15 years in prison, while the false statement charge carries up to five years.

The Department of Homeland Security has publicized a lengthy criminal history for Roberts, including a 2020 arrest in New York state on a charge of criminal possession of a weapon, details of which have been sealed. He was cited in 2021 for a minor firearms violation in Pennsylvania related to his storage of a hunting rifle in his vehicle.

The fallout from the case has been widespread. The district filed a lawsuit alleging the consulting firm it used during the 2023 superintendent search failed to adequately vet Roberts' background. The firm has defended its work, which included flagging a discrepancy involving a doctorate degree falsely claimed by Roberts on one resume.

State Auditor Rob Sand announced this week that his office will investigate the district's finances in response to an outside request. The move came after the AP reported that Roberts had pushed to award district business to a firm that employed him as a consultant, despite the conflict of interest.

School Board Chair Jackie Norris ended her campaign for U.S. Senate on Thursday, citing the need to lead the district through the crisis. The district is asking voters to approve a $265 million bond referendum next month that would raise property taxes in order to support program and building improvements.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-09/250929-Ian-Roberts-Iowa-School-Superintendent-ICE-se-1226p-bbc5a4.jpg",N,,2025-10-19 06:59:14.886667

These protests have intensified since late September when President Donald Trump invoked Title 10, effectively federalizing and deploying the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

Although the president's order has been challenged in court and temporarily paused—allowing National Guardsmen to be federalized but not deployed—protests persist. KATU witnessed federal officers spray protesters with tear gas.

Counter-protesters were also present alongside outside the ICE facility and then released a few weeks ago.

Portland Police Bureau (PPB) has , while two others have been detained pending investigation, with no clear charges as of now.

KATU crews witnessed one of the aforementioned counter-protesters shoving a woman in an inflatable suit, who was seen crying out in pain as her arm was bleeding.

Federal agents have frequently deployed crowd-control measures such as tear gas and pepper balls at protesters since large gatherings outside the ICE building began ramping up this summer.

Two protesters who were sprayed with tear gas tonight spoke to KATU crews.

McKenna Roberts recounted a moment when federal officers allegedly tackled someone nearby. ""They [unintelligible] someone next to us and tackled him to the ground,"" Roberts said.

They described the experience of being sprayed with tear gas like ""somebody's holding like a flamethrower to your eyes.""

Cheyenne Woods, another protester who was sprayed, expressed concern over the use of force by authorities. ""Honestly, it's nerve-wracking to have our government using lethal weapons and tear gas and chemical weapons towards people who are just out here peacefully protesting,"" Woods said.

They called for the removal of ICE from Portland, citing violations and expressing a desire for action against the agency.

The protests outside the federal building often include people in inflatable costumes. ""Portland's not gonna do it. Portland has never backed down from the b******t of the rest of the country,"" a protester said, emphasizing the city's motto to ""keep Portland weird.""

On Thursday, Oregon Democratic lawmakers have called on the Trump administration to withdraw federal agents deployed outside the facility in Portland, citing concerns over excessive use of force.

But with federal agents still on the streets of Chicago for “Operation Midway Blitz,” city leaders are seeing the limits of some of their stances.
Earlier this month, the mayor signed an executive order banning federal immigration authorities from staging and carrying out enforcement operations on city-owned land.","For the second time this month, federal immigration agents targeted rideshare drivers at O’Hare International Airport despite recent vows from Mayor Brandon Johnson to prevent more raids.

About 9:15 a.m. Saturday, agents were seen detaining rideshare drivers parked in a designated staging area off Balmoral Avenue as they waited for pickup requests, Service Employees International Union Local 1 spokesperson Bailey Koch said.

Koch — whose union is part of a labor coalition seeking to organize Illinois rideshare workers — said she did not immediately have information on the identities or whereabouts of the drivers.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin released a statement saying that Border Patrol agents conducted a “targeted operation near Chicago O’Hare airport parking lots” Saturday morning and arrested 11 immigrants who were in the country illegally. McLaughlin cited criminal histories such as domestic battery and driving under the influence but did not provide their names.

Without their identities, the Tribune could not verify McLaughlin’s claims related to criminal histories.

“The fact of the matter is those who are in this country illegally have a choice. They can use the CBP Home app and receive a free flight and a $1,000 check or they can be arrested, detained, and deported,” McLaughlin wrote.

Border Patrol field boss Gregory Bovino also responded to a user asking “When are y’all going to clean up the o’Hare airport?” on X with: “We arrested dozens of illegal alien ride share operators taking jobs from American citizens out there last week. More to come.”

Koch said the Johnson administration had agreed to provide 24/7 security for the lot to ensure “only people with the correct credentials” could enter, but the mayor’s spokesperson did not immediately confirm that.

Saturday’s immigration raid was the latest flashpoint in a roiling turf war between the Johnson and Trump administrations, the latter of which has been waging a mass deportation campaign in the city — including on airport grounds.

On Oct. 10, Border Patrol officers arrested 18 people at O’Hare, DHS confirmed. Immigration agents also targeted the same staging area for rideshare drivers, known as the Transportation Network Providers “Alpha Lot,” Koch said.

The progressive mayor, for his part, has sought to resist the president’s crackdown via a flurry of executive orders and invocations of Chicago’s sanctuary city policy that bans local police from assisting with immigration enforcement. But with federal agents still on the streets of Chicago for “Operation Midway Blitz,” city leaders are seeing the limits of some of their stances.

Ald. Michael Rodriguez, the mayor’s handpicked Workforce Development Committee chair, said he will be calling Johnson’s team to see what further measures can be taken to prevent another raid.

“The Gestapo efforts by this president have no boundaries,” Rodriguez said. “Quite frankly, they’re doing unlawful things every minute of the day, and here’s another opportunity for them to do that.”

While air traffic and security are controlled by the federal government, airport grounds at O’Hare and Midway International Airport are city property — a fact Johnson pointed out when he condemned the Oct. 10 arrests.

“My administration is working closely with the Illinois Drivers Alliance to ensure drivers are protected, their rights are respected, and that our City property is never used to facilitate unlawful civil immigration enforcement,” Johnson had said in a Tuesday statement.

Earlier this month, the mayor signed an executive order banning federal immigration authorities from staging and carrying out enforcement operations on city-owned land. Johnson also called for criminal charges against agents who violate the order, though it’s unclear how that would play out.

After the Oct. 10 arrests at O’Hare, Johnson spokesperson Cassio Mendoza said the administration believed that because signs laying out the immigration enforcement ban had not yet been installed at the airport parking lot, the administration lacked a legal avenue to pursue against the federal agents for carrying out a raid in the lot. Such signs should be posted in the lot soon, Mendoza said Tuesday.

As of Saturday afternoon, there did not appear to be any such signs in the parking lot.

The Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights urged affected drivers to call its Family Support Hotline.

“These abductions at O’Hare are reprehensible and will only separate working families who were otherwise just trying to make ends meet,” ICIRR deputy director Veronica Castro wrote in a statement. “Citizens and non-citizens alike rely on drivers to get around Chicagoland and this attack is yet another way that the Trump admin’s ICE and CBP escalation is disrupting life for everyone.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/CTC-L-Ohare-uber-ice001.jpg?w=1024&h=633,N,,2025-10-19 06:59:25.731120

The Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025 marks a pivotal transformation in India’s immigration governance. It replaces a fragmented colonial-era regime with a unified, security-conscious, and digitally integrated legal framework. While jurisprudence under the new Act is still evolving, legacy cases and early judicial commentary offer critical insights into its constitutional and procedural implications.

From Fragmented Statutes to a Unified Law

Aspect Old Laws (Repealed) Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025 Framework Dispersed across four statutes: The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920; The Registration of Foreigners Act, 1939; The Foreigners Act, 1946; and The Immigration (Carriers’ Liability) Act, 2000. Consolidated into a single comprehensive Act governing entry, visa, registration, and deportation. Institutional Control No centralized authority; enforcement was fragmented across agencies. Establishes the Bureau of Immigration (BoI) with statutory powers and centralized oversight. Entry & Exit Passport and visa requirements were scattered across multiple laws. Mandates both a valid passport and visa. Entry may be denied on grounds including national security and public health.

Key Provisions and Case-Informed Compliance

Mandatory Digital Reporting

The Act introduces mandatory digital reporting by Indian entities interacting with foreign nationals, reinforcing procedural accountability:

In Abdul Rahman v. State of Kerala (2010), the Kerala High Court emphasized the need for accurate registration of foreign nationals to prevent misuse of long-term visas.

The new biometric and institutional reporting requirements aim to pre-empt such lapses by embedding accountability into the system.

Enhanced Penalties and Procedural Streamlining

The Act codifies stricter penalties for immigration violations, addressing longstanding judicial concerns:

Unauthorized Entry: Punishable by up to 5 years’ imprisonment or a fine of ₹5 lakh.

Forged Documents: Attracts 2–7 years’ imprisonment and fines ranging from ₹1–10 lakh.

Compounding of Offences: Introduced for minor infractions to reduce judicial backlog and promote administrative efficiency.

These provisions respond to concerns raised in Mohd. Zakir v. State of Bihar (1997), where the court highlighted the inadequacy of deterrents under the previous legal regime.

Legal Orders and Emerging Constitutional Scrutiny

Immigration and Foreigners (Exemption) Order, 2025

This Order exempts certain religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who entered India before December 31, 2024, from being treated as illegal migrants.

The exemption mirrors the logic of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, and is likely to face constitutional scrutiny under Article 14.

In Harsh Mander v. Union of India (2020), the Supreme Court admitted petitions challenging religion-based exclusions under the CAA. Similar arguments are expected to surface against this Order.

Immigration and Foreigners Order, 2025 (Foreigners Tribunals)

This Order strengthens the powers of Foreigners Tribunals (FTs), equipping them with authority akin to First Class Judicial Magistrates.

FTs may now issue arrest warrants and detain individuals pending deportation, raising concerns around due process and natural justice.

In Union of India v. Ghaus Mohammed (1961), the Supreme Court upheld the principle that the burden of proof lies on the individual to establish citizenship—but emphasized procedural fairness.

The 2025 Order codifies detention mechanisms that may be tested against evolving standards of habeas corpus protections and administrative discretion.

Conclusion

The Immigration and Foreigners Act, 2025 represents a decisive shift in India’s immigration jurisprudence—centralizing authority, digitizing compliance, and recalibrating enforcement. As judicial review unfolds, particularly around the Exemption Order and Tribunal powers, courts will likely revisit foundational principles of equality, due process, and administrative fairness. These developments will shape the contours of India’s immigration law for years to come.

The protests came as the administration has engaged in a historically unprecedented expansion of executive authority, including the president's use of the military for domestic law enforcement, militarization of U.S. Customs and Border Protection agencies far away from national borders, detention of U.S. citizens without charge and deportations of legal immigrants without due process. Many of those detained have reported being held and transported in inhumane and unconstitutional conditions and members of Congress have complained of not being able to access detention sites.

The administration has also continued to try to withhold money from cities, states and counties that was already appropriated by Congress, as well as empower the president to fire federal employees and reshape federal agencies and departments in ways no other president has.

Similar protests in June recorded about 5 million participants. Saturday's demonstrations were planned in more than 2,700 communities across the nation, according to organizers, which included a broad coalition of formal groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and labor unions, and informal supporters, including the organizations Indivisible and 50501.

Demonstrations in the Bay Area were organized in San Francisco, Oakland, Alameda, Mill Valley, Berkeley, Contra Costa County, and several other cities and communities.

Two large events were San Francisco, including a demonstration at Ocean Beach's Sunset Dunes Park and a march from the Embarcadero to the Civic Center along Market Street.

Across the Bay, thousands of protesters streamed into Oakland's Wilma Chen Plaza just before noon where many held signs, wore colorful costumes, and gleefully chanted a unified message about their dissatisfaction with the Trump Administration.

Attendees laughed at the decorations that poked fun at the administration, but through smiles, people reiterated their concerns that their civil rights were in peril, and said it was their patriotic duty to push back.

Rachael Grail arrived to the march with her friends in inflatable costumes in an effort to spread joy to others.

""The reason we decided to wear these (outfits) is for strategic frivolity,"" said Grail. ""We want to stand for joy and kindness. By wearing these we show that we aren't playing by the same tactics as this administration with hate and fear.""

Several organizations were involved in planning the Oakland event, including the ACLU of Alameda, Alameda Labor Council, SEIU 1021 and the Council on American-Islamic Relations.

Dr. Stewart Chen, a local activist in Oakland's Chinatown, spoke just before people marched to the Lake Merritt amphitheater.

""No Kings Day is not just a march. It is a reminder that power belongs to the people, and we have to fight back,"" said Chen.

After traveling several blocks through downtown Oakland, marchers arrived just after 1:30 p.m. at the Lake Merritt amphitheater to listen to local leaders speak.

Organizers from the activist group the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment set up tables across the lawn and walked around with flyers to get people registered to vote in the November election and vote in favor of Proposition 50, which would redraw California's congressional district lines for the next two election cycles to counter a move by Texas to redraw its districts to create a stated partisan advantage.

Valarie Bachelor, executive director of the Alliance said that, besides the protest, they want people to feel empowered.

""Today, and every time we protest against this authoritarian regime, we are saying Oakland will not be bullied, Oakland will not be broken, and Oakland will not buckle,"" Bachelor said.

U.S. Rep. Lateefah Simon, D-Oakland, railed against the administration during her speech.

""So, to our neighbors here, to our nation and to our collective people I want to be clear that we are, in fact, living in the midnight of our democracy. Those folks who believe they are powerful, they have shut down our government and dared to call it leadership. We say, 'hell no!'"" Simon told the crowd.

Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee said true patriotism was standing up for civil rights.

""We're here today because we are the patriots, not the ones waving the flag tearing down our democracy, but the ones standing up to protect it,"" said Lee. ""We are free people, and we intend to stay that way because in the United States of America, there are no kings. There's only 'We the people.'""

Teresa Salazar with Workers United spoke about the impact immigrants have felt following the increase in deportations and raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""We all have the right to due process and legal representation, which are all currently being denied. We don't need the National Guard or the police,"" said Salazar.

""We are currently fighting the federal effort to open a detention center in our county. We need to make sure that the administration knows that we do not want them and we need ice out of Dublin.""

The San Francisco march on Market Street was organized by National Nurses United, Indivisible SF, and the organization 50501.

Marchers packed Market Street for several large city blocks from the Embarcadero to Pine Street with a mass of people holding homemade signs, some dressed in costumes such as dinosaurs, bears, and the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters. Several had their dogs or children in tow.

Many held American flags and cheered when the San Francisco Police Department offered a brief police escort for the first marchers from their staging point at Sue Bierman Park onto Market Street.

As of about 2:30 p.m., the crowd was so thick many marchers were still waiting for their turn to enter Market Street to begin the march west to the Civic Center.

A spokesperson for the SFPD said the department had deployed additional resources to ensure the city's safety and said the demonstrations had been peaceful as of 3:30 p.m.

""At this time people have been peaceful and spirited in positive ways. We will do all that we can to ensure the safety of all those enjoying our city,"" said Officer Robert Rueca.

The Oakland No Kings rally continued with music and dance performances throughout the afternoon. Organizers continued to call for mobilization in the case the Trump administration goes through with its threat to send national guard troops to San Francisco.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Grijalva until the House is back in legislative session.
Like Grijalva, Romero made history when she became Tucson’s first woman mayor, first Latina elected to the office and the only Latina mayor in the nation’s 50 largest cities when she won her first term in 2019.
CAGES.” “Yes, we want to swear in Adelita Grijalva because we voted for her fair and square,” Romero yells to the crowd.
“I’m so grateful for your continued support,” Grijalva says.","“We love our country. Save our democracy. No kings,” says Davina Martínez, holding a protest sign with a raised brown fist and handwritten words — “RESIST” — in bold red and black ink.

Standing amid rowdy chants and cheers, echoing against the sand-colored walls of a historic Tucson courthouse, Martínez is one of tens of thousands of people— citizens and non-citizens alike — who took to the streets across America on Saturday. They wanted their voices heard at the “No Kings” rallies against the actions and policies of President Donald Trump and his Republican administration.

“It’s not about our people, our education, our public health — We’re in danger with Trump,” Martínez says, as a woman passes by carrying a sign with an American flag, a peace sign and a red heart that reads: “NO KINGS IN THE U.S.A.”

The fired-up crowd at downtown Tucson’s El Presidio Plaza for the rally includes religious leaders, pro-immigrant organizations, grassroots coalitions, labor unions, Democratic officials and families of all ages.

Demonstrators speak in Spanish and English in their borderlands community, where everyone understands when they hear “presente” that it’s a united show of support.

Republicans have pushed back against the rallies calling the protests and protesters un-American.

Organizers say the rallies are a celebration of First Amendment rights to free speech and to assemble in solidarity. Protesters are pushing back against Trump administration policies, including aggressive immigration enforcement that has separated families, ignored due process rights to deport immigrants to foreign jails and ensnared U.S. citizens, as well as sent troops and masked agents into Democrat-leaning cities.

The “No Kings” rally in Tucson stood out from the more than 2,700 planned demonstrations in cities and towns across the nation. In the Southwest state’s second largest municipality, many protesters denounced the Republican-controlled Congress for not swearing-in Congresswoman-elect Adelita Grijalva, leaving thousands of Southern Arizonans without representation in the legislative branch of their federal government.

Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to swear in Grijalva until the House is back in legislative session. Grijalva was elected nearly one month ago in a Sept. 23 special election, making history as the first Latina and Chicana to represent Arizona in Congress.

The race to represent Arizona’s Congressional District 7 — which encompasses a large swath of Southern Arizona and six counties — was spurred by the death in March of Raúl Grijalva, Adelita’s father. He represented the deep-blue district for more than 20 years. Democrats have threatened a lawsuit to force Johnson to uphold the rights of Southern Arizonans demanding representation.

Surrounded by local constituents, Congresswoman-elect Grijalva and Tucson Mayor Regina Romero are standing next to each other. Like Grijalva, Romero made history when she became Tucson’s first woman mayor, first Latina elected to the office and the only Latina mayor in the nation’s 50 largest cities when she won her first term in 2019.

Protesters recognize Grijalva and Romero for having long fought for each other, for Tucsonans, for the rights of immigrants, Latinos and the most vulnerable people in their communities. That matters to Tucsonans cheering as their elected Southern Arizona representatives encourage the crowd to fight for their country’s values of freedom, liberty and justice.

“We’re defending democracy, fighting fascism and dictatorship, and oligarchy,” Romero says in an interview with Arizona Luminaria, before she speaks to the crowd, explaining why she joined the rally. “I want to make sure I let Tucsonans know that I stand in solidarity with them.”

The buzz around Grijalva’s delayed swearing-in ceremony resonates with demonstrators.

Their support turns into a rallying cry as Romero takes the stage. Chants of “Swear her in! Swear her in!” echo through the plaza as people call for an end to Trump-era politics. Grijalva throws a peace sign to the cheering crowd and places her hand over heart, standing in front of signs that say, “VETERANS AGAINST TRUMP.” “RESIST” “NO BANS. RAIDS. CAGES.”

“Yes, we want to swear in Adelita Grijalva because we voted for her fair and square,” Romero yells to the crowd. “We followed the rules. We want her in Congress.”

Invoking the legacy of late Congressman Raúl Grijalva, Romero raises her arm and shouts: “That is what he taught all of us — stand up in the face of power.”

As Grijalva takes the mic, chants of “Swear her in! Swear her in!” grow louder.

“I’m so grateful for your continued support,” Grijalva says. “We know how to fight back. Standing in union and solidarity is what we must do — for those who can’t be here, who are afraid of this administration. People are literally disappearing off our streets. We have to come together as a community and stand up for them.”

Grijalva speaks to the power of those able to show up.

“Thank you to each and every one of you for using your privilege to be here in unity. It’s an honor to be here with my community, my friends — and my mamá,” she says. “We love our community, and we want to make sure that generations from now, they can look back and know we stood up.”

Grijalva shares what many at the rally believe is at stake for their families, friends and their country.

“This administration wants to eliminate every one of us,” she says. “We are the 99%. We must remind them: We are here. We’re not going anywhere. And we’re going to make some changes in this next election.”

Grijalva also reflects on the legacy of her father:

“My dad was unapologetically the most progressive member of Congress. He never stopped,” she says. “When he passed away, I had to make a decision — and that decision was easier because of the support of this community.”

Ending in a steady voice on the strength she draws from those who came before her, Grijalva recalls her grandfather’s words.

“So, when I get to Congress and they try to ignore me,” she says while the crowd boos, “as my Tata would say: No te dejes, mijita. I’m not going to. You elected an Adelita. Adelitas were women soldiers — guardians of the revolution. We are guerreras. And I will keep fighting until we get the representation this community deserves.”

Cecilia Valdez, Chair of the Pima Area Labor Federation — which represents affiliated unions across Pima County — also urges Congress to swear in Grijalva, emphasizing that more than 800,000 constituents are currently without representation.

“My message today is that we’re in a labor organizing crisis,” Valdez says. “We’re facing serious challenges because of the Trump administration, which eliminated nearly a million federal government jobs. That impacts all workers — especially union members.”

Valdez continues as the crowd breaks into chants of, “Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!”

“The fact that Trump is taking from the poor to feed the rich is wrong,” she says “Our federal workers need to go back to work — they shouldn’t be getting fired. They deserve the jobs they have.”

Martínez — the Tucsonan holding a protest sign with a raised brown fist and the handwritten words “RESIST” — is outraged.

“It’s a disgrace. Adelita was elected democratically by the people of Arizona,” she says.

Martínez’s husband, Glen Harelson, is equally furious. Arizona voters’ voices are being silenced, he says.

“She’s our representative — and yet we’re not represented, because she hasn’t been sworn in,” Harelson says. “I don’t like (Trump), his cabinet choices, his policies. It’s all about him, not about the country or our democracy.”

Lidia Godínez and her 10-year-old daughter, Melina Godínez, came to support their community and their country, carrying signs that read: “LONG LIVE REBELLION” and “I CAN’T BELIEVE I HAVE TO EXPLAIN THIS TO ADULTS.”

“To fight for our rights and support our community,” Godínez says. “I have daughters and sons, and I want them to grow up in a world where their voices are heard. We need to keep rallying and protesting because this is what’s right — to show that we care and support each other.”

Melina’s handmade sign in red and blue paint on white posterboard is so big, she holds it just under her chin, over her long black hair and covering her body down to her knees. Her fingers curl alongside the all-caps word: “EXPLAIN.”",https://azluminaria.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PHOTO-2025-10-18-11-09-48-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 02:02:05.394247

Catch up quick: Since Trump launched ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in Chicago last month, an ICE officer shot and killed a man in suburban Franklin Park. Federal agents also swept up U.S. citizens and zip-tied children during a raid on a South Shore apartment building, according to witnesses and local advocacy groups. National Guard troops were dispatched, but a judge's temporary restraining order halted their deployment.

Meanwhile, large Latino areas such as Little Village have seen drastic declines in business as many residents are too afraid to leave the house to shop, or even go to work and school.

Rapid response groups have trained community members in alerting neighborhoods to ICE's presence and families have stepped in to protect students whose immigrant parents are being swept up by officers.

What they're saying: ""When we see ICE, we yell ""ICE."" It's good in a way that we see the way that community has come together to help each other out,"" Isis Espinoza of Ashburn told Axios at Saturday's march.

""The livelihood of places like Little Village has gone down. It's depressing to see it, because, where is the Hispanic essence in the heart of the Hispanic essence of Chicago?""

The events were part of a national “No Kings” day of protest, the second one since President Donald Trump took office in January. A coalition of progressive and labor groups organizing the national day of action say the demonstrations are in response to “the increasing authoritarian excesses and corruption of the Trump administration, which they have doubled down on since June.”

In Chattanooga, crowd size was estimated at around 3,000 attendees, but protests weren’t limited to Tennessee’s large cities, as small towns like Tazewell and Pikeville in East Tennessee and Union City in West Tennessee held events.

Grandson of immigrants worries about economy, due process

Mike Ondek of Nashville wore an inflatable chicken suit to attend the capital city’s protest, held on the grounds of the Tennessee Capitol. His parents immigrated to the U.S. from Slovakia and he said he’s concerned about the Trump administration’s immigration policies, deployment of National Guard troops to U.S. cities and a lack of due process for those being deported.

But the economy is also on his mind.

“I don’t like what’s going on and I’m supposed to be retiring this year and I have no idea what’s going on with Medicaid, the economy,” Ondek said. “I lost so much last time the economy tanked with my 401(k) and built it back up but there’s so much uncertainty.

Immigrant ancestors, fears for the future spur Nashville turnout

Many attendees of the Nashville No Kings event said they were motivated to protest by their fears of fascism, referring to ancestors who fought for the U.S. or to worries about the world their children and grandchildren will inherit.

John Kelty, 65, of Nashville said he is “haunted by the ghost” of an ancestor, also named John Kelty, who fought with George Washington during the Revolutionary War.

“It’s a lot easier to start this up now than for our grandchildren to have to face this when they grow up,” Kelty said, noting he also had seven uncles who fought against fascist regimes in World War II. “We are at the beginning of a fascist takeover.”

Friends Mike Minggia and Crow Lee Belcher expressed similar sentiments.

“(Republicans) love to say our country is divided,” said Belcher, a U.S. Army veteran and artist “This administration is doing everything it can to divide us. They’re not hiding their intentions so we’re not going to hide either.”

“The three branches of government aren’t working,” Minggia said, adding that he fears the U.S. is heading towards fascism. “The Republican government has capitulated to what Donald Trump wants.”

Claire Meneely and John Spragens attended the event with their daughter, Iris, 7, who was holding a sign featuring singer-songwriter Dolly Parton.

“We don’t want Trump to be king because he can be mean to a lot of immigrants and he kicks out a lot of immigrants,” said Iris Spragens, who said she wished Parton were president. “I think (Parton) would make this a better place.”

Retired physician Clay MacConnell, who attended with his wife, Wendy, said he is deeply concerned about Trump’s cuts to the nation’s science and health care infrastructure, including the Centers for Disease Control.

“I’m here for our grandchildren to protect their future, because the way it’s going, I’m scared,” MacConnell said. “I’m scared the education that my grandchildren are getting won’t be the real history.

Wendy MacConnell had thoughts about the Trump administration’s portrayal of No Kings day.

“They’re trying to whitewash this to make it seem like America doesn’t want this — but look around, look around at all these people,” she said.

Tennessee Highway Patrol arrests 71-year-old protester in Monroe County

An East Tennessee woman was arrested Saturday during a No Kings protest and booked into the Monroe County Justice Center.

Anna M. Grabowski, 71, of Ten Mile, was charged with obstructing a highway/passage and failure to obey a law enforcement officer, a Monroe County Sheriff’s deputy confirmed. Bond was set at $5,000: friends and supporters of Grabowski raised money to pay her bond and she was released from jail at 6:30 p.m.

Wesley Kile, one of the approximately 40 people participating in the No Kings protest, said he, Grabowski and two other people were protesting at the same location — on the shoulder of the road adjacent to a bridge — earlier in the month and were told by a Highway Patrol officer, a Monroe County Sheriff’s deputy and a Sweetwater police officer they were allowed to be there.

Grabowski ran as a Democrat for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 2024 and 2016, losing both times to incumbent Republican Rep. Dan Howell of Cleveland.

No other arrests have been reported from the 33 No Kings events across the state.

In Memphis, a peaceful protest as federal task force continues to make arrests

One day after Shelby County officials, including Mayor Lee Harris, and state lawmakers from Memphis filed suit against Gov. Bill Lee over what they allege is unconstitutional deployment of Tennessee National Guard troops to Memphis, an estimated 7,000 gathered at Poplar and Highland Park.

Memphis has become a focus of Trump administration law enforcement activities and is one of three cities in the nation — Chicago and Portland are the others — with National Guard troops deployed to allegedly deter crime.

The Trump administration remains deeply unpopular, and the No Kings protests have the potential to push that unpopularity to new heights.","Last Friday, new talking points were seemingly rolled out across the MAGA sphere. Top GOP leadership, from House Speaker Mike Johnson to Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, began seeding a narrative about today’s “No Kings” protests.

Rather than describing them for what they are — First Amendment-protected rallies where millions of Americans are expected to peacefully stand against the Trump administration’s unconstitutional, authoritarian, and un-American agenda — Republican leadership is framing the upcoming demonstrations as “Hate America” protests. Party leaders also called the gatherings “terrorist” and “Soros-funded” events that would be filled to the brim with “the antifa crowd, the pro-Hamas crowd, and the Marxists.”

This trial-balloon messaging is meant to get ahead of what organizers say could be one of the largest days of mass protest in U.S. history, with events planned in every state. Millions of Americans are projected to attend some 2,500 rallies to oppose the illegality and immorality of the Trump agenda, the destruction of hard-won civil and constitutional rights, and the fascist ambitions of the MAGA movement. Republican leaders are attempting to preemptively cast this protest within the framework Stephen Miller has been working to aggressively mainstream since the assassination of Charlie Kirk, where all who oppose the extremist MAGA agenda are “domestic terrorists.”

To their credit, Democratic and Independent leaders responded quickly. Sen. Bernie Sanders issued a statement pointing out that the No Kings protests are protected under the First Amendment and, contrary to right-wing smears, protesters are standing up for American values. Former Republican and now Independent Joe Walsh called out the GOP’s attempt to vilify half of the American electorate as “shameful” in a post on Twitter and urged his followers to attend the protests, emphasizing that his former party is “scared to death” of the looming rallies.

It’s true: MAGA is terrified of the specter of massive nonviolent protest — and for good reason. Nothing threatens their agenda more than millions of ordinary Americans mobilizing to put a face to the opposition.

The Impact of Images of Dissent

The administration has been working overtime in recent weeks to vilify and alienate its opposition, painting Democrats and left-leaning activists alike as violent extremists. With their media footholds and tight messaging discipline, they’ve had some success in painting a picture of a fictional, widespread antifa threat, which is already serving as a pretext for the Trump’s administration’s Justice Department to file terrorism charges against its foes.

But pictures are louder than words or soundbites. Even small-scale protests, like the inflatable frog demonstrations against ICE in Oregon, have resonated widely and effectively negated MAGA’s breathless portrayal of Portland as a city under siege by any forces other than the National Guard.

By making visible both the magnitude of opposition to MAGA’s authoritarianism and the everyday relatability of the Americans who are taking a righteous stand, the No Kings rallies pose a real PR problem for the extremist right. They puncture the narrative fictions that the MAGA movement has been working so hard to construct and undermine the credibility of their messengers. They also force GOP leaders into the awkward position of explaining why a large swath of the American public, from every walk of life are, supposedly “domestic terrorists.”

Mass nonviolent protests also effectively jolt the disengaged public to pay attention. Americans understandably tune out of day-to-day politics to focus on their immediate sphere; they’re overwhelmed, exhausted, and cynical about politics. But moments of mass protests, when millions are in the streets, are hard to ignore. They generate news coverage and powerful images that serve as irrefutable proof that all is not well, and there is widespread opposition to the regime’s agenda. Critically, they also remind us that we’re not standing alone.

The Persuasive Power of Protest

Protests as evidence of widespread defiance also reach far beyond the American public. They resonate with international audiences and key decision-makers in places like the Supreme Court, the military, and other institutions that may soon be in a position to decide if they will further comply with the administration’s demands.

Political scientists Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan’s widespread research on the power of nonviolent protest spells out how protest and institutional compliance impact one another. In their findings, they identify that once 3.5 percent of a country’s population is engaged in sustained nonviolent protest, authoritarian regimes find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their agendas. That’s because visible protest from large swaths of the population signals a deeper opposition throughout society, including within the very institutions and constituencies an authoritarian regime needs to enforce its will. Widespread public resistance makes obedience — and the carrying out of unconstitutional orders — exponentially harder.

And even for those sitting on the fence, mass protest is among the most powerful tools of persuasion available. The Trump administration remains deeply unpopular, and the No Kings protests have the potential to push that unpopularity to new heights.

Throughout U.S. history, mass protest has driven some of our most consequential shifts in public opinion. Mass protests were critical in building public support and shaping beliefs to win core democratic advances, including civil rights, the social safety net, and women’s suffrage. Sociologist Charles Tilly distilled the key qualities that make mass protest persuasive, popular, and durable. His framework offers four key elements for a successful movement: worthiness, which hinges on the credibility of the participants; unity, which refers to the cohesiveness of the messages; numbers, or the size of the protest; and commitment, or ability of those involved to persevere.

Scholars later added a fifth — diversity — to assess the breadth of who is represented. Together, these elements correlate strongly with a movement’s legitimacy, its ability to inspire bystanders to join in, and its power to influence elites and institutions.

The last time this full constellation appeared in the United States was during the overwhelmingly peaceful George Floyd protests. It may be hard to remember in this moment of revisionist backlash, but that massive, multiracial, and persistent protest moment powerfully shifted the national conversation on systemic racism. In the summer of 2020, nearly 1 in 5 Americans named race relations as the country’s top concern, and a majority recognized systemic racism as a societal problem. That surge in public consciousness and moral urgency around ending systemic racism was so persuasive and enduring that it drove Democratic voter registration and helped propel Joe Biden to victory in the 2020 election.

Through this framework, we can clearly understand the threat the MAGA regime sees in the No Kings protests: Millions (numbers) of everyday Americans (worthiness) from all walks of life (diversity) standing together (unity) for the second time (commitment) for core American values and constitutional and civil rights pose an existential threat to authoritarian ambitions. It is a potential turning point — one that could accelerate the erosion of support for MAGA’s political project, grow the pro-democracy movement that opposes it, and sow seeds of doubt within the administration’s ranks.

Fascists Fight Back

Around the world, authoritarians are wising up. In their research, Chenoweth notes that globally nonviolent movements are meeting less success than in decades past, as regimes coordinate with each other and devise new strategies to curtail their impact, such as controlling the flow of information and working to outright criminalize protest. It’s happening in the US, too: The Trump administration is keenly aware of the potential for mass nonviolent protest to shape public sentiment, which is why it is moving quickly to undermine and dismantle all infrastructure for opposition and organized dissent.

The primary MAGA crony behind this effort is White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller. Miller has made abundantly clear that he intends to dismantle his political opposition by forcing the narrative that any opposition to his agenda should be tamped down using the full power of the state. He recently seized his opportunity to create a new designation of domestic terrorism to justify the investigation, dismantling, and defunding of oppositional civil society.

The administration is moving forward with plans to weaponize the IRS and so it can be used to launch criminal probes into left-leaning philanthropic and civil society organizations. Trump acolyte Sen. Ted Cruz has introduced legislation that will make it easier to charge organizations that fund or support public mobilization with RICO charges, and just this week he invoked No Kings as one reason to pass the bill.

The administration hasn’t been shy about the groups it wants to target first. Trump himself has said he wants to go after his enemies on the left. A shoddy report from the conservative nonprofit Capital Research Center, which is believed to be a guiding document for the administration crackdown, cites mass-mobilizing groups like Indivisible, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the youth-led Sunrise Movement as “inciting terrorism.” It’s no accident that among MAGA’s first targets are organizations that have the strongest track records of nonviolently mobilizing the American public at scale and facilitating media-friendly protests that can move public opinion. Getting rid of organizations that empower Americans to participate in legible nonviolent mobilization is a great way of ensuring that the conceptions of the opposition that reach the public are those that feed the MAGA narrative of a deranged left.

That is why mass public opposition is so vital now, before this crackdown fully takes hold. This is a crossroads moment for our country, and the media should give these protests the coverage and consideration they deserve.

When the attacks against the civic sector organizations that support and anchor mobilization do come, they must be called out for what they are: as nothing less than efforts to stifle free expression, crush the First Amendment, and silence dissent.",https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2222872800-e1760731242438.jpg?fit=5000%2C2500&w=1200&h=800,N,,2025-10-18 23:01:56.115049

The gathering remained peaceful, with attendees holding signs saying “defend democracy” and “no kings.” Ferguson’s speech focused on defending democracy against authoritarian threats and protecting public health.
“Despite the challenges we’re facing as a country, no state in the country, no state in the country, is doing more to stand up to this administration and this autocrat than Washington state,” Ferguson said.
He brought up the West Coast Health Alliance, a public health alliance formed by 15 Democratic governors that Washington state joined.

Bob Ferguson struck a defiant tone at the No Kings day rally in Everett, Washington, where thousands of people attended on Saturday.

“As governor, I promise you one thing above all else, we will never, ever under any circumstances, bend the knee to this autocrat,” he said of President Donald Trump.

In Everett, roughly 4,000 people attended the demonstration, according to Snohomish County Indivisible, the event organizers. The gathering remained peaceful, with attendees holding signs saying “defend democracy” and “no kings.”

Ferguson’s speech focused on defending democracy against authoritarian threats and protecting public health.

In his remarks he cited a letter U.S Attorney General Pam Bondi sent to him in August which threatened to withhold federal funding and prosecute elected leaders if they failed to cooperate with immigration enforcement.

“I can sum up the response letter with two words, hell no,” Ferguson said.

Ferguson said democracies die by a slow, steady erosion of civil liberties and free speech, a gradual consolidation of power in one individual, and prosecuting political enemies with criminal charges.

“Despite the challenges we’re facing as a country, no state in the country, no state in the country, is doing more to stand up to this administration and this autocrat than Washington state,” Ferguson said.

He brought up the West Coast Health Alliance, a public health alliance formed by 15 Democratic governors that Washington state joined. This alliance is aimed to protect public health by breaking away from the guidance of the Trump administration and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.

“Robert, that guy’s a crank, right?” Ferguson said. “Unfortunately, he’s in charge of public health for our country.”

Anita Dietrich, founder of Snohomish County Indivisible, described the actions of Trump as reckless, corrupt and more dangerous than ever.

“They want us silent while they target immigrant families, while they strip our rights, shred our schools, hand our future to billionaire cronies and act like kings above the law,” Dietrich said. “But America has no kings, not now, not ever.”

The first No Kings day was held in June and drew hundreds of thousands of people to the streets. It was one of the largest protests in Seattle’s history and in Olympia, over 5,000 people attended.

In the demonstration on Saturday, people began to gather around 12 p.m. near the Snohomish county courthouse in Everett. The official event with speakers began around 1 p.m.. and finished shortly after 2 p.m. once it started raining.

In Olympia, meanwhile, an estimated 4,000 people, some in costume and most toting signs emblazoned with personal political messages, attended the rally at the state Capitol.

Seated on the steps of the Capitol and Temple of Justice, they cheered loudly as David Reaves, senior pastor of New Life Baptist Church in Lacey, proclaimed to the “architects of mischief, your time is up.”

“This is a call to the real America. Hold onto hope and protect it fiercely,” he said, imploring attendees to commit to be actively engaged. “Whatever you do, damn it, do something,” he said.

These are citizens.” Michigan Advance Editor-in-Chief Jon King and Freelance Reporter Erick Diaz Veliz contributed to this story.","As the administration of President Donald Trump continues to usher in anti-democratic policies, turns federal agents against migrants and begins a crackdown on any resistance against his administration and its policies, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on Saturday across Michigan to join in the nationwide No Kings rallies.

More than 100 communities from southeast Michigan to the westernmost part of the U.P. joined in the show of might to advocate for civil rights, democracy and the rule of law. The protests were expected to attract millions of people nationwide to speak out against the Trump administration since he took office this year for a second term.

At Michigan’s Capitol building in Lansing, the show of resistance was palpable.

For over an hour before the official start to the event, people gathered on the Capitol lawn. Several demonstrators greeted their friends and family with hugs while taking pictures with rally signs. Over that hour, the size of the protest grew from a small crowd to a group that nearly reached the edges of the front lawn.

Like other protests against the administration documented earlier this month, many wore costumes, which ranged from various inflatable animal suits to robes from The Handmaid’s Tale. Security for the protest was pronounced, with several Michigan Department of State Police troopers in tactical gear and road patrol uniforms on the lookout for threats.

As the crowd grew, cars and trucks driving by honked in support throughout the event. Some waved flags, held up signs or played loud music, and most were met with cheers and applause from demonstrators along North Capitol Avenue.

Just before a series of speakers began, various songs of resistance played over the loud speakers, including “Holiday” by Green Day, which was met with cheers from the crowd.

Several signs identified demonstrators as veterans, teachers and union members. Some protestors spoke of their concerns about Trump’s narratives on free speech, including his claim that he has ended free speech over flag burning, and some expressed worries about detentions and deportations by ICE.

Others, especially older protestors, spoke about their fears for the future for younger generations – wanting their children and grandchildren to live in a country where they were free to protest.

“We must commit ourselves, each and every one of you, all the way back to the streets to never, ever [give up],” Lansing-based community activist Lorenzo Lopez said in one of several addresses at the event. “We have to continue to resist, and we must never, ever let this country become a dictatorship.”

Speaking directly to the administration’s use of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to terrorize the immigrant community and enact its sweeping mass deportation policies, Lopez said it amounted to human trafficking.

“My fellow Americans, the mass deportations are not deportations at all,” he said. “When people are [detained] without due process, that’s called kidnapping. When they are sent to another country against their will, that’s human trafficking.”

Throughout the speeches, chants of “Release the files” and “Lock him up” permeated the crowd, especially in reference to Trump’s felony convictions in early 2024.

The rally started at 3 p.m. and was scheduled to run until 6 p.m. However, impending poor weather and gloomy skies ended the event early. As one organizer put it in a final speech, those who have been paying attention to the excesses of the Trump administration and its authoritarian tendencies have heard all the complaints before.

Now, however, was a time for action. As the crowd moved away from the Capitol lawn, thousands marched east down Michigan Avenue. They continued to chant, saying: “Donald Trump has got to go.”

Cars and trucks driving through downtown Lansing continued to honk in support of the demonstrators who took to marching, a line of people that stretched across the bridge into the city’s Stadium District and beyond.

State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) attended the rally in their district. They said it was a clear sign of solidarity and community building, and was bigger than the first No Kings rally held in June. With the Trump administration’s actions veering further into autocratic territory, the representative was also reflective on the moment, and the fight to retain the core tenets of the nation’s democratic values.

Michiganders show up across the state to oppose Trump policies and say ‘No Kings’

“If this isn’t a statement as to what we should do next, it is a statement that we have a community and we have resistance that is ready to push back,” Dievendorf said. “This rally was remarkable, in part, because the average person has reason to be afraid and to feel there might be consequences for dissenting right now. And yet we showed up anyway. I think that we’re starting to understand that silence is not going to get us out of this. The only way to fight fascism and to get our democracy back to a stable place is for us to have a united front in favor of rule of law and the Constitution.”

There were very few agitators or those launching counterprotests at the Lansing event, which ran counter to a warning from a GOP official who on Thursday claimed there would be problems from left-wing trouble makers at the event. At least one report of a counterprotester showed a peace keeping unit ushering him out of the crowd with little resistance otherwise.

On Thursday, Oakland County GOP Chair Vance Patrick warned in a bizarre statement issued in a vague email that left-wing agitators were planning to infiltrate and derail Saturday’s protests in Michigan. He specifically called out the Democratic Socialists of America.

The political party was indeed there at the Lansing rally, one of several political party vendors at the event, simply talking to voters about the issues of the day.

Among them was Sam Nelson, co-chair of the Greater Lansing DSA. Nelson said the event was certainly about mobilization, but it wasn’t a strike or a show of civil disobedience.

“It’s about putting out the calls. Everyone can come out and stand with hundreds of thousands, even millions, across the country,” Nelson said. “Yes, this is a rally, and rallies are about as peaceful as you can get when it comes to political demonstration.”

Instead of drumming chaos that didn’t exist, Nelson posited that the GOP in Michigan should look inward and denounce the young Republican group chats that were recently unveiled in news reports, which showed young party organizers shared slurs and violent political rhetoric.

“Then they can talk about peaceful discourse,” Nelson said.

Detroit, Flint, Ann Arbor and beyond

Rallies in other parts of the state also saw large crowds with thousands willing to exercise their rights to free speech while those rights still remain intact.

Among the larger No Kings rallies was at Roosevelt Park in southwest Detroit, where thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds began arriving just before 3 p.m., holding up signs in Spanish and English as they stepped out of their cars or buses, including “America has no kings,” or “No National Guard in Detroit.”

“The people united will never be defeated,” were one of the main chants heard around the crowd.

State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, applauded the courage of the protesters and told the Advance she hoped that more protests like this one will continue

“It is encouraging, I know protesting might be intimidating, but it is a good way to stand up and fight back. We have an opportunity to stay together and raise our voices against Donald Trump and his administration.”

After rallying at the park, demonstrators then peacefully marched down Michigan Avenue, although there was at least one arrest when a counter-protestor and supporter of President Trump, Andre Williams, 24, was taken into custody by Detroit Police after he followed No Kings marchers and reportedly began to scuffle with demonstrators and force his way into the crowd before being handcuffed and placed in a squad car.

At the Ann Arbor demonstration earlier Saturday, resident Angela Williams, 91, sat among the several hundred demonstrators at Veterans Park and told the Advance that while she had lived through many turbulent times, this felt different.

“I have feared for our democracy before, but I’ve always felt that the three branches of government were independent. And now I’m very disturbed by the lack of independence,” Williams said.

In Flint, among the several thousand demonstrators who turned out to the city’s No Kings rally was former U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Flint), who told the Advance the crowd itself stood as a rejection of the characterization from Trump and his administration that participants were violent extremists.

“This is dissent. This is a group of people who are just everyday citizens. I’ve run into people that I went to elementary school with, not people that I’ve met along the path of political activism that has defined my work until now, but people that I haven’t seen for years, neighbors, old friends. These are citizens.”

In recent appearances in a Univision forum and in the final debate of the campaign, Ciattarelli promoted not a path to citizenship, as immigration advocates have pushed for years, but what he called a “pathway to recognition,” which he later described as a first step toward citizenship.

It's a high-stakes gambit in one of two states with governor's races this year — Virginia is the other — but it's rooted in Trump's improved performance among Latino voters last year. In New Jersey, for example, Trump flipped two Hispanic-majority towns where he had lost by more than 30 percentage and 50 percentage points, respectively, in 2016. While the state typically votes Democratic in Senate and presidential election years, and Trump has lost it in all three of his White House runs, it has swung back and forth between parties in odd-year contests for governor.

Ciattarelli's more lenient stance toward some immigrants emerges amid Trump's all-out effort to increase deportations, even among those with no criminal record beyond violating immigration laws. Ciattarelli has softened his position in some respects, but he also has made clear that he wants New Jersey law enforcement officers to cooperate with federal immigration officials.

Sherrill, a congresswoman in her fourth term, has hammered Trump throughout the race, casting herself as a bulwark against the administration. But she has not made immigration a campaign emphasis.

Ciattarelli navigates the delicate politics of immigration

Ciattarelli, who served in the state Assembly and in local office before that, had been critical of Trump during the run-up to the 2016 election. While serving in the Legislature, he supported a bill that provided for in-state tuition for certain immigrants without lawful status.

In the governor's race, he has aligned himself with Trump on at least some of the president's immigration policies. Ciattarelli has also said that, if elected, his first executive order would be to repeal the state's Immigrant Trust Directive, which prohibits police from cooperating on civil immigration enforcement matters. He also has expressed opposition to giving birthright citizenship to children born to immigrants who are living in the U.S. illegally.

During a debate with Sherrill last week, Ciattarelli said he agreed with Trump that anyone with a “history of criminality” should be deported, as well as anyone who “committed a crime or scam.” But he broke with Trump slightly when he said: “I believe that everyone else should be put on a pathway to recognition.”

In front of Spanish-speaking audiences, Ciattarelli has boasted of supporting in-state tuition to students without lawful status, a practice that has been targeted by the Trump administration.

“I do not believe that anyone should be living in the shadows. If we’re giving you a pathway to recognition, that to me starts with some form of government issued ID including driver’s license,” Ciattarelli said in the Univision forum, fielding translated questions in Spanish from New Jersey residents, which he answered in English.

Why does it matter?

Ciattarelli is hoping to reach a key constituency in the state, where Trump cut into Democrats' edge with Latino voters in 2024, as he did across the board in New Jersey. Voter unease about the economy is sure to be central to that effort.

New Jersey Democrats, too, have largely shifted their focus to the economy and driving down costs with polls showing inflation was a top concern among Hispanics. About 1 in 5 residents in New Jersey are Hispanic, according to the census.

Trump lost New Jersey last November to Democrat Kamala Harris by just 6 percentage points — a shift from his nearly 13-point deficit to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Among Latino voters, Trump's support went from 28% in 2020 to 43% in 2024, according to AP VoteCast, a wide-ranging survey of the 2024 electorate.

How the shift sits with Republicans

Republicans who enthusiastically embraced the president's crackdown on illegal immigration may disagree with Ciattarelli's views, but many still back him.

“There are certain people it might deter,” said Ed Durr, a former state senator and Ciattarelli's primary foe who now backs him. “There are hard-liners who are going to see that as acquiescent to the Democrats.”

Still other Republicans say his policy looks good compared with the position taken by leading New Jersey Democrats. Mario Kranjac, another former primary opponent in the governor's race who has embraced Trump, invoked Sherrill, U.S. Sens. Andy Kim and Cory Booker and U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer.

“Mikie, Cory, Andy, Josh and their fellow Democrats support sanctuary cities and illegal immigration which foster crime and unnecessary expense,” he said. “While Jack doesn't.”

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on claims by Ciattarelli that he would be able to work with the Trump administration to exempt deportations of people without criminal records.

Outside a campaign stop at a pizzeria earlier this week, Ciattarelli repeated that some people should not be deported and should instead be brought out “from the shadows.” A request to the campaign to clarify how he reconciles his position with the president’s was not answered.

'He is pretending to care'

Sherrill reacted to Ciattarelli's “pathway to recognition” with skepticism.

“That’s not really a real thing. That doesn’t confer any status to anyone,” she said during the debate. She has promoted her background as a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted criminals, in addition to her work on federal legislation to create opportunities for citizenship.

She summed up their difference this way: “At the end of the day, he’s always going to do what Trump tells him to do.”

Asked repeatedly if she would keep the Immigrant Trust Directive in place, Sherrill has said only that she would enforce the law.

Patricia Campos-Medina, a labor activist who is advising Sherrill, said Ciattarelli is trying to “sound compassionate” toward Latinos who are increasingly worried the Trump administration is scaling up its actions against immigrants and affecting Hispanic businesses as a result.

“He is pretending to care about immigrants and be compassionate, but he is not giving you facts,” Campos-Medina said. “We all should be asking, ‘How are you going to protect data from the Donald Trump machine? New Jersey already recognizes immigrants. How are you going to keep that promise?’”

Standing among hundreds at the “No Kings” rally outside the Manchester Center in Fresno, she said it was time for her to speak out in support of immigrants amid escalating ICE activity across the country.

“I’m out here today because I’m seeing how this administration is destroying our democracy and dividing us, ignoring the Constitution,” she said. “Immigrants are not the enemy, and anyone who is out here supporting our First Amendment rights is not the enemy.”

Thousands of protesters gathered peacefully Saturday near the Manchester Center at Blackstone and Shields avenues in Fresno, and along the Clovis Old Town Trail near Shaw and Clovis avenues, as part of the growing nationwide “No Kings” movement. The rallies voiced opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration raids, the government shutdown and what protesters described as authoritarian tactics used by federal agents, among other things.

“I want basic human rights for all. I want respect for all, and I want Trump out of office,” said Ayse Kblemet, a protester outside the Manchester Center who also joined the rally in response to the ongoing government shutdown. “Trump has to stop bullying the Congress and blaming Democrats. It’s a terrible and inappropriate look for an elected official to place undue blame on other elected officials. Everyone should be getting compensated for their work.”

At both locations, demonstrators waved American and Mexican flags, held up handmade signs reading “No Kings,” and chanted slogans demanding accountability from government leaders. Phrases like “Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” and “The people united will never be divided” echoed from the busy Fresno intersection and the scenic trail in Clovis, drawing honks and cheers from passing cars and cyclists.

The rallies were organized by local nonprofits, community organizers and labor unions, including the May 1st Coalition and the National Union of Healthcare Workers. They followed large “No Kings” protests in June.

Singleton Papendick, a Clovis mom, organized the rally along the Old Town trail with a small team of volunteer safety coordinators by her side.

“The number one thing for me, and from what a lot of people who I’ve talked to have discussed, is exercising our free speech, the First Amendment right,” Papendick said. “To peacefully assemble is huge, and I feel like right now this administration is attacking and using not truthful rhetoric about who is trying to get out and protest and speak their minds.”

The Manchester Center protest drew a diverse crowd of students, families, and longtime activists who lined the sidewalks near one of the city’s busiest transit corridors.

“A good portion of my family has had history with ICE, so it’s just bringing up a lot of bad memories. They’re not willing to come out right now because they’ve been through it,” said Angel Sanchez, a protester at Manchester Center who was holding up a sign that read “More Reformation, Less Deportation.”

“They’re always telling me to be careful and to stay safe,” she said.

The Fresno Police Department was out patrolling the area of Manchester Center during the ‘No Kings’ demonstration that brought thousands to the event. Officers were out to make sure the demonstration was peaceful and that people remained on the sidewalk and away from the median on Blackstone Avenue, near Shields.

“We have flexed additional personnel to work the area,” Fresno police Lt. David Madrigal told The Bee. “Our patrol efforts are to maintain high visibility as well as enforcement action if needed. We have been working with the event coordinator to establish event guidelines. Our officers are also monitoring any potential counterprotests. Overall, we expect a safe event where people can demonstrate peacefully.”

Police said 25 citations were issued; four warnings were given; one vehicle was towed for reckless driving, and six misdemeanor citations related to vehicle code were issued.

In Clovis, the demonstration spanned part of the Old Town Trail’s east side near Shaw, a normally quiet stretch that became a hub of chants and music throughout the afternoon. Though typically seen as a more conservative part of the region, Clovis organizers and attendees said they were motivated to show that resistance to federal overreach isn’t limited by geography.

“I feel like somebody needs to stand up and say we still believe in human rights, and truth, and freedom from oppression and just basic decency,” said Carly Oliver, a protester in Clovis. “I wasn’t sure if there would be as good of a turnout, but Clovis is showing up.”

The Manchester Center protest drew thousands of participants at its peak, while the Clovis event saw 600-1,000 people join in throughout the day. Both protests remained mostly peaceful, and there was little visible counter-protest at either site. Although in Clovis, some drivers yelled “Trump” out of their windows and flipped off protesters.

Nelson Esparza, who represents District 7, which includes parts of central and east Fresno, was seen at the “No Kings” protest at the Manchester Center. He later participated in a kids Halloween event at a parking lot in the area.

“I thought people came out in full force from all over the community. Blocks and blocks and blocks were crowded with attendees,” he said. “It really reflects the angst, the frustration, the anger with this current administration that our country is having to endure. Fundamentally what we’re all seeing is the erosion of our democracy.”

Congressman Jim Costa and former state assemblymember Juan Arambula were also spotted at the Manchester Center rally.

The rallies in Fresno and Clovis are two of more than 2,500 protests that took place across all 50 states today, putting it on track to surpass the demonstrations held on June 14 that mobilized millions of people in over 1,500 cities.

The protests take their name to declare that America has no kings. “The president thinks his rule is absolute,” the group’s website says. “We won’t back down against the chaos, corruption, and cruelty.”

About 15 protests were scheduled around Alabama, part of over 2,600 demonstrations scheduled on Saturday that were expected to draw millions of people. Speakers and participants criticized the administration’s seizure of power; its arrest and detention of immigrants and its policies toward health care. Others said Trump administration policies were hurting members of their families.

The protests were largely peaceful, with no major incidents reported.

A similar round of protests were held in June and drew millions of people to 1,500 sites nationwide. About 14 of those protests were held in Alabama that day with thousands of people in attendance.

Crowd sizes varied, from about 40 people in Selma to up to 2,000 in Birmingham. Here are reports from four of the protests on Saturday.

Birmingham: Calls for community and activism

A crowd of approximately 2,000 people gathered in Railroad Park Saturday for Birmingham’s “No Kings” protest, hearing from speakers including former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones before peacefully marching along a seven-block parade route, carrying signs and engaging in call-and-response chants while drivers honked their horns in support.

“We’re here today, like so many more that have come to Birmingham before us, not just for a No Kings rally but for civil rights, for anti-war protests, you name it, to speak out about injustices when they see it,” Jones told the cheering audience that filled the park’s pavilion and spilled onto a hillside beyond it.

“We’re here because, ‘Freedom is a fragile thing, and it’s never more than a generation away from extinction,’” he continued, quoting Ronald Reagan’s 1967 inaugural address as California’s governor. “Two hundred and fifty years ago, this country was born of one thing that every American generation has reaffirmed: no kings.”

Attendees hailing from Birmingham and surrounding suburbs and towns cited concerns about human rights and vulnerable people, including the poor and immigrants, threats to democracy and freedom of speech, and opposition to President Donald Trump’s policies as reasons they came to the rally.

“I thought it was very important that we come out and that we show, really, as a country, how we feel about what’s going on in our government, how oppressive it is, and that we’re saying, ‘No,’” said DeValerie Williams of Birmingham. “We’re saying, ‘No, we love our country. We want our country to stay a democracy, where we care about each other. And I think the only way to do this is for us to be a show of force.”

In her remarks to the crowd, Rev. Julie Conrady of the Unitarian Universalist Church of Birmingham said the city redefined freedom and equality in 1965.

“Over and over in the history of our country, we, the people, have been the necessary checks and balances to ensure that our country continues to progress, improve and prosper,” Conrady said.

She encouraged people to get involved in local causes.

“There is not a lot we can do at the federal government right now,” Conrady said. “One party controls all three branches of government, and one despot’s marching orders control them all. Our resistance must focus locally and statewide, where together, we can make meaningful change.”

Quoting the words of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson, who called the No Kings protests a “hate-America rally,” attendees and speakers at the Birmingham event said they wanted to correct such misunderstandings.

“There’s a lot of people in this country who care passionately about what’s going on with the current administration and all the corruption and all the lies, taking people’s health care away and giving tax breaks to the rich,” said Greg Fuller of Birmingham. “I think it’s un-American. I think it’s not patriotic. And I think this group is full of people who love America, not hate America, as the speaker said.”

Idania Gonzalez with the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, told the crowd to look around them because the rally is what community looks like.

“This is what power looks like when people stand together for the same cause, when people stand together for our neighbors who are scared to come out, for our neighbors who are living in the shadows due to political fighting,” she said.

Comedian Rebecca Rothman gave rally goers a primer on how to contact their U.S. representatives and then demonstrated it by calling Sen. Tommy Tuberville’s office and leaving a message. She gave the crowd time to make their own calls and encouraged them to place five calls a day.

Candra Bethune of Birmingham said she’s going to do that. Attending the rally made her feel better, even though things are bad, she said, because before she didn’t know what she could do as one person to make a difference.

“We’ve got to do something to let them know that we don’t want this,” Bethune said.

Montgomery: Warnings about federal policy changes

More than 600 people gathered in downtown Montgomery for the city’s “No Kings” rally.

“The kind of change that we are trying to achieve is not the kind of change that happens fast,” said Tabitha Isner, vice chair of the Alabama Democratic Party, who spoke at the rally. “This is the kind of change that requires we keep showing up. The last time we showed up, we were a good, decent crowd, but this time we are bigger. The next time we show up, we will be even bigger.”

The protest, which began at Riverfront Park, featured people dressed in makeshift costumes displaying dinosaurs and squirrels and others who adorned themselves with colors of the rainbow. Many carried cardboard placards replete with crowns that were crossed out with the words “No Kings” on them.

At 9 a.m. the crowd then marched a quarter mile to the Court Square Fountain, a site where enslaved people were bought and sold prior to the Civil War, to hear from speakers who urged them to continue the public outcry, and who criticized nearly every aspect of Trump’s policies, from mass arrest and deportations of immigrants to tariffs on trade, as well as the budget bill that Congress passed at Trump’s urging that cut funding for social service programs.

“No king, no crowns, no thrones, only love, because violence is not just bullets and bombs,” said Rev. Valtoria Jackson, Montgomery lead organizer for the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign, said in a speech. “Violence is when people cannot afford a house, violence is when a voter cannot afford medicine, violence is when mothers continue to lose sons and daughters to greed and guns. Violence is when the rich get tax breaks and the poor get evicted.”

Jackson has spoken at numerous gatherings before to raise awareness of the budget bill recently passed by Congress and the potential expiration of expanded tax credits for Affordable Care Act plans that could drive up insurance costs around the nation. The loss of those credits has been a major reason for the ongoing federal government shutdown. The budget bill also reduced funding for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program that provides food subsidies to lower-income families and individuals. The bill passes more of the cost of maintaining the programs to the states, and advocates had been warning that the bill could reduce the state’s economy by more than $1 billion and eliminate health insurance coverage for almost 200,000 people.

“Our food pantry participation has gone up 200% since he passed this bill,” said Rev. Manuel Williams in an interview following the event, pastor at Resurrection Catholic Church in Montgomery. “These are people who never had to come and get food assistance, but now they are food insecure.”

Others voiced strong opposition to the administration’s efforts to deport large numbers of immigrants living in the U.S.

“One of my biggest things is the ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) raids, the deportation of people who are just trying to live,” said Haley Morgan, who attended the protest. “They are getting deported for a taillight being out, or for speeding. If that is the case, deport me because I have sped and my taillight has been out.”

Many of those who gathered also expressed reservations about Trump’s efforts to reshape the federal government.

“I wanted to help protest against all that Trump is doing,” said Judy May, 87, who attended the rally. “He is destroying the constitution. He is trying to take away our right to vote, our rights of free speech. He is firing so many people, taking so many important departments to pieces. He is destroying the Department of Education, he has destroyed the public health department, I just hate everything he is doing.”

Oxford: ‘We are American people who love our country’

Over 200 people gathered along the roads of the Oxford Exchange to protest the Trump administration Saturday under the “No Kings” name.

Protesters of all ages stood along the highway holding signs condemning President Trump for being what they describe as a dictator, demanding the release of the Epstein files and condemning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

“I’m here today to express my displeasure with the current administration. There are many things being done wrong. I couldn’t even name them, it wouldn’t fit on a sign,” Jim Baker, organizer of the demonstration, said. “I hope somebody hears our cries and our anger and does something about it.”

One protestor said she came to stop the government from continuing the way it is now.

“Things are really scary right now, and if somebody doesn’t say something, and if we don’t keep pushing back, then everything is just going to keep moving in the direction it’s moving. And even if it’s stopping things an inch then it’s worth it,” protestor Cami McKenzie said.

Others just want the government to hear them and their opinions.

“Our government isn’t listening to us. The government is meant to serve us, not control us. So I think it’s important that we stand up before we lose our rights,” protestor Pam Howard said.

Baker said he felt like he was alone when it came to standing up for issues such as healthcare, LGBTQ+ rights and ICE raids.

“It makes me extremely happy that there are this many people in the state of Alabama with the same mindset that I have,” Baker said. “I’ve lived here for 21 years, and for 21 years I thought I was on an island.”

And some of these issues are personal to the ones protesting.

“I have four biologically born female daughters, and two are gender non-conforming, so I’m really bothered by a lot of the talk about trans individuals and stuff,” said Glenda Reeseg.

Alanna Gregg, another protestor, said these issues affect everyone.

“You should be ashamed of yourself if you don’t care,” she said “It shouldn’t have to happen to you for it to matter to you.”

And Baker made it clear that protestors are just regular people who want better for everyone in the country.

“We are not Antifa, we are not insurrectionists. We are American people who love our country and don’t like the direction that it’s going and that’s why we’re here today.

While the overall response from non-protesters was mostly positive with many honking their horns in support of the cause, there were a few that began to heckle the demonstrators.

Halfway through the protest, a small group of Trump supporters stood across the street to heckle the “No Kings” demonstrators. A heated verbal exchange ensued but was quickly settled.

But protesters didn’t let the rude comments from the group dampen their spirits.

“They have every right to be there and we’re fighting for their rights too,” Howard said.

Howard also commended younger people for being at the protest, and not to let anyone deter them from using their voice.

“One thing I want to say to young people is don’t let anybody tell you that your vote doesn’t count. Voter turnout is one of the biggest issues we have in Alabama,” she said. “If you want to see things change, that’s how we change it.”

Selma: ‘We can see each other’

Laurie Kelly and her husband, who live in Chicago, were traveling to the Gulf of Mexico for a beach vacation. Kelly said she asked her husband to find somewhere to stop to protest.

“If we don’t show up, it’s over. This is very important. It’s small, but it’s still here and that does matter,” Kelly said in an interview. “People need to stand up. That’s what I’m trying to do. It’s all I can do.”

The couple joined about 40 people gathered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge Saturday afternoon for a local No Kings protest.

The Selma protest was the second for some. Jasie Shepard and Dr. Justin Cavanaugh traveled to Selma after the Tuscaloosa No Kings protest ended Saturday morning, about a 90-minute drive.

Nate Bradley and his friends came to Selma after the Montgomery protest ended this morning. He said he is protesting because of President Donald Trump’s disregard of Congress’ power of the purse.

“Now we have a president who says, ‘I’m not going to fund Democrat programs.’ What does that mean?” Bradley said. “He wouldn’t be able to articulate a thought about that. It’s insulting.”

Bradley said the protests in Montgomery and Selma gave him hope.

“I call my representatives, I go to my townhalls,” Bradley said of what he does outside of the No Kings protests. “I just try to stay sane and find a balance between staying sane and keeping up to date with the nonstop deluge of things that this administration is doing or not doing.”

Annie Pearl Avery, a long-time civil rights activist, urged people to protest every day.

“It’s not going to be a lot of show and a lot of talk. There’s going to have to be some action,” Avery said. “You’ve got a purpose. Everyone has a purpose.”

Rev. Leodis Strong, lead pastor at Brown Chapel in Selma, criticized Republicans who claim to be Christian, but do not show it in policies.

“How can you call yourself pro-life when you did not give access to insurance to soon-to-be mothers and soon-to-be children outside the womb? How can you call yourself pro-life when you take away WIC and SNAP?” Strong asked. “That is a polluted religion.”

Jennifer Wright, who recently moved to Selma from Huntsville, criticized Congress for not releasing investigative files related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. She urged people to write letters and call their representatives. She also wrote a thank you letter to U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Kentucky, for his petition to release the files.

“Every member of Congress should have happily signed your petition because child sex trafficking should not be considered a partisan issue and should be considered a crime by everyone,” Massie read.

The petition was one vote short of the 218 it needed to pass in September.

Azali Fortier, 18, said the protest gave her a glimpse of hope.

“I know that they can see us because we can see each other,” Fortier said of the Trump administration and Congress. “We’re about to undergo a big change, either for better or for worse.”

The protest wrapped up with Yomi Goodall leading the group singing “America the Beautiful” and “We Shall Overcome,” a Civil Rights Movement anthem.

So far, no response from either agency, but Leo Martinez is OUTFRONT now in his first national interview since the incident.
The ICE agents in the SUV, you then sort of seem to be driving in circles as we can watch this.","BURNETT: Breaking news, we have new video just into OUTFRONT and we’ll show it to you. What you’re looking at is ICE agents in an unmarked vehicle slamming into a U.S. citizens pickup truck. So that’s what you actually watch happening here. So that is an ICE agent in that car. The pickup truck is the American citizen.

Leo Martinez is an immigration rights volunteer in California. He was driving through the neighborhood monitoring ICE activity, which he had been doing for months before that. The agents who have been involved with ICE raids knew who he was.

But in this case, everything was different. Agents rammed his truck and then they took him into custody. The incident ignited outrage and protests. Martinez was hospitalized after that car rammed into him. Later, after that, they booked him into a detention center. Of course, he’s an American citizen.

CNN has reached out to both DHS and ICE repeatedly since yesterday. So far, no response from either agency, but Leo Martinez is OUTFRONT now in his first national interview since the incident.

And, Leo, I really appreciate your taking the time. I’m glad you’re okay.

When we watch that footage and we’ll play it again. But you’re in the pickup truck and then you’re rammed, and I know you have dashcam footage of all of the time leading up to that actual moment as well. The ICE agents in the SUV, you then sort of seem to be driving in circles as we can watch this. Can you explain to me exactly what was happening here?

LEO MARTINEZ, U.S. CITIZEN & IMMIGRATION RIGHTS VOLUNTEER DETAINED AFTER CRASH: Yeah, this was the first time in all the months that we’ve been doing this that the agents turned on us being legal observers, we keep our distance, we keep our safe distance to keep tabs on where they’re at. But this is the first time that they turn their aggression towards us and really started coming after us. So that’s something new. I was trying to stay away from them is why we

were moving in circles, because they kept following me and moving towards me. And once they hit me, I knew that it was a — it was a new ball game and we were going to have to deal with this a little differently in the future, because now they have no problem with — they’ve already pulled guns on us, they’ve already done a multitude of things, but one thing is coming after us in their vehicles.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/a1KvYhB80xALZaszpcCuVg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02Mjg7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mediaite_845/bd46fbe1ce52953098d6ebfb6f4b8ca9,N,,2025-10-18 19:58:25.563497

Thousands of people attended the protests in Cathedral Square Park on Saturday, with many donning costumes and inflatables, inspired by protesters in Portland who sought to emphasize the peaceful nature of the protests. Organizers estimated the turnout at around 16,000 people.

“We came out because it’s our right and it’s our privilege and that’s what Americans should do when you disagree with what’s going on,” said Bryan Lorentzen, a 72-year-old from Franklin. ""You need to make that verbal, just like we did during the Vietnam War.”

Lorentzen and others said they joined the nationwide protests to oppose President Donald Trump, who they say is acting like a monarch rather than the leader of a democracy.

Since his election, Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement, sent National Guard troops into several Democratic-controlled cities, made massive changes to American health care and eroded First Amendment rights, critics say.

In February, the White House shared an image on the social platform X mimicking a ""Time"" magazine cover depicting Trump wearing a crown, with the words ""Long Live The King"" at the bottom.

Lorentzen, who attended the protest dressed as Santa Claus, carried around a sign that said “I know who is naughty.""

His former colleague, Hayley Kleppin, who was dressed as an elf, thought the costumes helped diffuse tensions.

“You can’t detain Santa,” Kleppin, 29, of Greenfield, said.

Oct. 18 marks the second round of No Kings protests across the country. The first was held in June, when millions marched against the Trump administration nationwide. Milwaukee's June event drew an estimated 10,000 protesters.

The No Kings protests are organized by a coalition of progressive groups, including Indivisible, Public Citizen, MoveOn, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Human Rights Campaign and Working Families Power, along with multiple unions and grassroots groups like 50501 that formed in response to Trump's election.

Andy Guss, a co-leader of Grassroots Menomonee Falls, said around 20 groups planned the Milwaukee event.

Around 2,500 rallies were planned across the country as part of the Oct. 18 protests, compared to 1,800 in June.

“People need to see that they’re not alone and that that there’s other people here that think like they do,” said Guss, 42. ""We’re not scared. Everyone here takes courage to be here.”

Demonstrators cite immigration, health care, free speech as key issues

JoAnn Vetter, 75, said she skipped her granddaughter’s soccer game to attend the protest because she wants to ensure her granddaughter has a future. She was wearing the hooded robe and wide-brimmed bonnet from “The Handmaid's Tale.”

Vetter said she wanted to speak out against the repression of women and the erosion of due process, the constitutional right to fair treatment by the government.

She said she fears every day for her son-in-law, who is from Colombia, even though he’s a U.S. citizen.

“That he could be stopped and harassed and injured without any due process,” she said.

Galen DiDomizio, who works in the medical field, brought his 2-year-old daughter to the protest, carrying her on his back. He said he was protesting the administration's attacks on doctors and vaccines.

Trump has made numerous false claims about vaccines, including the discredited theory that they cause autism.

""We all have a responsibility to stand up for what's right and tell the government what they're doing is wrong,"" DiDomizio said. ""That's why I'm here, that's why my whole family is here.""

The event drew criticism from some Republican elected officials in Wisconsin.

U.S. Rep. Tony Wied, R-De Pere, described the protest as the ""Hate America Rally"" on his social media pages, while U.S. Rep. Derrick Van Orden called it a ""Election Denier Fest.""

Clay Norrbom, 50, is a small business owner in Madison. Norrbom, who describes himself as generally moderate, said this was the first time he has been worried about “government truly overreaching and starting to intrude in our day-to-day liberties,” including targeting law firms and news media.

""Now we have to worry about whether the government is going to cancel a contract, or is going to come after a law firm that I’ve worked with — maybe come after me, because I’ve spoken up today,"" Norrbom said.

Protests underway in dozens of cities throughout Wisconsin

More than 60 protests were scheduled throughout the state, including in Madison, Green Bay, Appleton, Shorewood, Greenfield, Brookfield, Waukesha, Cedarburg and Oconomowoc.

In Green Bay, retired teacher Ann Larscheid, 81, said she was supporting her friends marching in the protest from the sidelines.

“Green Bay doesn’t have a reputation for being very liberal, so seeing that a significant part of the population is making a joyful noise about all this stuff, it makes me very proud,"" she said.

In downtown Madison, Doug Green, 75, and Chris Carlsen, 69, both said they attended the protest because they’re worried for their grandchildren’s future.

Green said he protested the Vietnam War when he was a college student, and both participated in the 2011 protests against Gov. Scott Walker’s signature Act 10 legislation, which effectively ended collective bargaining for most public employees.

They each have granddaughters, one a women’s rights attorney and another a college student.

“I’m afraid of losing their health care, the watering down of education and just all civil rights being taken away from them,” Green said.

Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell was among the speakers at the Madison rally. He said his greatest concern is about separation of powers in the federal government.

Mitchell focused his remarks on Martin Luther King, Jr.’s famous 1963 letter from the Birmingham Jail.

“The time is now to act,"" Mitchell said. ""Not to wait for another election, another season, but to really use all our collective voices to inspire change. If not now, I don’t know when will be the time.”

Around 1,550 people attended the No Kings demonstration in suburban Brookfield, according to 78-year-old Carl Lock, who is a part of Brookfield Resist, the group facilitating the event.

Lock, 78, said the laundry list of issues he is protesting include Trump's “disregard” for the Constitution, his use of the Department of Justice and military to go after political enemies, and his treatment of immigrants.

“We love America,"" Lock said. ""We just hate the administration that has taken over.”

Beto O’Rourke joins protesters in Austin to 'win back people power in America'

and

Reporting from Austin, Texas

Former Democratic Rep. Beto O’Rourke joined protesters in downtown Austin, Texas, saying he “could not be more proud to stand and march with my fellow Texans today.”

He emphasized that the gathering was “clearly peaceful” and called out Gov. Greg Abbott for mobilizing the National Guard for any potential unrest.

“I don’t think Greg Abbott or Donald Trump are interested in the rule of law or the U.S. Constitution or peaceful protests,” O’Rourke told NBC News. “They would rather intimidate. They seek to control and they’re trying to cement authoritarian power nationally and right here in Texas. But the antidote to all that is the 20- to 30,000 people who have shown up so far at the Capitol.”

He said today’s protest is to stop authoritarianism and “win back people power in America.”

“When the president sends the National Guard into the streets of American cities, when he sweeps our fellow Americans up off the streets by masked plainclothes agents without badges or identification or warrants, when he illegally disbands agencies and departments that were created by Congress or defies federal court orders — I mean that contravenes everything that every American has ever sworn an oath to, the Constitution has ever stood or fought for,” he explained.

He called Trump’s deployment of the National Guard to cities including Los Angeles and Chicago an example of fascism.

“I was just in Germany last week, and the No. 1 question from members of the German parliament, the Bundestag, and press and civil society is, ‘What the hell is going on in your country? You guys, America, you saved us from fascism at the end of World War II. How in the world can it be rising in your own country today?’” he recalled.

Rally in D.C. mixes celebration and concern over Trump policies

and

Reporting from Washington D.C.

At today’s No Kings Day rally in Washington, D.C., protesters cheered, danced to pop music and wore inflatable Halloween costumes. But that celebratory atmosphere was tempered by fear.

Rallygoers expressed fear that the United States is sliding toward autocracy, as President Donald Trump fires federal workers and masked ICE agents ramp up immigration arrests.

“I’m pro-American. I’m pro-Constitution. I’m pro-law and order. I’m pro-immigration, legal immigration. I’m pro-First Amendment rights. I’m pro-free expression. All of that is under assault,” Robin Brown told NBC News. “I’m 66 years old tomorrow. I never thought in my life that I would be here with a dictator in the Oval Office. So I’m here to say no to that.”

Brown is from the New York City area but lives in Mexico.

Taren Peterson from 1199SEIU, a union that represents hospital workers in Maryland and Washington, D.C., said some members are not showing up for work because they fear ICE arrests.

“That’s more work on one individual, which means that potentially we could have infections go up because you can’t clean properly because you have to rush through it,” she said. “I’m not saying that is what is happening, but that is the potential impact of what not having the appropriate amount of staff inside of the building could look like.”

Protester Tara Reel, a former federal worker who was dressed like a crying Statue of Liberty, said that several of her friends were too scared to attend the rally.

“They’re afraid of persecution. They’re seeing these images on television of what ICE are doing around our country, that there’s this militarization that’s happening in our states, and I think they’re afraid for their safety. They’re afraid for their freedom,” she said.

The rally was overwhelmingly peaceful, with protesters pushing back against Republican claims that they hate America.

“I love America, and I think everybody here loves America, and that’s what we’re here to, you know, really express,” Maci Huber-Hopper said.

“We all love our country so much. That’s why we’re fighting so hard for it, because we know it’s important,” her friend Anna Hall added.

Thousands gather in Austin, focusing on democracy and women’s rights

Reporting from Austin, Texas

On the ground in Austin, Texas, there are no signs of unrest or National Guard presence. Organizers and reporters estimate that more than 10,000 demonstrators are making their way across the lake from the Texas Capitol.

Conversations with the crowd highlight concerns over the rule of law and democracy, as well as women’s rights and abortion access, which remain key issues in Texas.

The atmosphere so far appears peaceful and energetic, with protesters calling for accountability and protections for civil liberties.

NBC News has not independently confirmed crowd size.

Protesters form human banner urging 'Yes' vote for Prop 50

Demonstrators at a No Kings protest in San Francisco formed a human banner urging California residents to vote ""Yes"" for Proposition 50.

The human banner, created on the city's Ocean Beach, reads: ""No Kings. Yes on 50.""

Proposition 50 was proposed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to redraw congressional districts in the state. The measure was introduced in response to redistricting happening in other states that favor Republican lawmakers in Congress.

Californians will vote on the measure on Nov. 4 during a special election.

Protester: 'They are taking away our civil rights'

Reporting from Washington D.C.

Laurel Beedon, 79, and Deborah Chollet, 75, attended the rally in Washington, D.C., together, telling NBC News they protested against “a group of people who hold up the Constitution but clearly have not read it.”

“They are taking away our civil rights,” Beedon said.

Beedon pushed back against Republicans who she said were calling today’s rallies “socialism,” telling them to “look in the dictionary and define socialism, please, and communism, please.”

“And then look up fascism,” Chollet chimed in.

“Yeah,” Beedon answered. “Look up who you are.”

Reporting from Chicago, Illinois

Madonna Walsh, from LaGrange, Illinois, joined today’s No Kings protest in downtown Chicago, carrying a poster that compared immigration deportations to concentration camps.

“The rise of authoritarianism today is a repeat of what happened in the 1930s in Nazi Germany, and I don’t want it to happen here,” she said. “I did some research on what Hitler was doing in the 1930s and compared it to what Trump has been doing in office in January and the similarities are mind-blowing.”

Andy Thayer, an activist handing out signs that said “ICE OUT!” told NBC News, “Most Chicagoans don’t want ICE here.”

“I’m angry — what’s happening to my neighbors, my husband is second-generation Latinx. I fear for my neighbors. If you don’t think it’ll affect you, but at some point or another, they will get around you. They are arresting citizens,” Thayer sid.

Rachel Mason and Anton Ford came out to protest with their daughter. They said they were motivated to join because “ICE is in our neighborhood.”

“Children are afraid to go outside because ICE is around. It’s crazy — SUVs no license plates outside of schools,” they said.

A teacher named Yabira, who declined to share her last name, joined the protest to let her students know she supports them. She became teary-eyed as she said she prays for her father, a construction worker, to come home every night.

Trump administration mocks congressional Democrats on social media amid No Kings protests

Some parts of the Trump administration have taken to social media to make digs at congressional Democrats during the No Kings protests.

The White House posted on its official X account a photo appearing to spoof a cover of The New Yorker magazine, titling it “NY king of sombreros,” superimposing a photo of Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., wearing a sombrero.

Separately, a social media page associated with the Department of Transportation posted what appeared to be an AI-generated cartoon of Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., dressed as Disney princesses, captioning it “No Kings!!”

Spokespeople for Jeffries and Schumer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, or questions regarding whether they have any concerns that such posts could violate the Hatch Act, which restricts political activities by federal employees.

Similar posts by the White House broke down negotiations between Republicans and Democrats early on in the government shutdown, after Trump posted an altered video of Schumer and Jeffries with fake audio and portrayed Jeffries in a cartoon sombrero.

Bernie Sanders slams billionaire class at D.C. rally

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont called out the tech billionaires who saw “huge increases in their wealth and power” since Trump became president.

“Yes, I am talking about Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg and the other multibillionaires who were sitting right behind Trump when he was inaugurated,” Sanders added. “The very same billionaires who funded his campaign, who have bestowed gifts upon him, and who have seen huge increases in their wealth and power since Trump took office.”

Sanders went on to criticize the administration for the recent indictments of those he declared his political enemies.

“Our country is in danger when we have a president who threatens to arrest or imprison political opponents who stand against him, including the attorney general of New York state, a sitting U.S. senator and the governor of California,” Sanders said.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren says protests are patriotism and slams Trump as a bully

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren addressed thousands of protesters gathered on the Boston Common for the No Kings rally.

Pushing back on some congressional Republicans who labeled the demonstrations ""Hate America"" protests, Warren said the gatherings reflect core American values.

""Hundreds of thousands of people protesting peacefully for what they believe in? That is deeply American. That is patriotism,"" she said. ""Standing up to a wannabe dictator? That is patriotism. Peacefully protesting to protect our democracy? That is patriotism!""

Warren called the president ""weak"" and ""a bully,"" and accused congressional Republicans of lacking courage. ""Not a single one of them has a spine,"" she said.

""When we don’t bow down to kings or bullies, they start to lose their power,"" she said. ""So now is the time for us to say it clearly: Do we bow down to kings? Do we bow down to bullies? Do we bow down to Donald Trump? No, the American people do not bow down.""

Boston Mayor Michelle Wu said in a brief interview with NBC Boston that it was ""amazing to see so many people"" protesting.

""This is a community and a city where for 400 years we have done everything we can for freedom in this country and to set the course for generations to come, to have every opportunity,"" she said. ""And this is a moment where a lot of people feel that the administration in the White House is doing everything they can to undermine that sense of safety and belonging, and the progress that we’ve made, so we’re going to keep going in Boston.""

Sen. Chuck Schumer joins No Kings protest in New York

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted on X that he marched with labor unions and others at a No Kings protest in New York City.

Clark Furey, 40, attended the protest in Washington, D.C., accompanied by his dog, Scooby, saying he joined because ""I don’t even recognize what’s happening in this country.""

Furey told NBC News that he grew up in New York in a Republican family. “I actually came down to D.C., worked for College Republicans, always considered myself, sort of, center-right,” Furey said. “And then no longer. Just a slow degradation and then it just fell off a cliff.”

He said he is concerned about the Pentagon's recent decision to refuse credentials to reporters who didn’t sign a pledge to abide by new rules for members of the press.

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker addresses protesters in Chicago

Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker struck a defiant tone as he addressed protesters in Chicago, where high-profile clashes between residents and federal immigration authorities have taken place in recent weeks.

""History will judge us by where we choose to stand right now, today. Future generations will ask: 'What did we do when fellow human beings face persecution? When our rights were being abridged? When our Constitution was under attack?'"" he asked. ""They'll want to know whether we stood up or we stayed silent.""

Pritzker added that ""resistance starts with refusing to normalize cruelty.""

""Resistance means choosing solidarity over fear and means recognizing that an attack on free speech, on immigrants' rights, on due process is an attack on everyone’s rights,"" he said. ""It means understanding that we’re either building a society based on human dignity or one based on domination.""

Pritzker noted that the ""vast majority of Chicagoans are here because our ancestors fought to escape from tyranny, and another great portion of Chicagoans were brought to this country in shackles and had to fight for their literal freedom.""

""Resistance and survival are in our American blood,"" he said.

Mikie Sherrill and Andy Kim rally voters in New Jersey at No Kings event ahead of governor's race

Reporting from Montclair, NJ

Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill, her party’s nominee for governor, called on attendees to vote in just over two weeks.

“New Jersey is not a red state. New Jersey is not a purple state. New Jersey is a blue state,” Sherrill said, leading the crowd to chant, “When we vote, we win.”

“We’re gonna fight it tooth and nail,” Sherrill said of Trump’s agenda.

“We know at every level this president is raising costs on people,” Sherrill said, highlighting her proposals to address the state’s high cost of living.

Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., also spoke at the rally, sharply criticizing congressional Republicans. “We do not have right now three functioning branches of government,” he said, adding that House Speaker Mike Johnson is acting more like a Trump Cabinet official than a separate branch leader.

“It’s a historic moment in this country,” Kim said, referencing the late Rep. John Lewis, who often said history is “shaped by those who are up.” He called on attendees to support Sherrill as New Jersey’s next governor in November.

Jessica, 44, and Andrew, 56, of Washington said they joined the protest today because they’re “really upset” and “really scared” about the state of the U.S. today.

Andrew, who declined to share his last name, said that he was fired from the federal government earlier this year when the Trump administration cut funding for his former employer — USAID.

He said that in Washington, there are thousands of people “who are extremely patriotic, extremely dedicated to representing the United States here and abroad in really positive ways, in Christian ways, who are, you know, gone, out of jobs.”

“It’s a tragedy,” he added.

Fired USAID worker says D.C. protest is a 'double duty'

Reporting from Washington, D.C.

Amanda Nataro, 41, of Washington, D.C., told NBC News that for protesters, attending the rally is ""double duty"" — standing up against the Trump administration while also working to ""protect our home rule.""

""The common adage,"" Nataro said, ""is that 50% of the country voted for this. But 50% of the country didn’t vote for a government shutdown and the dismantlement of the government and services that people rely on.""

Nataro added that she was let go from USAID in July, joining thousands of federal workers who have been let go since the start of the Trump administration.

""It’s really devastating on all fronts,"" she said. “And it’s really important to not sit back and let this happen.""

Bill Nye declares 'No thrones! No crowns! No kings!' at Washington, D.C. protest

Bill Nye, known by his legions of fans as ""Bill Nye the Science Guy,"" compared President Trump to King George III — who ruled the United Kingdom during the loss of the American colonies — during an address to protesters in Washington, D.C.

The beloved children's show host also slammed Trump and the members of his cabinet for failing to accept ""basic scientific facts."" This presumably refers to a myriad of changes within the Department of Health and Human Services.

""They do not promote the progress of science. They suppress it, to the detriment of our health, well being, and international competitiveness,"" he said. ""It is a formula for failure.""

""No thrones! No crowns! No kings!"" Nye added.

First-time protester fueled by 'extreme frustration' attends D.C. demonstration

Reporting from Washington D.C.

Robin, 62, from Centreville, Va., traveled with some of her neighbors to Washington for the No Kings protest today. She decided to come out “to come to a community of people that have the same feelings about what’s going on with our government right now.”

Robin, who declined to share her last name, told NBC News that this is the first protest she’s attended and she was driven to attend by “extreme frustration.”

Her neighbor, Suzanne, who also declined to provide her last name, said she is “angry” at Trump and at Congress for not holding “Trump and his cronies” accountable.

“I’m just really feeling like, it’s at least something I can do to really utilize my First Amendment right,” Suzanne said. She also expressed frustration with Republicans on Capitol Hill this week who called No Kings protesters as “anti-patriotic.”

Sens. Bernie Sanders and Chris Murphy headline rally in Washington, D.C.

Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Chris Murphy of Connecticut were among the political headliners at the No Kings rally in Washington, D.C. Other speakers include journalist Mehdi Hasan, science educator Bill Nye and American rapper Oddisee.

Murphy addressed the crowd, calling Donald Trump ""the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America.""

""The truth is that he is enacting a detailed, step-by-step plan to try to destroy all of the things that protect our democracy: free speech, fair elections and independent press, the right to peacefully protest,"" Murphy said. ""But the truth is he has not won yet. The people still rule in this country.”

The D.C. event began at 12 p.m. and is scheduled to run until 2 p.m.

White House economist Kevin Hassett dismisses No Kings protests: They 'make no sense'

and

National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett weighed in on the No Kings protests, calling the demonstrations misguided and arguing that they prove the very freedoms protesters claim to defend.

""President Trump has said himself that he’s not a king,"" Hassett told Fox News in a wide-ranging interview today. ""Obviously everyone’s letting them protest, that’s what America is all about, is proving that there isn’t a king, right? And so what they’re doing makes no sense.""

Other Republicans have similarly denounced the rallies as unpatriotic.

NYPD will fan out 'across the city' today

The NYPD emphasized its ""zero tolerance"" policy for illegal activity associated with No Kings protests.

""The NYPD will be out across the city to make sure everyone can peacefully and safely exercise their first amendment right,"" the post said. ""As a reminder, there will be zero tolerance for any illegal activity or anyone who breaks the law.""

Chicago No Kings rally organizers denounce ICE actions

and

Reporting from Chicago, Illinois

Organizers of Chicago's No Kings rally say today's demonstration carries special meaning in the city, driven by frustrations over the conduct of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents involved in the Department of Homeland Security's ongoing immigration enforcement campaign, dubbed ""Operation Midway Blitz.""

“ICE is occupying our city. They are attacking our neighbors with tear gas. They are indiscriminately snatching people from streets and businesses and homes,” said Kathy Tholin, a board member of Indivisible Chicago, which is organizing a rally expected to draw thousands in downtown Chicago, and more than 30 others in surrounding suburbs.

President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court to immediately allow the deployment of National Guard troops here in Illinois, saying they are needed to protect federal agents carrying out immigration enforcement.

“We are coming together on No Kings Day to say, ‘No, this is not the city we want to live in.’ I’m looking at the cruelty and the violence against Chicagoans, and I’m just completely outraged,” Tholin said. She added that she is not aware of any protesters who are being paid to attend, as some Republicans have claimed.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., referred to the protests as “the hate America rally.”

Tholin responded directly: “What is more American than standing up to protest against policies and programs that you don’t agree with?”

What happened on the last No Kings day of nationwide protests

Today's No Kings protests come after the movement's lastnationwide demonstrations in June — the same day that Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota and their spouses were shot, killing two of them.

Those protests coincided with Trump's military parade marking the Army's 250th anniversary. As rallies unfolded across the country that day, Democratic lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were fatally shot in their home, and Minnesota state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded, also in their home. A 57-year-old Minnesota man was charged in what authorities described as acts of targeted political violence.

Officials tighten security

Officials in several states are boosting security ahead of today’s nationwide No Kings protests, warning that violence or property damage won’t be tolerated.

In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin said he’s activated the National Guard to support police “to help keep Virginians safe.” Texas Gov. Greg Abbott also ordered state troopers and Guard members to Austin, calling the demonstration there “antifa-linked” and pledging to “deter criminal mischief.”

Austin Police Chief Lisa Davis said officers will safeguard protesters’ right to assemble and that the department’s “Dialogue Police Team” will be on site to assist demonstrators.

In Philadelphia, officials announced road closures and parking restrictions for a large march from City Hall to Independence Mall and urged attendees to expect delays and sign up for safety alerts.

Authorities in all three states said they are coordinating with federal partners to monitor potential disruptions.

No Kings organizers say millions will join protests against Trump's 'authoritarian power grab'

A coalition of leaders for the No Kings protests said in a press conference this week that millions of Americans are expected to join more than 2,600 demonstrations nationwide to protest what organizers called ""authoritarian power grabs"" by the Trump administration.

The leaders insisted the events will be peaceful and lawful, contrasting them with what they described as ""lawless actions"" by the federal government. They urged participants to exercise their First Amendment rights despite what they view as intimidation tactics, including threats of National Guard deployments.

Organizers called the protests a show of unity in defense of democracy. Deirdre Schifeling of the ACLU said protesting is the ""most patriotic and American thing you can do.""

‘The cavalry is coming’: Indivisible predicts massive ‘No Kings’ turnout

Today's demonstrations are happening against the backdrop of a nation in conflict. Congress is at a standstill amid a government shutdown. Trump ordered National Guard deployments to California, Illinois, Oregon and Washington, D.C., against the wishes of local elected officials. Immigration agents are aggressively carrying out arrests in cities across the country, and videos showing clashes, sometimes violent, with residents and protesters have followed.

In the run-up to the upcoming marches, Republicans have pressed forward with messaging that attempts to cast the marches as made up of dangerous hate groups on the left. At the same time, the Democratic base has expressed its dissatisfaction with its party leadership.

The event on Oct. 18 drew 5,000 people or more according to early estimates from state police. Attendees voiced opposition to Trump's immigration detentions, his effort to redraw Indiana's congressional boundaries to favor Republicans and what protesters view as attacks on free speech.

Immigration took center stage during the first half of the roughly two hour rally, with speakers criticizing the Trump administration's immigration raids, which have led to the detention of more than 170 U.S. citizens, according to ProPublica.

Karla López Owens of the Indiana Democratic Latino Caucus, who is also a deputy Marion County prosecutor, said her family immigrated from Mexico with nothing.

“I have always felt welcome here,"" she said, ""but things are different now.""

Danielle Cooney of Live Free Indiana railed against Marion County Sheriff Kerry Forestal for housing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, detainees at the county jail. Earlier this year multiple Indianapolis City-County Council members criticized Forestal, a Democrat, for, in their view, actively supporting Trump's mass deportation.

Protesters also expressed anger at what they see as erosions of free speech. Suzanne Swierc, a former Ball State University employee who was fired for a critical social media post she made about conservative activist Charlie Kirk's assassination, said she is tired of hearing people say that freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.

“Consequences should not be so detrimental that we are afraid to exercise those rights,"" she said.

Protesters slam Indiana redistricting push

Others took aim at the White House's pressure campaign to redraw congressional boundaries in Indiana, where Republicans control seven of nine U.S. House seats. The rally came just one day after Trump called Indiana Republican senators about mid-decade redistricting.

So far, Gov. Mike Braun has not called a special legislative session, but has said, ""It probably will happen."" Multiple polls have been released in recent weeks showing the move would be unpopular.

""Mid-decade redistricting is what you do when you can’t win,"" said state Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis.

State Sen. Andrea Hunley said Trump is trying to make Indiana an “unwilling accomplice” in his effort to “rig"" congressional maps.

“Dictators do not act alone,” she said, later adding: “We do not negotiate with terrorists.""

The protest drew criticism from some Republicans. ""Terrorists? Seriously?"" state Rep. Jim Lucas, R-Seymour, responded on social media.

Attendance eclipses previous 'No Kings' rally

Indiana State Police Sgt. Robert Johnson said no arrests had been made as of about 3 p.m. “It’s been a peaceful rally,” he said.

He estimated somewhere around 5,000 or more people attended the rally, more than a previous ""No Kings"" rally in June.

There was one tense moment near the beginning of the rally when volunteer event security officials confronted a Trump supporter with a Make America Great Again hat who they said was disrupting the rally.

Amy Kleyla, a volunteer security director with We the People United, said the man had a holstered firearm and was asked to exit because firearms are not allowed on Statehouse property, in most cases. The man left and stowed his gun in his car and then came back, she said.

""I have the right to be here, just like everybody else,"" the man said during a confrontation with Kleyla. It's unclear if he had the firearm during that particular interaction. ""I know how to conduct myself,"" the man said.

The event was one of more than 2,500 demonstrations planned across the country, including in dozens of other Indiana cities such as Bloomington, Evansville, Fort Wayne, Muncie and South Bend.

At the march in Los Angeles, Pam Hope, 62, wore a shirt emblazoned with the Statue of Liberty and the words: “I am Aunt Tifa”.

Hope said she came because she is deeply worried about the direction of the country under Donald Trump, but also to push back on Republican claims that the protests are unAmerican and that anti-Trump activists are part of “Antifa”.

“I love America,” she said. “I just believe America should be against fascism and bigotry.”

It was a dance party in Los Angeles down First Street as protesters moved and grooved around the caravan-like truck pulling a live band.

Parents toted kids in strollers, pet owners walked their pups on leashes and a group of seniors pushed uphill with their walkers – part of a march that stretched several blocks.

The Dark Knight made an appearance in the Batmobile. One protester wore a brown grizzly costume, which he said was a symbol of California’s resistance.

Another protester, Kimberly M, who was only comfortable sharing the first letter of her last name, carried a sign that said “ICE in my horchata not in my streets.”

From Siri Chilukuri in Chicago:

Saturday’s No Kings Protest in Chicago ended without incident with the last protestors filing into Grant Park around 3:45pm.

Along the route drivers and Metra trains, the local commuter trains, honked in solidarity with protestors. One bus driver even put a Hands Off Chicago flyer on the dashboard.

People all over the Chicagoland area showed up for the rally and march which Block Club Chicago reported was two miles long.

When protestors passed in front of Trump tower, they flipped it off, as has become tradition and shouted “Shame! Shame! Shame!”

Deanthoni Wilkins, a 27-year-old Medical Student was inspired by the magnitude of the protest.

“This is my second protest I’ve been to, and the largest I’ve been to and it’s really inspiring to know I live in a place where people share [my] values,” said Wilkins.

The day so far

More than 2,600 demonstrations are taking place throughout the US in protest of the Trump administration, dubbed the “No Kings” protest. The previous iteration of the “No Kings” day that marched in June was one of the largest single days of protest in US history, and today looks to closely match that record.

Republican governors in several US states placed National Guard troops on standby in preparation for the nationwide protests. Governors in Texas and Virginia have activated their state’s National Guard troops.

Ahead of the huge No Kings protests expected across all 50 states of the US on Saturday, several protests in solidarity popped up across Europe.

Donald Trump told Fox News, “I’m not a king,” as millions across the US were about to march against his second presidency, uniting behind a message that the nation should halt its slide toward authoritarianism.

Connecticut senator Chris Murphy called Donald Trump the “most corrupt president in the history of America” at a No Kings rally in Washington DC.

In DC, Bernie Sanders headlined the event and gave various examples of Trump administration moves that he said put democracy at risk. He went on to denounce the billionaires who helped fund Trump’s campaign.

In Chicago, mayor Brandon Johnson spoke at a rally, saying: “We will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit.”

The New York police department posted on social media that most rallies across the city had ended and that there had been no arrests, adding that more than 100,000 people showed up to peacefully protest.

Screenwriter and director Tony Gilroy, who created the Star Wars series Andor, was among the thousands of people who gathered in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday afternoon for the No Kings protest.

Andor, starring Diego Luna as the protagonist, follows Cassian Andor’s journey as a thief-turned-spy for the Rebel Alliance – the good guys whose ranks eventually go on to include characters such as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo – in a crusade to take down the Galactic Empire.

“We spent six years making a show about the fascist takeover of a galaxy, far, far away,” he said. “We didn’t think we were making a documentary.”

Gilroy said the show offered a clear model for what authoritarian rule looks like – and how to resist it.

“We spent a lot of time thinking about sacrifice and courage, and the incremental encroachment of authoritarianism and how it works,” he said. “I think I would have been. I think I would have been here anyway, but the show is only amplified my understanding of it – my understanding of the sort of karaoke fascist playbook, but also my appreciation for the varieties of courage it takes for people to resist.”

Gilroy was dismayed by the “vacuum” of leadership among the anti-Trump resistance but saw reason to be hopeful as he looked out at the gathering crowd of Angelenos waving American flags and No Kings posters.

Rally in Portland turns into a massive march

Robert Mackey

The rally in Portland has turned into a massive march, now filling the city’s Hawthorne Bridge with thousands filling the streets leading to the bridge.

I just witnessed a remarkable scene further back in the crowd, as protesters carrying handmade signs passed a trio of street performers, dressed as Donald Trump, whose head was entirely constructed of Cheetos, JD Vance and Kristi Noem.

Just behind the performers, a group of nine people in black bloc clothing held a banner with the slogan “Organize to Attack the State” and chanted for insurrection and revolution.

At least one Portlander passing the group suggested that they looked like entirely “fake antifa”.

Fake or not, they were massively outnumbered by a crowd that included hundreds of people in animal costumes, making the protest feel more like a carnival than anything at all threatening.

Crowds are amassing outside city hall in Los Angeles, where many protesters are carrying American flags and organizers are handing out sunscreen and water.

A group is dancing to a live band as street vendors sell hot dogs and elote. There is a large contingent of inflatable costumes – I’ve spotted a frog, a shark and a duck.

Many people are waving Mexican flags, which have become a sign of resistance and protest amid the Trump administration’s violent immigration crackdown in the city.

There are plenty of signs denouncing Ice and Trump’s deportation campaign. “If you don’t care that he’s a felon, you shouldn’t care if someone is undocumented,” said one, referencing Trump’s 34 felony convictions by a New York jury.

Before the march is to begin, a speaker just led the crowd in a chant: “Fuck Trump. Fuck Ice.”

A panoply of speakers in Atlanta addressed both national problems like draconian immigration enforcement and the erosion of civil liberties, as well as issues of sharp local concern, as when a representative of Play Fair ATL, a coalition of anti-homelessness advocates and rights groups, took the stage.

Play Fair intends to hold Atlanta to commitments to refrain from sweeping unhoused people from the city’s streets before the World Cup next year, skeptical of mayor Andre Dickens’s resolve to resist demands by Fifa and Trump.

The suggestion that support for antifa – that is, antifascism – is tantamount to support for terrorism drew particular scorn from protesters.

“I think that’s absurd,” said Nicky Cooper, a software developer in Atlanta. She wore a shirt with an antifascist symbol on it. The labelling of people as somehow sympathetic to terrorism is chilling, she said: “I mean, we’re leaving a digital trail of this. You know? I have antifascism mentioned on my social media stuff. I mean, I’m not a ‘member’ of antifa, because how do you join antifa? So it’s like, who the hell are we looking for here?”

Comments by defense secretary Pete Hegseth to an assembly of high-ranking military leaders last month featured prominently in the words of speakers and the reaction of protesters.

Brian Woods, 65, from Lawrenceville and a former army communications staff sergeant, said: “I thought it was unnecessary. It goes against what we know as military people.” He marveled at the decision to put that many leaders in the same room at the same time, potentially providing an immense military target to the US’s enemies. “He could have said that over one of their so-called secured lines,” Woods said. “They have a bulletproof mentality, so they just do things recklessly, without real thoughts that go into those types of conversations and communications.”

Atlanta’s protest march concluded at 2pm without incident, traveling down streets hallowed in civil rights history from the Atlanta Civic Center to the state capitol building about 1.2 miles away. At least 35 other affiliated No Kings protests progressed across the state, from Brunswick, near the Ice detention center in Folkston on Georgia’s southern border, to Dalton in the heart of Marjorie Taylor Greene’s north-west Georgia district.

Initial crowds of about 10,000 in Atlanta contracted a bit as the day progressed, but turnout was roughly equivalent to those events in June in Atlanta, and more widely dispersed across the state.

Erik Malewaski, a college professor who lives in Marietta, where protests also had been planned, attended the Atlanta event anyway.

“I did the Marietta protest last time, and I wanted to see exactly what would go down here. Particularly, I thought we may get speakers like Warnock and Stacey Abrams,” she said.

As well he did. Both senator Rev Raphael Warnock and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Abrams described the actions of the federal government under Donald Trump as fascist in plain terms.

“They want us to believe that we’re in danger if we speak up ... that if we assemble like the first amendment tells us we can, that there’s a problem,” Abrams said, arguing that the attacks on press freedoms and the firing of outspoken Trump critics like Karen Attiah and Jimmy Kimmel are discrete steps on a path to autocracy. “They want to break democracy forever,” said Abrams. “Their destination is to take our country from us.”

I am in downtown Portland, where many thousands of No Kings protesters, many in inflatable animal costumes, are rallying in a riverfront park.

A small group of eight counter-protesters in Maga hats and Charlie Kirk shirts have been making their way through the crowd, trying to antagonize demonstrators by blaring air horns and shouting praise for Trump and transphobic slurs through megaphones.

The group is led by Tommy Allen, a pro-Trump streamer who was recently charged with assault by Portland prosecutors for punching a protester outside the Ice facility in south Portland during a skirmish instigated by Nick Sortor, a conservative influencer.

Their IRL trolling has led to jeers from some members of the crowd, but they have largely been ignored so far. One man, holding a sign in favor of trans rights, repeatedly screamed at the Trump supporters that they were “bootlickers”.

Other protesters alerted Portland police officers to the fact that Allen seemed to be trying to provoke conflict, while recording video, and that he was recently arrested. Officers on bicycles seemed to be tracking the movements of Allen and his group from a distance.

Good afternoon from Los Angeles, where more than two dozen No Kings protests are planned across southern California.

In California, San Diego and San Francisco have been identified as the “anchor” cities for the No Kings protests, but a major demonstration is expected to kick off in downtown Los Angeles, at Gloria Molina Grand Park.

Here activists are encouraging voters to pass “Prop 50” – a ballot initiative to redraw California’s congressional boundaries to give Democrats an additional five seats to offset the Republican-drawn and Trump-sought gerrymander in Texas.

Earlier this morning, a group of protesters formed a human banner on Ocean Beach in San Francisco that read, according to the local ABC affiliate, “No Kings Yes on 50”.

In Chicago, mayor Brandon Johnson says: 'We will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit'

From my colleague Siri Chilukuri in Chicago:

The No Kings protest kicked off in Chicago, Illinois, at Grant Park’s Butler Field at noon. There are at least 10,000 people as the speeches begin. An intergenerational group of protesters has gathered, most with signs opposing Ice’s presence in Chicago or mocking Donald Trump.

Many flags, signs and T-shirts read, “Fuck Ice”, and others read “Hands Off Chicago”, a rallying cry that began when Trump first announced his intent to send the national guard into the city. Other signs read “Resist Fascism” and “Hands off our Constitution”.

Mayor Brandon Johnson spoke to the crowd, which erupted in cheers when he took to the stage.

“They have decided that they want a rematch of the civil war,” he said.

“We are here to stand firm and stand committed that we will not bend, we will not bow, we will not cower, we will not submit. We do not want troops in our city.”

The crowd erupted in chants of “Fuck Donald Trump” while the Illinois representative Jonathan Jackson spoke to the crowd. Later, as ACLU Illinois’s communications director Ed Yohnka spoke, the crowd chanted: “USA! USA! USA!”

Illinois governor JB Pritzker, Senator Dick Durbin, Lt Gov Juliana Stratton, Representative Chuy García, President of the Cook County board of commissioners Toni Preckwinkle, as well as local aldermen and state representatives were in attendance.

The No Kings protests, which took place in hundreds of cities across all 50 states and in the nation’s capital, are intended to denounce the Trump administration and rally against “chaos, corruption, and cruelty.”

Many protest signs and speakers focused on anger with Trump’s deportation campaign using Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Congress’ failure to release the Epstein files and the conflict in Gaza.

Rosa Valdez said she’s never been involved in politics, but that seeing immigrants removed from their homes without due process brought her to the protest.

“There’s a lot of people that have been around me in my lifetime that have fallen victim to what is going on right now and have, unfortunately, been deported,” she said. “And just the way that everything has gone down, I know that they didn’t get any court (date) or anything like that.”

Duwayne Mills, an Oklahoma native, attended Saturday’s protests wearing a Ghostbusters outfit he altered to instead be a “Trump-busters” jumpsuit.

He said the outfit was meant to be silly because “tyrants hate to be laughed at.”

“I’ve got two kids at home, and I will not have them brought up in this B.S.,” he said. “Because somebody … has some kind of ego trip going on and no one in that party will stop him because they’re just as corrupt as he is.”

Georgia Williams and Kim Reed said they joined the protest because of the actions of GOP leaders like House Speaker Mike Johnson and a dislike of the administration limiting press access at the White House.

Organizers of the protests held a mock trial for Trump, alleging crimes such as using the military against civilians, obstructing justice, corruption and bribery. Speakers acted as prosecutors and witnesses in the trial, with the crowd of protestors acting as the jury and found Trump “guilty.”

The protests were peaceful and there was no prominent counter protest or local police presence, but organizers hired security to ensure safety.

Across the Triangle, North Carolinians joined millions of protesters across the world opposing the Trump administration’s “authoritarian policies.”

“Hey, Hey, Ho, Ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” was a chant used by protesters in Raleigh and Cary.

Demonstrators dressed in colorful costumes and held creative signs expressing their views about the direction the government is being led.

Saturday’s “No Kings” rallies spread into Washington, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles and into hundreds of cities across the U.S. They also took place in France, Switzerland and England.

Nine rallies were held in the Triangle, drawing thousands of people. No incidents or arrests were reported at any of the North Carolina protests. There were no noticeable counterprotests on the streets around the Triangle.

Trump supporters did comment on social media, including North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson, a Republican from Southern Pines, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee.

“Imagine hating America so much you skip College Football on a fall Saturday,” Hudson wrote, taking a cue from Republican talking points over the last several days that labeled the protests the “Hate America Rally.”

Protesters offered various reasons for coming out Saturday including policies on immigration, environmental protections, health care and not giving enough attention to mass shootings.

“I’m out here because I want to reclaim patriotism for what’s right in this country,” said Liz Skube, who joined the protest in Raleigh. “I’m also out here for all of the people who are lost and think Trump represents Christ.”

Here are scenes from around the area:

Raleigh

Thousands of protesters gathered along Capitol Boulevard near Triangle Town Center.

People dressed in inflatable costumes that included pufferfish, unicorns, hippos and dinosaurs.

Phoenix Rector, the director of operations for a real estate group, wore an inflatable frog suit with a blue scarf.

She said the costume was to show solidarity with protesters who dressed similarly in Portland while demonstrating outside an ICE facility.

“This is not a war zone,” Rector said. “Portland is not a war zone. Chicago is not a war zone. And so this helps put it in the face of those who want to claim [they are] as nonsense.”

Woody Setzer, a retired employee of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, with 30 years experience, was among the crowd.

The division’s work was used as the basis for agency regulatory rules. But it was shuttered by the Trump administration which claimed that it was wasting government money.

“Well, yeah, it’s wasteful if you think that people should just be able to dump crap in the water or the air all they want,” Setzer told The N&O during Saturday’s protest in Raleigh.

Setzer became active in politics when the science behind climate change became under scrutiny.

Beyond the current administration’s rollbacks on federal workers — like the EPA’s research department — Setzer said the system is skewed.

“This government is very much opposed to setting things up to support ordinary people or poor people,” he said. “This government is set up with a belief that only rich people matter.”

Michael Williams, a Raleigh-based Realtor and Army veteran who served from 1995 to 1999, held an “LGBTQ+ Veterans against Trump” sign.

Williams said he “made the mistake” of turning on the TV at 3 a.m. on election night and saw Trump had won. From there, Williams said he shut down and didn’t tap back into the news until the first No Kings protests in June.

He was encouraged by Saturday’s turnout, thinking it shows the current administration the support the other side has.

“We all need to know that we are not alone in these struggles,” Williams said. “We are not alone in the world dealing with whatever the repercussions are coming from this administration.”

Williams said his biggest issue with the Trump administration is how masked ICE agents detain suspected undocumented immigrants. Williams compared it to the Gestapo, Nazi Germany’s secret police.

“That’s not America,” Williams said. “That’s not what I’ve served in the military to protect.”

Durham

Durham’s protesters shut down streets as they marched into downtown from Central Park, where the rally began with a protest version of Chappelle Roan’s “Hot To Go.”

Speakers at the Durham rally included Rev. William Barber, a civil rights activist and co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign; and Braxton Winston, a former member of the Charlotte City Council and a 2024 Labor Commissioner candidate.

“This is a class solidarity struggle,” said Winston, now president of the NC AFL-CIO.

Cassie Little, a Navy veteran, drove from Creedmoor to Durham to stand up for her freedom of speech.

“I gotta fight this fascism,” she said. “I’m a Navy veteran. I didn’t take an oath to a king. I took an oath to the Constitution.”

Among her chief concerns are attacks on the LGBTQ community.

“I’m a gay veteran,” Little said, “and I have transgender in my family, and they are afraid.”

Erin Wallace, of Durham, was in the crowd with her brother, Andrew.

“I have a child, and I want this country to be better for her, and I know people who are actually in the process of leaving the country, and it’s scary, and I’m trying to make this place better, so that there’s something for people to actually live for,” Wallace said.

Cary

Protesters in Cary didn’t wait for their designated start time to start lining both sides of Kildaire Farm Road between Kilmayne Drive and Maynard Road. Event organizers estimated around 4,000 people showed up, overflowing down sidestreets and standing several rows deep.

“So many people are interested in saving our democracy,” said Martha Glass, of Cary Indivisible.

Other members of Cary Indivisible, which helped organize the protest, passed out yellow shirts, which they said is the color used for generations to symbolize peaceful resistance against oppression.

“No hate, no fear,” protesters chanted. “Immigrants are welcome here.”

Rev. Candy Snively, of St. Paul’s Episcopal Church in Cary, noted that the United States is built on diversity and said she was concerned about Trump’s efforts “to purify our nation.”

It was concerns about changes Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is making at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that brought out Laurie Sorge, a retired biochemist, and her husband, John Sorge, a retired physician.

“We feel like our democracy is greatly at threat, that Congress has relinquished control of tariffs and financial decisions to the executive branch,” Laurie Sorge said.

Pat Reese, a retired researcher who collected data for clinical trials, was also in the crowd.

She said she was protesting for several reasons including the decimation of scientists, the failing justice department and her opposition to the actions of ICE.

“I think our country is in jeopardy, and it’s important for us to speak out,” Reese said. “Democracy is fragile if you don’t protect it,” she said.

Clayton

Hundreds of people in Clayton marched from the town square down Main Street.

Tammy Powell, a Garner resident, held a sign reading: “Ugh, where do I start,” surrounded by a list of her complaints about Trump and his administration. Among them were immigration policies, weaponizing the Department of Justice, renaming the Gulf of Mexico and withholding the Epstein files.

Republicans call protests a ‘hate America rally’

Congressional Republicans and members of the Trump administration have been dismissive of the No Kings protests. Several, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, called it a “hate America rally.”

“Let’s see who shows up for that,” Johnson said on Fox News. “I’ll bet you see pro-Hamas supporters, I’ll bet you see the antifa types, I’ll bet you see the Marxists in full display — the people who don’t want to stand and defend the foundational truths of this republic.”

A statement by government accompanying the announcement of the public release of the proposed amendments, said this as a “decisive crucial point in national policy with the launch of sweeping immigration reforms designed to realign the system with the priorities of Caymanians, while preserving our competitiveness and social cohesion.”

Among the amendments is the extension to 15 years for the timeframe during which a person married to or in a civil partnership with a Caymanian or a permanent resident has to hold their Residency and Employment Rights Certificate (RERC) before they can apply for naturalisation or permanent residency.

The proposed amendments include extending the length of time a person has lived in Cayman from 15 years to 20 years, and from five years to 10 years after being naturalised, before they can apply for the right to be Caymanian.

The amendments also include the introduction of term limits for civil servants, details of which the government announced in May.

The proposed reforms also state that work-permit holders would not be permitted to change employers within the first two years of their permit being granted, “in an effort to curb job-hopping and encourage stability within the labour market”, the government statement noted. A permit holder would be required to leave Cayman for at least a year before being allowed to apply for another permit.

The bill also includes a clause that states that people who have been granted the right to be Caymanian, known as ‘status’, will be required to provide annual declarations for themselves and their dependents for seven years after being granted the right. Failure to do so will be a ground for revocation of their status.

Holders of RERCs also would be required to provide an annual declaration, or have their certificate revoked.

The amendments also include an age limit to the list of criteria for a Certificate of Specialist Caregivers. They also have a stipulation that holders of Certificates of Specialist Caregivers and Certificates of Commercial Farmhands would cease to be valid once those individuals turn 65.

Surviving spouses or civil partners, with dependents, will be required to have specific financial standing if they were married for fewer than seven years as part of their application to live permanently in Cayman.

A holder of the right to be Caymanian by entitlement, who after reaching the age of 18, resides outside Cayman for five years or more, and who fails to notify WORC, will lose that right, under the proposed amendments.

The public consultation period for the bill runs from 17 Oct. to 14 Nov.

Minister for Caymanian Employment and Immigration Michael Myles in the government stated, “Public consultation of a bill is a cornerstone of good governance. This process ensures that every voice is heard and that the Immigration Bill reflects the realities, needs, and aspirations of the people it will serve.

“By engaging with the public, we can craft a fair, transparent, and effective immigration system that upholds our national values and supports both our citizens and those who wish to contribute to our society.”

In the United States, sovereign immunity protects the federal government from lawsuits (unless it has explicitly waived that right).

Unlike other issues, such as dark money or deregulation, it’s more difficult to divine where the justices will stand on derivative sovereign immunity.","After being sued for violating state-level human trafficking laws, the nation’s largest private prison company is pushing the U.S. Supreme Court to grant private government contractors like itself blanket immunity from such lawsuits and many others.

This case — and another involving a military contractor — could deliver sweeping immunity to federal contractors, if they get the ruling they want from the high court, allowing them to operate with even greater impunity than they already do.

The two cases have drawn little attention amid a slate of enormously consequential legal battles currently before the Supreme Court. But they offer a window into a decades-long fight by government contractors to avoid public accountability in court, a battle that has ramped up as the federal government has outsourced ever more of its operations to powerful private firms.

Leading the charge are for-profit vendors that work with the Department of Homeland Security on immigration enforcement. Many of these private prison companies and security firms have histories of alleged physical, psychological, and sexual abuse — but often operate in the shadows, resisting public oversight. Private lawsuits are often one of the only ways left to hold these firms accountable.

More than a decade ago, the GEO Group, a private prison company with deep pockets and powerful allies in the Trump administration, was sued under Colorado law for forcing immigrants in its custody to work without pay. The GEO Group is a longtime contractor of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the Department of Homeland Security’s detention and enforcement arm. At ICE’s behest, the prison company now operates private immigration detention centers around the country under contracts worth billions.

While some of GEO Group’s arguments were rejected by a lower court, the prison operator has appealed the matter to the Supreme Court, arguing it is shielded from the lawsuit by so-called “derivative sovereign immunity,” a contested legal theory that holds that private firms are immune from such legal attacks if they are carrying out, under contract, the orders of the government. Over the past decades, private firms like the GEO Group have worked to expand this immunity theory to kill outside lawsuits.

“Immunity for those who carry out immigration laws is a value of high order,” attorneys for GEO Group wrote in their January petition for the Supreme Court to take up the case.

In June, the high court agreed to hear arguments on the case. While the question before the Supreme Court is narrow — revolving around when contractors can appeal a lower court decision on derivative sovereign immunity — GEO Group is also requesting the court “vindicate” and expand contractors’ legal shield, a position that has drawn opposition from unions, consumer groups, and even the Department of Justice.

Private interests have thronged to support GEO Group’s efforts. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation’s largest business lobbying group, and trade associations for government contractors, such as the Professional Services Council, have filed briefs in favor of GEO Group.

The case has also drawn the attention of other government contractors that are facing accusations of illegal conduct, including the obscure transportation company MVM, Inc., an ICE vendor that is facing a lawsuit over its central role in carrying out family separations under the first Trump administration.

MVM claims that it, too, is shielded by derivative sovereign immunity from attempts to hold the company liable for the lasting harms of family separations. The suit in question was brought by a father and son who were separated by MVM in 2018. They did not reunite for years.

But the impacts of the Supreme Court case could go far beyond immigration. Derivative sovereign immunity, as GEO Group sees it, applies to any contractor working for the federal government. And in the prison company’s view, it could grant them broad immunity from lawsuits.

“They’re asking for a change in the law that would immunize government contractors everywhere,” said Jonathan Maier, senior litigation counsel with Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, an advocacy group that has submitted an amicus brief opposing the GEO Group’s argument.

The implications of such a decision would be broad. Government contracting is a $750 billion industry that has infiltrated all facets of American life. It includes major corporations like weapons manufacturer Lockheed Martin and technology company Microsoft, as well as far smaller companies that provide landscaping services or security guards for government buildings.

“The amount of money at stake is massive,” said Kate Sablosky Elengold, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. “All of us at some time probably interact with government contractors.”

“It’s Spread Like Wildfire”

In October 2014, nine immigrants detained at the time or in the past at a GEO Group facility in Aurora, Colorado, filed suit against the company. All had worked various jobs at the detention center, like serving meals or doing clerical work, through the facility’s so-called “voluntary work program.” They were paid $1 per day.

All detainees were also forced by prison staff to clean the facility without any pay whatsoever, scrubbing windows, cleaning toilets, and mopping floors. When several of the plaintiffs in the case refused to do so, they were threatened with “the hole” — solitary confinement.

“You feel like you don’t have rights in there,” one man detained at the Aurora facility testified in the case. “They tell you, ‘Clean, because you’re going to the hole,’ I’m going to clean.”

These labor conditions violated several Colorado state wage and trafficking laws, attorneys representing the detainees alleged. They sued the private prison operator for $5 million, noting that in 2013, while GEO Group was forcing immigrants to do its janitorial work for free, the company raked in $1.52 billion in revenue.

Over the last 10 years, GEO Group has “repeatedly sought to delay the case,” attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in a brief this year. Among the defenses the private prison giant raised to stall for time was derivative sovereign immunity — the sweeping legal shield increasingly invoked by federal contractors. Because its contract with ICE had, among other things, required GEO Group to offer a work program for detainees, the prison operator claimed that it could not be sued under Colorado state law; it was simply carrying out the federal government’s orders.

GEO Group is hardly the first company to make such an argument. Private contractors, from third-party student loan servicers to weapons manufacturers, have increasingly used the derivative sovereign immunity defense when accused of misconduct.

“The courts have been addressing more and more arguments by government contractors that they’re entitled to this defense in a particular case,” said Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the consumer legal advocacy group Public Citizen. “It’s spread like wildfire.”

Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that originates from common law. In the United States, sovereign immunity protects the federal government from lawsuits (unless it has explicitly waived that right). Private contractors claim a similar legal shield through derivative sovereign immunity. If a federal contractor is required by the government to carry out an action, the logic goes, then sovereign immunity is passed down from the state, protecting the private company from liability as well.

This principle can be traced back to a 1940 Supreme Court ruling, Yearsley v. W.A. Ross Construction Co., that found a construction contractor working for the government wasn’t liable for damage to private land — although the high court didn’t use the term “immunity” in its opinion. Generally, the courts have determined that if a contractor is following precise orders from the government, it can often escape liability for its actions. But the scope of this defense is contested, and private contractors have been trying to expand the concept into blanket immunity.

Derivative sovereign immunity is just one of several legal shields private contractors have developed over the years to try to stymie lawsuits over their actions. Military contractors, particularly those working for the Pentagon in combat zones, are using a new case to seek their own unique legal protections.

The case, Hencely v. Fluor Corporation, arose from a lawsuit against a construction contractor operating in Afghanistan, which argued that the contractor’s negligence allowed a suicide bomber access to a military base, severely injuring the plaintiff, a U.S. soldier, and killing five others. The contractor in question, Fluor, is arguing that it has broad immunity from lawsuits related to contract work it undertook for the government.

If the Supreme Court sides with the contractor, attorneys with Public Citizen wrote in an amicus brief in the case, it would grant “blanket immunity” for all lawsuits against military contractors working in wartime combat zones — an area of law that has long been murky.

Fluor “seems to be arguing that they are not liable for anything done within the scope of their contract, even where they breached their contract,” Joshi at Public Citizen told The Lever, a broader request than in the GEO Group case.

Alliance of Goliaths

The backdrop for these twin legal battles is the continual outsourcing of core U.S. government functions to private contractors, which over time has created a class of powerful companies that fill in for the government, but are in some ways more difficult to oversee.

“Public officials are generally more accountable to the public than private companies are,” said Joshi. Private companies have their investors to answer to, rather than a public mandate, and may be subject to different oversight or regulatory requirements than a public body.

The Pentagon, which spends trillions of dollars on private vendors, has never successfully passed an audit. ICE contractors regularly flout congressional disclosure requirements. Already, these contractors are pushing for more impunity in the contracting process; military contractors have advocated for measures, which are being considered in this year’s defense policy bill, to speed up procurement and slash restrictions on contracting.

Further privatization often means replacing union jobs with low-wage positions, as one major union wrote in its amicus brief in the GEO Group case. And all of this comes at an enormous cost, as private contractors take in ever more government dollars.

If the Supreme Court sides with the contractors in the two cases — granting them stronger legal protections against lawsuits — it could further entangle private contractors in the government, eroding the distinction between public and private services, advocates warn.

In the GEO Group case, the Trump administration has taken the side of the plaintiffs, arguing that while a derivative sovereign immunity defense is “critically important” to government contractors, it is not as broad as GEO Group claims. But the Department of Justice is siding with military contractors in the Hencely case, arguing that immunity is necessary for its war contractors.

It’s not the first time that the government has sided with its contractors on this question. Elengold, in a 2021 paper the law professor co-authored on derivative sovereign immunity, dubs this an “alliance of Goliaths,” a marriage between the federal government and big business to crush efforts by consumers or the public to use the courts to push back on exploitative policy.

“My concerns come when private, for-profit entities are violating state and federal law when not strictly required by the federal government and then avoiding liability,” Elengold said. “I think that’s a huge problem.”

Experts are unsure what the Supreme Court will ultimately decide on this issue, particularly in the GEO Group case, since the prison company’s arguments lack the backing of the Trump administration. Unlike other issues, such as dark money or deregulation, it’s more difficult to divine where the justices will stand on derivative sovereign immunity. Currently, the court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case later this fall.

Although the conservative supermajority has certainly proved a friend to big business, Joshi speculated that in this instance, it may not be as helpful to GEO Group.

“It’s really an open question,” he said. “More open than some other questions might be.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2226391298-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 15:57:51.351737

The NFAP said as expenditures rise, so will the country’s debt.","A new study released Friday says President Trump’s immigration enforcement policies will decrease the country’s workforce by 15 million people over the next decade.

“The Trump administration’s policies on illegal and legal immigration would reduce the projected number of workers in the United States by 6.8 million by 2028 and by 15.7 million by 2035 and lower the annual rate of economic growth by almost one-third, harming U.S. living standards,” the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) wrote in its analysis of deportation efforts led by the White House.

The research organization said the new migrant policies will “substantially” increase the federal debt by $1.74 trillion and reduce gross domestic product (GDP) by $12.1 trillion throughout the span of the next 10 years.

“The reductions in legal immigration include suspending and reducing refugee admissions, the travel ban enacted in 2025, ending Temporary Protected Status and humanitarian parole programs, prohibiting international students from working on Optional Practical Training and STEM OPT after completing coursework and other changes, such as an expected public charge rule, to restrict legal immigration,” researchers wrote.

“The analysis does not include the likely significant economic impact of restricting U.S. companies’ access to high-skilled foreign nationals through regulatory and administrative action, which could affect productivity growth,” they added.

The Hill reached out to the White House for comment.

The Trump administration has set a goal of removing at least 1 million immigrants in the country illegally per year. The Labor Department recently warned that the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts could drive up food prices due to a dwindling workforce in the agriculture industry.

Taxpayer funds are currently being used to bolster border and immigration enforcement, including the White House’s $45 billion investment to increase Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention capacity.

The NFAP said as expenditures rise, so will the country’s debt.

“Increasing the federal debt will reduce living standards in the United States by leading to higher levels of taxation, inflation and interest rates than without such debt,” researchers wrote.

“Labor force growth is a crucial part of the economic growth that advances a country’s living standards and facilitates the financing of existing debts and obligations.

The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.
Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.","Maria worked cleaning schools in Florida for $13 an hour. Every two weeks, she’d get a $900 paycheck from her employer, a contractor. Not much — but enough to cover rent in the house that she and her 11-year-old son share with five families, plus electricity, a cellphone and groceries.

In August, it all ended.

When she showed up at the job one morning, her boss told her that she couldn’t work there anymore. The Trump administration had terminated President Joe Biden’s humanitarian parole program, which provided legal work permits for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans as well as Nicaraguans like Maria.

“I feel desperate,’’ said Maria, 48, who requested anonymity to talk about her ordeal because she fears being detained and deported. “I don’t have any money to buy anything. I have $5 in my account. I’m left with nothing.’’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on immigration is throwing foreigners like Maria out of work and shaking the American economy and job market. And it's happening at a time when hiring is already deteriorating amid uncertainty over Trump's erratic trade policies.

Immigrants do jobs — cleaning houses, picking tomatoes, painting fences — that most native-born Americans won’t, and for less money. But they also bring the technical skills and entrepreneurial energy that have helped make the United States the world’s economic superpower.

Trump is attacking immigration at both ends of spectrum, deporting low-wage laborers and discouraging skilled foreigners from bringing their talents to the United States.

And he is targeting an influx of foreign workers that eased labor shortages and upward pressure on wages and prices at a time when most economists thought that taming inflation would require sky-high interest rates and a recession — a fate the United States escaped in 2023 and 2024.

“Immigrants are good for the economy,'' said Lee Branstetter, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University. ""Because we had a lot of immigration over the past five years, an inflationary surge was not as bad as many people expected.''

More workers filling more jobs and spending more money has also helped drive economic growth and create still-more job openings. Economists fear that Trump's deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.

In a July report, researchers Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the centrist Brookings Institution and Stan Veuger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute calculated that the loss of foreign workers will mean that monthly U.S. job growth ""could be near zero or negative in the next few years.''

Hiring has already slowed significantly, averaging a meager 29,000 a month from June through August. (The September jobs report has been delayed by the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.) During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, citing fallout Trump's immigration and trade policies, downgraded its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 1.4% from the 1.9% it had previously expected and from 2.5% in 2024.

‘We need these people’

Goodwin Living, an Alexandria, Virginia nonprofit that provides senior housing, health care and hospice services, had to lay off four employees from Haiti after the Trump administration terminated their work permits. The Haitians had been allowed to work under a humanitarian parole program and had earned promotions at Goodwin.

“That was a very, very difficult day for us,” CEO Rob Liebreich said. “It was really unfortunate to have to say goodbye to them, and we’re still struggling to fill those roles.’’

Liebreich is worried that another 60 immigrant workers could lose their temporary legal right to live and work in the United States. “We need all those hands,’’ he said. “We need all these people.”

Goodwin Living has 1,500 employees, 60% of them from foreign countries. It has struggled to find enough nurses, therapists and maintenance staff. Trump’s immigration crackdown, Liebreich said, is “making it harder.’’

The ICE crackdown

Trump’s immigration ambitions, intended to turn back what he calls an ""invasion'' at America's southern border and secure jobs for U.S.-born workers, were once viewed with skepticism because of the money and economic disruption required to reach his goal of deporting 1 million people a year. But legislation that Trump signed into law July 4 — and which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — suddenly made his plans plausible.

The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.

And his empowered ICE agents have shown a willingness to move fast and break things — even when their aggression conflicts with other administration goals.

Last month, immigration authorities raided a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains. They’d been working to get the plant up and running, bringing expertise in battery technology and Hyundai procedures that local American workers didn’t have.

The incident enraged the South Koreans and ran counter to Trump's push to lure foreign manufacturers to invest in America. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country's other companies might be reluctant about betting on America if their workers couldn't get visas promptly and risked getting detained.

Sending Medicaid recipients to the fields

America’s farmers are among the president’s most dependable supporters. But John Boyd Jr., who farms 1,300 acres of soybeans, wheat and corn in southern Virginia, said that the immigration raids — and the threat of them — are hurting farmers already contending with low crop prices, high costs and fallout from Trump’s trade war with China, which has stopped buying U.S. soybeans and sorghum. “You got ICE out here, herding these people up,’’ said Boyd, founder of the National Black Farmers Association . “(Trump) says they’re murderers and thieves and drug dealers, all this stuff. But these are people who are in this country doing hard work that many Americans don’t want to do.’’ Boyd scoffed at U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ suggestion in July that U.S.-born Medicaid recipients could head to the fields to meet work requirements imposed this summer by the Republican Congress. “People in the city aren’t coming back to the farm to do this kind of work,’’ he said. “It takes a certain type of person to bend over in 100-degree heat.’’ The Trump administration itself admits that the immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages on the farm that could translate into higher prices at the supermarket. “The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce,’’ the Labor Department said in an Oct. 2 filing the Federal Register, “results in significant disruptions to production costs and (threatens) the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers.’’ ""You're not welcome here'' Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that job growth is slowing in businesses that rely on immigrants. Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May. “Those are the short-term effects,’’ said Kolko, a Commerce Department official in the Biden administration. “The longer-term effects are more serious because immigrants traditionally have contributed more than their share of patents, innovation, productivity.’’ Especially worrisome to many economists was Trump’s sudden announcement last month that he was raising the fee on H-1B visas, meant to lure hard-to-find skilled foreign workers to the United States, from as little as $215 to $100,000. “A $100,000 visa fee is not just a bureaucratic cost — it’s a signal,"" Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said. ""It tells global talent: ‘You are not welcome here.’’’ Some are already packing up. In Washington D.C., one H-1B visa holder, a Harvard graduate from India who works for a nonprofit helping Africa's poor, said Trump's signal to employers is clear: Think twice about hiring H-1B visa holders. The man, who requested anonymity, is already preparing paperwork to move to the United Kingdom. “The damage is already done, unfortunately,’’ he said. _____ Wiseman reported from Washington and Salomon from Miami.

Huerta and other protesters “appeared to be communicating with each other in a concerted effort to disrupt the law enforcement operations,” a federal agent wrote in the complaint.
The agent wrote that they told Huerta that if he kept blocking the Ambiance gate, he would be arrested.
According to the complaint, as a white law enforcement van tried to get through the gate, Huerta stood in its path.
“Despite David’s harsh treatment at the hands of law enforcement, he is now facing an unjust charge,” the statement read.","Federal authorities are now pursuing a misdemeanor charge against David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union California, who was arrested during the first day of a series of immigration raids that swept the region.

Prosecutors originally brought a felony charge of conspiracy to impede an officer against Huerta, accusing him of obstructing federal authorities from serving a search warrant at a Los Angeles workplace and arresting dozens of undocumented immigrants on June 6.

On Friday, court filings show federal prosecutors filed a lesser charge against Huerta of “obstruction resistance or opposition of a federal officer,” which carries a punishment of up to a year in federal prison. The felony he was charged with previously could have put him behind bars for up to six years.

The U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles declined to comment.

In a statement, Huerta’s attorneys, Abbe David Lowell and Marilyn Bednarski, said they would “seek the speediest trial to vindicate David.” The lawyers said that “in the four months that have passed since David’s arrest, it has become even clearer there were no grounds for charging him and certainly none for the way he was treated.”

“It’s clear that David Huerta is being singled out not for anything he did but for who he is — a life-long workers’ advocate who has been an outspoken critic of its immigration policies. These charges are a clear attempt to silence a leading voice who dared to challenge a cruel, politically driven campaign of fear,” the statement read.

The labor union previously stated that Huerta was detained “while exercising his First Amendment right to observe and document law enforcement activity.” Huerta is one of more than 60 people charged federally in the Central District of California tied to immigration protests and enforcement actions.

Two recent misdemeanor trials against protesters charged with assaulting a federal officer both ended in acquittals. Some protesters have taken plea deals.

In a statement Friday, Huerta said he is “being targeted for exercising my constitutional rights for standing up against an administration that has declared open war on working families, immigrants, and basic human dignity.”

“The baseless charges brought against me are not just about me, they are meant to intimidate anyone who dares to speak out, organize, or demand justice. I will not be silenced,” he said.

Huerta was held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles for days, prompting thousands of union members, activists and supporters to rally for his release. California Democratic Sens. Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla also sent a letter to the Homeland Security and Justice departments demanding a review of Huerta’s arrest.

A judge ordered Huerta released in June on a $50,000 bond.

The case against Huerta centers on a June 6 workplace immigration raid at Ambiance Apparel. According to the original criminal complaint filed, Huerta arrived at the site around noon Friday, joining several other protesters.

Huerta and other protesters “appeared to be communicating with each other in a concerted effort to disrupt the law enforcement operations,” a federal agent wrote in the complaint.

The agent wrote that Huerta was yelling at and taunting officers and later sat cross-legged in front of a vehicle gate to the location where law enforcement authorities were serving a search warrant.

Huerta also “at various times stood up and paced in front of the gate, effectively preventing law enforcement vehicles from entering or exiting the premises through the gate to execute the search warrant,” the agent wrote in the affidavit.

The agent wrote that they told Huerta that if he kept blocking the Ambiance gate, he would be arrested.

According to the complaint, as a white law enforcement van tried to get through the gate, Huerta stood in its path.

Because Huerta “was being uncooperative, the officer put his hands on HUERTA in an attempt to move him out of the path of the vehicle.”

“I saw HUERTA push back, and in response, the officer pushed HUERTA to the ground,” the agent wrote. “The officer and I then handcuffed HUERTA and arrested him.”

According to a statement from SEIU-United Service Workers West, SEIU California State Council, and the Service Employees International Union, “Huerta was thrown to the ground, tackled, pepper sprayed, and detained by federal agents while exercising his constitutional rights at an ICE raid in Los Angeles.” Video of his arrest went viral.

“Despite David’s harsh treatment at the hands of law enforcement, he is now facing an unjust charge,” the statement read. “This administration has turned the military against our own people, terrorizing entire communities, and even detaining U.S. citizens who are exercising their constitutional rights to speak out.”

Acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli, posted a photo on the social media site X of Huerta, hands behind his back, after the arrest.

“Let me be clear: I don’t care who you are — if you impede federal agents, you will be arrested and prosecuted,” Essayli wrote. “No one has the right to assault, obstruct, or interfere with federal authorities carrying out their duties.”

In an interview with Sacramento TV news oulet KCRA last month, Essayli referred to Huerta as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “buddy” and said he “deliberately obstructed a search warrant.”

While speaking with reporters in June, Schiff said Huerta was “exercising his lawful right to be present and observe these immigration raids.”

“It’s obviously a very traumatic thing, and now that it looks like the Justice Department wants to try and make an example out of him, it’s all the more traumatic,” Schiff said. “But this is part of the Trump playbook. They selectively use the Justice Department to go after their adversaries. It’s what they do.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d9f6d7b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F60%2F48%2F4ed5b4a9407d870f4450f22c4c7e%2F1471988-la-pol-dnc-cal-delegate-breakfast-0027-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 18:03:41.880788

“It was not my intention.” Shahriar approached immigration officials when he realized his mistake – and was subsequently detained.

“In the past we’ve seen people from the US trying to enter Canada and border officials reject them, citing the safe third country agreement.
But Ahmed said Ice will not bring Shahriar to an examination centre without prior approval from the CBSA.","A refugee applicant living in Canada is trapped at a US immigration detention facility after he says he mistakenly crossed the border, but his lawyer says Canada isn’t helping to bring him back.

Mahin Shahriar, 28, who came to Canada from Bangladesh in 2019, told the Canadian Press he accepted an invitation from a “friend” to visit a property near Montreal, which he now suspects was part of a broader human trafficking operation.

He says the alleged property was in a rural area and when he couldn’t find it, he called the acquaintance for directions.

“Then I found myself in the US,” he said. “It was not my intention.” Shahriar approached immigration officials when he realized his mistake – and was subsequently detained.

But unlike recent harrowing stories in which Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officials have blocked attempts to repatriate people to Canada, Shahriar’s lawyer told the Guardian it is the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) hampering his client’s return.

“It’s not that CBSA isn’t accepting him – it’s that they won’t even respond to us at all,” said immigration lawyer Washim Ahmed. The last time he received correspondence from the border agency was in July. “Quite simply, they have a legal obligation to bring him back.”

Ahmed says that, under the safe third country agreement, Canada is required to bring Shahriar back because he was detained by border officials within 14 days of illegally entering the US. Even if the CBSA did not invoke the agreement in this case, an exception could still apply, said Ahmed.

“If you have a family member in Canada that has legal status or is a refugee claimant – which he had – you are entitled to return. And so our position is either to apply the agreement or acknowledge the exception, but the end result is the same: he needs to come back.”

Ahmed has turned to the federal courts, requesting the courts compel a formal decision from CBSA in order to begin the process of a judicial review of the case, under the argument that CBSA is obliged to facilitate Shahriar’s return.

He has also petitioned Canada’s public safety minister, Gary Anandasangaree, for assistance in the “unique” case.

“In the past we’ve seen people from the US trying to enter Canada and border officials reject them, citing the safe third country agreement. We’re now asking them to apply those same rules of the agreement to this case,” said Ahmed.

Canada’s border services agency says as a broader policy, it does not comment on specific cases and does not intervene on behalf of foreign nationals subject to immigration enforcement in another country.

CBSA did say that anyone trying to enter Canada must appear at an official examination centre to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

But Ahmed said Ice will not bring Shahriar to an examination centre without prior approval from the CBSA. He says correspondence with Ice also suggests US officials have reached out to Canadian counterparts and faced resistance.

Complicating Shahriar’s case is a failed refugee application in Canada. He arrived to the country in 2019 as a student and fell victim to a fraudulent immigration consultant who portrayed himself as a qualified lawyer. A fraudulent claim was made on his behalf and rejected.

Under Canadian law, Shahriar is eligible to apply for pre-removal risk assessment because his failed claim was made more than a year ago. As part of the assessment, officials check whether claimants would face persecution if deported to their home country. If they face substantial risk, they can remain in Canada.

“Ice has looked at his case and concluded he would face risks in Bangladesh, so they won’t send him there,” said Ahmed. “And so we want to apply for pre-removal risk assessment because we’re confident Canadian officials will see the dangers he will face if he was ever sent back.”

While staying in Canada without legal status, Shahriar managed to bring his mother and sister to the country and Ahmed was able to prepare a successful claim on behalf of Shahriar’s mother.

Shahriar’s mother, who has permanent residency in Canada, has been hospitalized on numerous occasions for severe mental health issues compounded by her son’s detention.

“My client is in arbitrary detention. He didn’t commit any crime. He didn’t steal anything, didn’t harm anyone or cause trouble. And it’s been like this for nearly half a year,” said Ahmed, calling the case a “profoundly disappointing” situation. “He doesn’t know where he’s going. He can’t be deported to Bangladesh. He needs to go back to Canada. And so we’re asking Canadian officials to do what’s right – but also what they’re legally obliged to do.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76089665f713b09175435753e9a2500b067bb7fa/0_163_1536_1229/master/1536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2c09c99dd820fbfa64e0a7fe282dd1e6",N,,2025-10-18 13:58:06.273050

Johnson said participation in the controversial 287(g) program could allow the city to hire additional officers with no impact on the budget, according to a memo he sent on Friday asking the chairs of the city's public safety and government efficiency committees to hold a joint meeting on the agreement.

""This program could act as a 'force multiplier,' providing a path for the Dallas Police Department to deploy additional resources to reduce violent crime at lower cost to taxpayers,"" Johnson wrote in the memo.

Police Chief Daniel Comeaux told the Community Police Oversight Board Tuesday that he immediately rejected a $25 million offer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the city to sign such a deal.

""We said, 'Absolutely no, not, no.' That was me who said that. Turned it down,"" Comeaux said, adding DPD officers do not make immigration arrests.

Johnson said such a decision should not be made unilaterally.

""Decisions on matters like this—especially one involving $25 million of public funds—should be made by elected policymakers after receiving public input,"" he wrote, asking the committee chairs to arrange for a public briefing involving ICE representatives and Comeaux.

""With this information, you should then determine what, if any, financial efficiencies and public safety benefits Dallas might achieve by participating in ICE’s Task Force Model,"" the mayor wrote.

Messages to Chair of the Public Safety Committee Cara Mendelsohn, and Chair of the Committee on Government Efficiency were not immediately returned Friday. The mayor's memo was first reported by the Dallas Morning News.

A sample agreement for the ICE task force model, posted on the agency's website, outlines functions local police are able to undertake if such an agreement is signed including:

The right to ask any person believed to be in the country illegally about their right to be in the United States.

The power to arrest any person suspected of being in the county illegally who may flee before a warrant can be obtained.

The power to make arrests for immigration law violations.

If the joint committee meeting proposed by Johnson is held and a recommendation to move forward with a 287(g) agreement is made, the full City Council must still approve any such agreement -- which is likely to be an uphill battle in a city dominated by Democrats.

A bill passed by the legislature earlier this year will mandate large counties within the state, including Dallas County, to sign a version of a 287(g) agreement -- including versions specifically focused on jails. The ""task force model,"" which would apply to DPD, is more controversial.

At Tuesday's meeting, Comeaux expressed concern that making headlines about the department's stance on immigration would bring more federal attention to the city of Dallas.

Johnson is calling for a public review of Police Chief Daniel Comeaux's decision to reject a $25 million federal offer from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, urging a joint committee meeting to determine whether the city should reconsider joining the 287(g) immigration enforcement program.

Mayor seeks committee briefing

The Republican mayor's request follows Comeaux's disclosure to the Community Police Oversight Board that he personally declined ICE's $25 million offer, citing concerns about bringing unwanted attention to Dallas.

The 287(g) program allows local law enforcement agencies to perform certain immigration duties under federal authority. Recent changes in Texas law now require county sheriff's departments to participate in at least one of the program's models.

Johnson says the decision should be made transparently, with public input and a thorough analysis of both financial implications and public safety impact.

Memo outlines mayor's request

In a memorandum sent Friday to city committee chairs - Cara Mendelsohn (Public Safety) and Maxie Johnson (Government Efficiency) - Mayor Johnson asked for a joint meeting to be convened as soon as possible.

""Clearly, participation in ICE's Task Force Model could offer substantial financial benefits to Dallas,"" Johnson said in the memo. ""These funds could be used to hire additional officers without impacting the city's budget. Declining ICE's offer may mean forfeiting significant financial resources.""

Johnson is requesting briefings during the meeting from both ICE representatives and the Dallas police chief regarding the rejected $25 million offer and the 287(g) program. He is urging the committees to evaluate the potential financial efficiencies and public safety benefits of participating in ICE's Task Force Model.

He also said public input should be considered in the decision-making process, followed by a thoroughly vetted recommendation from the committees to be presented to the full City Council for potential further action.

Comeaux explains his decision

Comeaux disclosed the rejection of the $25 million federal offer during a recent Community Police Oversight Board meeting.

During the meeting, he clarified that social media posts suggesting Dallas police were helping ICE were inaccurate. Officers were assisting U.S. Marshals, Comeaux said.

He emphasized that the department has had ""very little interaction with ICE.""

""We were contacted by the federal government, I think it was last week or within the last two weeks, and we were offered $25 million to be appointed 287(g),"" Comeaux said. ""We said absolutely no, not no. That was me who said that, turned it down.

""There's nothing happening in Dallas, but every time we do something like this, we're bringing more attention to Dallas. We don't need that attention. We don't want to deal with that smoke.""

What is the 287(g) program?

Since 1996, state and local law enforcement agencies have been able to partner with the Department of Homeland Security to carry out certain immigration enforcement duties through a voluntary program known as 287(g).

The program includes three models that departments can participate in:

Serving administrative warrants in jails

Executing civil immigration warrants on behalf of the federal government

Conducting limited immigration enforcement activities

Earlier this year, the Texas Legislature passed a law requiring all county sheriff's departments to participate in at least one of the 287(g) models.

North Texas participation details

In February, CBS News Texas asked sheriff's departments in North Texas' four largest counties how they were assisting the Trump administration with immigration enforcement. Dallas, Tarrant, Collin, and Denton counties reported checking the immigration status of any inmates processed through their jails.

The Collin County Sheriff's Office also said it assists federal authorities in apprehending undocumented immigrants when requested.

The city of Keller also participates in the 287(g) program through its jail.

Johnson outlines potential benefits

As of July, more than 100 Texas agencies were participating in the program. Under Senate Bill 8, ""nearly all Texas counties - including Dallas County - are now required to participate,"" Johnson said.

He said ICE now offers full reimbursement for trained officers' salaries, benefits, and overtime.

Potential benefits, Johnson said, include funding additional officers with no budget impact, helping remove violent repeat offenders from the streets, and acting as a ""force multiplier"" for law enforcement.

""Together, we can continue to make our city government more efficient and responsible, and make Dallas safer, stronger, and more vibrant,"" Johnson said.

And in practice, the Kavanaugh stop hasn’t hewed to his imagined brief encounter, either.
The quintessential components of a Kavanaugh stop involve a person detained for immigration enforcement specifically, with race a certain or likely factor in the decision behind the stop—the Fourth Amendment’s protections from unlawful searches and seizures be damned.
That Kavanaugh has to own the Kavanaugh stop is cold comfort.
By all outward appearances, Trump’s crime crackdown priorities seem odd.","Believe it or not, there was a time when the Supreme Court’s emergency docket rulings did not regularly garner controversy; they were simply the means by which the court could consider time-sensitive legal crises, such as motions related to capital punishment. But a key feature of the Trump era is the transformation of the emergency docket into the “shadow docket”: unsigned rulings that have had a profound effect on the country. Beyond the fact that these rulings have a “heads Trump wins, tails Democrats lose” bent, they are, as Erwin Chemerinsky notes, often proffered without much in the way of jurisprudential explanation while frequently bulldozing precedent. The justices themselves may not like the term “shadow docket,” but they seem to relish operating in the shadows all the same.

But there is one instance in which a justice did attempt to explain himself in a recent shadow docket ruling, only for that justice’s reasoning to blow up nearly immediately after its first encounter with the real world: Brett Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo, in which the Supremes stayed a lower court ruling that was specifically impeding the Department of Homeland Security from racially profiling people for immigration stops. The larger court, as is its wont, failed to offer a ruling. But Kavanaugh opted to weigh in all the same. His reward is a heaping helping of infamy in the form of a specific secret police tactic that many have taken to calling “the Kavanaugh stop.”

Here’s the essential background. As The New Republic’s Matt Ford reported after the ruling in Noem was handed down, Kavanaugh’s surprise concurrence went to some pains to “minimize the impact” of a law enforcement encounter: “Importantly, reasonable suspicion means only that immigration officers may briefly stop the individual and inquire about immigration status,” Kavanaugh wrote. “If the person is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, that individual will be free to go after the brief encounter. Only if the person is illegally in the United States may the stop lead to further immigration proceedings.”

As Ford noted, the law enforcement encounters that formed the basis of the case itself could hardly be called “brief.” One of the plaintiffs in Noem testified that his attempt to show valid proof of U.S. citizenship did not make the encounter any shorter, as the agents “refused to believe the validity of his California driver’s license.” As Justice Sonia Sotomayor recalled in her dissent, “The agent said the ID was insufficient, ‘grabbed [his] arm,’ escorted him to a vehicle, and drove him to a ‘warehouse area’ for further questioning.” None of that sounds at all like the quick interaction that Kavanaugh suggested was the theoretical norm. And in practice, the Kavanaugh stop hasn’t hewed to his imagined brief encounter, either.

The quintessential components of a Kavanaugh stop involve a person detained for immigration enforcement specifically, with race a certain or likely factor in the decision behind the stop—the Fourth Amendment’s protections from unlawful searches and seizures be damned. Sotomayor saw a grim future in the court’s decision: “We should not have to live in a country where the Government can seize anyone who looks Latino, speaks Spanish, and appears to work a low wage job.”

If the news is any guide, Sotomayor’s fears are now reality. As the Chicago Tribune recently reported, Chicago resident Rueben Antonio Cruz, a 60-year-old man originally from El Salvador, was sitting with a friend in Rogers Park when “immigration officers stopped their truck and went straight after them.” What followed was a classic Kavanaugh stop: Cruz and his friend were asked for “papers” proving their citizenship. Cruz, who was not carrying such papers on his person, was then bundled into the agents’ vehicle and interrogated. Cruz was eventually let go, but not before the agents fined him $130 for “not having his papers.” The ordeal left Cruz angry: “It’s not fair because I said, let’s go to my house and I’ll show you my papers. I’m a resident.”

The Tribune notes that while federal law requires registered foreign nationals to carry proof of registration with them at all times, “prior to a second Trump administration, it was rarely enforced.” The detention drew the criticism of the ACLU’s Ed Yohnka: “America has never been a place where people need to ‘show one’s papers.’ Ticketing a lawful permanent resident—and forcing him to appear in court and pay a fine for not carrying their papers—is unnecessary and cruel.” Unfortunately, it’s likely to become commonplace as Trump’s goons, freed from legal obligations by the Supreme Court, make the Kavanaugh stop part of their daily operations.

The possibility that Trump’s ICE agents, who have effectively been given carte blanche to abuse their authority, might simply dismiss their quarry’s valid proof of citizenship appears to have not occurred to Kavanaugh. But it has definitely occurred to the jabronis snatching up brown people in American cities. In a second Kavanaugh stop detailed by the Tribune, a 44-year-old Latina woman named Maria Greeley was out for a jog when she was jumped by federal agents who zip-tied her and detained her despite the fact that she carries her passport with her at all times to prove that she was born in the United States. According to the report, agents remarked that she didn’t “look like a Greeley,” dismissed her documentation, and accused her repeatedly of lying.

One of the most obviously impeachable things about the Supreme Court is that it’s so frequently out of touch with the real world—a perhaps inevitable condition of giving nine people special robes and lifetime job security and then stuffing them inside a sepulchral building to stew in their own partisan juices with no one to answer to. Kavanaugh’s flawed reasoning may simply be the product of profound naïveté. But since this all came about in a shadow docket case in which the Trump administration asked for emergency relief in the form of the permission to racially profile people, I think it’s hardly beyond belief to think that Kavanaugh felt compelled to try to put a good spin on a reprehensible ruling.

That Kavanaugh has to own the Kavanaugh stop is cold comfort. Who knows if it’s even possible to shame or humiliate Brett Kavanaugh anyway? It’s very possible that transforming the United States into a country more reminiscent of Nazi Germany’s “Ihre Papiere bitte” era is precisely the legacy that Kavanaugh sought for himself. We’re the ones who are stuck with the consequences.

The popular way of describing what’s going on in Washington right now is to say that on October 1, the federal government shut down as a result of Congress’s inability to pass an appropriations bill to keep it funded. Chief among the sticking points was the fact that Democrats and Republicans could not come to terms on the future of Affordable Care Act subsidies. The Republican bill did not include them; Democrats balked at signing their name to a budget that would cause skyrocketing premium costs for millions of mostly low- and middle-income Americans.

You wouldn’t be faulted if that was your capsule summary of the shutdown. It’s essentially the story to which most of the political press is sticking, and there’s nothing fundamentally untrue about it. It would appear for now, in fact, that the broad public acceptance of this state of play is boosting Democrats’ fortunes in the game of who “owns” the shutdown. CNN’s Harry Enten reported this week that voters blame the GOP more, by an average of 12 points, and he noted that historically speaking, the party blamed at the outset is who gets blamed at the end. (It probably helps Democrats’ cause that those perusing the Obamacare exchanges for plans right now are already seeing the huge spikes in premium costs.)

Still, these facts only tell part of the story. This government shutdown isn’t merely about an appropriations bill, and it’s not entirely about health care subsidies. This shutdown is actually the culmination of a much deeper dysfunction, to which blame can indeed be wholly attached to President Donald Trump and his GOP apparatchiks. But the underlying cause of the shutdown is tricky terrain for Democrats to negotiate, and it calls into question whether they can—or even should—speedily resolve it. And the key to understanding the problem begins with acknowledging that this didn’t start in October. The government shutdown began a few weeks after Trump was sworn in.

Trump’s second term is broadly defined by his monomaniacal desire to either end or fatally impair the federal government. With the help of Elon Musk and Russell Vought, the Trump administration managed to do this in the most alienating possible way. As my colleague Alex Shephard noted this week, the administration’s slash-and-burn speedrun through the civil service has been broadly unpopular. It also probably goes a long way toward making any of the GOP’s rhetoric about Democrats being to blame for this most recent shutdown harder to take seriously.

But the reason things have dragged to a legislative standstill in October is essentially because Republicans in Congress willed it to be so when they returned to Washington to rejoin Trump as devoted supplicants. Their most fateful decision in that regard? Giving up one of the legislative branch’s core functions—the power of the purse. As NPR reported, by the first week of February, Republican lawmakers had already begun to master the art of explaining away why they were happy to surrender the power to appropriate money to Trump.

I characterized this at the time as an escalation in GOP lawmakers’ expansive campaign of self-abnegation. But it has ended up being so much more. The decision to give the White House full power to decide what, when, and how congressionally appropriated money is spent has created an impasse more deep and intractable than the shutdown itself, because the question of how the conflict over Obamacare subsidies gets resolved has become impossible to answer.

Let’s think about it for a minute. The White House’s position, as advanced by Vice President JD Vance and others, is that Senate Democrats should stop filibustering the appropriations bill now, and the matter of the subsidies can be negotiated later. The problem is that it’s impossible for a reasonable person to view that offer as sincere. Sure, Congress can go through the motions: meet in committee, hash out a deal, pass a bill, and send it to Trump’s desk. Trump can even sign that bill. But none of it matters when you know that Trump is likely to simply appropriate or not appropriate that money as he sees fit through pocket rescissions.

What we have here is a fully busted appropriations process; it is impossible to have faith in anything that Trump and his Republican cronies do with taxpayer dollars, even in instances in which bills have been negotiated, agreed to, and passed. And Republicans just keep on tipping their hands that they don’t really care about restoring that faith. This week, the chief way they responded to Democrats’ demands was to threaten federal workers’ back pay, despite the law being very clear that workers are entitled to those wages once the shutdown ends. Here, Democrats should say, “If the Trump administration is willing to break faith, and the law, to not pay you now, there is no reason to believe your steady paycheck is safe under any circumstances.”

So when and how does this get resolved? Knowing of the Trump administration’s faithlessness and the physiological impossibility of him honoring any deal made on Obamacare subsidies—or anything else—it’s not clear that Democrats should even play a role in resolving the matter. As Garrett Graff wrote, “If appropriations bills are not seen as enforceable contracts, why should any Member of Congress vote to fund any part of the federal government under Donald Trump? You’re voting to provide money for lawlessness.” Having once opted to give Trump’s paramilitary forces the money to invade American cities, Democrats should not position themselves to be fooled a second time.

It’s worth pointing out that Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress, so they can end the impasse any time they want, all on their own. I’ll admit that I do not know what Devil Magic has heretofore kept the GOP from simply nuking the filibuster and getting on with this. Perhaps they desire even the slightest whiff of bipartisan assent for Trump’s designs because of the cover it earns them from the mainstream political media, who are as desperate as ever to find the smallest scintilla of evidence that the American experiment is still working. But from here, the shutdown calculus becomes simple: If Democratic votes are what Trump and his GOP enablers need the most, they must never be provided.

According to a fresh Gallup poll this week, 43 percent of Americans regard the Supreme Court as “too conservative,” against 36 percent who feel that the Roberts court is an even-tempered administrator of justice. That 43 percent is a new high, per Gallup: “Before the court shifted to a 6-3 conservative advantage after Amy Coney Barrett replaced Ruth Bader Ginsburg in October 2020, no more than 33% had ever characterized it as too conservative.” But then, that conservative majority started doing things—like gut Roe—and disapproval followed. Don’t expect things to turn around, by the way. As Matt Ford noted earlier this week, the court is expected to take a rightward lurch during its next term.

I got to thinking about the Supreme Court this week after Brian Beutler invited the readers of his Off Message newsletter to engage in a thought exercise: If you could thwart MAGA and the rise of fascism, but only by “turning the Democrats’ ideological clock” back to 2005, would you take that trade-off? Moderating would mean a lot of ideological progress on the left would have to fall by the wayside (Democrats in 2005 weren’t robustly defending marriage equality, and were nowhere near President Joe Biden’s vision of a pro-worker economy). But the idea is tempting—and the Supreme Court looms large. I would not call the high court’s 2005 incarnation “good” by any stretch of the imagination. But during the transition from Chief William Rehnquist to John Roberts, the court came studded with justices—Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Sandra Day O’Connor—who were willing to swing between ideological poles. Going back sure sounds like a good deal.

Alas, the world only spins forward. There’s no “moderation” button that Democrats might press to take us back to a more halcyon era. As provocative as Beutler’s thought experiment is, I’d prefer Democrats to think more deeply about the present moment—and more strategically about getting out of it. I don’t think we escape the fascism trap without Democrats who are willing to spend a lot of political capital, and I think those Democrats will have to commit themselves to some radical thinking along the way.

There is a place, to my mind, where Democrats can and probably should moderate. The big intraparty battles of the pre-Trump era revolved around whether Democrats should go big on policy or stay toward the center; here were the debates over Medicare for All, the Green New Deal, and taxes designed to soak the rich. This is, alas, not the moment to revive or promote these ideas—and I say that as a fervent supporter of them. That’s because they don’t stand a chance under this extremist Supreme Court, which must first be dealt with.

I spelled out some of my thinking on this matter back in 2024, at a time when Kamala Harris was being dogged by daily reports of her reversing herself or becoming suddenly noncommittal about policies she once supported in the years prior to her vice presidency. I was fairly sanguine about this state of affairs because the Supreme Court had, by then, entered its Enemy of Liberal Governance Era, and it was quite clear to me that the six-member conservative majority was simply going to stamp a line-item veto over anything a Democratic president or legislature did.

Under this judicial regime, things like Medicare for All are a complete nonstarter. Hell, so is any hyper-timid means-tested bullshit if five justices don’t want Democrats to succeed. As I urged at the time, conflict with “a Supreme Court that’s holding the policymaking apparatus hostage” is inevitable, and it is “not a fight [Democrats] can duck.”

All of which means that while Democrats might be able to pick and choose some avenues of moderation, the task of arresting and reversing the degradation of the Trump era will inevitably require a hard swerve toward a more radical type of political thinking—especially with regard to the Supreme Court. The polite norms around the Supreme Court have been obliterated. This should be apparent to everyone; every one of these shadow docket rulings where the majority semi-anonymously grants a would-be dictator more power to overthrow the Constitution only reinforces the fact that the high court’s age of respectability is over.

The Democrats who want to win back power in 2026, and win the presidency in 2028, need to embrace this conflict and nurture the growing public antipathy toward the Supreme Court. They will also have to do things that the Democrats of 2020—let alone 2005—dared not: Packing the court needs to be on the table. Reforms must be forcefully imposed. The justices need to be brought before Congress and explain themselves in regular reviews. And to get there, Democrats must engage in a content-creation campaign depicting the Roberts court as it truly is: a promoter of political corruption, a despoiler of the environment, an enemy of democracy, an institution that has pilfered wealth right from the people’s pockets.

I feel for Democrats facing this moment. Institutionalism has served them in decent stead in the recent past. But those institutions have been perverted in the Trump era and must be brought to heel and firmly restored to their civic purpose. There’s no purely moderate path to what should be the ideal “moderate” outcome: a restoring of balance to our civic lives.

But rather than look back to 2005 for solutions, Democrats must wind the clock back still further, to 1862, and find their purpose in this passage from President Abraham Lincoln’s second State of the Union address: “We can succeed only by concert.… The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise—with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.” The Democratic leaders of the future will be those who disenthrall themselves of the dogmas of the quiet past, and face a moment piled high with difficulty with courage and conviction.

Donald Trump was lustily booed at the U.S. Open in New York, and his excursion to one of D.C.’s despots’ club restaurants was interrupted by chanting protesters. But the opposition to the president extends well beyond the Acela corridor. As CNN’s Harry Enten noted this week, Trump’s approval rating is plummeting and he’s now “underwater on every issue”—including on crime and immigration, his supposed strengths. Across the board, Trump continues to have a “consent of the governed” problem, and it’s gotten so pronounced that former New York Times columnist Paul Krugman is wondering whether “a despised autocrat can consolidate power.”

It’s a question that Krugman ultimately leaves unresolved. “I guess we’re going to find out,” he concludes. But there’s a hint of passivity here, as though the outcome is beyond our control—which could not be further from the truth. There’s a large and growing anti-Trump movement across the United States that is just waiting for powerful allies to join them, and it just so happens that there’s a minority party in Washington that is desperate for ways to exert its power that don’t require controlling the levers of government. It’s a no-brainer for the Democrats, who can keep the public animus toward the president well stoked by turning Trump’s elite enablers and supplicants—not just in the capital but across society, from Silicon Valley to academia—into objects of opprobrium.

We’ve been over this before, but the most important thing to remember about Trumpism is that it doesn’t work as a matter of policy. He doesn’t know how to run the economy anywhere other than into the ground, and with each passing day come fresh harbingers of shocks to those mythical kitchen tables. (According to recent reports, agricultural economists believe prices for a slew of grocery staples could be set to double this winter.)

As Krugman notes, Trump is running the inverse play from the Dictators’ Guide to Consolidating Power: Instead of using his power to shore up a weak economy, Trump is taking a roaring economy and wrecking it. And it hasn’t gone unnoticed: TNR’s Greg Sargent reported on a recent poll that found that “48 percent of overall likely 2026 voters say Trump’s tariffs are hurting their own economic situation, versus only 29 percent who say they’re not having any effect and an abysmal 8 percent who say the tariffs are helping their economic prospects.”

Still, as Krugman writes, Trump is governing like he has “an overwhelming mandate to do whatever he wants,” which raises the question: How is he getting away with it? Part of the answer is that denial has become his administration’s stock-in-trade—like the hilarious claim that the president’s signature does not appear in Jeffrey Epstein’s birthday sex-crime book. But another part of the answer, Krugman continues, “is anticipatory compliance on the part of members of the elite, from corporate CEOs to university presidents to law partners.”

Let’s linger on this a moment: Krugman is correct to note that one of the key forces enabling Trumpism is this grotesque collection of oligarchic weirdos that everybody hates: Big Law goons, Ivy League ivory tower types, corporate predators, and the tech-bro billionaire set. While some of these supplicants are more willing than others, they’re also the only ones receiving—or hoping to receive—some tangible benefit from Trump. Whether it’s Trump’s Silicon Valley dinner party guests or the university president who tried to cut a deal, all of these elites are operating from the same premise: “Maybe if I’m nice enough to Trump, he’ll let me keep the money.”

But the salient point is this: In the not-so-recent past, it would be the GOP endeavoring to paint Democrats as the captive party of America’s economic and cultural nobility. Now Trump has embraced all of these political albatrosses as his boosters. And as fortunes decline for you and me, it’s these already uber-privileged members of society who are staying whole—or getting ahead. The only people for whom Trumpism works, in other words, are the same sort of people who rigged the system in their favor in the first place. The only thing that’s changed is that the new mob boss is demanding a bigger cut.

It may be that the same forces that are enabling Trumpism could enable the opposition to Trumpism, provided that Democrats lose their risk-averse ways and demonize the elites that are now at Trump’s beck and call. And while it’s true that some have bent the knee more readily than others, we must have the stomach to castigate Trump’s allies no matter how willingly they came to his side. For my part, it’s OK with me if Democratic messaging included the line, “While Trump’s Harvard cronies were cutting deals, the cost of your groceries has doubled.”

There are no allies for Democrats to be found in Trump’s teeming hive of enablers. Anyone who might serve the ends of democracy and the rule of law has, by now, explicitly announced themselves as having taken that side. As Jonathan V. Last notes, “Any institution not explicitly anti-Trump will eventually become useful to Trump.” One day, we might need to have a conversation about whether some of these people or institutions should receive a path back to respectability after violating the social compact on behalf of a wannabe fascist strongman. But that’s not the pressing business of the day.

For now, brave Democrats can and should implicate and vilify those who have abetted Trumpian misrule and have, by extension, reaped the fruits of its poisonous economic tree. It may be that one of the keys to denying Trump long-term power is to foment the public’s ire at the company he keeps, paint the whole lot as crooks and brigands who are looting the proceeds of the public trust. The burgeoning anti-Trump movement in the streets will be cheered to hear from some political allies who are promising to name the villains of the Trump era and to crush them in whatever era comes next.

As Donald Trump’s goon-squad occupation of the nation’s capital wends its way into its third week, the president is already eyeing the next Democratic stronghold he’d like to strangle with his bruised hands in the name of “fighting crime.” Among the municipalities facing the mad king’s wrath is Chicago, which has loomed in far-right lore as some kind of Third World hellhole. While we wait for many Democratic leaders and media elites to take Trump’s authoritarian spree seriously, TNR editor Michael Tomasky this week urged Illinois officials to steel themselves for what’s to come. “Okay, JB Pritzker,” he wrote, “you’re up.”

It didn’t take long for the reply to come. In a Monday afternoon news conference, Illinois’s Democratic governor joined a slew of state leaders speaking out about Trump’s plan to deploy troops to Chicago. Pritzker has, over the past year, begun to cement his national profile ahead of what many presume to be a presidential run in 2028. He has firmly planted himself in the same “fighter” lane as California Governor Gavin Newsom—the better to distinguish himself from, say, whatever it is that Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer thinks she’s been doing lately.

Pritzker ended up being the headline figure of that Monday news conference, thanks to the simplicity and directness of his message. “Mr. President, do not come to Chicago,” he said. “You are neither wanted here nor needed here.” He offered some satisfying digs at the evident decline of Trump’s mental faculties. He hit many of the right notes for someone who wants to establish himself as a leader of a dissident movement. But Pritzker saved his best for last, when he promised to take the fight against Trump a step farther than most Democrats have allowed themselves.

Finally, to the Trump administration officials who are complicit in this scheme, to the public servants who have forsaken their oath to the Constitution to serve the petty whims of an arrogant little man, to any federal official who would come to Chicago and try to incite my people into violence as a pretext for something darker and more dangerous: We are watching and we are taking names.

This is where Pritzker has leveled up over his fellow Democrats, by promising a future of accountability and retribution for the destruction Trump and his minions are doing to the constitutional order and our individual freedoms. As I wrote back in May, the Trump White House and the GOP are no longer a political party by any definition; rather, they are a sort of criminal syndicate with an extensive portfolio of white collar crimes, violent offenses against our civil rights, and an ongoing sort of imposed cultural tyranny that is killing off the well-paying jobs of the future by decimating academia, and literally sparking public health crises at home and abroad through the Lysenkoism of key administration figures like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

As I noted at the time, “There is a certain necessary logic to what has to follow corrupt misrule of this kind: tribunals, trials, punishment, prison, and the running to ground and defunding of the entire Trump syndicate.” The only thing we were lacking then was an ambitious political figure who was willing to say that they were ready and willing to make accountability a key plank in their platform. Pritzker has made a timely arrival.

As Discourse Blog’s Rafi Schwartz points out, this isn’t the only uniquely consequential aspect of Pritzker’s speech. The Illinois governor—channeling the feelings of so many who’ve forewarned of what was to come in a second Trump term—told those assembled, “If it sounds to you like I am alarmist, that is because I am ringing an alarm, one that I hope every person listening will heed, both here in Illinois and across the country.”

Pritzker’s willingness to straightforwardly announce the existence of a crisis with “no caveats” and “no conditionals,” Schwartz writes, helps to “[neutralize] the latent anxieties of those worried about coming off as unduly panicked or oversensitive to the political realities around us.” In short, Pritzker allows those so inclined to finally grant themselves the permission to see the fascism that’s on the march, and speak of it out loud.

In the same way, I think that Pritzker has kicked open a door to an alternate future: One in which the restorative work of post-Trump patriots involves accountability for criminals and reparations for the people they’ve harmed. The taking of names and the doling out of punishments: This is now part of the larger political discussion; this is now part of the Democrats’ intraparty debate about What Is To Be Done. By including this as part of his political ambition, and broadly suggesting it may be the major goal of some future Pritzker administration, he allows us to imagine this future and have a hand in creating it.

And it sure sounds like Pritzker wants to put his hands to the task right now. “If you hurt my people,” he said, “nothing will stop me, not time or political circumstance, from making sure that you face justice under our constitutional rule of law.” In a week where Beltway Democrats passed their time pointlessly debating whether or not they were using words like “food insecurity” too much, and congratulating each other for calling the D.C. occupation a “stunt” or a “distraction,” hearing a Democratic politician speak in plain English is pleasingly bracing. These are, indeed, encouraging words to hear after Democrats long implored us to “look forward, not backward” and allowed misrule to go unpunished, thereby paving the road for Trump’s fascist second act.

Less than a fortnight into President Trump’s federal takeover of D.C. by the National Guard and an alphabet soup of federal law enforcement agents, Washingtonians have rendered an unsurprising verdict on the president’s latest display of authoritarian corruption: They hate it, in large numbers. And they’re organizing against it: A “Free D.C.” movement has taken root—and taken to the streets—to resist the president’s latest power grab.

The response from political and media elites to this militarized takeover of our capital, however, has been rather limp. As The New Republic’s Monica Potts reports, Democrats apparently have been caught flat-footed by Trump’s maneuver; to the extent that they’ve said anything about it, they’ve largely dismissed it as a manufactured “distraction” rather than loudly calling it what it is: a fascist occupation—and a prelude to worse.

But Trump is getting plumped by some in the media as well: The Atlantic’s Michael Powell idly handwaves the fact that D.C. brought the violent crime rate to a 30-year low in 2024 to admonish Democrats for “downplaying crime.” (In this case, “downplaying crime” means “marshaling statistics demonstrating that the crime rate is trending in the right direction.”) Charles Fain Lehman, also in The Atlantic, goes to similar lengths to dismiss the actual facts to assert that “the reality is more complicated” and that some “deliberate intervention”—atop the one that brought the crime rate to a 30-year-low, presumably—is warranted.

These authors and others are making a profound error from the jump in assuming that Trump sincerely desires to lower the crime rate in D.C. Trump is actually a “blank, sucking nullity” who wants to see himself on television and has decided that his second term in office will be about self-enrichment and revenge. He is inventing a crisis of crime as a pretext for further consolidating his power; this is authoritarianism 101.

Personally, I think downplaying crime in the nation’s capital is not nearly as irresponsible as downplaying Trump’s authoritarianism. But if we must pretend that Trump’s efforts are sincere, then I’d challenge the proponents of his militarized deployments to approach their work with more rigor, and less vibes. Trump has proposed a thesis: Crime in D.C. will go down if masked paramilitaries flood the city and amble about the streets. The task, then, is to see if his theory stands up to the test—to take this seriously.

Trump’s critics do take this seriously, and they have a thesis of their own backed up by data. The District of Columbia had a miserable year in 2023; as crime rates were dropping across the country, D.C.’s were spiking. The New Republic’s Grace Segers took an in-depth look into the phenomenon and reported that the city’s woes stemmed from an interlocking array of local failures, structural problems, and lack of investment. But city officials got busy in 2024 and reversed the trend, achieving a 35 percent reduction in violent crime and the aforementioned 30-year low in the violent crime rate. (Trump is now contending that the city lied about these results. As always, the safe harbor for journalists is to treat every Trump claim as a probable lie—unless, for example, you relish being the type of dummy who reported that Trump had “disavowed Project 2025.”)

As the city pulled off this feat without unleashing goon platoons into the streets, Trump’s challenge is to somehow demonstrate that his way of doing things is more effective. While it’s early days, I’m not sure that we’re getting much bang for what I’m guessing will be a lot of bucks taken from taxpayers. What statistics the administration has put forth are scant: The White House told Axios that “212 people have been arrested for various [non–immigration related] crimes” between August 8 and August 18, 101 of which were from Wards 7 and 8.

That sounds fine, but there’s a lot I don’t know about these numbers and no one at Axios bothered to do much in the way of scrutinizing Trump’s claim. Which agency is reporting these numbers? Is this a coordinated data dump from multiple agencies? Are these adult arrests, juvenile arrests, or both? Do these figures include the Metropolitan Police Department’s own arrest tallies during that period? Does “212” reflect the number of defendants or the number of arrest charges? Because that’s how the MPD tabulates its own arrest statistics. Speaking of, in the same time period in 2024, the MPD made 596 adult arrests.

Crime statistics can be treacherous waters in which to wade; in my experience the lack of consistency and the eminent cherry-pick-ability of them is fodder for crime fearmongers to beat their drum. Moreover, as my colleague Matt Ford pointed out to me, arrest statistics can be unreliable because they are more reflective of law enforcement priorities than they are of actual criminal activity. But that suggests there is a ripe avenue for curious reporters: Find out from the administration what their priorities are. Make them stake a specific claim about what they want to achieve and then hold them accountable.

By all outward appearances, Trump’s crime crackdown priorities seem odd. As The New York Times reported this week, most of the troops that have been sent to D.C. are aimlessly wandering around “the National Mall, large monuments and other tourist-heavy areas,” as well as “metro stations, most of which are also near tourist and entertainment sites.” These patrols aren’t exactly taking place in the mean streets, folks.

The big accomplishment of this deployment seems to be a big uptick in the number of selfies tourists are taking with troops. The other achievement is public displays of ridiculousness: My former New Republic colleague Prem Thakker spent Wednesday morning at the Columbia Heights metro station witnessing a farce as various troops and cops rode the escalators up and down and back again, only to eventually nab a single alleged fare evader. Those who think Trump is in the right should probably explain how these activities will achieve a lower crime rate than city officials were managing themselves.

But it’s not all so benign. Gangs of vaguely identified pseudo-cops are brazenly beating up people in the street, in a manner that The New Republics Melissa Gira Grant likens to the violent exploits of the Proud Boys. The occupying forces are carrying out a sadistic campaign against the city’s homeless population. And beneath it all, the city is being subjected to the mother of all ICE raids, with unidentifiable agents snatching food deliverers off the street (one GrubHub driver was rammed by a police car while making a delivery on his moped) and swarming local churches, grocery stores, and daycare centers. That’s certainly a lot of activity, but those who’ve criticized the city’s own approach to law and order should explain what’s being achieved.

Proponents of Trump’s intervention should also explain whether or not what D.C. needed was a swift kick to the local hospitality economy. While the Trump administration has recently tried to claim that restaurant reservations are “up 30 percent” since the takeover, this is a lie. As The Washington Post reported this week, “Restaurant reservations have dropped in the city by as much as 31 percent year over year for a single day,” since Trump kicked off his military takeover, and “business owners are concerned that the continued surge in law enforcement could impact their revenue during a vital period of the summer.” For everyone who pooh-poohed the Democrats who wielded actual facts about crime in D.C., please enlighten me: Is this good? Are these the results we wanted?

You can absolutely mark me down as extremely skeptical that Trump’s interventions are going to reduce crime in D.C. As always, I’m prepared to be wrong. Can the same be said of the pundits who’ve criticized anyone who dares use facts to question Trump’s fearmongering on crime?

Earlier this month, I brought you the good news that Democrats were developing a concept of a plan for their upcoming midterm campaign, having spent the first half of the year on a concentrated strategy of sitting back and letting Republicans screw things up. The precipitating event for the change of heart, according to reports, was the passage of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which I guess was the trap that Democrats were hoping to spring. Well, as if to confirm that the game is, finally, afoot, James Carville—the chief advocate of his party’s “roll over and play dead” strategy—is calling for a big shift, in a recent op-ed in The New York Times.

To my surprise, there is merit to be found in his proposed line of attack. But it’s sandwiched between a confused read of the political landscape and a rather limp call to action that really fails to contemplate the real harms that Trump’s legislation is about to unleash. For this garden to bear fruit, we need to do some weeding.

As is their wont, the minders of the rubber room in which New York Times opinion pieces are formed did permit Carville to spend several paragraphs throat-clearing about how the Democrats are “constipated” and “leaderless”—which, you know, shouldn’t bother someone who advised them to do nothing for six months, anyway. He also seems weirdly panicked at the fact that Zohran Mamdani won his party’s nomination for the upcoming New York mayoral election, which to Carville represents “an undeniable fissure in our political soul.” To my mind, our political soul would be more gravely imperiled had serial sex pest Andrew Cuomo won the nomination, but it’s always interesting to learn about what elite Democrats and their favorite newspaper editors are prepared to forgive.

After this simultaneously overwrought and underbaked beginning, we finally arrive at Carville’s big idea: Democrats should let Trump “rope-a-dope with MAGA on the Jeffrey Epstein case” without “get[ting] in the way” and instead train their fire on the depredations of Trump’s budget bill.

Now, I come from a controversial school of thought that holds that a political party can, and even should, do two things at once. But I’m willing to concede that the Epstein matter has become something of a perpetual motion machine, with Trump’s own actions being the strongest force keeping this hurdy-gurdy spinning. It is also the precise kind of story—salacious, wicked, and conspiratorial—that our cynical political media doesn’t need outside encouragement to cover. As always, Democrats should take note of what it is the political press wants to spend its time covering and do more to provide low-minded fodder for partisan conflict.

But Carville is very much on point where one vital matter is concerned: This is a phenomenally favorable environment to wage war on Trump’s signature law. Carville cites a July 16 CNN poll that found that a majority of respondents oppose the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, 61–39 percent, and expect it to hurt the economy, 51–29 percent.

What can I say? The public basically has it correct. Taken as a whole, we have strong evidence that there is fertile terrain to wage a maximal battle against Trump on this issue. So it’s puzzling that Carville’s clarion call to action is so oddly muted—and so fundamentally illogical:

Our midterm march starts with a simple phrase every candidate can blast on every screen and stage: We demand a repeal. A repeal of Mr. Trump’s spending law is the one word that should define the midterms. It is clear, forceful and full-throated. It must be slathered across every poster, every ad, every social media post from now until November 2026. That single word is our core message. Every Democrat can run on it, with outrage directed not at the president or a person but at this disastrous bill. And the reasons are countless, each one a venom-tipped political dagger.

I am really struggling to understand how we’ve landed at “We demand a repeal.” In the first place, are Democrats … not planning on winning the midterm elections? I thought the goal here was to take back both houses of Congress, in which case they wouldn’t need to demand a repeal from anyone, they could simply—you know—pass their own bills to repeal things and then demand the president sign them. Which Trump wouldn’t do, of course, but hopefully Democrats understand that the goal here would be to use politics to cross-pressure vulnerable Republicans and construct an anti-GOP electoral majority, not expect Trump to give in to their demands. Republicans spent the Obama years trying to send Obamacare repeals to his desk, not because they thought he’d sign them but because doing so helped reaffirm their commitment with their base.

At any rate, “Demand a repeal” is strained and supine—it suggests that you’re either not planning on using your power to fight or you somehow still intend to attempt bipartisan collaboration once you gain back power. A clearer and more full-throated campaign message would be, “Not only will we repeal this bill, we will pass bills to undo the damage done to the government, we will fight to get the civil service rehired, and we will crush the corrupt thieves who stole your wealth and health care.”

And they shouldn’t stop there. Democrats need to contend with what the One Big Beautiful law will do—and it’s not clear that Carville, at any rate, is prepared to do that. Yes, the law, as Carville suggests, filches wealth from the American people in a thousand different ways, but he fails to connect the all-important dots as to where that money is actually going. Beyond the usual, bog-standard creation of yet another taxpayer-funded slush-fund for oligarchs, Trump’s law is a massive transfer of wealth from the American people to fund a domestic deportation army and construct a nationwide network of concentration camps.

Phenomenal sums of money are already changing hands. The law allocates $8 billion to ICE to go on a massive hiring spree, for which the agency is offering $50,000 signing bonuses. This week, an eye-popping Bloomberg story reported that the Virginia-based Acquisition Logistics Company was awarded a $1.26 billion contract to build another detention facility in Texas. Prior to winning that contract, the firm had collected a mere $29 million in Defense Department contracts. And the fact that the company “doesn’t appear to have any experience with detention” was no impediment to its receiving this windfall.

The law is not merely greedy; it’s not merely cruel. What Trump is doing is nefarious. Needless to say, I’m troubled by Carville’s omission of the way this one law furthers and funds what can only be called the president’s fascistic designs for our country’s future. And I’m troubled by the feeling that Democrats—who are far from great on the issues of immigration and asylum—may try to duck this fight.

Democrats are notoriously conflict-averse, and I worry that they’re still intimidated by Trump’s alleged mastery of the immigration issue. But the biggest reason to take this fight to Trump is that Trump doesn’t think Democrats have the heart for it. As Brian Beutler recently noted, Trump is “betting that grappling with a giant, masked right-wing police force and a multistate immigrant gulag will tear Dems apart if they ever retake power.” Anyone authentically concerned with “undeniable fissures” in the Democrats’ “political soul,” as Carville purports to be, needs to make sure Trump loses this bet.

The first six months of Donald Trump’s second presidency have been a master class in what he truly excels at: wanton misrule. With an absence of adult minders and a determination to run roughshod over all of the democratic guardrails that have historically only been propped up by a fealty to norms and the waning spirit of fair play in Washington, Trump has moved fast and broken the government, put the economy into trauma with his constantly shifting tariff demands, perpetrated the deaths of HIV-infected children abroad, and cut the ribbon on a spanking new concentration camp in Florida.

These first six months have also featured a Democratic Party that has done what it does best: kept its stockpile of powder nice and dry. While some Democratic electeds have broken from the herd (often to the disdain of Democratic leadership) to confront Trump and his Republican minions, the party’s age-old theory of how political change happens—wait for the GOP to screw up—has remained in effect. Though now, with the passage of Trump’s big new “kick people off health care and funnel the money into an American Gestapo Act of 2025,” it looks like Democrats finally have their quarry right where they want them.

Or … almost? As it turns out, Democrats are planning to take on the GOP—in a few weeks, anyway. “House Democrats are plotting to turn the August recess into the opening salvo of the midterms, including through town halls and organizing programs,” reports Politico, as the party is experiencing “renewed bravado after months in the political wilderness.” And to think that all it took for Democrats to exit this self-imposed exile was Trump getting everything he wanted.

But come on, feel the bravado, folks. Maine’s centrist weirdo Representative Jared Golden, who is part of a group of Democrats who’ve lately decided that swearing more often makes them look edgy, shows up in the same Politico piece, bragging, “There’s almost nothing about this bill that I’m going [to] have a hard time explaining to the district. This is a giant tax giveaway to wealthy people. Everyone fucking knows it.” Can confirm! The New Republic has been covering this bill rather relentlessly over the past few months, which raises an uncomfortable question: What was stopping Golden from explaining this to his district at any point during the legislative meanderings of this bill? (Perhaps Golden, the most Trump-curious member of the Democratic caucus, was weighing whether to vote with the Republicans, as he has in the past.)

If there’s one thing that Democrats do seem committed to, it’s their August timetable for finally unleashing the spittin’, cussin’, new-look party to officially open the midterm election campaign. Over the past weekend, as Texans faced the now-familiar tragedy of mass casualties from devastating floods, House minority leader and energy vampire Hakeem Jeffries found it premature to go on an attack. Instead, he joined the Sunday morning talk show idiot parade to express his firm hope that Democrats might work productively with the party that’s hell-bent on destroying the government and wiping climate change from our brains: “I think we are going to have to figure out what happened, why did it happen, and how do we prevent this type of tragedy from ever happening again? And so the question of readiness is certainly something that Congress should be able to explore in a bipartisan way, particularly as we head into a summer where we can expect intensifying extreme weather events.”

It’s hard to fathom a Democratic leader speaking these words aloud in July of 2025. In the first place, the hows and whys of this flood should be glitteringly apparent: Trump’s executive branch misrule has led to cuts in the programs and personnel that keep people safe from these disasters, his shell of a disaster-response agency was slowed by Kristi Noem’s penny-pinching and is (as of this writing) “slow-walking the response,” and the federal government’s weather resources are being sold to his cronies. There is also ample evidence of Republican misrule closer to home, from a Republican governor who keeps presiding over these needless disasters to local officials who passed on funding a more robust emergency system so they could score partisan political points. Meanwhile, the GOP’s commitment to the promulgation of deranged conspiracy theories has the MAGA faithful engaging in the sorts of crimes that might cause the next disaster.

Therefore, the question of “How do we stop this tragedy from happening again?” has a pretty clear and obvious answer: Drive Republicans out of office. And that, I’m sorry to say, precludes the possibility of working arm-in-arm with the members of this criminal syndicate to solve the problems of the world. The scores who perished in these Texas floods deserve the finest politicization-of-their-deaths that the Democrats can muster: Take the cheapest shot, force Trump and his lackeys to defend themselves, shred their defense to pieces by demanding more and better, and then reload for the next disaster, which under Trump, as we know, will always be soon in arriving.

I agree with The New Republic’s editor Michael Tomasky that Trump’s murderous new piece of legislation will reveal how cruel and stupid the Republicans have become; how could it not? But the GOP has a distinct advantage over Democrats not just because they, as Tomasky correctly points out, have “a multibillion-dollar propaganda machine that will see to it that [their] vast audience never learns the truth about the impacts of this bill”; they are also vastly better at playing the media game with outlets outside their immediate control, where they are quicker to the punch and more relentless in bringing controversy and conflict to market. It would be a good idea to follow Delaware Representative Sarah McBride’s lead and start referring to the future Medicaid cuts as “Trumpcare.”

Until these widening strategic gaps start to close, I wouldn’t put my faith behind the belief that Trumpism will discredit itself. It’s not enough to simply vote against Trump’s bad ideas—though that is mandatory. You have to engage in full-frontal war with the GOP, relentlessly force them to defend themselves, find a way to blame them for everything that goes wrong, and use your available resources and expertise to help those who will be harmed by the GOP’s policies. This is the time for Democrats to get a lot less civil.

To bide one’s time in the hopes that a more favorable political environment might emerge is malpractice—because while you’re waiting, people are getting crushed economically and snatched off the street by masked paramilitary thugs. And to pretend that you have a productive relationship with the GOP on any level, as Jeffries asserted in the wake of more deaths by Republican hands, is simply brain-dead. I’m pleased as punch to know that in a few weeks’ time, the Democrats will supposedly be firing their powder. I hope to see some real pyrotechnics at last.

Zohran Mamdani’s decisive victory in Tuesday night’s Democratic mayoral primary in New York City is the latest event heralding the potential end of what we frequently refer to as “politics as usual.” Disgraced former Governor Andrew Cuomo, the candidate of Big Cynicism and the broken status quo, naturally collected the biggest piles of billionaire boodle and got The New York Times edit board to hand him a sideways endorsement after they vowed to abjure such activities. We’re used to such advantages proving decisive, so Mamdani’s rocket ride through the early returns and Cuomo’s swift concession were stunning developments. It’s not every day that Michael Bloomberg, Andrew Cuomo, Bill Ackman, and The New York Times all get pantsed at the same time.

Mamdani’s true upset—he trailed Cuomo in all but a couple of polls—has given bloom to myriad “What It All Really Means” analyses in the political press. But I think it would be wrong to let the moment pass without shining a light on one of Tuesday’s also-rans: Brad Lander. The New York City comptroller may have finished third behind Mamdani and Cuomo, but during the latter half of this month he has played a pivotal role in American politics and been a warrior for his party, as he helped to elevate Mamdani while also putting a thumb in the eye of the two most venal politicians in America: Cuomo and Donald Trump.

It’s hard to imagine Mamdani putting Cuomo’s comeback bid to bed without Lander’s assistance. But you don’t have to take my word for it. Mamdani adviser Morris Katz put it best Tuesday night: “Hard to tell the story of the Election Day results without [Brad Lander,] who went all out in the closing 10 days, defending Zohran, spending nearly half a million dollars attacking Cuomo, and building momentum that could not be overcome.” You can also hear the appreciation among Mamdani’s voters, who gave Lander a hero’s welcome when he arrived at the newly crowned nominee’s watch party last night.

It’s not every day a defeated candidate walks into the winner’s campaign celebration and receives such acclaim. But two weeks ago, when Mamdani and Lander cross-endorsed each other—that is, urged their supporters to rank their rival second on the ballot to take advantage of the primary’s ranked-choice vote system—it felt like the ground was starting to shift. The pair’s affable, charming cross-endorsement video was a soothing balm to what had been a bruising war with Cuomo. Instead of cynicism, voters got to see something that looked more like a budding bromance. This is what ranked choice is meant, in part, to accomplish.

Obviously, it helped immensely that Lander, who is Jewish and a self-proclaimed Zionist, had this genial relationship with Mamdani as attacks from Cuomo-aligned super PACs amped up their anti-Muslim rhetoric in the final press of the primary campaign. It also helped that Lander was willing to lustily deride Cuomo all campaign long, frequently in defense of his fellow (non-Cuomo) nominees.

But Lander’s most important political actions in this past week had little to do with the mayoral election and more to do with the people he has worked tirelessly to serve—which brought him into direct conflict with the Trump administration when he was arrested and detained by ICE while accompanying a defendant out of an immigration court. Lander had, by then, quietly made it a habit to help defendants get into and out of the courtroom. That he had not bragged about this humble service to New York’s most vulnerable residents helped cement his integrity, and that he was taking these kinds of risks while running for office highlighted his courage. (Upon his release, he held a press conference joined by other mayoral candidates and took another jab at Cuomo for not being there.)

Most importantly, Lander joined a small pantheon of Democrats—including Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, California Senator Alex Padilla, and others—putting themselves in direct confrontation with Trump’s mass deportation policies. As I noted two weeks ago, conflict with Trump is inevitable and Democrats need to be more ready, willing, and able to get confrontational with the administration. And as Brian Beutler recently observed, Democrats’ willingness to fight seems to have a real yo-yo effect on Trump’s numbers. At the peak of the party’s confrontation over Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s wrongful arrest and remanding, Beutler writes, “Democrats dragged Trump’s immigration approval underwater. Instead of viewing their quick success as an invitation to continue pressing their advantage, they viewed it as the perfect time to quit while they were ahead. Once they relented, though, Trump’s numbers floated back up.”

Over the course of the last two weeks, which featured nationwide anti-ICE protests and the arrests of Padilla and Lander, Trump has lost considerable ground—so much so that CNN data maven Harry Enten recently declared, “I think we can say that Donald Trump has lost the political battle when it comes to what has happened out in Los Angeles.” Even if the confrontational tactics of Democrats like Lander aren’t directly pushing these numbers down, the fact that Trump is so underwater on what the punditocracy presumed would be his best issue in perpetuity should only embolden Democrats to keep bringing the fight to Trump and his minions. Moreover, what Lander’s derring-do shows is that you don’t have to file lawsuits or pass bills—you don’t even have to win elections—to play a vital role in the anti-Trump resistance.

Where Lander goes from here is anyone’s guess. There may be opportunities for him to lend his considerable skills to a prospective Mamdani administration, but he could also set his sights higher. He’d be a good look—and a great leader—for Democrats aiming to take back the House of Representatives. Should he want to bide his time, the 2028 cycle offers the possibility of a Senate run, where he’d be a massive improvement over Chuck Schumer, whose weak-kneed approach to confronting Trump leaves him unsuited for the moment.

At the root of all of Lander’s recent newsmaking are qualities that are often so hard to come by in the average politician. His willingness to put bigger matters ahead of his own near-term political aspirations cuts a huge contrast with Democratic members who grab political office only to play it safe and, in so doing, boost the broken status quo. But what’s truly refreshing is Lander’s innate understanding of this political moment. In a statement to Politico after the election, he said, “I don’t think the line right now is between progressives and moderates. I think the line is between fighters and fakers.” By all means, let’s get this man to his next fight.

In the end, I was only on hold with the Trump Mobile customer service line for about 13 minutes. I’d been offered the opportunity to simply leave a number for an agent to call me back, due to “unprecedented demand,” but my extreme reluctance to give anyone affiliated with the president my contact information left me listening to a limp jazz instrumental loop for what I felt was a perfectly precedented amount of time. Maybe there is a massive number of people ready to ditch their wireless provider and follow the president on this new venture, but I’ve honestly been on hold with CVS longer.

Once on the phone with an agent, I was quick to learn that this new side hustle was at least refreshingly free of Donald Trump’s signature bombast. There was no braggadocio; no outrageous claims being made about the phone’s capabilities. Instead, I was treated to that other signature Trumpian quality: the unreadiness for prime time that those of us who lived through the Covid pandemic knew all too well. But this time, it also comes with the stink of self-dealing, if not outright corruption.

What is Trump Mobile? First and foremost, it’s a very gaudy, very gold-looking mobile device—most renderings show a screen emblazoned with the president’s name, an American flag, and the “Make America Great Again” motto. The exact model name is the “T1 Phone 8002,” and no, I don’t know why they’ve skipped “8001” but I wouldn’t be surprised if it all has something to do with obscure white-supremacist lore. The phone can allegedly be yours for $499 (they are taking $100 preorders). Trump Mobile is also a wireless service that you can join right now with your current device, if you’re so inclined, for—sigh— $47.45 a month.

The agent I spoke with wasn’t prepared to do a side-by-side comparison between the iPhone and Trump’s wares. (Strange because they were in many ways comparable—at least on paper.) She could tell me nothing about cloud storage. She knew the screen dimensions and the weight of the phone but could only add that “it looks like it had the standard thickness.” The Verge’s David Pierce (who calls the phone “bad and impossible”) reported that there was no processor listed on the website for the phone, and I was unable to get any clarification on this matter beyond the assurance that this was going to be an Android phone. Gen Z can rejoice, however, because Trump is bringing back headphone jacks.

Of course, the most important question was the one I asked first—and one she couldn’t answer: Where was this phone going to be made? After all, the major selling point of this whole enterprise is that the Trump phone was going to be made right here in America. Instead of cheerful affirmation, I got a long, suspicious pause followed by a plaintive, “I don’t know.” That’s fine. With Trump, it pays to be suspicious; you’d do well to keep yourself unassociated with his central claims. But the salient point is this: Even as he collapses the government, shreds the economy, and potentially takes us to war, the president is at all times expanding his scam empire.

My experience with Trump Mobile seems pretty typical—though I wasn’t willing to actually put my credit card at risk for journalism, sorry. The Washington Post’s Shira Ovide said that while Trump Mobile successfully charged her for joining Trump’s wireless service, it charged her more than the listed price and she hasn’t been able to use it yet. 404 Media’s Joseph Cox attempted to make a $100 down payment on the Trump phone itself (due to hit the market in September), only to be billed $64.70 and sent a cryptic confirmation email. “It is the worst experience I’ve ever faced buying a consumer electronic product and I have no idea whether or how I’ll receive the phone,” he wrote.

And experts, asked by CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal to weigh in on the likelihood that this phone will be made in the United States, respond with a resounding LOL. “There is no way the phone was designed from scratch, and there is no way it is going to be assembled in the U.S. or completely manufactured in the U.S.,” said one, adding, “That is completely impossible.” Says another, “The U.S. does not have local manufacturing capabilities readily available.” In fact, all signs point to the inconvenient truth that China’s vaunted manufacturing hubs will have to be involved.

If Trump has a magic power, it’s that no matter how much evidence you marshal in the service of letting the buyer beware, the president still manages to get fools to part with their money pretty regularly. Whether it’s for Trump steaks or the Trump presidency, the one constant is the multitudes willing to be his marks. Frankly, even Trump’s self-conception borders on the level of delusion necessary to con oneself. His own recollections of dealmaking derring-do, when probed, tend to reveal a disastrous self-pantsing.

But maybe the Trump phone is more than meets the eye. As Business Insider reported this week, Mark Cuban thinks that it has something to do with the Trump family’s emerging interests in cryptocurrency:

“I think the smart game they are probably playing is to put a crypto wallet on the phone that leverages WLF, $Trump, and their stable coins,” Cuban posted in response to the product launch. WLF is a reference to crypto firm World Liberty Financial, which is connected with the Trumps.

“Whatever transactions they can create [generate] fees for them, and there are so many ways to sell things and pre-load whatever they want,” he added.

Cuban may be onto something. Crypto has become the new, transcendent dimension of Trump’s scam empire. This week, Eric Trump announced that the family is planning to start “American Bitcoin,” a “company focused on Bitcoin mining, the business of running energy-guzzling machines to generate new coins.” Alongside Trump’s interest in WLF and his emoluments clause–busting memecoins, the president is now tightly entangled in what The New York Times refers to as a “business portfolio … fraught with conflicts of interest that have blurred the boundary between government and industry.”

Between his own up-to-the-gills involvement with the industry and his orders to have both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission effectively stand down on policing the industry, the president’s capacity for self-dealing and favor trading has reached steroidal new highs. As Harvard University’s go-to expert on authoritarian regimes Steven Levitsky told The Guardian this week, “I have never seen such open corruption in any modern government anywhere.”

Perhaps the most distressing thing about this is the extent to which Democrats are helping to further Trump’s ends. This week, 18 Senate Democrats helped pass the “GENIUS Act,” which is essentially the crypto industry’s version of Gramm-Leach-Bliley. As University of California-Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen describes at length, the GENIUS Act would bring widespread mayhem in the way it would grant “hundreds—perhaps even thousands—of American companies” the power to issue their own bespoke cryptocurrencies. “Imagine Walmart issuing a Walmartcoin, and Amazon doing the same with an Amazoncoin, enabling them to bypass the banking system and credit card networks,” he writes.

While the idea may seem dizzily postmodern, Eichengreen says that these proposed arrangements bear “an uncanny resemblance to the way America’s monetary system functioned from the mid-1830s until the Civil War,” when “bank failures, personal bankruptcies and financial instability” were part of daily life. “Lawmakers should think twice before passing this piece of legislation,” he writes. Whoops!

Trump might be the nation’s biggest problem right now, but the crypto industry ranks high on the list. As The New Republic’s Paige Oamek reported last September, Washington has lately been flooded with crypto cash: “Crypto companies spent over $121 million to sway elections during [the 2024 election] cycle,” she wrote. “By comparison, since the Citizens United ruling in 2010, the fossil fuel industry has collectively spent $176 million over 14 years of election cycles.”

With that kind of filthy lucre sloshing around, it’s not hard to buy off some Democrats. As The Lever reported this week, the crypto industry has purchased key allies, in the form of scheming strategists who’ve spun through the government-to-private-sector revolving door, now coaching Democratic lawmakers in the art of offering “symbolic anti-corruption amendments” knowing that they would, in the end, be “dead on arrival, since the language would likely be voted down by Republicans.” I suppose that in this way, Trump has done the impossible: He’s brought both parties together in a rare demonstration of bipartisan comity. Too bad, then, that it’s all in the furtherance of the president’s corrupt self-enrichment.

Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.
During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.
The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.
Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.","Maria worked cleaning schools in Florida for $13 an hour. Every two weeks, she’d get a $900 paycheck from her employer, a contractor. Not much — but enough to cover rent in the house that she and her 11-year-old son share with five families, plus electricity, a cellphone and groceries.

In August, it all ended.

When she showed up at the job one morning, her boss told her that she couldn’t work there anymore. The Trump administration had terminated President Joe Biden’s humanitarian parole program, which provided legal work permits for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans as well as Nicaraguans like Maria.

“I feel desperate,’’ said Maria, 48, who requested anonymity to talk about her ordeal because she fears being detained and deported. “I don’t have any money to buy anything. I have $5 in my account. I’m left with nothing.’’

President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on immigration is throwing foreigners like Maria out of work and shaking the American economy and job market. And it’s happening at a time when hiring is already deteriorating amid uncertainty over Trump’s erratic trade policies.

Immigrants do jobs — cleaning houses, picking tomatoes, painting fences — that most native-born Americans won’t, and for less money. But they also bring the technical skills and entrepreneurial energy that have helped make the United States the world’s economic superpower.

Trump is attacking immigration at both ends of spectrum, deporting low-wage laborers and discouraging skilled foreigners from bringing their talents to the United States.

And he is targeting an influx of foreign workers that eased labor shortages and upward pressure on wages and prices at a time when most economists thought that taming inflation would require sky-high interest rates and a recession — a fate the United States escaped in 2023 and 2024.

“Immigrants are good for the economy,” said Lee Branstetter, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University. “Because we had a lot of immigration over the past five years, an inflationary surge was not as bad as many people expected.”

More workers filling more jobs and spending more money has also helped drive economic growth and create still-more job openings. Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.

In a July report, researchers Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the centrist Brookings Institution and Stan Veuger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute calculated that the loss of foreign workers will mean that monthly U.S. job growth “could be near zero or negative in the next few years.’’

Hiring has already slowed significantly, averaging a meager 29,000 a month from June through August. (The September jobs report has been delayed by the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.) During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, citing fallout Trump’s immigration and trade policies, downgraded its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 1.4% from the 1.9% it had previously expected and from 2.5% in 2024.

‘We need these people’

Goodwin Living, an Alexandria, Virginia nonprofit that provides senior housing, health care and hospice services, had to lay off four employees from Haiti after the Trump administration terminated their work permits. The Haitians had been allowed to work under a humanitarian parole program and had earned promotions at Goodwin.

“That was a very, very difficult day for us,” CEO Rob Liebreich said. “It was really unfortunate to have to say goodbye to them, and we’re still struggling to fill those roles.’’

Liebreich is worried that another 60 immigrant workers could lose their temporary legal right to live and work in the United States. “We need all those hands,’’ he said. “We need all these people.”

Goodwin Living has 1,500 employees, 60% of them from foreign countries. It has struggled to find enough nurses, therapists and maintenance staff. Trump’s immigration crackdown, Liebreich said, is “making it harder.’’

The ICE crackdown

Trump’s immigration ambitions, intended to turn back what he calls an “invasion” at America’s southern border and secure jobs for U.S.-born workers, were once viewed with skepticism because of the money and economic disruption required to reach his goal of deporting 1 million people a year. But legislation that Trump signed into law July 4 — and which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — suddenly made his plans plausible.

The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.

And his empowered ICE agents have shown a willingness to move fast and break things — even when their aggression conflicts with other administration goals.

Last month, immigration authorities raided a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains. They’d been working to get the plant up and running, bringing expertise in battery technology and Hyundai procedures that local American workers didn’t have.

The incident enraged the South Koreans and ran counter to Trump’s push to lure foreign manufacturers to invest in America. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country’s other companies might be reluctant about betting on America if their workers couldn’t get visas promptly and risked getting detained.

Sending Medicaid recipients to the fields

America’s farmers are among the president’s most dependable supporters.

But John Boyd Jr., who farms 1,300 acres of soybeans, wheat and corn in southern Virginia, said that the immigration raids — and the threat of them — are hurting farmers already contending with low crop prices, high costs and fallout from Trump’s trade war with China, which has stopped buying U.S. soybeans and sorghum.

“You got ICE out here, herding these people up,’’ said Boyd, founder of the National Black Farmers Association . “(Trump) says they’re murderers and thieves and drug dealers, all this stuff. But these are people who are in this country doing hard work that many Americans don’t want to do.’’

Boyd scoffed at U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ suggestion in July that U.S.-born Medicaid recipients could head to the fields to meet work requirements imposed this summer by the Republican Congress. “People in the city aren’t coming back to the farm to do this kind of work,’’ he said. “It takes a certain type of person to bend over in 100-degree heat.’’

The Trump administration itself admits that the immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages on the farm that could translate into higher prices at the supermarket.

“The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce,’’ the Labor Department said in an Oct. 2 filing the Federal Register, “results in significant disruptions to production costs and (threatens) the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers.’’

“You’re not welcome here”

Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that job growth is slowing in businesses that rely on immigrants. Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.

“Those are the short-term effects,’’ said Kolko, a Commerce Department official in the Biden administration. “The longer-term effects are more serious because immigrants traditionally have contributed more than their share of patents, innovation, productivity.’’

Especially worrisome to many economists was Trump’s sudden announcement last month that he was raising the fee on H-1B visas, meant to lure hard-to-find skilled foreign workers to the United States, from as little as $215 to $100,000.

“A $100,000 visa fee is not just a bureaucratic cost — it’s a signal,” Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said. “It tells global talent: ‘You are not welcome here.’’’

Some are already packing up.

In Washington D.C., one H-1B visa holder, a Harvard graduate from India who works for a nonprofit helping Africa’s poor, said Trump’s signal to employers is clear: Think twice about hiring H-1B visa holders.

The man, who requested anonymity, is already preparing paperwork to move to the United Kingdom. “The damage is already done, unfortunately,’’ he said.

In a 43-page filing, the administration argued the judicial branch has no right to “second guess” a president’s judgment on national security matters or resulting military actions.

“A federal district court lacks not only the authority but also the competence to wrest control of the military chain of command from the Commander in Chief,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote.

President Donald Trump’s Oct. 4 order to federalize, or take control of, 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, along with the deployment of 200 Texas guardsmen and another 16 troops from California, has been blocked since last week. U.S. District Judge April Perry issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 9 forbidding the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard, ruling there was “no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Since then, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stay Perry’s order blocking the National Guard’s deployment, with a three-judge panel writing in an opinion published Thursday that “political opposition is not rebellion.”

But the administration is continuing its insistence that Chicago-area protests against Trump’s immigration enforcement actions are far more violent than the accounts Perry relied upon in issuing her two-week temporary restraining order. The order is set to expire on Thursday, Oct. 23, though Perry has scheduled a hearing the day before on a possible extension.

Sauer wrote that continued delays in deploying guardsmen to protect federal immigration agents and property from “rioters” puts agents’ lives at risk. He cited incidents of slashed tires on vehicles belonging to Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and alleged protesters have aimed fireworks at agents “and have thrown bottles, rocks, and tear gas at them.”

The filing accused Perry of having “disregarded outright the evidence of violence proffered by federal officials” and “instead accepting the implausibly rosy assessment of state and local officials,” which he called “indefensible.”

Perry was appointed to the bench last year after former President Joe Biden’s previous attempt to appoint her U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois was blocked in the Senate by now-Vice President J.D. Vance.

The judge last week said the DOJ’s arguments — particularly its characterization of the protests she noted had never exceeded 200 people outside the ICE facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview — seemed to add to “a growing body of evidence that DHS’ version of events are unreliable.” She also gave credence to allegations that agents were often the aggressors in clashes with protesters and predicted that deploying the National Guard “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

But on Friday, Sauer shot back that the judge’s ruling was part of “a disturbing and recurring pattern” that follows similar cases in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon.

In his telling, protestors in those Democratic strongholds put immigration agents at risk and obstructed their work while local law enforcement offered only “tepid support,” prompting the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard for the protection of agents and federal property. Sauer decried local federal judges’ rulings against the Trump administration after “local political leaders” filed lawsuits.

“The district court then issues an opinion granting injunctive relief against the President’s action that downplays or denies the ongoing threat to the lives and safety of federal agents, substitutes the court’s own judgment for the President’s about the need for military augmentation, and gives little or no weight to the United States’ interest in enforcing federal immigration law,” he wrote.

Sauer also chided the 7th Circuit panel, which wrote in Thursday’s opinion that “the facts do not justify the President’s actions in Illinois.” The three-judge panel, which included Trump-appointed Judge Amy St. Eve, stayed the portion of Perry’s order blocking the administration from federalizing National Guard troops but backed up the part of her ruling preventing their deployment.

“That result eviscerates the President’s order,” Sauer wrote, saying it “deprives” immigration agents of the protection Trump “sought to give them” by activating the National Guard. “It also places the Seventh Circuit in the untenable position of controlling the military chain of command and judicially micromanaging the exercise of the President’s Commander-in-Chief powers, including the decision about which military forces the President can deploy.”

The high court gave the Illinois Attorney General’s office until 5 p.m. Monday to respond to the filing.

In a 43-page filing, the administration argued the judicial branch has no right to “second guess” a president’s judgment on national security matters or resulting military actions.

“A federal district court lacks not only the authority but also the competence to wrest control of the military chain of command from the Commander in Chief,” U.S. Solicitor General John Sauer wrote.

President Donald Trump’s Oct. 4 order to federalize, or take control of, 300 members of the Illinois National Guard, along with the deployment of 200 Texas guardsmen and another 16 troops from California, has been blocked since last week. U.S. District Judge April Perry issued a temporary restraining order on Oct. 9 forbidding the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard, ruling there was “no credible evidence that there is a danger of rebellion in the state of Illinois.”

Since then, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals refused to stay Perry’s order blocking the National Guard’s deployment, with a three-judge panel writing in an opinion published Thursday that “political opposition is not rebellion.”

But the administration is continuing its insistence that Chicago-area protests against Trump’s immigration enforcement actions are far more violent than the accounts Perry relied upon in issuing her two-week temporary restraining order. The order is set to expire on Thursday, Oct. 23, though Perry has scheduled a hearing the day before on a possible extension.

Sauer wrote that continued delays in deploying guardsmen to protect federal immigration agents and property from “rioters” puts agents’ lives at risk. He cited incidents of slashed tires on vehicles belonging to Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and alleged protesters have aimed fireworks at agents “and have thrown bottles, rocks, and tear gas at them.”

The filing accused Perry of having “disregarded outright the evidence of violence proffered by federal officials” and “instead accepting the implausibly rosy assessment of state and local officials,” which he called “indefensible.”

Perry was appointed to the bench last year after former President Joe Biden’s previous attempt to appoint her U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois was blocked in the Senate by now-Vice President J.D. Vance.

The judge last week said the DOJ’s arguments — particularly its characterization of the protests she noted had never exceeded 200 people outside the ICE facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview — seemed to add to “a growing body of evidence that DHS’ version of events are unreliable.” She also gave credence to allegations that agents were often the aggressors in clashes with protesters and predicted that deploying the National Guard “will only add fuel to the fire that the defendants themselves have started.”

But on Friday, Sauer shot back that the judge’s ruling was part of “a disturbing and recurring pattern” that follows similar cases in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon.

In his telling, protestors in those Democratic strongholds put immigration agents at risk and obstructed their work while local law enforcement offered only “tepid support,” prompting the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard for the protection of agents and federal property. Sauer decried local federal judges’ rulings against the Trump administration after “local political leaders” filed lawsuits.

“The district court then issues an opinion granting injunctive relief against the President’s action that downplays or denies the ongoing threat to the lives and safety of federal agents, substitutes the court’s own judgment for the President’s about the need for military augmentation, and gives little or no weight to the United States’ interest in enforcing federal immigration law,” he wrote.

Sauer also chided the 7th Circuit panel, which wrote in Thursday’s opinion that “the facts do not justify the President’s actions in Illinois.” The three-judge panel, which included Trump-appointed Judge Amy St. Eve, stayed the portion of Perry’s order blocking the administration from federalizing National Guard troops but backed up the part of her ruling preventing their deployment.

“That result eviscerates the President’s order,” Sauer wrote, saying it “deprives” immigration agents of the protection Trump “sought to give them” by activating the National Guard. “It also places the Seventh Circuit in the untenable position of controlling the military chain of command and judicially micromanaging the exercise of the President’s Commander-in-Chief powers, including the decision about which military forces the President can deploy.”

The high court gave the Illinois Attorney General’s office until 5 p.m. Monday to respond to the filing.

What we need is smart law enforcement, secure borders, a modernized asylum system, a clear and fair path to legalization and a relentless focus on dismantling the cartels.","When it comes to fixing our immigration system, Democrats and Republicans in Congress both need to admit where they have been wrong. This includes acknowledging that for decades, both parties ignored the main problem: the cartels that have made billions of dollars smuggling people, drugs and weapons into the United States.

Democrats must concede that Donald Trump was right about the importance of securing the border. He was right about the need to create a joint task force — involving multiple government departments, agencies and military branches — to fight the cartels. And he was right about the need to deport violent criminals who are in this country illegally.

But Republicans have to realize that the Trump administration risks squandering the progress it has made by conducting raids on workplaces and neighborhoods throughout the country, such as the disastrous crackdown it began five weeks ago in Chicago. These raids — rounding up people who often have lived here for decades, raised families, held jobs and committed no crimes beyond lacking proper documentation — are economically unwise, socially destructive and morally wrong.

The raids remove workers from businesses that rely on them. They erode trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they police. And they separate families.

While Democrats must denounce these raids, we do need a crackdown — on the cartels. The cartels and the human traffickers known as coyotes who work for them teach migrants to exploit loopholes in our immigration law and deliberately overwhelm our asylum system. In the chaos, they smuggle drugs, traffic people and expand their grip on both sides of the border.

I recently visited the southern border in Arizona with a bipartisan group of fellow U.S. representatives. We met with immigration officials, law enforcement officers, Border Patrol agents and intelligence officers, all of whom issued the same warning: Though the border is officially closed to asylum seekers between the ports of entry, the cartels and coyotes are still hard at work, spreading false promises and luring families north.

The cartels are well organized, well funded, tech-savvy transnational enterprises. Fighting them at the border requires investing in drones, movement sensors, physical barriers and rapid-response units. It requires continuing to support the joint task force that is working to disrupt their financial networks and their leadership. It requires using law enforcement resources wisely: Every federal officer who is focused on arresting a farmhand, factory worker or landscaper could be better used to fight the cartels.

The Trump administration’s crackdown in Chicago is also a reminder that only Congress can permanently fix our immigration system. It cannot be done by executive orders, presidential decrees, lawsuits or agency directives. One president can issue an order, the next can reverse it. Judges can block policies or gut them. Cabinet officials can change enforcement priorities overnight. That’s not real leadership; it’s political theater.

Instead, we need legislation — ideally bipartisan. Lawmakers should reform our asylum system, which hasn’t been meaningfully updated in decades, so that it works quickly, fairly and with finality. Legitimate claims should be honored; meritless ones should be resolved swiftly with deportation.

Lawmakers should also fix our guest worker programs and create earned legal status for longtime residents. The border needs to be secure, but children should not live in fear of losing their parents to a midnight raid and families that have built lives here deserve the chance to earn legal status.

These reforms would also reduce cartel profits, stabilize labor markets and give employers greater certainty.

Meaningful change requires that Republicans acknowledge the economic and humanitarian necessity of immigration and that Democrats grant the necessity of secure borders and the deportation of violent offenders. Neither open borders nor mass deportation is a serious solution. What we need is smart law enforcement, secure borders, a modernized asylum system, a clear and fair path to legalization and a relentless focus on dismantling the cartels.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/19/multimedia/19suozzi-mfjc/19suozzi-mfjc-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 09:01:53.947046

The big picture: Previously relegated to niche online communities like the HistoryMemes Reddit, the Third Amendment is receiving almost as much attention as its big siblings, the First and Second Amendments.

Context: The Third Amendment prohibits the forcible housing of the military in a civilians' house during peacetime, and requires any change to that status to be codified by law during times of war.

The amendment is ""not considered controversial"" and its merits have never been litigated before the Supreme Court, according to Cornell University's Legal Information Institute.

""She didn't ask for a meeting. She asked to use the restroom. This is insane.""

State of play: The Trump administration rolled back restrictions on immigration enforcement in churches, hospitals and schools earlier this year, opening the floodgates for officers to access traditionally safe spaces to conduct raids.

The rollback has confused staffers unaccustomed to navigating law enforcement demands while adhering to industry protocols.

""These types of communication channels are extremely effective. It just depends on the person that's using them.""

Zoom in: The memes keep coming. Users have remarked how they never expected to need their knowledge of the Third Amendment from history classes, and apologized to the Founding Fathers for not seeing their vision.

At the end of a secluded, winding road in Laredo, Texas, sits the Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office. For nearly two decades, Stern has investigated the deaths of immigrants attempting to cross into the United States illegally.

On a hot summer day, less than 24 hours after a woman attempted to cross the U.S.-Mexico border, her body arrived at Stern’s office – the first dead border crosser in weeks.

The Webb County Medical Examiner’s Office has reported a nearly 97% decrease in migrant deaths since 2021, a trend she attributes to Trump's federal anti-immigration policies. Nineteen border crossers have lain on Stern’s autopsy table so far this year.

“Today, we might get a call, it's been maybe once every three weeks,” Stern said. “This year, the numbers just plummeted.”

That’s compared to 77 deaths in her jurisdiction last year – a stark contrast from 2021 at the height of the migrant surge when she recorded nearly 300 deaths.

“We would get multiple calls a week and sometimes multiple calls a day,” Stern recalled.

Webb County is the sixth-largest county in Texas by land, and covering it is no small task. From Stern’s office, it can take more than two hours to reach the furthest point. Her coverage area also spans 10 other counties across hundreds of miles.

June through September are typically the busiest months, as many crossers die from heatstroke on their journey by foot in triple-digit temperatures and desert-like terrain. The woman who lay on Stern’s autopsy table on Aug. 13 was “markedly dehydrated” and died of hyperthermia.

Stern’s job is unique in that a large number of her patients are unauthorized immigrants, many dying from heat stroke or drowning while attempting to cross the Rio Grande River.

“Because I work down here on the border, a great percentage of my patients are those individuals that die in their attempts to cross the border between Mexico and the United States,” she said.

Although many die from hyperthermia, and others drown while attempting to swim across the Rio Grande River, Stern still conducts an autopsy to determine the cause of death correctly. For women, she checks the reproductive organs to see if she was pregnant. If a dead border crosser was carrying a child at the time of her death, authorities could charge the “coyote” (a person who helps smuggle migrants in exchange for payment) with two counts of murder instead of one.

The woman in Stern’s autopsy room was not pregnant.

Life at the Border: Living Among Law Enforcement

The data show a significant drop in illegal immigration, but numbers don’t tell the complete story about Laredo.

With a 95% Hispanic population, the “Gateway City” is 150 miles from the nearest big city, San Antonio.

Known to outsiders as the United States’ largest inland port of entry, with tens of thousands of semi-trucks passing through with cargo daily, Laredo is largely known to its residents as “safe” and “community-oriented.”

Despite the grim realities of migrant deaths, Laredo was named one of the safest U.S. cities last year by WalletHub. Immigration remains a part of daily life here.

“I love life on the border. Laredo is my home,” Stern said. “It’s one of the safest cities in the country, and I think part of the reason is we have so many boots on the ground.”

At any given moment, Border Patrol cars patrol the city roads and station themselves along the river where city parks are also located. Although Laredo residents are all too familiar with seeing Border Patrol vehicles, some say they’ve noticed an increased presence.

The agents are also locals, frequenting business owner Janet Zapata’s pizza shop, 550 Pizzeria, and other spots like coffee shop Borderland Espresso & Gifts.

Zapata said she’s noticed more agents in recent months, though their presence has been a part of daily life for many people’s entire lives in Laredo — a community where immigration is never far from conversation.

“We think about a lot of the changes that are happening, that are going to happen,” Zapata said.

One of the more noticeable changes is the installation of a military Stryker parked underneath the pedestrian bridge that connects Laredo to its sister city, Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. The armored vehicle sits steps from the Rio Grande River and a city park.

Laredo Border Patrol Chief Jesse Muñoz said there is no militarization of the border, but instead, the vehicle is there in a “supportive role.”

“When I think of military militarization, you think they're coming to do military operations or military things on the border, and that's not the case,” Muñoz said. “They're here to help with border security.”

Public Information Officer Joe Baeza with the Laredo Police Department said this level of enforcement is more than what they’ve seen before.

However, Border Patrol emphasized that this is not a militarization of the border.

“I think we sent a message, and you know one thing is, I don't think the Border Patrol is anti-immigrants or anti-migration. We're anti-illegal immigration,” sector Chief Muñoz said.

Ashley N. Soriano is a bilingual multimedia journalist covering politics and immigration.

It lit up the media. Democrats and civil libertarians denounced the FCC chairman Brendan Carr for violating the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech. Voices on the right, including Senator Ted Cruz, joined them.

Within a week, Kimmel’s show was back on the air.

While bipartisan agreement may be rare, it’s not surprising that it came in defense of the First Amendment – and a popular TV show. A recent poll found that a whopping 90% of respondents called the First Amendment “vital,” while 64% believed it’s so close to perfection that they wouldn’t change a word.

In just 45 words, it bars Congress from establishing or preventing the free exercise of religion, interfering with the peoples’ right to assemble and petition, or abridging freedom of speech or the press.

I’m a historian and scholar of modern U.S. law and politics. Here’s the story of why this amendment – now considered fundamental to American freedom and identity – wasn’t part of the original Constitution and how it was included later on.

Added three years after the Constitution was ratified, it resulted from political compromise and a change of heart by framer James Madison.

Soured on bills of rights

Building a strong national government was the focus of Madison and the other delegates who met in Philadelphia in May 1787 to draft the Constitution.

They believed the government created by the Articles of Confederation after the colonists declared independence was dysfunctional, and the nation was disintegrating.

The government could not pay its debts, defend the frontier or protect commerce from interference by states and foreign governments.

Although Madison and the other framers aimed to create a stronger national government, they cared about protecting liberty. Many had helped create state constitutions that included pioneering bills of rights.

Madison himself played a critical role in securing passage in 1776 of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, a monument to civil liberties.

By the time the Constitutional Convention met, however, Madison had soured on such measures. During the 1780s, he had watched with alarm as state legislatures trampled on rights explicitly guaranteed by their constitutions. Bills of rights, he concluded, weren’t sufficient to protect rights.

So Madison and his colleagues put their faith in reinventing government.

No appetite to haggle

The Constitution they wrote created a government powerful enough to promote the national interests while maintaining a check on state legislatures. It also established a system of checks and balances that ensured federal power wasn’t abused.

In the convention’s waning days, delegates briefly discussed adding a bill of rights but unanimously decided against it. They had sweated through almost four months of a sweltering Philadelphia summer and were ready to go home. When Virginia’s John Rutledge noted “the extreme anxiety of many members of the Convention to bring the business to an end,” he was stating the obvious. With the Constitution in final form, few had the appetite to haggle over the provisions of a bill of rights.

That decision nearly proved fatal when the Constitution went to the states for ratification.

The new Constitution’s supporters, known as Federalists, faced fierce opposition from Anti-Federalists who charged that a powerful national government, unrestrained by a bill of rights, would inevitably lead to tyranny.

Ratification conventions in three of the most critical states – Massachusetts, New York and Virginia – were narrowly divided; ratification hung in the balance. Federalists resisted demands to make ratification contingent on amendments suggested by state conventions. But they agreed to add a bill of rights – after the Constitution was ratified and took effect.

That concession did the trick.

Harmless, possibly helpful

The three critical states ratified without condition, and by midsummer 1788, the Constitution had been approved.

However, when the First Congress met in March 1789, the Federalist majority didn’t prioritize a bill of rights. They had won and were ready to move on.

Madison, now a Federalist leader in the House of Representatives, insisted that his party keep its word. He warned that failure to do so would undermine trust in the new government and give Anti-Federalists ammunition to demand a new convention to do what Congress had left undone.

But Madison wasn’t just arguing for his party keeping its word. He had also changed his mind.

The ratification debates and Madison’s correspondence with Thomas Jefferson led him to think differently about a bill of rights. He now thought it harmless and possibly helpful. Its provisions, Madison conceded, might become “fundamental maxims of a free government” and part of “the national sentiment.” Broad popular support for a bill of rights might provide a check on government officials and how they wielded power.

Madison pushed his colleagues relentlessly. Wary of provisions that would weaken the national government, he developed a slate of amendments focused on individual rights. Ultimately, Congress approved 12 amendments – ensuring rights from freedom of speech to protection from cruel and unusual punishment – and sent them to the states for ratification.

First Amendment no cure-all

By the end of 1791, 10 of them – including the First Amendment ≠ had been ratified.

As Madison anticipated, the First Amendment wasn’t a cure for a government bent on suppressing dissent. From the Sedition Act in the 1790s to McCarthyism in the 1950s and the Trump administration’s assault on the First Amendment, government has used its awesome powers to pursue and punish critics.

On occasion, courts have intervened to protect First Amendment rights, a weapon Madison didn’t anticipate. But not always.

Perhaps the ultimate protection for First Amendment rights is “national sentiment,” as Madison suggested. Norm-breaking presidents can disregard the law, and judges may cave. But public sentiment is a powerful force, as Jimmy Kimmel can attest.

In State of Illinois v. Donald J. Trump, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit addressed the scope of presidential authority to federalize and deploy National Guard forces under 10 U.S.C. § 12406 in response to protests surrounding federal immigration enforcement in Illinois. The dispute arose after President Trump, citing threats to federal agents and facilities during “Operation Midway Blitz,” ordered the federalization and deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois over the Governor’s objection. The State of Illinois and the City of Chicago sued, arguing the legal predicates for § 12406 were unmet and that the action violated the Tenth Amendment and the Posse Comitatus Act.

The district court issued a temporary restraining order (TRO) enjoining both federalization and deployment. On expedited review, the Seventh Circuit concluded that the TRO was appealable, rejected the administration’s argument that the President’s § 12406 determinations are unreviewable, and—giving the President substantial deference on facts—held that the record did not satisfy § 12406’s predicates. The court denied a stay as to deployment but continued a stay of the portion of the TRO that had enjoined federalization, effectively allowing the federal government to maintain federal control of Guard members but forbidding their deployment within Illinois pending appeal.

The opinion establishes two key clarifications with broad significance: (1) presidential call-ups under § 12406 are judicially reviewable because the statute enumerates factual predicates; and (2) political protests, even disruptive and occasionally violent, do not amount to a “rebellion” within § 12406(2) absent organized, deliberate violent resistance to governmental authority. The court also found insufficient evidence that federal authorities were “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws” within the meaning of § 12406(3).

Summary of the Opinion

Appealability: The TRO was appealable because it bore the “hallmarks” of a preliminary injunction—an adversary hearing, extensive submissions, and thorough reasoning.

Reviewability: The President’s decision to federalize and deploy the National Guard under § 12406 is judicially reviewable; Martin v. Mott and Dalton v. Specter do not bar review of statutory predicates in this context.

Deference and Standard of Review: While the court affords the President “a great level of deference” to factual assessments in national security contexts, it reviews statutory meaning de novo and district court factfinding for clear error.

§ 12406(2) “Rebellion”: Political opposition and protest—even if organized, persistent, and marred by isolated unlawful incidents—does not constitute a “rebellion or danger of rebellion” absent organized violent resistance to governmental authority.

§ 12406(3) “Unable with the regular forces”: On this record, federal enforcement activities were continuing successfully; thus, even under a deferential “significant impediment” standard, the predicate was unmet.

Tenth Amendment: The state-sovereignty claim rises and falls with the statutory predicates; because those predicates are unmet on this record, deploying Guard troops over the state’s objection likely infringes Illinois’s Tenth Amendment interests.

Stay factors: The administration failed to show likelihood of success or irreparable harm outweighing the state’s sovereign injury. The court therefore denied a stay as to deployment but continued to stay the bar on federalization itself.

Disposition: Motion to stay pending appeal granted in part and denied in part. The administration may keep the Guard federalized but may not deploy National Guard forces within Illinois pending appeal.

Factual and Procedural Background

Operation Midway Blitz (Sept. 8): The administration increased immigration enforcement in Illinois, focusing attention on ICE’s Broadview processing facility. Protests—longstanding but generally small—grew in size but typically remained under 200 persons, with occasional road closures and arrests.

Escalation and Response (late Sept.–Oct. 4): DHS requested troop support, and federal officials anticipated increased chemical agent use. Illinois formed a Unified Command and implemented designated protest areas. State and local law enforcement contained incidents without DHS intervention on several days; federal facilities remained open.

Federalization Orders (Oct. 4–5): The President invoked § 12406, asserting coordinated assaults impeded federal law enforcement and that regular forces were insufficient. Illinois objected. The Secretary of Defense federalized Guard troops, referencing threats and planned operations, including federalizing up to 400 Texas Guard members for deployment in Illinois and Oregon.

Government Messaging: DHS publicized the success of Operation Midway Blitz, noting increased arrests and deportations and that protests had not slowed ICE operations—facts the court later treated as undercutting “inability” claims.

District Court TRO (Oct. 9): Enjoined federalization and deployment for 14 days; found neither the “rebellion” nor “inability” predicates met; gave limited credit to federal declarants where contradicted by objective evidence and state/local accounts.

Seventh Circuit Administrative Stay: Allowed Guard members to remain under federal control but blocked deployment while considering the stay motion; final stay ruling continues that arrangement pending appeal.

Analysis

Precedents Cited and Their Influence

Martin v. Mott, 25 U.S. (12 Wheat.) 19 (1827): The administration invoked Martin to argue the President’s call-up determinations are conclusive. The Seventh Circuit distinguished Martin as addressing subordinate officers’ obligation to obey orders in wartime invasion, not whether courts may review if statutory predicates exist in peacetime domestic operations. Thus, Martin does not preclude judicial review here.

Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462 (1994): Dalton’s bar on reviewing actions “committed to the discretion of the President” did not apply because § 12406 enumerates specific, reviewable predicates and does not make the President the sole judge of their existence.

Newsom v. Trump, 141 F.4th 1032 (9th Cir. 2025): The Seventh Circuit aligned with the Ninth Circuit that § 12406 decisions are reviewable and that courts should afford “a great level of deference” to presidential factfinding. It noted—but did not adopt or reject—the Ninth Circuit’s interpretations that “unable” means “significantly impeded” and “regular forces” means federal officers.

Sterling v. Constantin, 287 U.S. 378 (1932): Cited to show executive discretion in deploying military forces is given a “permitted range of honest judgment,” but courts still review whether underlying conditions legally justify deployment.

Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1 (2010); Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57 (1981): Support the notion that courts defer to the political branches’ national security factfinding but ultimately retain their role in statutory interpretation.

Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369 (2024): Emphasized that interpretation of statutes is “precisely the business of the judiciary,” underscoring the court’s independent role in defining § 12406’s terms.

Department of Education v. California, 604 U.S. 650 (2025) (per curiam); Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579 (2018); Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974): Provided the framework for treating a TRO as appealable when it bears the hallmarks of a preliminary injunction.

Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418 (2009); Camelot Banquet Rooms, Inc. v. SBA, 14 F.4th 624 (7th Cir. 2021): Articulated the stay factors applied by the court.

United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598 (2000): Reinforced that general police powers reside with the states, a background principle informing the Tenth Amendment analysis.

Preston v. Thompson, 589 F.2d 300 (7th Cir. 1978): Recognized that violations of constitutional rights, including state sovereignty interests, constitute irreparable harm.

Legal Reasoning

1) Judicial Review of § 12406 Actions

The court held that because § 12406 enumerates specific triggering conditions—(1) invasion, (2) rebellion or danger of rebellion, or (3) inability to execute federal law with the regular forces—the President’s invocation is judicially reviewable. Nothing in the text renders the President the sole, unreviewable judge of those predicates. Martin v. Mott and Dalton v. Specter do not foreclose judicial review in this context.

2) Deference to Executive Factfinding; Standards of Review

The court granted “a great level of deference” to the President’s factual assessments in national security matters. Still, it reviewed statutory interpretation de novo. On the preliminary record, the district court’s factfinding—crediting state and local declarations and objective evidence over federal declarants the court found omitted material information—was not clearly erroneous. That factual backdrop drove the statutory analysis.

3) Defining “Rebellion” Under § 12406(2)

The Seventh Circuit substantially endorsed the district court’s approach in Newsom: a “rebellion” entails organized, deliberate violent resistance to governmental authority, often avowed and aimed against the government as a whole, not mere opposition to a single law or policy. The court emphasized:

“Political opposition is not rebellion.”

Protests—even organized, sustained, and accompanied by civil disobedience or sporadic unlawful incidents—do not become a rebellion.

Isolated violence by rogue participants falls within the space between protected speech and rebellion; it does not suffice to trigger § 12406(2).

Applying this understanding to the record—including small-to-moderate gatherings, episodic arrests, effective containment by state/local authorities, and continuing federal operations—the court found insufficient evidence of an actual or threatened rebellion.

4) “Unable with the Regular Forces to Execute the Laws” Under § 12406(3)

The court did not definitively resolve two interpretive disputes: whether “unable” means “significantly impeded” (Ninth Circuit’s view) or “incapable” (district court), and whether “regular forces” means federal officers broadly (Ninth Circuit) or the regular armed forces. The Seventh Circuit held that, under either understanding, the record showed continued and successful immigration enforcement:

Federal facilities remained open and operational despite protests.

State and local Unified Command effectively contained disruptions; DHS intervention was not required on key dates.

DHS and ICE publicly touted enforcement successes and increased arrests, undermining any claim of “inability.”

Accordingly, § 12406(3)’s predicate was not met on this record.

5) Tenth Amendment Considerations

Because Congress has constitutional authority to provide for calling forth the militia (U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 15), the Tenth Amendment question tracks whether § 12406’s predicates are satisfied. On this record they were not, making deployment over the state’s objection a likely violation of Illinois’s reserved sovereignty interests. The court gave particular weight to the proposed deployment of out-of-state Guard units (e.g., Texas) into Illinois, heightening the sovereignty injury.

6) Stay Factors: Balancing Equities and Public Interest

The administration failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits or irreparable harm absent a stay. By contrast, the state faced irreparable sovereign injury from unlawful deployment. The public interest favored avoiding unnecessary military presence in domestic policing. However, the court considered the harm from allowing temporary federalization (without deployment) relatively minimal at this stage and thus continued to stay the TRO’s bar on federalization while maintaining the bar on deployment.

Impact

Judicial Review Cemented: The decision solidifies that § 12406 invocations are reviewable and not committed to unreviewable presidential discretion. This aligns with the Ninth Circuit and sets the stage for consistent nationwide treatment unless the Supreme Court intervenes.

Meaningful Limitation on “Rebellion”: By clarifying that political protest—even disruptive and occasionally violent—is not a “rebellion” without organized violent resistance to governmental authority, the court places a high bar on using § 12406(2) to federalize and deploy Guard forces in response to domestic dissent.

Evidence Matters for “Inability”: Government messaging that enforcement is proceeding apace can undercut claims of inability under § 12406(3). Agencies invoking § 12406 must curate a consistent evidentiary record of actual impediment or incapacity—mere inconvenience or episodic disruption will not suffice.

State Sovereignty Emphasized: Deployment of federalized Guard into a state over the Governor’s objection, especially involving out-of-state Guard units, poses severe Tenth Amendment concerns that courts will treat as irreparable harm in equitable balancing.

Remedial Middle Path: The court’s interim remedy—allowing federalization while forbidding deployment—offers a pragmatic template in fast-moving crises, preserving federal command arrangements while preventing premature military use on the streets absent lawful predicates.

Convergence with, Yet Distinction from, the Ninth Circuit: The Seventh Circuit sidestepped resolving contested definitions of “unable” and “regular forces,” holding the government lost even under the Ninth Circuit’s more government-friendly readings. This minimizes circuit conflict for now but leaves doctrinal questions open.

Signals for Future Litigation: The opinion’s careful parsing of “rebellion” and “inability,” its reliance on objective, local-law-enforcement evidence, and its attention to agency press releases will inform both executive-branch decision-making and state litigation strategies in any future domestic deployments.

Complex Concepts Simplified

Federalization vs. Deployment:

Federalization (Title 10 status): National Guard members come under federal command and become part of the U.S. armed forces. They are subject to federal law and restrictions (including the Posse Comitatus Act).

Deployment: Actual use of those federalized forces for missions, here proposed for domestic protection of federal agents/facilities in Illinois.

10 U.S.C. § 12406 (Call of the National Guard into Federal Service): Authorizes presidential call-up of National Guard in limited circumstances—(1) invasion, (2) rebellion/danger thereof, (3) inability to execute federal laws with regular forces.

“Regular forces”: The statute’s phrase is debated. Some courts read it as including federal law enforcement officers; others as limited to the regular armed forces. The Seventh Circuit left the question open in this posture.

Posse Comitatus Act (18 U.S.C. § 1385): Generally prohibits the Army and Air Force (and by policy, the Navy and Marine Corps) from participating in civilian law enforcement absent express authorization (e.g., the Insurrection Act). When Guard members are federalized (Title 10), PCA constraints apply to them.

Tenth Amendment and State Sovereignty: Reserves general police powers to the states. While Congress can authorize federal call-ups of militia, deploying federalized troops for domestic law enforcement over a state’s objection without meeting statutory predicates implicates state sovereignty and can be enjoined.

Standards on Emergency Relief:

Appealability of TROs: A TRO can be appealed if it has the practical features of a preliminary injunction (adversary hearing, thorough merits reasoning, etc.).

Stay Pending Appeal: Requires showing likelihood of success and irreparable harm; court then balances harms and considers the public interest.

Standards of Review: District court factfinding is reviewed for clear error; statutory interpretation is reviewed de novo; executive factfinding may receive deference, especially in national security contexts.

Insurrection Act vs. § 12406: The Insurrection Act (10 U.S.C. §§ 251–255) authorizes use of active-duty military in limited circumstances (e.g., suppression of insurrection, enforcement of federal law when impracticable through ordinary means). Section 12406 pertains specifically to calling the National Guard into federal service. This case concerns § 12406, not the Insurrection Act.

What the Court Did Not Decide

It did not set a definitive test for “unable” or “regular forces” under § 12406(3); it held the administration failed even under the more lenient interpretations.

It did not reach or resolve the Posse Comitatus claim, because the statutory predicates for federalization/deployment were dispositive at this stage.

It did not permanently enjoin federal control; it left Guard members under federal command but barred their deployment within Illinois during the appeal.

It did not foreclose future federalization or deployment should facts materially change to satisfy § 12406’s predicates.

Practical Guidance and Implications

For the Executive Branch:

Build a consistent, evidence-based record of actual organized violent resistance (for § 12406(2)) or concrete, significant inability of federal forces to execute the laws (for § 12406(3)).

Align public communications with legal positions; claims of enforcement “success” may undermine assertions of “inability.”

Document unsuccessful reliance on federal officers and cooperative state/local measures before invoking military support.

For States and Localities:

Establish unified command structures and document effective containment using civilian law enforcement.

Preserve objective evidence (e.g., surveillance footage, incident logs) to counter claims of rebellion or inability.

Emphasize sovereignty harms, especially where out-of-state federalized Guard units are slated for in-state deployment.

For Courts:

Maintain deference to executive factfinding while rigorously enforcing statutory predicates.

Use calibrated interim remedies (e.g., permitting federalization but enjoining deployment) to balance equities in fast-moving situations.

Conclusion

The Seventh Circuit’s decision sets an important marker on the limits of executive power to deploy military forces domestically under § 12406. It clarifies that courts will review whether statutory predicates are met; that “political opposition is not rebellion”; and that claims of enforcement incapacity must be grounded in demonstrable, not rhetorical, impediments. The court’s nuanced remedial approach—allowing federalization but barring deployment—protects state sovereignty while preserving federal command arrangements during ongoing litigation.

Going forward, the opinion will guide executive branch lawyers, state attorneys general, and district courts evaluating federal call-ups during periods of civil unrest. It underscores the judiciary’s role in policing the boundaries of statutory authority, even while according deference to the political branches in matters of national security. Most practically, it warns that deploying the National Guard into a state over its objection requires more than sporadic disorder; it requires evidence of organized violent resistance or an actual breakdown in the capacity of federal forces to execute federal law.",https://www.casemine.com/images/casemine-share.jpg,N,,2025-10-19 01:02:03.003793
,Litigation,2025-10-18 10:54:10+00:00,Chicago Tribune,Chicago's federal court feeling impact of government shutdown,Jason Meisner,,,,,https://www.chicagotribune.com/2025/10/17/chicago-federal-court-operations-shutdown/,"The ongoing federal government shutdown is starting to have dire consequences at Chicago’s Dirksen U.S.
Courthouse, where money has run out to pay staff and some jury trials have already been canceled amid growing uncertainty.
“I think we have funding to make it to the end of the year as far as paying jurors,” Kendall said.
After that, they’ll be working without pay as “excepted” employees in order to keep the court’s constitutional functions running, she said.
Kendall said the courthouse staff is keeping a stiff upper lip, but the prospect of working without pay is daunting especially in an uncertain economy.","The ongoing federal government shutdown is starting to have dire consequences at Chicago’s Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, where money has run out to pay staff and some jury trials have already been canceled amid growing uncertainty.

In one bit of good news, however, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts notified all federal courts nationwide this week that there are sufficient funds to continue to pay jurors and grand jurors for up to about three months.

U.S. District Chief Judge Virginia Kendall told the Tribune on Friday that the announcement was “out of the blue,” but the exact date the funding would run out was unclear.

“I think we have funding to make it to the end of the year as far as paying jurors,” Kendall said.

Still, the ongoing shutdown, which began Oct. 1 and currently has no end in sight, prompted Kendall to announce Friday the U.S. District Courts in Chicago are now entering “Phase 2” of its shutdown operations, stopping salary payments to courthouse employees and reducing operations at the clerk’s office to only “excepted activities” such as constitutional functions.

While the courthouse will remain open, Kendall said that workers — from docketing employees to clerks and courtroom staff — will get their last paycheck on Oct. 24. After that, they’ll be working without pay as “excepted” employees in order to keep the court’s constitutional functions running, she said.

Kendall said the courthouse staff is keeping a stiff upper lip, but the prospect of working without pay is daunting especially in an uncertain economy.

“Regardless of your political position, it’s critical that the court has stay open for those seeking redress, and it’s unfortunate that Congress is not understanding that those individuals working to keep it open are citizens who need to support their families,” Kendall said.

The shutdown initially affected only civil litigation involving the United States as a party since the court keeps a reserve of funds that allow most operations to continue.

Despite that, judges in several criminal cases at the Dirksen courthouse this week decided to move jury trials that were imminent to avoid having to shut it down in the middle of proceedings.

Among the cases postponed was that of Antoine Larry, a police officer in south suburban Phoenix who had been scheduled to go on trial Wednesday on charges he shook down drug dealers for money.

Also canceled was the trial starting Wednesday of Jawad Fakroune, a Moroccan national accused of threatening and assaulting a Chicago restaurateur to collect a debt Fakroune claimed he was owed. In a minute order last week, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah said the “uncertainty” surrounding the lapse in appropriations could affect the ability to summon jurors in the near future.

“Although circumstances could change between now and (the start of trial), the court concludes that resetting the trial will allow the parties a better opportunity to reasonably and effectively prepare for the trial,” Shah wrote. Fakroune’s trial was reset for January.

Kendall said that because of the way jurors are called in for service, some judges went forward with canceling trials before it was known this week that funding would indeed be available to pay the panel. She said she’s since told the 34 district judges that “If you have a trial this year and you haven’t canceled yet, I think we have funding to make it to the end of the year.”

While government shutdowns — and threatened ones — have affected the courts numerous times over the past decade and a half, the situation this year is the most serious since 2013, when federal workers who were deemed “essential” reported to work but went without paychecks until Congress later approved the money.

At the U.S. attorney’s office that year, about a third of its 300 employees — mostly from its civil litigation and support staff — were sent home during the budget stalemate. Most of the office’s approximately 125 criminal prosecutors are exempt from budget-related furloughs, and their work would not be affected.

Joseph Fitzpatrick, a spokesman for current U.S. Attorney Andrew Boutros, said Friday the office had furloughed about a quarter of its staff, also mostly civil litigation and support employees.

Kendall said the Federal Defender Program, the not-for-profit that represents clients who can’t pay for their own lawyer, has told her they have enough funding to last through November.

How long the shutdown lasts this time around is anyone’s guess, but there is no doubt the money will run out eventually.

In 2013, then-U.S. District Chief Judge Ruben Castillo told the Tribune that if the stalemate hadn’t been resolved, he was prepared to send a doomsday email that would have halted all trials at the busy downtown courthouse because he had no more money to pay jurors and court-appointed attorneys or cover other costs of a trial.

Officials in Washington had told Castillo to give jurors IOUs for their service if necessary — something he refused to do.

She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order.","The Trump administration says it has paused work on only a small share of the roughly 4,000 mass layoffs announced since Oct. 1, in order to comply with a court order.

That includes more than 400 Department of Housing and Urban Development employees, 465 Education Department staff and 102 people with the Census Bureau, according to court filings released Friday.

Friday's court filing came amid a legal fight between the administration and two federal employee unions — the American Federation of Government Employees and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees — which sued to block what they call ""politically driven RIFs,"" or reductions in force.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in the Northern District of California granted the unions a temporary restraining order (TRO), halting some of the layoffs announced Oct. 10 and preventing new firings until she holds another hearing on Oct. 28 to consider an indefinite pause.

As part of her order, Illston also directed the government to provide the court with ""an accounting of all RIFs, actual or imminent, that are enjoined by this TRO.""

In more than 30 declarations filed by the defendant agencies Friday afternoon, Trump administration officials provided some details about the layoffs and repeatedly stated they would not proceed with RIFs blocked by the court order.

At the same time, the administration made clear it believes most of the employees who have already received layoff notices – or are expected to in the near future – are not covered by the court order, which only applies to programs or offices where the union plaintiffs have members or bargaining units.

In a status conference Friday evening, Illston said she didn't think agencies should be carrying out layoffs while the temporary restraining order was in effect and urged the government to ""err on the side of caution.""

She described this moment as a terrible situation, adding ""We ought not make it worse.""

The government's attorney Elizabeth Hedges repeatedly told the judge that the government was doing everything it could to comply with her order.

The plaintiffs' attorney Danielle Leonard repeatedly said the government had taken too narrow an interpretation of the order.

In some cases, agencies indicated they believed the court order does not apply to their employees because their agency no longer has an obligation to bargain with the unions.

Earlier this year, President Trump issued an executive order ending collective bargaining rights for most federal workers citing national security concerns, including at agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Thomas Nagy, a human resources official with HHS, referenced the executive order in his declaration to the court about the 982 RIFs at HHS announced since the shutdown.

""HHS has not issued any RIF notices implicated by the Court's TRO,"" he wrote. ""Although CDC did previously have AFGE bargaining units, HHS terminated the relevant Collective Bargaining Agreements on August 26, 2025, pursuant to Executive Order 14251.""

During the status hearing, the plaintiffs' attorney Leonard noted that the cancellation of collective bargaining rights at many agencies is under legal dispute. She asked the judge to clarify the wording of the temporary restraining order to ensure that employees of bargaining units affected by Trump's executive order are covered by the court order. Illston agreed to that change.

The plaintiffs also asked the court to add three more unions to the lawsuit and to the temporary restraining order, to broaden the number of employees who would be covered by the pause on RIFs.

Illston agreed to add the three unions to the temporary restraining order and said she would consider adding them as plaintiffs in the case at the next hearing.

At the hearing on Wednesday, Illston characterized the Trump administration's approach to the most recent RIFs as ""ready, fire, aim"" and said the administration was seeking to take advantage of the lapse in funding ""to assume that all bets are off, that the laws don't apply to them anymore, and that they can impose the structures that they like on a government situation that they don't like.""

In response, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called Illston ""another far left, partisan judge.""

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Leavitt added that the White House is confident their actions are legal and called the layoffs ""an unfortunate consequence"" of the government shutdown.

OMB Director Russ Vought said Wednesday close to 10,000 people could receive layoff notices during the shutdown, shortly before the judge blocked firing plans from taking effect.

While the White House promised ""substantial"" firings during the shutdown, the layoffs announced so far amount to only a fraction of the federal employees who have left the government since Trump returned to the White House in January.

Back in August, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said roughly 300,000 federal workers would be gone from the government by the end of the year. OPM director Scott Kupor told news outlets that 80% of those departures were voluntary.

That means even prior to the shutdown, roughly 60,000 federal workers faced involuntary separation, according to Kupor's estimates.

Another 154,000 workers took the Trump administration's ""Fork in the Road"" buyout offer, according to OPM. Many who took the buyout told NPR they feared they would be fired if they didn't leave.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/2364x1330+0+246/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F0a%2Fc1bf8e494d09bf8efdd61a21b938%2Fgettyimages-2238023122.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 06:57:00.658123

His lawyers filed an emergency appeal urging the court to set aside rulings of judges in Chicago and hold that National Guard troops are needed to protect U.S. immigration agents from hostile protesters.

The case escalates the clash between Trump and Democratic state officials over immigration enforcement and raises again the question of using military-style force in American cities. Trump’s lawyers have repeatedly gone to the Supreme Court and won quick rulings when lower-court judges have blocked his actions.

Federal law authorizes the president to call into service the National Guard if he cannot “execute the laws of the United States” or faces “a rebellion or danger of rebellion against the authority” of the U.S. government.

“Both conditions are satisfied here,” Trump’s lawyer said.

Judges in Chicago came to the opposite conclusion. U.S. District Judge April Perry saw no “danger of rebellion” and said the laws were being enforced. She accused Trump’s lawyers of exaggerating claims of violence and equating “protests with riots.”

She handed down a restraining order on Oct. 9, and the 7th Circuit Court agreed to keep it in force.

But Trump’s lawyers insisted that protesters and demonstrators were targeting U.S. immigration agents and preventing them from doing their work.

“Confronted with intolerable risks of harm to federal agents and coordinated, violent opposition to the enforcement of federal law, the President lawfully determines that he is unable to enforce the laws of the United States with the regular forces and calls up the National Guard to defend federal personnel, property, and functions in the face of ongoing violence,” Solicitor Gen. D. John Sauer wrote in a 40-page appeal.

He argued that historically the president has had the full authority to decide on whether to call up the militia. Judges may not second-guess the president’s decision, he said.

“Any such review [by judges] must be highly deferential, as the 9th Circuit has concluded in the Newsom litigation,” referring to the ruling that upheld Trump’s deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles.

Trump’s lawyer said the troop deployment to Los Angeles had succeeded in reducing violence.

“Notwithstanding the Governor of California’s claim that deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles would ‘escalat[e]’ the ongoing violence that California itself had failed to prevent ... the President’s action had the opposite, intended effect. In the face of federal military force, violence in Los Angeles decreased and the situation substantially improved,” he told the court.

But in recent weeks, “Chicago has been the site of organized and often violent protests directed at ICE officers and other federal personnel engaged in the execution of federal immigration laws,” he wrote. “On multiple occasions, federal officers have also been hit and punched by protesters. ... Rioters have targeted federal officers with fireworks and have thrown bottles, rocks, and tear gas at them.”

“More than 30 [DHS] officers have been injured during the assaults on federal law enforcement” at the Broadview facility alone, resulting in multiple hospitalizations, he wrote.

Officials in Illinois blamed aggressive enforcement actions of ICE agents for triggering the protests.

Sauer also urged the court to hand down an immediate order that would freeze Perry’s rulings.

Mr Trump and his allies have described these cities as lawless, crime-ravaged and plagued with vast, violent protests in need of military intervention.
Demonstrations over the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts have been largely peaceful and limited in size, according to local officials, far from the “war zone” conditions described by Mr Trump.
Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Mr Trump.
A judge blocked the deployment – extending that order on Oct 16 – and an appellate court has heard arguments in the administration’s appeal.","- US President Donald Trump’s administration asked the Supreme Court on Oct 17 to allow his deployment of National Guard troops to the Chicago area, as the Republican President moves to dispatch military personnel to a growing number of Democratic-led locales and expand the use of the armed forces for domestic purposes.

The Justice Department asked the court to block a judge’s ruling that halted the deployment of hundreds of troops over the objection of Illinois state officials and local leaders, while litigation challenging Mr Trump’s plan continues.

Given events on the ground, the judge questioned the administration’s

stated reasons for sending in the military

. A federal appeals court upheld the judge’s ruling on Oct 16, also doubting the administration’s stated justification.

The administration has stated that danger to federal property and personnel posed by protests against Mr Trump’s hardline immigration enforcement policies justified the president’s deployment of troops.

In a written filing, the Justice Department called the assessment by local officials of these protests as “implausibly rosy” and urged immediate action.

Federal law enforcement agencies “have been forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence,” the department said. “Local forces have failed to respond, or unaccountably delayed their response, even when federal agents face life-threatening violence.”

The Supreme Court asked Illinois and Chicago officials to respond to the Justice Department’s request by Oct 20 afternoon.

“Donald Trump will keep trying to invade Illinois with troops – and we will keep defending the sovereignty of our state,” Democratic Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker wrote on social media.

“Militarising our communities against their will is not only un-American but also leads us down a dangerous path for our democracy. What will come next?”

Mr Trump ordered National Guard troops to Chicago, the third-largest US city, and Portland, Oregon following his

earlier deployments to Los Angeles

, Memphis and Washington.

He has sought to use military forces to suppress protests and support domestic immigration enforcement.

Mr Trump and his allies have described these cities as lawless, crime-ravaged and plagued with vast, violent protests in need of military intervention.

Democratic mayors and governors, along with other Trump critics, have said these claims are a false account of the situation and a pretext for sending troops to punish adversaries, accusing Mr Trump of abusing his power.

Federal judges have expressed scepticism over the administration’s view of events on the ground. Demonstrations over the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement efforts have been largely peaceful and limited in size, according to local officials, far from the “war zone” conditions described by Mr Trump.

Testing the limits

Though Mr Trump has suggested troops can be used to tackle crime, National Guard and other military personnel under US law are not typically permitted to engage in civilian law enforcement. While a US president can deploy the National Guard under certain authorities, Mr Trump is testing the limits of those powers by sending troops to cities controlled by his political adversaries.

The legal dispute centres on Mr Trump’s invocation of a federal law that allows a president to federalise National Guard troops only in the case of rebellion or if he is “unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

The administration in October federalised 300 Illinois National Guard troops and also ordered more Texas National Guard troops into the state.

In the face of criticism and pushback from local leaders, Mr Trump escalated his threats, calling on Oct 8 for the mayor of Chicago and the governor of Illinois, both Democrats, to be jailed, accusing them of failing to protect immigration officers.

Illinois and Chicago sued the administration over the deployment. On Oct 9, Chicago-based US District Judge April Perry, an appointee of former president Joe Biden, a Democrat, temporarily blocked the move.

Judge Perry said the administration’s claims of violence during protests at an immigration facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, Illinois, where a small group of demonstrators had gathered daily for weeks, were unreliable.

In a written opinion, Judge Perry faulted administration officials for “equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning and criticising their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting or doing violence”.

There is no evidence of a danger of rebellion in Illinois or that the law is not being enforced, the judge said, adding that a National Guard deployment “will only add fuel to the fire”.

A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined to lift Judge Perry’s order blocking the deployment, concluding that “the facts do not justify the President’s actions in Illinois”.

Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Mr Trump.

Officials from Portland and Oregon are pursuing a separate legal challenge to Mr Trump’s planned deployment to that city. A judge blocked the deployment – extending that order on Oct 16 – and an appellate court has heard arguments in the administration’s appeal.

“In New York City, ICE officers tackled a photojournalist filming protests outside a courthouse, claiming she had assaulted them.
They prohibit using city resources for federal immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant.
They require that ICE warrants be verified by city personnel and that the city solicitor review any administrative subpoenas before compliance.
Our officers respond to Providence residents.","“It comes down to creating trust and accountability mechanisms here in Providence. While it’s clear and important to acknowledge that this alone isn’t going to stop ICE officials from creating and continuing barbaric actions, it’s going to set a precedent on where the Providence lies in terms of what our values are as a city, not only as individual councilors but as a city as a whole. Many elected officials, including the Mayor, have said that Providence is a welcoming city, and we welcome everyone. Providence has a diverse history of immigration, whether it was the Italians and Irish or the Latino communities today - at the end of the day, immigration is the backbone of our city.

“We’re a working-class, welcoming, and diverse city. What’s before us today is to put clear accountability mechanisms into the city ordinances. There will now be a mechanism for the people we serve to hold us accountable as elected officials. There’s also going to be an avenue of accountability for individuals - that has always been the case since 2017 - but now we’re going to add organizations.

“What happens when someone is detained is that they are transported to another facility. That’s what we’re seeing. Someone might be detained here in Providence but quickly transported to Louisiana or Texas. Usually, the deported individual doesn’t have the resources to hold the city accountable if there is certain collaboration between the Providence Police Department and immigration officials, but now there’s going to be an avenue where organizations hold us accountable to our values - values we all share.

“This has been worked collaboratively with many partners locally and federally. We’ve been working with the mayor’s office the past couple of days, and I don’t want to speak for the mayor, but I believe he is very supportive of where we’re at today with this ordinance because at the end of the day, we all want to have a welcoming city with clear procedures and policies when it comes to our colleagues on the police department and immigration officials. At the end of the day, what we all want is a safe, welcoming city and accountability measures.”

“If I may pivot outside of Providence, we’ve seen horrific stories about ICE’s abuse. Several days ago in Houston, a mother was selling fruit on the corner with her children when her 15-year-old son, who has autism and the cognitive ability of a 4-year-old, asked to use the bathroom. Minutes later, he was gone. ICE agents had taken him. The family spent days not knowing where he was until they learned he had been placed in a federal children’s detention facility, but no one told them. No one even thought to call. Imagine the terror of a mother who doesn’t know where a child is, only to find out he’s been locked in federal custody for days.

“Then in Chicago, a woman driving to work was slammed by an unmarked federal SUV. Witnesses yelled, ‘Hit and run!’ as agents jumped out, dragged her out of the car by her legs, and detained her at gunpoint. She was a U.S. citizen, just cleared by her doctor to return to work after surgery.

“In New York City, ICE officers tackled a photojournalist filming protests outside a courthouse, claiming she had assaulted them. They arrested her, cuffed her, and later released her with no charges because, what do you know? There was no assault. The only thing she was guilty of was recording their actions.

“In California, a U.S. Army veteran who served in the Iraq war, an American citizen on his way to work security at a farm, was surrounded by ICE agents, tear gassed in his car, and dragged out. He was detained for days, stripped, placed on suicide watch, and kept under 24-hour light in his cell. His family had no idea where he was. His ID was sitting in the car they towed away. He later told reporters that the only thing he could think about while being locked up was seeing his kids again.

“Perhaps most haunting of all is what we saw in Chicago. Days ago, a massive pre-dawn raid at South Shore Drive, residents awoke to Black Hawk helicopters overhead, flash bangs, and hundreds of agents in combat gear storming their building. Doors were kicked in. Children were zip-tied on the sidewalk. Birth certificates and belongings were thrown into the hallway. Thirty-seven people were reportedly arrested, but many of those detained were U.S. citizens or lawful residents. The Department of Homeland Security called it a joint operation, but residents called it what it was: a military style assault on their neighborhood.

“This is what happens when a federal agency operates without restraint. This is what we mean when we say ICE is a rogue agency. And of course, Providence is not immune. This week on Chalkstone Avenue, an unmarked ICE vehicle ran a red light with its lights on but no siren. It struck another car, jumped a sidewalk, and snapped a telephone pole. Witnesses said it was chasing another unmarked vehicle through a city intersection.

“Back in July, ICE crashed into a suspect’s car on Alverson Street, and Providence Officers were found to have assisted them, violating both department policy and city ordinance.

“According to records, as of September 21, 2025, ICE held nearly 60,000 people in detention, and over 71% had no criminal conviction whatsoever. These are not hardened criminals. They are parents, workers, students, and neighbors. When people in our city, especially those who are undocumented, believe that calling 911 could bring immigration agents to their door, they stop calling. Crimes go unreported. Victims go unprotected. Predators roam free. That makes all of us less safe.

“The amendments before you tonight make this law enforceable. They spell out cooperation and include every indirect way local resources are pulled into immigration enforcement, like setting parameters, sharing data, offering staging space, or providing equipment. They prohibit using city resources for federal immigration enforcement without a judicial warrant. They add protections against profiling based on immigration status or citizenship. They stiffen privacy safeguards or limit data sharing with outside agencies. They require that ICE warrants be verified by city personnel and that the city solicitor review any administrative subpoenas before compliance. They empower the residents to take legal action if the city fails to follow this law.

“Before I conclude my remarks, I want to remind us that what we’re doing tonight is constitutional. The 10th Amendment’s anti-commandeering principle clarifies that the federal government cannot force local police to enforce federal law. Our officers respond to Providence residents. I know that’s a radical idea, but they don’t answer to what happens in Washington, and our laws should reflect that.

“The question we have before us is: Do we want to be a city where a mother can report abuse without worrying about which badge shows up at her door, where a child can walk home from school without finding himself in the middle of a federal convoy, and where our police are focused on protecting our residents and not enforcing civil immigration law? Nationally and in Providence, the record shows an agency operating with impunity, sweeping up citizens and non-citizens alike and sowing distrust in local enforcement.

“I value what the community did in 2017 in passing the CPRA, but the landscape has changed, and I don’t believe it’s enough. I think these amendments bring the CPRA clarity and the power it needs to protect our residents, uphold the constitution, and keep Providence safe.”","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Hdi3!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4c41be43-894f-4841-84df-cc1a5c122558_1500x844.jpeg",N,,2025-10-18 14:57:49.799654

David McSwane",,,,,https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dhs-ice-secret-police-civil-rights-unaccountable,"When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.
The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official.
“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.
The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported.","When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.

Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.

“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”

One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”

And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”

During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.

Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere. “It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.

Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns. They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.

And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.

One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”

Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”

The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”

Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.

The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.

The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.

The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.

Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.

“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”

Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”

“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.

In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.

“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.

McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”

“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.

Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.

The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.

“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.”

“Authoritarian Playbook”

Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.

“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”

Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.

And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”

U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.” The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.

Where the Fallout is Felt

The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.

The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”

Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.

“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”

In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody. The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.

“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.

In Plain Sight

Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.

Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”

With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.

On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”

The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.

Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees.

Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.

“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”

Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.

“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.

Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.

Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”",https://img.assets-d.propublica.org/v5/images/h_31.RC29OCADCT05_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95.jpg?crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&imgixProfile=propublicaAssetsV5&q=90&w=1200&s=bd393e416097ec117baf1a56eb5e49a0,N,,2025-10-18 06:57:09.666859

National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission (Dec. 9) – Whether a federal law limiting coordinated party expenditures violates the First Amendment.","The Supreme Court announced on Friday afternoon that it will hear oral arguments on Dec. 8 in the battle over the president’s power to remove the heads of independent federal agencies created by Congress. The case, Trump v. Slaughter, is one of eight cases scheduled for oral argument during the court’s December argument calendar, which runs from Dec. 1-3 and again from Dec. 8-10. Other high-profile cases now slated for argument in December include National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission and First Choice Women’s Resource Centers v. Platkin.

The dispute over presidential power began in March, when Rebecca Slaughter received an email notifying her that she had been removed from her position as one of the five members of the Federal Trade Commission. Under federal law, commissioners can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,” but the email did not indicate that she had been fired for one of these reasons.

Federal courts in Washington, D.C., ordered the Trump administration to reinstate Slaughter. They pointed to the Supreme Court’s 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, which held that Congress can create independent, multi-member regulatory agencies, like the FTC, whose members can only be removed “for cause.”

The Trump administration came to the Supreme Court in early September, seeking permission to fire Slaughter while the litigation continued. By a vote of 6-3, the justices agreed to put the lower court’s order requiring Slaughter’s reinstatement on hold.

In National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission, the justices will decide whether to overrule a 2001 decision that upheld federal limits on coordinated campaign expenditures, which bar political parties from spending money on campaign advertising with input from political candidates. The case was brought by (among others) then-Sen. J.D. Vance, contending that the federal law at the center of the case violates the First Amendment.

Mashable also asserted that pending Senate Bill 690 indicates the California Legislature’s disagreement with the plaintiff’s interpretation of the Pen Register Act.","On October 9, 2025, the Northern District of California denied Mashable, Inc.’s motion to dismiss a class action alleging violations of the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). Mashable operates a digital news and entertainment website that publishes articles and multimedia content online. The plaintiff alleged that Mashable disclosed the IP addresses and device identifiers of its website visitors to Microsoft and other third parties in violation of CIPA.

Case History

The plaintiff alleged that Mashable’s website embedded third-party trackers from Microsoft and others which collected users’ IP addresses and device information, transmitting that data to third parties for advertising and profiling. The plaintiff argued these trackers function as “pen registers” under CIPA. The Pen Register Act (the chapter of CIPA at issue) prohibits installing or using any device or process that records addressing information from electronic communications without a court order.

Mashable’s Arguments

Mashable moved to dismiss, contending that the Pen Register Act, applies only to person-to-person communications such as phone calls or emails, not to general website activity. It further argued that the complaint did not plausibly allege a violation and that the CIPA statute is ambiguous and should be interpreted narrowly under the rule of lenity– a legal principle that requires courts to interpret ambiguous criminal statutes in favor of defendants. Mashable also asserted that pending Senate Bill 690 indicates the California Legislature’s disagreement with the plaintiff’s interpretation of the Pen Register Act.

Court’s Reasoning and Decision

The court rejected Mashable’s arguments and found that the Pen Register Act’s language is intentionally broad, covering any “device or process” that records addressing information. Pen Register is defined as a “device or process that records or decodes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information transmitted by an instrument or facility from which a wire or electronic communication is transmitted, but not the contents of a communication.” Hinging on the inclusion of “process” in the definition, the court held that this definition was intended to encompass software trackers embedded in websites, not just traditional telephone hardware. According to the court, “[w]hat matters under the statute is not the form of the tool, but rather the function.”

The court further held that a user’s visit to a website, which involves transmitting an HTTP request containing IP and device data, constitutes an “electronic communication” under the statute. The court likened an IP address to a telephone number, as “quintessential ‘addressing’ information…[that] identifies the device sending the communication and determines where the packet is to be routed.”

In addition, the court found that Mashable’s role in embedding trackers and using the resulting data was sufficient to plead “installation” and “use” under CIPA, even if third-party vendors operated the trackers. The court held that, even if the trackers were operated by a third party, Mashable embedded the trackers onto its website and used the data captured from them to facilitate targeted advertising.

Moreover, the court found the statute clear enough in its “language, structure, history and purpose” to apply to the conduct alleged and declined to apply the rule of lenity. It also held that S.B. 690 is not persuasive evidence because it has not passed and “[the] Court must apply the statute as it currently exists.”

Implications

This decision significantly broadens the scope of CIPA compliance risk for website operators in California. By holding that the Pen Register Act applies to modern web tracking technologies, such as embedded third-party trackers that collect and transmit IP addresses and device identifiers, the court clarified that CIPA is not limited to traditional telephone or direct person-to-person communications. Any website embedding third-party advertising or analytics tools that record user “addressing” information could face similar exposure, even if the trackers are managed and operated by external vendors. Importantly, the court’s dismissal of the rule of lenity and disregard for pending legislative amendments further signal that California courts are leaning toward expansive interpretations of digital privacy statutes.

Takeaways

Website operators, especially those with significant California user bases, should reassess their use of tracking technologies and the sharing of user data with third parties. Compliance strategies should include conducting thorough audits of all embedded trackers, understanding what information is collected, ensuring appropriate disclosures, and evaluating the legal basis for any data-sharing practices. The court’s emphasis on function over form warns that simply relying on vendor installation or technical outsourcing does not insulate companies from liability under CIPA. In this environment, proactive reviews of privacy practices and ongoing legal monitoring are critical, not only to limit exposure in potential CIPA litigation, but also to align with evolving regulatory and judicial expectations.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15533_134.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 10:57:53.148890

The video recorded by Mari Magana and posted on Facebook showed the moment ICE agents kicked down the bedroom door in the family’s apartment in Gresham, approximately 17 miles outside of Portland, Wednesday evening. The video has been shared across social media.

The baby’s grandmother, Gloria Bautista, told The Independent that her daughter has been left shaken by the ordeal.

Two male relatives in the room were detained by ICE agents in the confrontation, where an agent appeared to grab one of them by the hair and pull him backward out of the room. The two suspects have been taken to a detention center in nearby Tacoma, Washington.

A senior Department of Homeland Security official told The Independent that “no injuries were sustained” in the operation, which was targeting “a previously removed violent criminal illegal alien from Mexico” who remains at large.

“ICE officers attempted to pull this criminal illegal alien over in a vehicle stop,” the official said. “He attempted to evade arrest and rammed into a United States Postal Service vehicle before fleeing on foot into an apartment. After refusals to come out, law enforcement entered the apartment.”

""It’s a lofty goal, but it starts with us exercising our right to peacefully protest.""","Amid President Donald Trump's unprecedented and accelerating attacks on US democracy, millions of Americans in every state and beyond are preparing to take to the streets Saturday for a second wave of No Kings rallies.

In what organizers and participants say might be the ""largest protest in US history"" in a single day, No Kings demonstrations are set to take place in more than 2,500 communities across the nation, from its biggest cities to small towns like Burns, Oregon—population 2,700—and Bryson City, North Carolina, with 1,500 residents.

The first round of No Kings rallies, held on June 14, drew an estimated 4-6 million participants to over 2,100 demonstrations. Organizers say that the October 18 protest could be even bigger, as Americans are more alarmed than ever by the assault on democracy by Trump and Republicans.

""What we’re seeing is truly unprecedented,"" Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, told Common Dreams. ""What we’re seeing from this administration is authoritarian slip. We are seeing them attack judges, attack nonprofits, trying to attack the media, stifle First Amendment protected speech, and arrest sitting members of Congress for doing their oversight of [Immigration and Customs Enforcement].""

""The list, unfortunately, is very long and what we want is what we’ve seen in other countries that have successfully resisted authoritarianism—to hold on to our democracy and to create and protect the checks that we have against that kind of executive overreach,"" she added. ""It’s a lofty goal, but it starts with us exercising our right to peacefully protest.""

As Republicans including US House Speaker Mike Johnson (La.)—who called Saturday's pro-democracy demonstrations ""hate America"" rallies—attempt to smear the No Kings movement, organizer Sarah Parker of 50501 and Voices of Florida said during a Thursday press conference that ""we have a saying in the South: A hit dog will holler, and I’m hearing a lot of noise from Washington, DC right now.""

""And with that said, on October 18 millions of people just like me... are going to take the streets peacefully and say there will be no kings in America,"" she continued.

""These are everyday Americans coming together to organize,"" Parker said. ""These are faith leaders, teachers, veterans, small business owners who are being impacted by extremely dubious tariffs. These are people that are seeing their friends and family members be kidnapped off the streets. These are everyday Americans that are struggling to put groceries into their fridge, and these are Millennials and Gen Zers who were promised a beautiful and free America.""

""They are rising to this moment because they feel… it is their obligation to joyfully and peacefully push back against authoritarianism like the generations that came before us,"" she added.

Jamie Contreras, the executive vice president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) 32BJ who is also a US Navy veteran and former undocumented immigrant, told the press conference that ""America belongs to the people—working people—not to billionaires or a few politicians who think they can rule like kings.""

Addressing the Trump administration's designation of leftist protesters as ""terrorists"" and its ominous threat to take the ""same approach"" to them as to the alleged drug traffickers it is extrajudicially assassinating on the high seas, Contreras said that ""the real threat to this country isn’t peaceful protesters, it’s politicians shutting down our government to protect billionaires and corporate greed.""

""What’s ironic to me is, you call peaceful protesters terrorists, but then the [January 6 insurrectionists] patriots,"" he added. ""That’s so ironic and so far from the truth.""

The federal government shut down at the beginning of the month, and as Democrats and Republicans continued to spar over the GOP's healthcare cuts, Johnson warned this week that it could be the longest shutdown ever.

Indivisible co-founder Leah Greenberg told the press conference: ""Republicans are blaming and smearing millions of Americans who are peacefully protesting because they have run out of excuses for their own failures. Republicans understand that Americans are blaming them for the shutdown, Americans are blaming them for out-of-control healthcare prices, and a rising affordability crisis.""

Greenberg continued:

They are blaming them for the fear and chaos gripping the country. They are panicking and they are flailing and they are searching for anything, literally anything, to distract from their governing failures. And in their desperation they have decided to go with smearing millions of Americans who are coming out to peacefully, directly assert our rights. It is both ridiculous and outrageous. It is ridiculous because it is transparently false, it is outrageous because it is an attack on the First Amendment and on all of our right to free speech.

Parker said Republicans ""are refusing to accept the fact that the American people are pissed, by the millions. They are refusing to accept the fact that their actions are harming our beloved country. They are refusing to look in the mirror and accept the fact that they are destroying America.""

ACLU chief political and advocacy officer Deidre Schifeling said during the press conference that ""President Trump and his allies are abusing their power and attempting to scare their own citizens away from exercising our rights and freedoms.""

""What we have seen so far is as troubling as it is illegal,"" Schifeling continued. ""The Trump administration has directed ICE to kidnap people including journalists and students off the street, ripping them from their families and deporting them without due process.""

""Their allies are attempting to undermine fair elections at President Trump’s direction by redistricting voting maps and further gerrymandering states,"" she noted. ""And they are attempting to limit our First Amendment rights and use the federal government to attack political rivals, stifle dissent, and undermine checks and balances on presidential power.""

""The Trump administration has even deployed armed agents and troops into American cities, including my home of Washington, DC, turning our streets into militarized zones and threatening to do so again to quash Saturday’s protests,"" she said.

""You have to ask: Why are they so afraid of their own citizens?"" Schifeling said. ""Well, they know that their agenda of selling fear, division, misinformation, lawbreaking, and violence is deeply unpopular. Millions of Americans will peacefully protest on Saturday to tell the Trump administration that we are a country of equals, we are a country of laws that apply to everyone, of due process, and of democracy.""

""We will not be silenced,"" she added. ""If we stop exercising our rights, our First Amendment freedom of speech out of fear, we forfeit our power in advance. The best way to protect our freedom is to act free.""

Gilbert told Common Dreams: ""I think we can turn this around. I think we wouldn’t be doing this if we couldn’t. We are still in a democracy today, we’re having this free and fair conversation right now, you and I… and we have a set of protections we can exercise and we need to remind people what democracy is supposed to look like.""

U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Judge Susan Illston said during an emergency hearing the restraining order affects any agency that has employees who are members of the unions that brought the lawsuit or are in collective bargaining units.

The Trump administration choosing not to recognize those union activities based on an earlier executive order doesn’t mean an agency can issue layoff notices, she said.

Illston, who was appointed by President Bill Clinton, specifically said the departments of Interior and Health and Human Services must comply with the TRO and cannot issue Reductions in Force, or RIFs.

“It is not complicated,” Illston said. “During this time these agencies should not be doing RIFs of the protected folks that we're talking about.”

She also added the National Federation of Federal Employees, Service Employees International Union and National Association of Government Employees, Inc. to the lawsuit and the temporary restraining order.

Meanwhile, as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 extends with no end in sight, administration officials said they will freeze $11 billion in Army Corps of Engineers projects and furlough Energy Department employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration.

Unions argue administration ignoring part of judge’s order

The California case was originally brought by the American Federation of Government Employees, the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing those unions, said during the hearing the Trump administration had been “overly narrowly interpreting the scope of the TRO and ignoring some of the language in the TRO.”

Leonard pointed to a brief filed by the Department of Health and Human Services that said the agency hadn’t issued any layoff notices to workers covered by the TRO, even though an earlier filing to the court said HHS had sent notices to 982 employees.

That department, Leonard said, appeared to take the position that an earlier executive order ended all union representation at HHS.

“The government is well aware that is a disputed issue,” Leonard said.

Elizabeth Hedges, counsel for the Trump administration, said after considerable back and forth that she didn’t agree with Leonard and the judge’s interpretation of the temporary restraining order’s impact.

“I would submit that’s not what the TRO says,” Hedges said, though she later told the judge she would make sure the administration complied with the updated explanation of the restraining order.

Hedges also told the judge the Interior Department didn’t previously disclose it was contemplating layoffs because officials began considering those RIFs before the shutdown and were only going to implement them during the shutdown because it’s gone on so long.

The judge ordered the Trump administration to tell the court by 9 a.m. Pacific on Monday about any actual or imminent layoff notices under the full scope of the restraining order.

Army Corps to pause billions in big-city projects

White House budget director Russ Vought announced hours before the emergency court hearing the administration plans to freeze and may unilaterally cancel billions more in funding approved by Congress.

“The Democrat shutdown has drained the Army Corps of Engineers' ability to manage billions of dollars in projects,” Vought wrote in a social media post. “The Corps will be immediately pausing over $11 billion in lower-priority projects & considering them for cancellation, including projects in New York, San Francisco, Boston, and Baltimore. More information to come from the Army Corps of Engineers.”

The Trump administration has been cited several times by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office for not spending money approved by Congress as lawmakers intended.

Generally, after Congress approves a spending bill and it becomes law, the president is supposed to faithfully implement its provisions.

Any president that wants to cancel funding lawmakers already approved is supposed to send Congress a rescissions request, which starts a 45-day clock for members to approve, modify, or ignore the request.

The Trump administration followed that legal pathway earlier this year when it asked Congress to cancel billions in funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and foreign aid.

The House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, approved the request after senators preserved full funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR.

The White House budget office sent up another rescissions request in late August, asking lawmakers to cancel billions of additional spending on foreign aid programs.

Neither chamber has taken action to approve that request, but Vought believes that since it was sent up within the last 45 days of the fiscal year, he is allowed to cancel that funding without congressional action.

The GAO and Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, have both called the maneuver, known as a pocket rescission, unlawful.

Nuclear security workers to be furloughed

The Trump administration also announced Friday that it would have more than 1,000 employees at the National Nuclear Security Administration stop working for the remainder of the shutdown, joining hundreds of thousands of others on furlough. According to its website, the NNSA’s job “is to ensure the United States maintains a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear stockpile through the application of unparalleled science, technology, engineering, and manufacturing.”

An Energy Department spokesperson wrote in an email to States Newsroom that “approximately 1,400 NNSA federal employees will be furloughed as of Monday, October 20th and nearly 400 NNSA federal employees will continue to work to support the protection of property and the safety of human life. NNSA’s Office of Secure Transportation remains funded through October 27, 2025.”

By Andy Worthington, October 17, 2025

Since its founding in January 2012, marking the 10th anniversary of the opening of the ""war on terror"" prison at Guantánamo Bay, the Close Guantánamo campaign has persistently called for freedom and/or justice for the men held there, struggling against indifference under Barack Obama and Joe Biden, but shut out completely under Donald Trump, who, in his first term in office, disregarded the remaining prisoners so thoroughly that, for four years, it was as though they had been entombed.

In the eight and a half baleful months since Donald Trump returned to the White House, the 15 ""war on terror"" prisoners still held at the prison (down from 40 in his first term) have, predictably, largely disappeared from view, made invisible as the would-be tyrannical president sprung a miserable surprise on everyone, seizing on the naval base as a venue for perforative cruelty in the ""war on migrants"" that he declared when he took office, promising what Human Rights First has accurately described as ""an unprecedented mass deportation agenda.""

On January 29, out of nowhere, Trump ordered the Defense Department and the Department of Homeland Security, via a ""Presidential Action,"" to make preparations to hold up to 30,000 migrants there — plans which, fortunately, never materialized.

Beginning in February, however, the first of what, to date, have been just over 700 migrants held at Guantánamo were flown to the naval base from detention facilities on the U.S. mainland run by ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement), part of the Department of Homeland Security, both of which were created in 2003 as part of the domestic response to post-9/11 paranoia. No one at the time could have had any idea that one day they would get embroiled with Guantánamo, which was so clearly the territory of the military.

Some of these migrants were held in an existing Migrant Operations Center, used to hold migrants intercepted at sea since the 1990s, with others held, illegally, in Camp 6 of the ""war on terror"" prison, which, by law, can only be used to hold prisoners allegedly seized in connection with the 9/11 attacks, Al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations.

Faced with legal challenges, Trump disposed of all of the first migrants held at Guantánamo — 178 Venezuelans — within weeks, sending all but one back to Venezuela. In the months that followed, however, more migrants continued to arrive, in smaller numbers, and from a variety of countries, although they too were all subsequently deported or returned to the U.S. mainland.

In June, reports emerged that Trump was once more threatening to massively increase the migrant population at Guantánamo, allegedly planning to send 9,000 men there, including 800 Europeans. I speculated at the time that the news had been an internal leak, designed to get the plans dropped via the fury of European leaders, who, as anticipated, in many cases vociferously complained in public about this flagrant affront to diplomacy.

The arrival and subsequent disappearance of migrants at Guantánamo reportedly convicted of serious crimes

In July, however, further disturbing news emerged, establishing that, at the time, 72 migrants were held, with 26 of them singled out for particular attention by the Department of Homeland Security, which published a hysterically-entitled list, describing them as the ""Worst of the Worst Convicted Criminal Illegal Aliens,"" and giving their names, their nationalities, and the alleged crimes for which they had allegedly been convicted (no actual proof was provided). The men came from a variety of countries, mainly in Central and South America and South East Asia, although they also included individuals from the U.K. and Romania.

The decision to focus on alleged convicts had evidently arisen because the administration had been repeatedly humiliated, exposed time and again lying about most of the men it had been seizing, routinely describing them as gang members and ""heinous criminals"" based on nothing more than the fact that they had tattoos. In case after case, exposed by lawyers, investigators and journalists, their family members had established that their only ""crime"" had been to undertake perilous journeys to seek work in the promised land of the USA.

The decision to focus on alleged convicts was particularly disturbing because it coincided with the administration’s successful efforts to deport migrants not to their home countries, but to third countries (namely, South Sudan and Eswatini), with none of the guarantees required under international humanitarian law to ensure that they would not be abused, tortured, ""disappeared,"" or even killed.

Nevertheless, despite my best efforts to promote the precarious position these 26 men at Guantánamo were in, no one at all followed up on the story, attempts to chase leads led nowhere, and the story soon sank without trace.

It was only on October 2 that Carol Rosenberg of the New York Times reported that all of the migrants held over the summer had been removed, with none remaining at all.

As Rosenberg explained, on October 1 the last 18 migrants held were removed on a charter flight to the U.S. mainland. As she stated, ""Their final destinations were not known, but immigration authorities have in the past moved migrants back to the United States to consolidate deportation flights.""

Further elucidating the story of the migrants held over the summer, Rosenberg explained that, at the end of July, 61 migrants were held, but that, since then, 16 ICE flights had ""picked up deportees, to either return them to the United States or to add to flights already loaded with other migrants and continue on to other countries.""

She added that, according to Thomas Cartwright, who tracks deportations with the immigrant rights group Witness at the Border, ""Their destinations included Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, England, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Laos, Nigeria, Romania, St. Kitt, Sierra Leone and Vietnam.""

Some of these deportations undoubtedly included the 26 men on the list published by the DHS, most notably the British national, although as with his arrival at Guantánamo, and his imprisonment over the summer, there has never been any mention of him in any British media outlet at all.

Once upon a time, a British national held at Guantánamo, even one allegedly convicted of paedophilia, would have been a major news story, but now it’s lost in a vortex of media indifference and the perma-chaos of Trump’s insane rule.

I can only wonder how many other troubling stories are not even being noticed at all.

More migrants arrive at Guantánamo

Unfortunately, on October 14, Rosenberg provided an update regarding the migrant situation at Guantánamo, noting that she had been told by a Defense Department official that about 20 more migrants had arrived at the naval base, although no further details — about their nationalities, for example — were provided.

Every time the naval base is emptied of migrants, I hope that the Trump administration will finally have taken note of some of the main reasons why using it is so inappropriate — the colossal costs involved, for example, or the evident illegality of using it to hold anyone detained in connection with civil immigration matters.

Every time, however, the administration’s contempt for propriety and the law wins out.

Later this month, however, a federal judge in the District Court in Washington, D.C. will finally hear a case, Luna Gutierrez v. Noem, which was submitted in June by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP).

In their submission in June, lawyers for ""all immigration detainees originally apprehended and detained in the United States, and who are, or will be held at Naval Station Guantánamo Bay, Cuba"" argued that all these individuals ""do not challenge the government’s authority to detain them on U.S. soil or to directly remove them to their home country or to another statutorily authorized country. What they challenge is the government’s unprecedented and unlawful decision to hold them in a detention facility at Guantánamo — which, under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act], and for purposes of the application of that statute, is not the United States. Immigration detention outside the United States is straightforwardly illegal under the statute.""

As the lawyers added, ""Moreover, the government’s use of Guantánamo for immigration detention is arbitrary and capricious, lacks any legitimate purpose, and imposes punitive detention conditions on immigration detainees in violation of their constitutional rights.""

In addition, as they stated, ""Never before this administration has the federal government moved noncitizens apprehended and detained in the United States on civil immigration charges to Guantánamo, or to any other facility outside the United States, for the purpose of civil immigration detention. Nor is there any legitimate reason to do so. The government has ample detention capacity inside the United States.""

It is to be hoped that, when the hearing takes place and a ruling is handed down, it will be another blow against the monstrous overreach and illegality of this particularly cruel and disdainful administration.

However, even if this is the outcome, and the ruling survives further appeals, 2025 will go down in history as the year that, in a cynically constructed policy echoing the lawless indignities of the Bush administration’s ""war on terror,"" Donald Trump and senior officials in his administration — Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, Pete Hegseth, and numerous devious legal advisers — conspired to replicate the horrors and lawlessness of the post-9/11 period not on foreign Muslims seized abroad, but on hapless migrants seized on the U.S. mainland.

And they did so not because there had been any great tragedy like 9/11, but simply because of their deep and revolting racism.",https://www.closeguantanamo.org/statics.1/img/favicon.png,N,,2025-10-18 12:03:05.678875

Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 495 into law, enabling an individual to care for children of deported parents, despite claims that it poses a legal loophole for kidnapping children, says the California Family Council.

Newsom signed into law Assembly Bill 495, also known as the “Family Preparedness Plan Act of 2025,” this past week despite heavy opposition from parental advocacy groups.

Authored by Assemblywoman Celeste Rodriguez, D-San Fernando, the bill claims to give immigrant families facing deportation solutions in taking care of their children and ensures that they are not left vulnerable if a parent is unexpectedly detained by immigration officials.

“Our children deserve to feel safe at home, in school and in the community,” Newsom said in a press release. “We are putting on record that we stand by our families and their right to keep their private information safe, maintain parental rights and help families prepare in case of emergencies.”

According to the bill, a “nonrelative extended family member” could authorize school-related medical care and enrollment in school for a minor by filling out a one-page affidavit.

“I am grateful that the Governor has signed AB 495, the Family Preparedness Plan Act, into law today. This is a crucial step toward protecting children and families at a time when they are facing the terror of separation,” Assemblymember Rodriguez said in Newsom's news release.

Newsom’s press release clarifies that the bill does not alter a child’s caregiver, legal custodian, or guardian without a court order despite opponents’ claims that it erodes parental authority and child safety.

The California Family Council and other parental advocacy groups have been in huge opposition to this bill, as it claims the bill is a child trafficker's dream bill.

“Governor Newsom deceptively describes AB 495 as a caregiver planning tool for undocumented immigrant parents. It’s more accurately described as a child trafficker’s and child predator’s dream bill,” Dean Broyles, president and chief counsel of the National Center for Law & Policy, said in a statement. “Its sweeping application is not limited to immigrant families, does not require any parental notice or consent, and lacks even the most basic safeguards to protect children.”

CFC claims that this bill is unconstitutional and that there are not enough safeguards in place to protect children.

“Governor Newsom is deliberately trying to deceive parents by claiming this bill protects them, when in fact it does the opposite,” Jonathan Keller, president of California Family Council, said in a press release. “AB 495 strips parents of their constitutional rights and hands them over to unverified strangers.""

Yet the author of the bill states it is all about unity for the family.

“AB 495 is about one thing: keeping families together,” said Rodriguez. “It strengthens the ability of parents to make decisions for their children, empowers them to prepare for the unthinkable, and ensures kids are cared for by people they know and love.""

Keller disagreed.

“It is unconstitutional, it is illegal, and no school or medical facility should recognize or accept the authority of a Caregiver’s Authorization Affidavit without a verified signature from a parent or legal guardian. Newsom knows exactly what this bill does, but he’s hoping the press and the public won’t read it for themselves,” Keller added.",http://www.goldenstatenewspapers.com/content/tncms/live/global/resources/images/_site/favicon.png,N,,2025-10-18 14:57:54.443159
