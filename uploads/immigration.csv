Bay Area Advocates Head To Court To Halt Trump Administration’s Immigration Policies

In a series of recent class action lawsuits, Bay Area civil rights advocates are calling on the federal courts to halt what they call illegal Trump administration policies that are leading to the arrest of asylum seekers, victims of human trafficking and people attending immigration court hearings.

The three lawsuits filed in federal courts in California in recent weeks are part of a larger legal pushback by advocacy groups across the country challenging the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics.

At a time when Homeland Security officials tout arrests of “heinous” criminals they call the “worst of the worst,” the lawsuits put the focus on the ways U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has targeted vulnerable people such as domestic violence survivors and those who’ve fled persecution, said UC Davis Law Professor Kevin Johnson. “These are serious constitutional and statutory claims … challenging the efforts of the Trump administration to tighten the immigration enforcement machinery around non-citizens,” he said.

The majority of them failed to meet ICE’s physical or academic standards, according to the data.
“There is absolutely concern that some people are slipping through the cracks,” the current DHS official said.
As part of the effort, ICE shortened the training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Georgia from 13 weeks to eight weeks.
Fewer than 10 of the new recruits were dismissed because ICE training leaders learned from the recruits during the training program that they had pending criminal charges, failed their drug test or were otherwise considered a safety concern, the officials said.","WASHINGTON — Immigration and Customs Enforcement has placed new recruits into its training program before they have completed the agency’s vetting process, an unusual sequence of events as the agency rushes to hire federal immigration officers to carry out President Donald Trump’s mass deportation policy, one current and two former Homeland Security Department officials told NBC News.

ICE officials only later discovered that some of these recruits failed drug testing, have disqualifying criminal backgrounds or don’t meet the physical or academic requirements to serve, the sources said.

Staff at ICE’s training academy in Brunswick, Georgia, recently discovered one recruit had previously been charged with strong arm robbery and battery stemming from a domestic violence incident, the current DHS official said. They’ve also found as recently as this month that some recruits going through the six-week training course had not submitted fingerprints for background checks, as ICE’s hiring process requires, the current and former DHS officials said.

Per ICE policy, applicants are required to pass a drug test and undergo a security vetting through ICE’s human resources office prior to showing up for the training course. The former officials said that process was more strictly adhered to before a hiring surge that began this summer. That process was meant to weed out disqualified candidates before they would be sent to training.

Since the surge began, the agency has dismissed more than 200 new recruits while in training for falling short of its hiring requirements, according to recently collected internal ICE data reviewed by NBC News.

The majority of them failed to meet ICE’s physical or academic standards, according to the data. Just under 10 recruits were dismissed for criminal charges, failing to pass drug tests or safety concerns that should have been flagged in a background check prior to arriving at training, the data indicated and the current and former DHS officials confirmed.

The officials said there is growing concern that in the Trump administration’s race to expand the number of ICE agents to 10,000 by the end of the year, the agency could miss red flags in the backgrounds of some new recruits and inadvertently hire them.

“There is absolutely concern that some people are slipping through the cracks,” the current DHS official said. The official said many of the issues that have been flagged during training only surface because the recruits admitted they did not submit to fingerprinting or drug testing prior to arriving.

“What about the ones who don’t admit it?” the official said.

In a statement to NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security said most of its new recruits are former law enforcement officers and former ICE officers who go through a different process.

“The figures you reference are not accurate and reflect a subset of candidates in initial basic academy classes,” said DHS assistant secretary for public affairs Tricia McLaughlin. “The vast majority of new officers brought on during the hiring surge are experienced law enforcement officers who have already successfully completed a law enforcement academy. This population is expected to account for greater than 85% of new hires. Prior-service hires follow streamlined validation but remain subject to medical, fitness, and background requirements.”

The Atlantic reported this week on the struggle some ICE recruits have had with meeting the agency's physical fitness requirements. The broader scope of issues and specific data have not been previously reported.

ICE has been under pressure from the White House to increase hiring with the funding designated by Congress in the sweeping tax and spending bill that Trump signed into law on July 4. The agency has frequently lagged behind the White House’s arrest goal of 3,000 per day, which they have attributed to a lack of manpower.

As part of the effort, ICE shortened the training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Georgia from 13 weeks to eight weeks. The training was later shortened to six weeks, the DHS official said.

Recruits also are supposed to attest that they can pass ICE’s physical fitness test, which includes sit-ups, pull-ups, and running one-and-a-half miles in under 14 minutes and 25 seconds.

Darius Reeves, who recently left his position as ICE field office director in Baltimore, said he believes the agency’s Aug. 6 decision to waive age limits so that older people can join has led to more recruits failing the physical test.

“These new recruits are dropping like flies,” Reeves said in an interview after speaking with colleagues seeking to bring new hires into the agency. “And rightly so, it makes sense. We’re going to drop the age requirements, of course this was going to happen.”

Nearly half of new recruits who’ve arrived for training at FLETC over the past three months were later sent home because they could not pass the written exam, according to the data. The academic requirement includes an exam where officers are allowed to consult their textbooks and notes at the end of a legal course on the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Fourth Amendment, which outlines when officers can and cannot conduct searches and seizures.

A slightly smaller group was dismissed because they failed the physical fitness test or had medical challenges, though some of those sent home had made clear on their application that they could not meet ICE’s physical requirements but were sent to training anyway, the current and former DHS officials said.

Fewer than 10 of the new recruits were dismissed because ICE training leaders learned from the recruits during the training program that they had pending criminal charges, failed their drug test or were otherwise considered a safety concern, the officials said.

The three sources said the agency’s human resources office is overwhelmed with more than 150,000 new applicants that have applied since ICE began offering $50,000 signing bonuses in August. The HR office is rushing to clear new recruits, which they believe is leading to mistakes.

“They are trying to push everyone through, and the vetting process is not what it should be,” said one of the former DHS officials with knowledge of the agency’s hiring.

The current DHS official likened the pressure on ICE’s human resources employees to clear recruits to “asking them to pull a rabbit out of a hat.”","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251021-ice-recruit-ch-1629-fb41af.jpg",N,,2025-10-22 17:17:12.481530

But it will require a lot more public outcry to defend America’s disappeared and preserve diversity in this country.
Congress has been largely silent (though it recently announced an inquiry into ICE treatment of U.S. citizens).","The Trump administration aspires to deport a million people in its first year of office. The president has also spoken of the more ambitious goal of deporting 15-20 million undocumented people overall, even if that category probably covers only 14 million folks. The discrepancy of a couple million people shouldn’t bother Trump. He’s happy to deport those with green cards, H-1B visas, and even American citizens.

Deporting a million people in a year is a heavy lift. The previous record, 409,849 people, was during the Obama administration, as part of the 1.5 million deportations he conducted in his first term. Trump, no doubt, wants to best Obama in this category, since he’s determined to outshine the former president in every respect, even the dubious ones.

Despite all the high-profile seizures by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the deals to dump Venezuelans to Salvadoran prisons, and the truly crazy efforts to send people to countries they’ve never even visited like Eswatini and South Sudan, the Trump administration has managed to deport only about 350,000 people through the end of August. That includes the 200,000 by ICE and the rest by Customs and Border Protection and the Coast Guard, plus some self-deportations. Another 60,000 are languishing in ICE detention centers. The government is currently monitoring about 180,000 families and individuals in its Alternatives to Detention program, which may end up becoming a Preparation for Deportation program.

Most of the people currently in detention—over 70 percent—have never committed any crime, which undermines the claim by the Trump administration that he’s going after the “bad hombres.”

Detention is pretty much a fast track to deportation. After all, detainees often don’t have access to lawyers. As The American Prospect reports, “ICE uses bureaucracy and location transfers to isolate their detainees from both their families and their lawyers, limiting their ability to get out of their predicaments and increasing misery and hopelessness.” One immigration lawyer told me that some of his clients have disappeared for several days in ICE detention—and these included people who were willing to self-deport.

Trump is not close to meeting his ambitious deportation goals. That’s no comfort to all the immigrants whose lives he has already upended.

ICE Is Not Nice

The scenes involving the round-up of refugees and migrants have been harrowing. Consider this description:

Buses backed up to apartment buildings and were filled with screaming, crying people. Hospital beds were emptied. A cancer patient operated on the previous day was carried away. One woman gave birth while police waited to haul off mother and baby. Younger children were permitted to be left behind, and many parents desperately accepted that choice in the hope that neighbors or orphanages would take them in.

Oh, I’m sorry, I got mixed up. That’s a description of the French police rounding up 13,000 Jewish refugees in 1942 at the behest of their Nazi overseers, as reported by David Wyman in his seminal book, The Abandonment of the Jews.

Here, by comparison, are three snapshots of recent ICE actions:

In Louisiana and Florida:

Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers have in recent days deported the Cuban-born mother of a 1-year-old girl — separating them indefinitely — and three children ages 2, 4 and 7 who are U.S. citizens along with their Honduran-born mothers, their lawyers said Saturday.

In Chicago:

Agents used unmarked trucks and a helicopter to surround the five-story apartment building. NewsNation, which was invited to observe the operation, reported agents “rappelled from Black Hawk helicopters.” Agents then went door to door, woke up residents and used zip ties to restrain them. Residents and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which canvassed the area, said those who were zip tied included children and U.S. citizens.

In New York:

On the morning of September 4, dozens of masked federal agents raided a snack bar factory in the small town of Cato, New York. They claimed there was a “violent felon” in the plant, but proceeded to siphon off and hold anyone who looked Latinx. At least 69 workers were initially detained, with 57 still in custody or deported, though some say that could be an undercount. There are multiple reports of aggression — knees on necks, blows to heads — used during the raid.

This is happening not just to the undocumented and those on the rock-strewn path to citizenship. Quite a few American citizens have also been caught up in the ICE dragnet. At least 170 have been detained, according to ProPublica:

Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched. About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.

Much of Trump’s domestic and foreign policy can be understood only by examining them through the lens of his obsession with deporting people and restricting immigration from non-white parts of the world. The question remains: how many laws will the Trump administration break and how many crimes will it commit in this effort to make America predominantly white again?

German citizens failed to stop the Nazis. Will Americans stand up and be counted?

Trump’s Immigration-Obsessed Foreign Policy

In exchange for a payment of about $5 million, the tiny country of Eswatini in southern Africa has agreed to receive up to 160 deportees from a variety of countries. Human rights groups in Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, have challenged the arrangement in court. A U.S. District Court judge also blocked the removal of deportees to third countries back in April, but the Supreme Court lifted that ban in June.

The $5 million is only part of the sweetheart deal. In August, the Trump administration waived all tariffs on Eswatini goods entering the United States—in contrast to the 30 percent rate that South Africa will be paying. A number of countries hoping for tariff reductions or similarly favorable treatment from the Trump administration— Costa Rica, Guatemala, Kosovo, Panama, Rwanda, South Sudan—have also accepted the transport of deportees.

Eswatini does have its limits. It refused to accept Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran national that the Trump administration sent to a prison in El Salvador. Garcia was freed and sent back to the States, only to be arrested again by the U.S. government and charged with human trafficking. Afraid that Garcia will be released by court order, the Trump administration is scrambling to find some country that will take him. Garcia is living proof of the administration’s lies—contrary to what Trump has said, he is not a gang member or a human trafficker. No wonder Trump wants him out of the country.

El Salvador has been an enthusiastic backer of Trump’s deportation plans. The country received $5 million to house deportees like Garcia in its horrific prisons. In addition, the State Department recently gave the country its highest safety rating, ahead of France and Spain. Trump has also backed Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele’s bid to become the country’s leader for life. Finally, the country faces a mere 10 percent tariff on its goods, Trump’s lowest tier.

In one of the least savory parts of the arrangement with El Salvador, Secretary of State Marco Rubio cut a deal with Bukele to return several members of the MS-13 gang who were cooperating with U.S. authorities. Bukele wanted them back because they had information about members of his administration who had cut their own deals with the country’s various gangs. It’s best to keep your enemies close, as the expression goes, particularly if you can put them in a dangerous high-security prison.

The immigration issue also affects relations with Venezuela, where the Trump administration has used the threat of Tren de Aragua, and the alleged inroads the gang has made in U.S. society, to step up its efforts to topple the government of Nicolas Maduro.

Trump has attempted to tilt immigration policy in favor of English speakers and white people more generally, even as the overall quotas for immigrants are radically reduced from 125,000 per year to 7,500. Among the proposals considered by the administration is one that would give preference to such groups as Europeans who support the radical right and white Afrikaners from South Africa. The overall purpose is a reduction in American diversity because, as one of the internal proposals argues, “The sharp increase in diversity has reduced the level of social trust essential for the functioning of a democratic polity.”

The administration has also radically increased the fee for a work permit—the H-1B visa—to $100,000. Although there are some exemptions to the new fee, it is clearly designed to restrict entrance to the United States to the wealthy.

Taken together, Trump has treated the “shithole” companies he identified in his first term—the poorer countries of the Global South—as dumping grounds for undesirable elements. And he has put a sign on America’s front door that reads: Wealthy, Christian, Right-Wing Whites Only.

Barack Obama wanted to create an administration that looked like America. Donald Trump wants to create an America that looks like his administration.

How Deportations Shape Domestic Policy

Trump knows a hot-button issue when he touches one, and immigration remains a great way to defeat Democrats who, however anti-immigration some of them have become, will never stoop to the race-baiting lows that Trump uses to wow his supporters. The invading “army” of migrants approaching the Mexico border, the fictitious pet-eaters of Springfield, OH, the “murderers” and “rapists” from points south responsible for all the crime in America: these mendacious memes propelled Trump to victory in 2024.

His immigration policies are no surprise: they were all laid out in detail in Project 2025: stopping refugee resettlement; ending Temporary Protect Status for Haitians, Venezuelans, and others; ending visas for foreign students. Trump has gone further. Even Project 2025 didn’t propose revoking birthright citizenship and ignoring the constitution.

Trump has put ICE raids at the center of his approach, but there has been pushback from Democratic-controlled cities and states. So, the president is sending in the National Guard to ensure greater access and mobility for ICE agents. The use of the U.S. military for domestic operations is unprecedented, of course, and several judges have ruled the president’s actions unconstitutional. Trump, meanwhile, has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act to suppress “rebellion,” which would allow him to use the military to impose civilian law (his government’s laws). It’s not quite martial law—which is the imposition of military laws on civilians—but it certainly aims in that direction (and the two may well be conflated in Trump’s mind).

ICE, meanwhile, has received a huge surge in funding—$170 billion in new money—at a time of cutbacks in virtually all non-military parts of the federal government. If ICE and associated agencies constituted a military, it would be the thirteenth largest one in the world, as Sarah Lazare and Lindsay Koshgarian point out. The militarization of the United States, at the expense of social welfare, is now directed not just at China or securing access to critical raw materials: it is directed at the U.S. population.

Trump is attacking diversity more generally, as the changes in federal immigration policy suggest. Because birthright citizenship has changed the demographics of the United States, its repeal has been a priority for white nationalists, and they have also cheered Trump’s moves in this direction. Meanwhile, the president is going after diversity in federal institutions, federal grantmaking, and across the U.S. educational system.

At the moment, lawyers and judges are the thin line that holds back the lawlessness of the Trump administration. A few civic groups like the Immigration Defense Project and Freedom for Immigrants are fighting the administration. But it will require a lot more public outcry to defend America’s disappeared and preserve diversity in this country.

As Bad as Nazis?

The Nazis were also obsessed with the diversity of German society in the 1930s. They ultimately decided not just to stigmatize and imprison Jews, Roma, homosexuals, and others. The Nazis killed them in huge numbers.

Trump and his white nationalist allies are currently at the stigmatize and deport stage. They’re content for the moment to let the killing take place elsewhere. The administration is not only erecting higher walls against refugees and immigrants—leading to more deaths among the desperate overseas—it is sending those who thought they’d already made it to safety to warzones (South Sudan), certain imprisonment (Afghanistan, Russia), and failed states (Haiti).

The U.S. business community is heavily reliant on immigrant labor, much of it undocumented, in agriculture, construction, and the food industry. But it has failed to stand up for its immigrant workforce. The international community is busy making deals with Trump, not censuring him. Congress has been largely silent (though it recently announced an inquiry into ICE treatment of U.S. citizens).

At a time when countries around the world are shrinking in population, the United States has remained strong because of all the people who have come here from abroad to work, to contribute to the tax base and Social Security, and, yes, to have babies. So, who will combine the necessary moral and practical arguments to convince the mass of Americans that the very survival of this country depends on immigrants?",https://fpif.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2640469337.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 17:00:39.560534

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem outlined on social media last week these personnel will receive “super checks” by Wednesday covering their next pay period, as well as lost wages from the first few days of the shutdown, and applicable overtime pay.
Among the hundreds of thousands of government employees not being paid are air traffic controllers, who have been deemed necessary employees.
“To think that somehow we can live with, ‘You’ll get paid eventually,’ that doesn’t pay the creditors, that doesn’t pay the mortgage, that doesn’t pay gas, that doesn’t pay the food bill,” Daniels told Fortune earlier this week.
But even furloughing employees during a shutdown or giving them temporarily unpaid leave can end up costing more than just continuing to pay them, Bilmes noted.","Customs and Border Protection border patrol agents, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officers, Secret Service Special Agents, and Transportation Security Administration air marshals will continue to be paid during the ongoing shutdown, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson confirmed to Fortune. Their pay is covered under Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which gave ICE an extra $75 billion in funding.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem outlined on social media last week these personnel will receive “super checks” by Wednesday covering their next pay period, as well as lost wages from the first few days of the shutdown, and applicable overtime pay.

Not all essential workers have been so fortunate. Among the hundreds of thousands of government employees not being paid are air traffic controllers, who have been deemed necessary employees. Many are working 60 hours, six days a week, and some are taking on second “gig jobs,” such as serving at restaurants or driving for Uber or DoorDash, according to Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.

“To think that somehow we can live with, ‘You’ll get paid eventually,’ that doesn’t pay the creditors, that doesn’t pay the mortgage, that doesn’t pay gas, that doesn’t pay the food bill,” Daniels told Fortune earlier this week. “No one takes IOUs, and the air traffic controllers are having to feel that pressure as well.”

The decisions of who gets paid and who doesn’t during government shutdowns depends on department personnel sorting employees into respective groups of essential and non-essential, as well as appropriations for salaries that may or may not be impacted by the lapsed Congressional budget.

But this employee selection process is completely arbitrary and subjective, highlighting a failure of government shutdowns, which are ultimately more expensive than keeping the government operating, according to Linda Bilmes, a public finance expert and senior lecturer at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco estimated for each week the government is shut down, it would translate to a $7 billion economic hit and a 0.1% reduction in U.S. GDP growth, a result, in part, of delayed procurement of goods and a drag on demand.

“There is this overarching dysfunction of the entire process,” Bilmes told Fortune. “Every time you get into one of these situations—which has been on average four times a year for the last four to five years—there is an arbitrariness in who ends up being paid for their work, who ends up working, who ends up being furloughed.”

“The arbitrariness is almost inherent in this dysfunction—a feature as well as being a bug,” she added.

A ‘dysfunctional’ system

There have been 20 government “funding gaps” in the last 50 years, following a 1974 Congressional budget reform law in response to former President Richard Nixon’s impoundment attempts on funds Congress had already allocated. While the president had significant control over the budget for the better part of the 20th century, the 1974 reform put more power in Congress’ hands.

As a result of a series of fiscal and appropriations committees overseeing government budgets, the process of allocating and approving funds is convoluted, Bilmes said. For example, the Department of Veterans Affairs has a two-year budget, meaning their funding does not lapse when Congress fails to pass an appropriations bill. The Patent and Trademark Office, conversely, is not funded through Congressionally appropriated money, but rather through patent fees, and likewise do not have employee pay impacted by the shutdown.

But even furloughing employees during a shutdown or giving them temporarily unpaid leave can end up costing more than just continuing to pay them, Bilmes noted. Government contractors are typically furloughed, but unlike many other federal workers, they are not guaranteed—and in many cases, not paid—backpay. These contractors are aware of a potential disruption in income because of the frequency of shutdowns and, as a result, pad their contracts.

Bilmes posited that in order to resolve the arbitrary payment disparities during shutdowns, there should be automatic resolutions, creating an automatic extension of the previous budget. This, however, would not be ideal because it could make less urgent conversations about planning, strategy, and addressing long-term problems that accompany new budget discussions, she said. An alternative would be to have the whole government run on a two-year budget to avoid the quarterly stop-and-go that has become the current precedent.

In a case before a federal judge in San José, Bay Area legal groups are seeking to block ICE from rearresting immigrants who had previously been granted conditional release, typically after border agents had determined they were not dangerous and not a flight risk, meaning they were expected to show up for their proceedings in immigration court.

Advocates say ICE has arrested and detained more than 100 immigrants in recent months as they attended mandatory court hearings and ICE supervision check-ins in Northern and Central California, even though they were abiding by the terms of their release and their circumstances had not changed.

Bree Bernwanger, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU of Northern California, one of the groups filing the suit, said until things shifted abruptly in May, such rearrests were unheard of for ICE’s San Francisco field office.

“ICE’s new policy allows them to make arrests and throw people back into detention without any justification,” she said. “[It] has disrupted people’s lives, it’s torn families apart, and it’s fundamentally unfair and unreasoned.”

ICE officials did not respond to KQED’s request for comment, but the agency typically does not comment on pending litigation.

One of those arrested was Gabriela Vargas Plasencia, who was an engineering student in Peru before she fled death threats and came to the U.S. last year seeking asylum, according to her declaration to the court. She said she and her boyfriend were detained at the border, then released with instructions on attending immigration hearings.

They settled in Oakland, submitted their asylum applications and enrolled in English classes. Once she was granted a work permit, Vargas Plasencia said she found two jobs, at Target and FedEx, working 50 hours a week.

But at court on Sep. 4, she said, a government attorney asked the immigration judge to dismiss their cases. When the couple left the courtroom, Vargas Plasencia said agents in plain clothes grabbed them, took them to the basement and shackled them – all with no explanation. Hours later, they were driven to Bakersfield and locked up at the Mesa Verde Immigration Detention Center.

After lawyers intervened, a federal judge ordered Vargas Plasencia’s release. But in the meantime, she said, her car was towed and she was reprimanded for missing work. Her partner is still in custody. And she said she still has flashbacks to what she called “one of the most difficult and painful experiences I have ever endured.”

“Each time I have to check in with ICE, I feel anxiety and panic all over again,” Vargas Plasencia said in her declaration. “I have never committed any crime, in the United States or anywhere else. I only wish to continue my asylum case peacefully and to build a safe, stable life here; and for my partner to be released soon, as well.”

Bernwanger, the ACLU attorney, says rearresting people who are complying with the conditions of their release is an arbitrary exercise of power that violates the Constitution’s protection against unreasonable seizure.

“We should all be concerned,” she said. “Are we comfortable with a system in which people can just be grabbed off of the street and thrown into detention?”

Can ICE arrest immigrants at immigration courthouses?

While the lawsuit involving Vargas Plasencia centers on the question of why ICE can arrest someone, another recent case deals with the question of where those arrests can take place.

That lawsuit, filed last month by the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights of San Francisco, along with the ACLU and others, takes on Trump administration policies instructing ICE and the immigration courts that arresting people at courthouses, formerly off limits, is now acceptable.

Immigrant advocates say detaining people who are following the rules, and may, like Vargas Plasencia, have pending claims to asylum or other relief, will have a “chilling effect,” keeping them away from hearings and denying them access to justice. The administration has denied there’s any evidence for that.

“Conducting these arrests at courthouses, and conducting arrests of people without a justification when you’ve already released them, both of those policies are unlawful for different reasons,” said Bernwanger. “We are seeing ICE use them in coordination to absolutely terrorize people in our community who are just trying to do what the immigration system asks of them.”

The same judge, P. Casey Pitts, who was appointed to the bench by President Joe Biden, will hear both Bay Area cases. Pitts has set hearings in both cases for Dec. 9.

Can ICE arrest survivors of trafficking and domestic violence?

Meanwhile, a class action case filed in federal court in Los Angeles last week blasts ICE for arresting, and even deporting, immigrants applying for legal visas as survivors of human trafficking, domestic violence or other serious crimes.

Karen Hernandez is with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, which is representing the immigrants. She said, under the Violence Against Women Act and other laws, these immigrants have permission to be in the U.S while their visas are pending.

“These are folks who have been granted legal protection by Congress,” she said. “The government is basically violating those legal protections.”

One of the named plaintiffs in the case, identified as Camila B., has lived in Los Angeles for more than two decades. In 2021, she was attacked at a bus stop and beaten unconscious, according to the complaint. She cooperated with police, helping them to arrest her attacker, and applied for a U Visa, which offers legal status to undocumented immigrants who’ve suffered serious crimes and assist law enforcement.

Because of the long backlog for applications, the government granted Camila, 46, temporary protection from deportation to her native Mexico while she awaited her visa. But on July 1, as part of ICE’s immigration sweeps in Los Angeles, officers surrounded her tamale stand and arrested her. She was held in detention until July 30, when a judge ordered her released on bond.

Many of the affected immigrants are in the U.S. illegally. But, beginning with the 1994 passage of the Violence Against Women Act, Congress repeatedly expanded protections for immigrant survivors of crime, encouraging them to seek safety and cooperate with law enforcement. Among the protections are special visas for victims of trafficking and other serious crimes that eventually lead to a green card. Congress also provided work authorization, and for years, immigration authorities had policies not to deport people who were in the process of applying for the visas.

The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration’s reversal flies in the face of a federal law against “arbitrary and capricious” policy changes, and says the detentions violate people’s constitutionally guaranteed due process rights.

ICE and Homeland Security officials did not respond to KQED’s requests for comment about the case, but Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin has told other news outlets that every immigrant deported by ICE “has had due process and has a final order of removal — meaning they have no legal right to be in the country.”

Hernandez, with the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, said defending laws like the Violence Against Women Act is very personal to her. She said she was a 3-year-old when her own family moved to the U.S. from Mexico. But her childhood was marked by domestic violence, and it took years for her mother to get free.

“I grew up with a father who was very violent towards my mom,” she said. “And I remember talking to her about this lawsuit as we were working on it. And she just said, ‘If this would have been around when you and I were being harmed by your father, this would’ve protected us.’”

The extent to which the Trump administration is pushing the legal limits on immigration means more lawsuits can be expected, according to Johnson, the UC Davis law professor.

“This administration is just so dogged in its immigration enforcement efforts, we see something new and different almost every day,” he said. “It’s an extraordinary time. The human misery is off the charts.”",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/06/031523-ICE-Arrest-AP-CM-01-copy.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 16:17:08.967404

On Wednesday, acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told Fox News that New York City will see an ""increase in ICE arrests"" because there are ""so many criminal illegal"" immigrants.

""You will see us making those criminal arrests to make New York safe again. It's definitely intelligence driven, it's not random,"" Lyons said. ""We aren't pulling people off the street. There was a specific reason based on criminal intelligence and criminal activity that we showed up on Canal Street,""

On Canal Street Wednesday morning, there was an unusual sense of peace and tranquility on what is usually a hub of illegal commerce.

Empty sidewalks were free of the illegal street vendors hawking fake designer label purses and luxury watches.

If that was the mission of federal agents Tuesday afternoon, to clear the scene of vendors who often hail from West Africa, mission accomplished.

It was a chaotic scene in Chinatown on Tuesday when a swarm of masked immigration officers, ATF and Homeland Security agents, and other federal law enforcement all pushed, pulled, and detained the vendors who are a fixture on the sidewalks of Canal Street.

The show of force quickly generated a rather vocal response from ICE protesters who immediately started recording video and taking pictures of agents at work. Pushing and shoving soon followed.

In a statement, a Homeland Security spokesperson said the agents, ""Conducted a targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City focused on criminal activity related to selling counterfeit goods.""

Jason Jackson, an elevator repairman who works in the area, said he wouldn't be surprised if social media videos taken by ICE supporters led federal agents to target this part of Manhattan.

""I definitely think that is how it went. Because this has been going on for a long time and just out of nowhere, they want to crack down on it,"" Jackson said.

Mayor Eric Adams, in an effort to distant himself and the city from what happened said in a statement in part that ""New Yorkers should know we have no involvement.""

Following the surprise crackdown, New York Attorney General Letitia James launched a portal for members of the public to submit photos and videos of ICE enforcement actions.

In a statement, James vowed to review the materials to determine if any laws were violated, including ""unlawful questioning, detention, or intimidation.""

""Every New Yorker has the right to live without fear or intimidation,"" James said. ""If you witnessed and documented ICE activity yesterday, I urge you to share that footage with my office. We are committed to reviewing these reports and assessing any violations of law. No one should be subject to unlawful questioning, detention, or intimidation.""

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.","This article originally appeared in Salem Reporter.

The state of Oregon is asking a federal judge to dismiss a Marion County lawsuit over immigration records, saying state law is clear that the county can’t share information about men on parole for local crimes with federal immigration authorities.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion Monday in Eugene U.S. District Court to dismiss the lawsuit, which county officials filed Aug. 18 to seek clarity on whether they could share contact information and other details about men on parole with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Because state law unequivocally prohibits Marion County from producing the requested information without a court order, and because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies, there is nothing further for this court to do,” Rayfield wrote.

The motion is the latest in an ongoing back-and-forth between Marion County, the state and federal authorities who say they are trying to locate several men in Salem who served prison time for violent crimes and should be deported.

ICE sent subpoenas to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office on Aug. 1 asking for information about five men on parole, according to the county’s lawsuit.

The lawsuit named Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Marion County said that a federal judge needs to resolve conflicts between Oregon’s so-called sanctuary law, state public records law and federal law. The county compiled information to respond to the ICE subpoenas but has not provided them as of Tuesday, according to Marion County counsel Steve Elzinga.

Oregon sanctuary law generally bars agencies from sharing information with immigration authorities for enforcement purposes, unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Rayfield argued that ICE does not have authority to inspect the information under the state’s public records law.

The subpoenas sent to Marion County were signed by a special agent, not a judge. That means they are not to be cooperated with under Oregon law, Rayfield argued.

Rayfield said that previous court rulings have made clear that sanctuary and federal law do not conflict, and that if a judge orders to enforce subpoenas, agencies are then required to provide the information.

“And yet, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed this lawsuit instead, seeking an advisory opinion from this court rather than following well-established processes under state and federal law – processes that have been in place for many years without the need for lawsuits or further clarification,” Rayfield wrote in the motion.

In a statement Tuesday, Marion County disputed Rayfield’s argument that there is no conflict between state and federal laws.

“The state’s assertion that there is no legal uncertainty fails a basic smell test when there is an obvious federal-state clash over subpoenas requesting public records of violent criminals and the majority of Oregon’s sheriffs and counties who are caught in the middle say that legal clarity is needed,” Elzinga said.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office separately filed a lawsuit Oct. 1 to enforce subpoenas sent to Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties requesting information on 10 men previously convicted of crimes in the counties.

In that case, Marion County asked a judge to order it to release information to ICE, according to an Oct. 6 filing. No such order has been issued yet, federal court records show.

Twenty Oregon counties and all but two of the state’s sheriffs support Marion County’s lawsuit seeking clarification on immigration subpoenas.

In a letter sent to Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Oct. 6, counties said Marion County should ask a judge to “issue a detailed opinion that provides the type of clarity that will help all local governments ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

In its subpoenas, ICE sought personal information on five men on parole in Marion County for serious crimes, including rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping and theft. ICE later rescinded one subpoena due to “discrepancies in biographical information,” an email from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Salem Reporter filed a public records request Sept. 18 for the information ICE requested in its administrative subpoenas and received the records a week later without exemptions or redactions. The news publication was not charged for the records.

The records, which include home addresses, employers and phone numbers for each of the men, were also provided to OPB and KOIN 6, according to a declaration by Elzinga.

Providing the records to news outlets underscores a key claim in Marion County’s lawsuit. The county argued that under state public records law, information about people on parole is a public record that anyone can obtain through a public records request.

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.

In the motion, he cited state law that says people who are allowed to inspect public records include “any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, association or member or committee of the Legislative Assembly.”

Public bodies and the federal government are not included in Oregon’s definition of who is allowed access to public records, Rayfield said.

“Here, the administrative subpoenas issued by ICE are issued under federal government authority, not in anyone’s individual capacity, do not state that they are public records requests and do not invoke the Oregon public records law on their face,” he wrote in the motion.

The ICE special agent who signed the subpoenas could have access to the information if the information was requested on behalf of an individual, and not a public agency, according to Rayfield’s motion.",https://oregoncapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dan-Rayfield-9_12_25-8-of-16-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:17:10.011543

We’re talking about the government shutdown, of course. How did we get here, and what does it mean for the justice system? FindLaw breaks it down.

Shut Down for What?!

The short end of it is this: the current shutdown is the product of a protracted standoff between congressional Democrats and Republicans, which reached a breaking point at the end of last month.

The immediate cause was the failure to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government. Senate Democrats refused to advance a Republican-backed bill that would have eliminated Obamacare subsidies, resulting in a lapse in appropriations and triggering a government-wide shutdown on October 1. Executive branch agencies began furloughing workers and suspending services immediately.

The federal judiciary was able to maintain paid operations for several weeks by relying on reserve funds, court fees, and leftover balances from previous years. However, these stopgap measures were always temporary, and by October 17, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts announced that funding would be exhausted by Monday, October 20.

Judiciary Hits the Wall

The shutdown isn’t breaking news, so why is it newsworthy now? Well, for the first few weeks of the month, the federal judiciary was mostly spared the fate of other government branches thanks to legal fees. The fees are collected from litigants and defendants who use the courts. They help to pay court costs, but they only cover part of the courts’ expenses (the remainder comes from government appropriations). And they can only go so far.

After 20 days of shutdown, an estimated 750,000 federal employees have been furloughed nationally, with another 33,000 federal court staff either performing limited tasks unpaid or placed on furlough. The impasse, driven by heated disagreement over medical care subsidies, has resulted in daily economic losses estimated by some economists at $15 billion. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts reinforced on Friday that, “until the ongoing lapse in government funding is resolved, federal courts will maintain limited operations necessary to perform the judiciary’s constitutional functions.”

As the shutdown drags on, its effects on courts across the country are becoming increasingly severe. Federal courts (including appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts) are now forced to curtail non-essential functions and begin furloughing staff – for the first time since the mid-90s. That’s not great news on its own, but there’s an even bigger problem when you consider the governing law of the country.

Under the U.S. Constitution, judges of courts established under Article III (such as the Supreme Court, Courts of Appeals, and District Courts) are guaranteed life tenure and their salaries cannot be diminished while in office. This ensures judicial independence and continuity even when the government faces funding shortfalls. Therefore, judges must continue fulfilling their constitutional duties (hearing cases, issuing rulings, and maintaining essential judicial proceedings) regardless of whether Congress has passed a funding bill.

But there’s also another snag: the Anti-Deficiency Act. This law prohibits federal agencies and employees from obligating or spending government funds without congressional appropriations. It allows only narrowly defined ""excepted activities"" to continue during a shutdown.

So, how is Uncle Sam planning on reconciling these seemingly opposing laws?

Courts in Survival Mode

Put simply, the judiciary limped along as long as it could by relying on court fees — money paid by litigants to file cases, access court records, and so on — but those funds are only a stopgap. Once exhausted, the courts face the same constraints as the rest of government and have to sharply limit their operations to what’s required by the Constitution and core legal mandates. Against the backdrop of mounting partisan finger-pointing in Washington, this situation is exposing both structural vulnerabilities and the real-world consequences of a budget impasse on the justice system.

It looks like judges will continue to serve as required by the Constitution, but most court employees will only be permitted to perform ""excepted activities"" under the Anti-Deficiency Act. In the judiciary’s case, “excepted activities” include functions required by the Constitution (adjudicating cases and issuing judicial orders), but also work necessary for the “safety of human life or the protection of property,” and “activities otherwise authorized by law.”

That’s not very clear, is it? Here are examples of the kinds of activities that fall into these exceptions and will therefore remain ongoing: security operations; emergency detention hearings; maintaining critical infrastructure like electronic filing systems; essential criminal proceedings or urgent court filings that cannot be postponed without violating rights.

In short, while judges remain constitutionally obligated to serve, the broader judiciary shifts into “survival mode,” sustaining only the most crucial operations under strict legal limits. Most court employees (clerks, administrative staff, researchers, probation officers, and others) cannot work during a shutdown unless their tasks fall into one of those excepted categories. Those who do continue working must do so without pay until Congress restores funding. All other staff are being placed on furlough.

A ‘Funding Crisis’

Senate Judiciary Committee leaders warn that lapses in funding could soon mean “justice delayed—or even justice denied.” The shutdown's impact extends beyond just court staff: federal public defenders, who represent indigent criminal defendants, will not be paid during this period, nor will private lawyers appointed under the Criminal Justice Act.

In fact, payments for private lawyers have already been delayed since July due to earlier budget shortfalls—a situation the judiciary has deemed a ""funding crisis."" Probation officers, judicial clerks, and administrative staff still working are set to receive their last paychecks on October 24 if appropriations do not resume.

The Justice Department has argued in filings that it cannot keep up with hundreds of lawsuits with reduced staff and resources. While that very well may be true, note that only about 11 percent of its workforce has been furloughed, compared with over 80 percent at agencies like Commerce.

Every Court for Itself?

Each individual court is responsible for determining how it will operate during this funding lapse. Unsurprisingly, this has led to a patchwork of responses nationwide.

Some courts have pledged to keep scheduled trials and grand jury sessions running for as long as possible using remaining funds. For example, Chief Judge Virginia M. Kendall of the Northern District of Illinois warned that delays in timely justice are inevitable but assured that enough funding remains for now to continue critical proceedings. At the Supreme Court, the justices plan to keep hearing cases and issuing rulings while the building remains closed to the public. On Monday, the Court announced they will review a high-profile gun law case but that might just be because the Trump Administration urged them to take it up.

Despite all the operational constraints, litigation against the Trump administration continues apace. Judges overseeing lawsuits challenging administration policies have repeatedly denied government requests to suspend cases due to lack of resources. Some deadlines have, of course, been extended, and less urgent matters have been put on hold. But still, many high-profile cases (including those related to immigration enforcement and deployment of federal forces) are proceeding with only minimal interruption.

Trials and Tribulations Ahead

Looking ahead, lawyers and litigants should brace for significant uncertainty and delays. President Trump and House Republicans show no signs of conceding, blaming Democrats for obstructing federal courts and critical services.

With individual courts making their own operational decisions based on available staffing and resources, parties may find scheduled hearings postponed or rescheduled at short notice. Civil litigation involving federal agencies is particularly affected due to widespread furloughs among agency employees who serve as witnesses or provide necessary documentation.

Ultimately, while judges remain constitutionally obligated to serve, the judiciary is now fulfilling only its core functions and under strict legal restraints.

“Those metrics have turned to immigration enforcement.” Fort Snelling currently has six immigration judges.","The Executive Office for Immigration Review fired Fort Snelling immigration judge Amy Zaske last month, immigration court sources confirmed to the Minnesota Daily.

In April, the court held the deportation trial of University of Minnesota international graduate student Doğukan Gunaydin, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for over a month.

Zaske’s firing comes during a time of nationwide dismissals of immigration judges by EOIR, which cites the executive branch’s authority under Article 2 of the Constitution. A spokesperson for EOIR declined to comment, saying the office does not comment on personnel matters.

Fort Snelling Immigration Court oversees immigration cases for Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota residents. The court had over 21,000 new cases filed in 2024 and is currently experiencing a backlog of 38,694 cases, with the number likely to increase before the end of the year.

Former Assistant Chief Immigration Judge at Fort Snelling Ryan Wood said losing another immigration judge will push the limits of an already strained system.

“The court system on January 19th, 2025, was operating at 125%, or more,” Wood said. “The staff, we were running a sprint pace at marathon lengths indefinitely.”

Wood also said the shortage of administrative staff is equally problematic for the case backlog.

“When you think of the amount of staff work it takes to manage a case docket of 40,000 cases, it’s a lot of people,” Wood said. “They are woefully understaffed, and I don’t know how they’re going to keep up with this.”

Along with staffing changes, the way immigration law has been enforced has changed substantially since President Donald Trump took office in January. The number of individuals criminally prosecuted for immigration violations reached around 6,885 in May, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, up from about 3,344 in February, Trump’s first full month in office.

At Fort Snelling, mounting pressure from the federal government to increase immigration enforcement has led to changes in judges’ decision-making. According to Amy Lange, project manager for The Advocates for Human Rights’ court observation project, the Department of Homeland Security has increased the number of motions to dismiss immigration cases, subjecting immigrants to potential detention and deportation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Lange says judges have repeatedly shifted stances on how to deal with motions for dismissal.

“There were two judges when this first started that weren’t automatically dismissing cases, then obviously there was a lot of pressure that came from above because then they were dismissing every case,” Lange said. “In the last week, we’ve seen two different judges deny a dismissal, and that’s new since early August.”

According to Lange, the administrative staff at the court has rapidly departed. She said that in some cases, staff were provided financial incentives to depart, and in other instances, staff members were fired.

Lange also echoed Wood’s concerns about court system funding and confirmed that former Immigration Judge Zaske’s cases had been reassigned.

“They’re reassigning her cases to other people,” Lange said. “People were showing up for afternoon appearances with Judge Carr, and those hearings had been rescheduled for June, but nobody knew.”

Wood said that Homeland Security Investigations’ and enforcement priorities have shifted under the Trump administration to emphasize immigration.

“They [prosecutors] have metrics; we want to see x number of worksite enforcement actions, x number of prosecutions for child exploitation,” Wood said. “Those metrics have turned to immigration enforcement.”

Fort Snelling currently has six immigration judges. To Wood, the onslaught of firings and pressure on immigration judges has a more discrete motivation of making a mental impact.

“We can’t see a lot of logic in the noise right now, other than that it’s putting fear in the judges,” Wood said. “You’re making close decisions on the bench, and that weighs. On the human level, it’s really tough.”",https://mndaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ctimmigrationjudge.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 15:01:15.372747

Rivera's story gained national attention after he shared a video of himself being denied his CDL renewal at a Utah DMV.
If a crash requires sanctions against CDL privileges, those are reported through the division of court convictions or crash reports.
“I’m not asking for special treatment — just to be able to keep working and providing for my family,” he said.","A Utah truck driver and business owner was among four plaintiffs who sued the federal government over a new rule that prevented immigrants with legal work authorization from obtaining commercial driver's licenses.

The emergency action, issued by Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, immediately paused the issuance and renewal of CDLs for noncitizens while states undergo audits of their licensing systems.

The U.S. Department of Transportation said the rule aimed to address ""widespread noncompliance"" and a ""troubling series of fatal crashes involving foreign nationals.""

Attorneys with Public Citizen, the public-interest law firm who have been representing the plaintiffs, argued the rule was imposed without the required public notice or comment period.

MORE |

""It's possible for an agency to act quickly in a true emergency,"" said Cormac Early, an attorney with Public Citizen Litigation Group. ""But this isn't one. DOT based this on just five news stories, without any data showing noncitizen drivers are more dangerous.""

Early said those incidents — which involved drivers who would not have qualified for CDLs under the new rule — do not amount to the kind of “true emergency” required for an interim final rule.

He added that the government failed to analyze how revoking licenses from thousands of legally employed immigrants could impact the economy and public safety.

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals, challenged both the process and the substance of the rule, alleging it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and unfairly targeted immigrants who have a legal right to work in the U.S.

Among them is Jorge Rivera, a DACA recipient who has lived in the U.S. since childhood and has owned a trucking company in Cedar City.

Rivera's story gained national attention after he shared a video of himself being denied his CDL renewal at a Utah DMV.

""What do you do when you can't renew your license, and you suddenly have to look for another job?"" said Rivera. ""I'm self-employed, I own my own business, I'll have to hire someone to drive my truck.”

Rivera said his CDL, which is set to expire at the same time he has to reapply for his federal work permit, could be revoked by the end of November.

""You're going to take somebody like me off the road who has 11 years of experience and replace me with someone who just came out of school,"" said Rivera. ""How is that making the roads safer?""

State impact and oversight

According to the Utah Division of Driver License, the state has had 85,586 active CDL licenses and permits — roughly 1,000 of which are limited term, issued to noncitizens with legal work authorizations, including DACA recipients, asylum-seekers and refugees.

State officials said they track CDL-related accidents through the Highway Safety Office. If a crash requires sanctions against CDL privileges, those are reported through the division of court convictions or crash reports.

In order to obtain a commercial driver's license, drivers have to take a training course and pass both a written and driven exam. Some drivers, depending on the class of vehicle, may be required to pass additional tests.

If a driver has several moving violations, they may need to retest.

Rivera said he has followed these requirements consistently for his 11 years of driving.

""Every two years that I renew, they run my paperwork and every two years it passes,"" he said.

What comes next

Early said the plaintiffs are seeking to have the rule vacated, which would allow states to resume issuing and renewing CDLs for legal noncitizens as before.

The DOT maintains that the rule is temporary and aimed at protecting public safety while audits are completed. The agency said it will accept public comments and may modify the policy before finalizing it.

For Rivera, the case has been about more than his own livelihood.

“I’m not asking for special treatment — just to be able to keep working and providing for my family,” he said. “This isn’t just about me. It’s about everyone who’s been doing the right thing and is suddenly told they can’t.”

Public comments on the rule remain open on the Department of Transportation’s website.

The full text of the letter can be found here and below.

Dear Mr. Greer:

I am writing to request that you open an investigation concerning reports that political messaging has been disseminated through federal agency channels during the ongoing government shutdown. This includes reports of a request by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to airports that they air videos framing the cause of the federal shutdown in political terms. I believe that the request from DHS to airports, messaging included in federal government websites and communications disseminated to employees are in clear violation of the Hatch Act and federal restrictions on partisan activity by government employees. This is an inappropriate and wasteful use of taxpayer dollars for political gain that merits a full investigation.

Recent postings on official government websites and reported emails to employees promote a partisan political narrative regarding the causes of the shutdown—activity that federal law expressly prohibits when “directed toward the success or failure of a political party, partisan political group, or candidate for partisan political office.”

Again, the Hatch Act is clear: Federal employees must remain impartial in the performance of their duties, regardless of political climate or leadership. Federal employees, including those on California’s Central Coast, deserve clear guidance to ensure that directives do not compromise their integrity or the public’s trust.

It has been brought to my attention that the website for the Los Padres National Forest under the U.S. Department of Agriculture includes partisan messaging attempting to place blame on Congressional Democrats— another violation of the Hatch Act. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident. There are multiple reports that several agencies have issued communications blaming one political party for the ongoing shutdown, using official government resources to amplify these claims. These statements—some of which appeared on agency websites and others distributed internally to staff—frame the shutdown as being “caused by Democrats” or “driven by the left,” language that raises significant Hatch Act concerns. Regardless of which party holds power, such messaging violates the foundational principle that federal agencies serve the American people, not partisan agendas.

These clear violations of federal law demand a prompt and thorough investigation. To ensure accountability and transparency, I respectfully request that the Office of Special Counsel:

Immediately open an investigation into the use of government communications channels for partisan purposes during the shutdown; and

Provide guidance on how your office plans to address these incidents and prevent future violations.

Preserving the impartiality of federal agencies and their employees is essential to ensuring the integrity of our democracy and sustaining the public’s trust in our institutions. I ask that you give this request your immediate attention. Please reach out to my office at (202) 225-3601 should you have any questions.",https://[lastname].house.gov/images/facebook-meta.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 13:17:14.059566

Last Thursday, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sued the Trump administration in the U.S. District for the District of Columbia over the President’s recently announced $100,000 fee on H-1B petitions. According to the Chamber, the fee violates the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and would impose prohibitive costs on businesses seeking to take advantage of the visa program.

President Donald Trump announced the new fee in a September 19 Proclamation entitled “Restriction of Entry on Certain Nonimmigrant Workers.” All H-1B visa petitions filed after September 21 are subject to the $100,000 fee, but previously issued visas will not be impacted. The Proclamation cited the continued abuse of the H-1B program to undercut American wages, and the resulting struggles facing college graduates in the job market, particularly STEM graduates. According to the Proclamation:

The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was created to bring temporary workers into the United States to perform additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor. The large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security. Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.

The Chamber of Commerce pushed back in its lawsuit. The complaint in the case claims that the proposed fee would exacerbate a “well-documented labor shortage” by making it more difficult to staff certain positions with H-1B visa holders, particularly in the STEM fields. The complaint goes on to argue that imposing the fee on H-1B petitions would hinder American manufacturing, innovation, and trade, and make the H-1B program prohibitively expensive for many companies. The Chamber of Commerce also contested the President’s authority to impose the fee on the H-1B program in a way that it regards as “flatly contrary to Congress’s directives” as laid out in the INA, namely statutes outlining the implementation of the H-1B program.

Trump administration officials were quick to respond. According to a statement from the White House: “President Trump promised to put American workers first, and his commonsense action on H1-B visas does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages, while providing certainty to employers who need to bring the best talent from overseas.” FAIR’s executive director and general counsel Dale Wilcox also supported the new H-1B fee, saying, “The new fee is significant enough to discourage employers who merely want to hire lower wage foreign workers, but not so prohibitive that it will prevent them from petitioning for workers whose skills are truly needed.”",https://www.fairus.org/sites/default/files/styles/og_image/public/images/H1B%20Visa%2C%20Money%2C%20Passports%2C%20Cracked%20American%20Flag.jpeg.webp?itok=ZaYc8XYL,N,,2025-10-22 13:17:17.123025

The filings follow President Trump’s recent National Guard deployments to major cities, raising alarm that such tactics could extend to polling locations next year. Trump previously made similar threats ahead of the 2020 election, when he claimed he would send law enforcement officials to monitor polling sites. — a move experts warned could intimidate voters and potentially violate federal law.

“The presence of law enforcement or military personnel at polling places risks chilling voter participation and undermining public confidence in the integrity of our elections —– perhaps that is what President Trump is counting on,” said Chioma Chukwu, Executive Director of American Oversight. “The possibility that this kind of government power might be used to threaten voters exercising their constitutional rights demands scrutiny. Rather than stoke fears of political intimidation, the administration should strengthen trust in our democracy and address the real crises affecting people’s lives.”

Deploying military personnel or immigration enforcement officials to polling places would not be Trump’s first use of federal power to influence the 2026 midterms. With a history of punishing states that refuse to do his bidding, he has publicly pressed states to redraw congressional maps ahead of the 2026 midterm cycle, intervening directly in the redistricting process in states like Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina to lock in additional Republican seats rather than wait for the usual post-census period.

Additionally, Trump ordered the Department of Justice (DOJ) to investigate ActBlue, the main online fundraising platform for Democratic candidates, while ignoring its GOP counterpart, WinRed. The DOJ has also demanded detailed voter registration data from states, threatening legal action against some Democratic-led states that have not complied. What’s more, Trump has also indicated he will sign an executive order outlawing voting machines and mail-in ballots, despite courts blocking his earlier executive actions that sought to impose proof-of-citizenship requirements for voter registration.",https://americanoversight.org/wp-content/uploads/Copy-of-Web-image-template-4.png,N,,2025-10-22 13:17:20.844315

Trump could mobilize a state’s National Guard over its governor’s objections for blatantly illegal purposes, and courts would be powerless to stop him.
The ruling did not say, or remotely imply, that courts lack authority to review the president’s decision, as Nelson wrongly asserted.
But Congress later stripped out that deferential language and replaced it with explicit restrictions on federalization of the National Guard.
Nelson’s theory would nullify Congress’ constitutional authority over the National Guard by letting the president summon it whenever he wants.","Two judges appointed by President Donald Trump allowed him to deploy the National Guard into Portland, Oregon, on Monday, granting the executive branch sweeping authority to suppress peaceful protests based on false claims of widespread violence. The 2–1 decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rested on a credulous reading of the record: The majority largely accepted the administration’s portrayal of Portland as a “war zone,” dismissing the district court’s extensive findings to the contrary. As dissenting Judge Susan Graber pointed out, Trump’s “illegal deployment of troops” rests on “false pretenses,” “fabrication,” and “propaganda”—all “political theater” that no court should dignify.

As bad as Monday’s decision was, it could have been far worse. In a concurrence, Judge Ryan Nelson argued that the judiciary has no power at all to review (or halt) a president’s deployment of the National Guard to suppress alleged domestic unrest. In Nelson’s view, Trump enjoys absolute discretion to send troops into American cities for any reason he deems necessary, and no court may stand in his way. It may be tempting to dismiss this argument as Nelson’s audition for a Supreme Court seat. But it must be taken seriously, because it is precisely what the Trump administration is now asking SCOTUS to embrace. And it is wrong from top to bottom: As a matter of constitutional principle, statutory text, precedent, and history, there is no remotely plausible argument that courts cannot review a president’s domestic deployment of the National Guard. Indeed, the weight of evidence points in the opposite direction.

Before delving into why Nelson’s claim is wrong, consider its radical and disturbing consequences. Trump could mobilize a state’s National Guard over its governor’s objections for blatantly illegal purposes, and courts would be powerless to stop him. He could send in the Guard to punish voters, protesters, and lawmakers who oppose his agenda—as he is doing in Portland and Chicago—responding to political disagreements with a militarized crackdown. He could flood Democratic cities with troops during an election to obstruct people going to the polls. He could dispatch soldiers to surround critical media outlets, sending the message that dissent will be met with force. The opportunities for repression are boundless, which is one reason why the Framers were so hostile to the idea of a standing army responsible for domestic security.

In light of these dire consequences, one might expect Nelson to mount a robust defense of his belief that Trump’s mobilization of the Guard “may not be reviewed by the federal courts.” But he devoted a sum total of fewer than six pages to this radical claim and spent most of them mischaracterizing Supreme Court precedent. The key case, to his mind, is 1827’s Martin v. Mott, a dispute over President James Madison’s authority to call up the states’ militias (the predecessors to our National Guard) during the War of 1812. In his unanimous opinion, Chief Justice Joseph Story held that Madison’s mobilization was lawful because the British invasion constituted a genuine emergency. The ruling included a sentence that the Trump administration has repeated ad nauseam: “We are all of opinion,” Story wrote, “that the authority to decide whether the exigency has arisen, belongs exclusively to the President, and that his decision is conclusive upon all other persons.”

Plucked from context, these words seem to imply that the president alone may determine when there is an emergency that requires state militias, and courts may not second-guess his decision. That’s precisely what Nelson insisted on Monday. But as professor Steve Vladeck has explained, the sentence means something entirely different in the context of the opinion. Mott addressed a debate about whether the president could make the initial determination that an emergency exists, or whether officers lower in the military’s chain of command could do so instead. The Supreme Court, professors Joshua Braver and John Dehn have shown, was concerned about preserving the military chain of command, specifically during a foreign invasion; it wanted to ensure that the commander in chief’s military subordinates could not defy his decision in a crisis.

To that end, Mott announced that the president, rather than officers of inferior rank, could make the first call to deploy the militia in a national crisis. The ruling did not say, or remotely imply, that courts lack authority to review the president’s decision, as Nelson wrongly asserted. That mistake has been definitively debunked by Braver, Dehn, and a comprehensive account of the case by the Constitutional Accountability Center.

There is another reason why neither Mott nor any other 19th-century case that Nelson cites could possibly stand for the proposition that courts may not review the president’s declaration of an emergency: They involved a different statute than the one Trump now relies upon. Those cases interpreted the Militia Acts of 1795 and 1807, which broadly empowered the president to “call forth” the militia to counter an insurrection or rebellion “as he shall think proper.” These statutes gave immense deference to the president’s judgment and imposed few limitations. But Congress later stripped out that deferential language and replaced it with explicit restrictions on federalization of the National Guard. The modern statute allows the president to send in the troops only in the case of insurrection, rebellion, or an inability “with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Nelson ignored this significant revision of the statutory text. He wrote that the current statute “uses similar language” to its predecessors, disregarding Congress’ deletion of a clause that gave more deference to the president. But as Judge Graber pointed out in dissent, today’s statute includes careful limitations on the president’s discretion. And those limits create a “judicial responsibility” for courts to rebuff the president when he deploys the Guard “in a situation far divorced” from what Congress envisioned.

There is, Graber noted, a deeper principle that counsels judicial review here. The Constitution does not give the president control over the militia; it allows Congress to decide when the militia may be called up. Congress has decided when deployment is appropriate and instructed the president to send in troops in those circumstances alone.

The Department of Homeland Security described the operation as a “targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City, focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”.
Trump, she said, “claims he’s targeting the ‘worst of the worst’” but “today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street”.
The city comptroller, Brad Lander, said that “street vendors are not a national security threat” and thanked the “New Yorkers who mobilized quickly”.
The three candidates for New York City mayor also reacted to the raid.","Local and state officials in New York are expressing outrage after dozens of federal agents carried out a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raid in Manhattan’s Chinatown on Tuesday.

Eyewitnesses accounts and video footage captured the chaotic scenes in Lower Manhattan on Tuesday afternoon, where masked and armed federal agents were seen detaining several individuals near Canal Street, while crowds of New Yorkers gathered, protesting against the action. Military-style vehicles were also seen driving through the area.

The Department of Homeland Security described the operation as a “targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation on Canal Street in New York City, focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”.

The raid drew swift condemnation from local and state leaders.

The New York police department (NYPD) quickly distanced itself from the operation, stating that the department had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon”.

Eric Adams, the mayor, reposted the NYPD’s statement and added: “New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.”

The New York governor, Kathy Hochul, condemned the operation and hit out at Donald Trump.

Trump, she said, “claims he’s targeting the ‘worst of the worst’” but “today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street”.

“You don’t make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers,” she said.

Chuck Schumer, a New York senator, called the raid “indiscriminate, wrong, and destructive” and said that federal immigration agencies “should target criminals for arrest and deportation – not unleash reckless raids against vendors on the streets of the city”.

“This creates fear and chaos and does not make us safer,” he added.

Jumaane Williams, the city’s public advocate, said that federal agents deprived “vendors of due process and ripping them from their families – all because they tried to earn a living”. The city comptroller, Brad Lander, said that “street vendors are not a national security threat” and thanked the “New Yorkers who mobilized quickly”.

Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, described the raid on Tuesday as a “horrifying display of federal overreach and authoritarian tactics”, adding that “our communities deserve safety, dignity and due process – not fear and violence that tear families apart”.

He also told reporters that a few people were taken into custody for protesting and blocking Ice’s efforts.

A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that people in the crowd “were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties” and said that at least one protester was arrested for allegedly assaulting a federal officer.

The three candidates for New York City mayor also reacted to the raid.

The Democratic candidate, Zohran Mamdani, condemned the operation as a “aggressive and reckless raid on immigrant street vendors”, adding: “Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop.”

Andrew Cuomo, the independent candidate and former New York governor, called the raid an “abuse of federal power by the Trump administration: more about fear than justice, more about politics than safety.

“This is not who we are, and it will never be NYC when I am mayor,” Cuomo said. “The Statue of Liberty stands in our harbor, not as a decoration, but as a declaration of our values and the promise of America.”

And in a statement to the Gothamist, a spokesperson for the Republican candidate, Curtis Sliwa, said that the federal government should prioritize the deportation of “gang members, sex traffickers, and those involved in major crimes.

“[Sliwa] has also been clear that the backs of restaurants and other service industries should not be the focus of immigration enforcement, and that resources should target dangerous offenders, not working people,” the spokesperson added.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f39a4b9e75b9e3fd40331d8b4b1a3e942cf93102/383_0_3799_3039/master/3799.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbae09c57f8f7d769ead6cb4ccb444ee",N,,2025-10-22 12:57:43.059555

“Shutdown Democrats are already refusing to pay our law enforcement agents. Now, @RepRobertGarcia and @SenBlumenthal are trying to put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs,” Bondi said in a post on the social platform X, referring to Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).

“@TheJusticeDept has ZERO tolerance for violence against law enforcement — we will prosecute any person who physically assaults our agents,” she added.

Bondi’s post also featured a clip of a Monday press conference with Garcia and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass (D).

“The Oversight Committee, I shared this with the mayor — over the course of the next couple of weeks, the Oversight Committee will be launching on their website a master ICE tracker where we can … essentially [track] every single instance that we can verify that the community will send, be able to send us information on.”

“It’ll be all available in one central place,” he added.

Garcia responded to Bondi with his own X post an hour after Bondi’s initial post.

“Hey @AGPamBondi, ICE detaining over 170 U.S. citizens is not them ‘just doing their jobs.’ But since you have the time to tweet at me—when are you going to stop covering for pedophiles and release the Epstein files?” the California Democrat said.

Since he returned to office in January, President Trump’s administration has heavily cracked down on immigration. Last week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) implemented a new $1,000 immigration fee for migrants paroled into the U.S.

The fee aims to “institute accountability and prevent rampant fraud of the parole system,” DHS said. It would also bolster oversight of the immigration parole system “and deter its misuse.”

“The Biden Administration abused America’s immigration system and turned parole into a de facto amnesty program, thereby allowing millions of unvetted illegal aliens into the U.S., no questions asked, to the detriment of all Americans,” DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a previous statement.

Blumenthal, in an emailed statement, said ICE was “using police state tactics to terrorize communities across the country — unlawfully arresting at least 170 U.S. citizens in the process.”

The Hill has reached out ICE for comment.

(AP) — Women taken into custody by U.S. immigration agents while pregnant say they received inadequate care in a letter Wednesday that calls on the Trump administration to stop holding expectant mothers in federal detention facilities.

The letter to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is part of a broader campaign in recent months by Democrats and immigrant rights groups to draw attention to what they say is the mistreatment of pregnant women who have been detained in Trump's immigration crackdown.

The Department of Homeland Security has defended the care given to pregnant detainees, saying they are given regular prenatal visits and nutritional support. The agency did not immediately provide figures on the number of pregnant women in detention, as Democrats have demanded.

The letter sent by the American Civil Liberties Union gives accounts from pregnant women who say they were shackled while being transported, placed in solitary confinement for multiple days and given insufficient food and water while held in detention facilities in Louisiana and Georgia.

The ACLU said that over the past five months it has met with more than a dozen females who were pregnant while in ICE custody -- including some who had a miscarriage while detained. The women reported “gravely troubling experiences,” the letter states, including lack of translation during medical encounters and medical neglect. One suffered a “severe” infection after her miscarriage.

In an interview with The Associated Press, one of those woman said she was kept in handcuffs while being transported to Louisiana — a journey that lasted five hours and spanned two plane rides. The woman, who has since been released from custody and given birth, spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of facing retaliation during her ongoing case.

An officer told her he considered taking off the handcuffs but worried she would escape. “How am I going to escape if I’m pregnant?” the woman said she responded.

She said she felt as if she'd been kidnapped and experienced dizziness, nausea and suffered from vaginal bleeding. During her time in the detention facility, she said pregnant women were not offered special diets and described the food as horrible. She alleged that detainees had to “beg” for water and toilet paper.

The ACLU's letter is the latest call for an investigation into the arrest and treatment of pregnant detainees.

Senate Democrats wrote Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in September, expressing concerns about the “prevalence and treatment” of pregnant, postpartum and nursing women in ICE custody and demanded that the agency stop detaining such people unless there are “exceptional circumstances.”

Democratic lawmakers have also said information about the number of pregnant women in ICE custody has been difficult to ascertain.

DHS has said that pregnant detainees receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations “aligned with community standards of care.”

“Detention of pregnant women is rare and has elevated oversight and review,” the agency said in an August press release.

Perhaps this hypocrisy has more to do with playing politics with California than ensuring road safety across our nation.
However, the wholesale ban of immigrants with temporary immigration status turns the focus on eligibility instead of implementing tougher policies for road safety.
We can raise the bar for road safety, but should do so in a way that gives immigrants a chance to meet those standards.","U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy recently announced sweeping changes to significantly restrict the issuance of commercial driver’s licenses to immigrant workers with temporary work authorization.

The rule changes the federal minimum eligibility requirements — immigrants with pending asylum cases, for example, can no longer receive a commercial driver’s license with a work permit alone.

Duffy’s comments took particular aim at California, whose policies have been under strict scrutiny after a California trucker was involved in an accident in Florida, killing three. The driver was a Sikh, whose religious attire — such as his turban — drew bigoted and racist comments from across the country. It’s estimated that 150,000 Sikhs work in the trucking industry, with an overwhelming majority of them being from California. The Florida turnpike crash was a turning point for Sikh truckers. Sikhs remain at the center of this issue, with many reporting harassment and racial abuse while driving across the country. The mistake of one man in Florida is being used to target the entire Sikh trucking community.

Historically, Sikhs have disproportionately been victims of hate crimes due to their outward religious symbols, such as their turbans and long beards. Many chose the trucking profession as it allowed them to maintain their religious preferences and also earn a living. For these hardworking immigrants, this was the American dream.

But now, asylum seekers from Sikh, Mexican and other communities with pending asylum cases will no longer be able to work as truckers. Those with an existing commercial driver’s license are no longer eligible for renewal. And with obsolete licenses, the livelihoods of thousands of workers have been upended.

The immigrants being affected by this policy change had lawfully issued employment authorization documents. In other words, these individuals followed proper procedure, bringing their asylum cases to the immigration courts and diligently showing up for every hearing and court date.

In many ways, the catalyst behind these new trucking policies stemmed from a xenaphobic “other-ing” of a community of truck drivers. To justify these policies, it was necessary to create and justify the idea that immigrant drivers were making American roads unsafe. The data, however, tells a different story.

California has a fatal crash rate for commercial drivers that is almost 40% lower than the national average. According to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which releases reports on state-level commercial motor vehicle fatal crashes, the 10 states with the highest commercial fatal crash rate are all Republican states. The 10 states with the highest crash rates are Wyoming, New Mexico, North Dakota, West Virginia, Oklahoma, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska and Mississippi. The FSMCA data is expansive, assessed through fatal crashes per 100 million total vehicle miles traveled.

The data is clear that this policy is not a result of a focus on road safety, but instead an immigration incitement issue.

Why target immigrant drivers, who work dangerous hours to support and contribute to the American economy? Perhaps this hypocrisy has more to do with playing politics with California than ensuring road safety across our nation. California has been a thorn in the side for the Trump administration, who perceive Gov. Gavin Newsom’s state as defying federal authority.

The abruptness of the policy is a problem in itself. Unlike many new rules which phase out certain policies, this overnight change allows no time for truckers to assess their options.

So what can we do? To start, tighter safety regulations are needed across the country. Tougher tests, increased language requirements and stricter policies are important to curbing road risks. However, the wholesale ban of immigrants with temporary immigration status turns the focus on eligibility instead of implementing tougher policies for road safety.

We can raise the bar for road safety, but should do so in a way that gives immigrants a chance to meet those standards. No one wants safer roads more than truckers, who spend their entire lives on them. However, reacting to a tragedy in Florida in this way isn’t wise policy-making — it’s politics.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/latest-news/opn71u/picture311907879/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/FRS_EPZ_PUNJABI_TRUCKING_01.JPG,N,,2025-10-22 15:01:10.020539

October 22, 2025 10:00 am

WASHINGTON — A group of civil and human rights organizations today urged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to end the detention of pregnant people immediately and to investigate alarming reports of medical neglect and abuse in ICE facilities in Louisiana and Georgia.

In a letter sent to ICE leadership, the American Civil Liberties Union, American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana, National Immigration Project, Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, Sanctuary of the South, and Sanctuary Now Abolition Project detailed the experiences of six women detained at the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, Louisiana, and the Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia. Several of the women were pregnant or had recently miscarried while in custody.

“Our interviews indicate that ICE has issued detainers, arrested, and taken pregnant individuals into custody, even after they have informed officers of their pregnancy, in violation of agency guidance,” advocates warned in their joint letter. “Notably, ICE has issued detainers and then detained several cases of pregnant individuals arising from domestic disputes. This practice endangers survivors of domestic violence, particularly pregnant individuals, who are more vulnerable to abuse and violence.”

Advocates interviewed more than a dozen women, and in their letter, also describe disturbing accounts of shackling and use of restraint during transport, solitary confinement, denial of prenatal vitamins, inadequate food, delayed or substandard medical care, and lack of interpretation during medical visits. One woman experienced a dangerous infection after a miscarriage due to ICE’s medical neglect.

Along with documenting abuses, the groups also urged ICE to:

Identify and release all pregnant, postpartum, and nursing individuals in its custody

Comply with its own directive prohibiting the detention of pregnant individuals except in extraordinary circumstances

Guarantee timely medical care consistent with community standards of care

Investigate failures of informed consent and language access for women seeking gynecological care

The groups argue that ICE’s practices continue to violate federal regulations and ICE’s own policies, putting pregnant and postpartum individuals at risk.

“I experienced so much pain and trauma while detained,” said Jenny, a mother who was detained in February 2025 at the Basile detention center while she was pregnant. Jenny is using a pseudonym to protect her privacy. “I am sharing my story for all the other women in detention, as well as the women who were deported. There were even women who lost their pregnancies. I want to make sure everyone knows what we had to go through. There are many women in detention who are facing this experience now and each of them needs help and support from advocates, members of Congress, and the community.”

No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways.
What's next: Giannoulias announced that his office has created a ""Plate Watch Hotline"" for residents to report suspected license plate tampering.
Separately, another judge ordered federal immigration agents to wear body cameras due to protests involving agents using aggressive tactics for crowd control.","Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias is warning federal immigration agents that swapping or altering license plates during the Trump administration's enforcement operations is against the law and ""will not be tolerated.""

What we know:

Giannoulias issued the warning after reports surfaced that ICE agents have been changing or flipping state-issued license plates while carrying out what he described as ""military-style deportation efforts"" in the Chicago area.

A video circulating on social media appears to show a federal agent telling someone, ""You can record all you want. We change the plates out every day.""

In response, Giannoulias said, ""Swapping out license plates or tampering with them to avoid or conceal detection is illegal, unsafe and will not be tolerated in Illinois. No one, including federal agents, is above the law, and we intend to hold them accountable, especially while driving on our roadways. This is a matter of public safety and protecting the wellbeing of our communities.""

What's next:

Giannoulias announced that his office has created a ""Plate Watch Hotline"" for residents to report suspected license plate tampering. Reports can be made by calling 312-814-1730 or emailing platewatch@ilsos.gov.

Under Illinois law, displaying a plate not authorized for a vehicle, or obscuring or modifying a plate can result in fines, possible jail time, and suspension or revocation of the vehicle’s registration.

Giannoulias also reminded drivers that all Illinois-registered vehicles must display two license plates, one on the front and back, and that vehicles from other states must comply with their own state’s requirements when driving in Illinois.

The backstory:

The warning from Giannoulias comes amid an increase in federal immigration enforcement efforts across the Chicago area under President Donald Trump.

Broadview’s ICE facility has become a focus of recent protests, some of which have grown tense over the past month or so.

Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security continues to defend its immigration enforcement tactics in court. A judge recently blocked the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard to the Chicago area to assist federal agents in the immigration crackdown.

House speaker responds to report that Trump is demanding $230m in reimbursement from justice department

Mike Johnson said that he hasn’t spoken with the president about a New York Times report that he is seeking $230m from his own justice department in damages over past federal investigations.

“I know that he believes he’s owed that reimbursement. What I heard yesterday was, if he receives it, he was going to consider giving it to charity,” he said.

As my colleague, Joseph Gedeon, reports, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically bars claims arising from discretionary or policy actions, meaning a president seeking compensation for law enforcement investigations into his own conduct would fall well outside the statute’s intended scope.

The president insisted on Tuesday that the government owes him “a lot of money” for previous justice department investigations into his conduct. “It’s interesting, ’cause I’m the one that makes the decision, right?” Trump said at the White House.

The No Kings alliance, the left-leaning groups behind the mass days of protest last Saturday and in June, is building a nationwide rapid response network that will call on supporters to take new actions each week.

Leaders of the organizations told the Guardian that there was energy for “some type of disruption”, and future actions could include targeted boycotts, campaigns at universities, more street protests, and electoral organizing in local communities.

After an estimated 7 million people took to the streets last weekend, tens of thousands joined a national call on Tuesday to hear what’s next for the growing movement. Leaders celebrated the broad turnout, saying it showed how much opposition to Trump there was in all corners of the US, and talked about how to sustain and grow a movement during an increasingly authoritarian moment for the country.

The next steps for this burgeoning resistance will show the durability of the movement and whether it can pressure Democrats or pillars of civil society to stand stronger against Trump, or whether it can force defections from Trump’s Republican allies to fracture his power.

Democrat Scott Wiener will run for the US House seat long held by Nancy Pelosi, the California state senator announced on Wednesday.

Pelosi, the first female speaker of the House, has represented San Francisco in Congress since 1987 and has not yet said whether she will seek re-election in 2026. But Democrats are increasingly facing calls for change with younger candidates who will offer new opposition to Donald Trump.

Wiener has served as a state lawmaker since 2016 and said he was seeking office to stand up to Trump as the president wages a “full-on war against immigrants and LGBTQ people” and the cost of living continues to increase.

“We need more than rhetoric and good intentions from Democrats. We need action. We need someone who will fight like hell for the most marginalized in our community – someone who will stand up for trans kids, undocumented immigrants even when it’s unpopular, even when it means getting personally attacked and threatened,” Wiener said in a statement. “We need leaders with spines, who don’t just put their finger in the air to see where the winds are blowing or what polls well.”

As a state lawmaker, Wiener, an attorney who attended Harvard law school, authored a recently passed bill banning federal and state law enforcement from wearing masks and has promoted legislation to address California’s housing crisis and expand climate action.

“I’m running for Congress to defend San Francisco, our values, our people and the constitution of the United States with everything I have,” Wiener said in a video announcing his candidacy. “I’ve stood up to violence and hate my entire life. Trump and his Maga extremists don’t scare me.”

Vance meets with families of Israeli hostages after press conference with Netanyahu

A short while ago, vice-president JD Vance met with families of Israeli hostages who returned alive and families members of deceased hostages who have not been returned.

Earlier, Vance met with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who maintained that Israel has an “unmatched alliance” and partnership with the US.

“I was impressed with your clarity, with your incisiveness, with your solidarity for our common cause,” he said of Vance.

The vice-president said that the nations they would be sitting down to work on the Gaza peace plan. “We’re have a very tough task ahead of us, which is to disarm Hamas but rebuild Gaza,” he said.

When Vance was asked about the fragility of the current ceasefire he said “this thing takes monitoring, and it’s going to take a lot of work.”

One repeated refrain from House Republicans today was how Democrats push back on several policy issues simply because they are loth to support the president.

Most of today’s speakers repeated this claim today, with House conference chair Lisa McClain even saying “president Trump could have the cure for cancer, and the Democrats would vote no” because it came from him.

House speaker responds to report that Trump is demanding $230m in reimbursement from justice department

Mike Johnson said that he hasn’t spoken with the president about a New York Times report that he is seeking $230m from his own justice department in damages over past federal investigations.

“I know that he believes he’s owed that reimbursement. What I heard yesterday was, if he receives it, he was going to consider giving it to charity,” he said.

As my colleague, Joseph Gedeon, reports, the Federal Tort Claims Act specifically bars claims arising from discretionary or policy actions, meaning a president seeking compensation for law enforcement investigations into his own conduct would fall well outside the statute’s intended scope.

The president insisted on Tuesday that the government owes him “a lot of money” for previous justice department investigations into his conduct. “It’s interesting, ’cause I’m the one that makes the decision, right?” Trump said at the White House.

Johnson kicked off the press conference continuing to blame Democrats for the shutdown. Both parties have traded endless barbs in the four weeks since government funding lapsed.

“As long as Democrats continue to act like unserious lawmakers, I’m just going to say this morning enough is enough,” he said.

The House speaker brought up the topic of Affordable Care Act (ACA) premium tax credits, which Democrats say is one of the key extensions they’re seeking in any stopgap funding bill. A reminder, Obamacare subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year. For his part, Johnson maintained today that resolving this in a continuing resolution was “not possible”.

“Republicans cannot and will not solve it in a back room deal,” he added. “Issues of this magnitude deserve deep thought and deliberation.”

Man arrested after driving into security gate outside White House

A man who drove into a Secret Service vehicle gate outside the White House has been arrested.

US Secret Service said in a statement that the incident took place late Tuesday at “approximately 10.37pm”. The individual drove into the security gate located at 17th and E St NW, in Washington DC.

Ultimately the vehicle was assessed and deemed safe. They added that their “investigation into the cause of this collision is ongoing”.

Officials did not provide any extra details on the driver’s identity or possible motivation. The vehicle had a Maryland license place.

Democratic senator continues 14-hour floor speech, as government shutdown enters day 22

Democratic senator Jeff Merkley, of Oregon, has been speaking on the floor of the upper chamber for more than 14 hours.

Merkley said that his marathon speech, which began at 6.24pm ET on Tuesday, is to “ring the alarm bells” about how Donald Trump is “shredding the constitution”.

Throughout his time on the floor, which threatens to delay legislative business in the Senate as long as Merkley is still speaking, the lawmaker has run through the president’s first nine months back in the White House, chastising his tariff policies, the use of the justice department to target of his political adversaries, and his frequent attacks on journalists and the media.

Throughout the speech Merkley had several dark green placards behind him to illustrate his points. As of now, he’s standing in front of a sign which reads “AUTHORITARIANISM IS HERE”.

A reminder that Cory Booker, the Democratic senator from New Jersey, holds the record for the longest Senate floor speech – coming in at over 25 hours earlier this year.

Senate’s top Democrat decries Manhattan immigration raids on street vendors

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who represents New York, said that the federal immigration raids targeting street vendors in Manhattan were “indiscriminate, wrong, and destructive”.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials said the operation was “targeted” and “focused on criminal activity relating to the selling of counterfeit goods”. The arrests sparked protests outside 26 Federal Plaza, where several immigrants were reportedly detained.

“Fed immigration agencies should target criminals for arrest and deportation-not unleash reckless raids against vendors on the streets of the city,” Schumer said. “This creates fear and chaos and does not make us safer.”

New Hampshire Republican John E. Sununu announced a campaign for US Senate on Wednesday, hoping to reclaim a seat he lost nearly two decades ago and boosting the GOP’s chances of regaining a foothold in a region overwhelmingly represented by Democrats.

Sununu, 61, is seeking the Republican nomination for the seat being vacated by US Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat who ousted him in 2008. His decision sets up a primary featuring two former senators: Republican Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts before moving to New Hampshire and losing to Shaheen in 2014, has been running since June.

“Maybe you’re surprised to hear that I’m running for the Senate again. I’m a bit surprised myself,” Sununu said in a video announcement. “Why would anyone subject themselves to everything going on there right now? Well, somebody has to step up and lower the temperature. Somebody has to get things done.”

Senate Republicans, who hold a 53-47 advantage, are defending seats in Ohio, Maine and North Carolina against a slate of high-profile Democratic candidates. But Republicans are also on the offensive in places like Michigan, Georgia and now, increasingly, New Hampshire – and if they flip one of those seats it will probably put the chamber out of reach for Democrats until at least 2028.

Sununu must first win the primary though, and his past opposition to President Donald Trump could be problematic. While Brown has aligned himself closely with Trump and served as his US ambassador to New Zealand, Sununu backed Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, writing an op-ed calling Trump a “loser.”

Trump went on to win New Hampshire’s leadoff primary, but the state’s voters rejected him for a third time in the general election. And while Republicans control the Statehouse and governor’s office, Democrats have held all four of New Hampshire’s congressional seats since 2017.

Sununu served three terms in the US House before being elected to the Senate at age 38. He’s now the same age Shaheen was when she defeated him and is 16 years older than US Rep. Chris Pappas, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. Sununu said Congress has become “loud, dysfunctional, even angry” in his time away, but said he hopes to return “to help calm the waters,” while focusing on the economy, veterans, health care costs and Social Security.

Pappas’ campaign countered that he is the one who has been fighting to lower costs for working families, seniors and small businesses while Sununu has spent years “cashing in and making millions selling out to corporations and working for special interests”.

Mayor says Ice should not target undocumented people in New York City

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. We start with the news that the mayor of New York City has said that the city has had “no involvement” in the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids in Chinatown related to “selling counterfeit goods”.

Mayor Eric Adams shared a social media post from the New York police department (NYPD) after it distanced itself from the raids, saying that it had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal Street this afternoon”.

Adams quote-tweeted the NYPD’s missive and emphasized:

New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.

While we gather details about the situation, New Yorkers should know that we have no involvement. Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals.

Hundreds showed up to protests that broke out in New York City on Tuesday evening after Ice raids related to “selling counterfeit goods” were conducted in the Chinatown neighborhood earlier in the day and resulted in an unknown number of people being detained.

Hours after federal agents descended on lower Manhattan, demonstrators were seen assembling near the 26 Federal Plaza Immigration Building where they believed detainees were taken. Many shouted chants including “Ice out of New York” and “No Ice, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Videos of the raid show multiple masked and armed federal agents zip-tying and detaining a man, and shoving away onlookers. Throngs of New Yorkers followed the agents through the streets and down the sidewalks. An armored military vehicle was also seen rolling through the city streets.

“Is this worth the paycheck? Selling your soul?” one woman can be heard shouting at agents.

The raid, which onlookers say involved more than 50 federal agents, took place in a well-known area of Manhattan where counterfeit handbags, accessories, jewelry and other goods are sold daily en masse – often to tourists.

It was unclear how many people were detained in the raid, but a witness told the New York Daily News that he saw at least seven individuals taken into custody.

Finally, when a federal court lawsuit in the Ninth Circuit involves California state law claims, an anti-SLAPP motion remains an option and offers the prospect of attorney’s fees to successful movants.","An en banc panel of the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit further narrowed the protections available in federal court under California’s anti-SLAPP law, which provides an avenue for quickly disposing of meritless lawsuits that seek to chill First Amendment rights.

The ruling in Gopher Media LLC v. Melone extends a trend of Ninth Circuit decisions that have significantly limited the protections provided by California’s anti-SLAPP law and has three major implications for litigants:

Forum selection matters more than ever, with California state court offering significantly stronger anti-SLAPP protections than federal court.

The long-term viability of anti-SLAPP motions in federal court remains uncertain.

Anti-SLAPP motions remain available in Ninth Circuit federal courts, and the potential for substantial attorney’s fee awards still makes them a valuable tool for defendants facing suits targeting their speech.

The opinion in a lawsuit that arose from a dispute over parking spots outside a California pizzeria held that district court denials of anti-SLAPP motions aren’t immediately appealable in federal court, overruling the contrary 2003 decision in Batzel v. Smith.

Now, defendants filing anti-SLAPP motions in federal proceedings may have to wait longer to vindicate their rights.

Decades-Long Saga

Gopher Media is the latest installment in a story that began in 1992, when the California legislature enacted the state’s anti-SLAPP statute, which allows defendants in such cases to file a special motion to strike at the outset of litigation and provides procedural protections.

Because anti-SLAPP motions may be filed only to strike claims arising under state rather than federal law, most anti-SLAPP litigation takes place in state court. But what happens when a California law claim is litigated in federal court?

In 1999, the Ninth Circuit held the statute applies in that circumstance. It since has struggled with questions about how to reconcile its provisions with the details of federal court practice. The court has stripped away many of the protections of the anti-SLAPP law that apply in state court, reasoning that they conflict with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

Gopher Media Implications

This decision continues the erosion. The only question presented in Gopher Media was about interlocutory appeals. In its 2003 decision in Batzel, the Ninth Circuit held that a district court’s denial of an anti-SLAPP motion under California law is immediately appealable, as it is in state court.

The real action in Gopher Media is reflected in the two dueling concurring opinions regarding the broader question of whether California’s anti-SLAPP law should continue to apply in federal court at all.

Judge Mark Bennett, joined by Judge Consuelo Callahan, argued it should. In their view, the anti-SLAPP motion provides defendants with a “substantive right” in the form of a “claim for attorneys’ fees for plaintiffs’ abuse of the judicial process,” and “no federal rule controls or directly collides with that right.”

In contrast, Judge Daniel Bress—joined by Judges Daniel Collins, Kenneth Lee, and Patrick Bumatay—would have held that California’s anti-SLAPP law doesn’t apply in federal court at all.

They pointed out that the Ninth Circuit’s case law has gradually whittled away most core aspects of the statute because they conflict with federal procedural rules. The attorney’s fees provision is “all that really remains” of the anti-SLAPP law in federal court and concluded it is ultimately “a procedural device” that can’t apply in federal court under the Erie doctrine.

In an odd coincidence of timing, the Federal Circuit held in an opinion published on Oct. 15—less than a week after Gopher Media—that denials of California anti-SLAPP motions are immediately appealable under the collateral-order doctrine. The opinion cites Batzel favorably and reflects no awareness than the en banc Ninth Circuit just overruled it, so the Federal Circuit may grant rehearing and reconsider its decision to align with Gopher Media.

Key Takeaways

California litigants and their attorneys should think carefully about whether state or federal court is a more favorable forum. With the demise of interlocutory appeals in federal court, anti-SLAPP movants have lost one more key benefit of the law, along with the discovery stay and the heightened pleading standard. Yet those protections will continue to apply in California state court.

While defendants often seek to remove cases from state court to federal court, that calculus may flip for defendants planning to file anti-SLAPP motions. And counsel for plaintiffs who anticipate a potential motion may prefer to file in federal court when they can, to deprive defendants of that choice.

It’s also an open question how much longer this slimmed-down version of California’s anti-SLAPP law will apply in federal court. The broader legal landscape has shifted in a way that generally disfavors anti-SLAPP motions in federal court.

Informed in part by intervening US Supreme Court decisions, other circuits have held that state anti-SLAPP statutes don’t apply in federal court. Several Ninth Circuit judges across the ideological spectrum have urged the en banc court to join those courts. They may yet prevail, or the Supreme Court may take up the issue at some point—particularly if the square conflict that now exists between the Ninth Circuit and the Federal Circuit regarding interlocutory appeals persists.

Finally, when a federal court lawsuit in the Ninth Circuit involves California state law claims, an anti-SLAPP motion remains an option and offers the prospect of attorney’s fees to successful movants. Those fees may be substantial.

In California state court, the discovery stay and interlocutory appeal often limit the fees that may be incurred before an anti-SLAPP motion is definitively resolved. But those provisions don’t apply in federal court.

This creates the potential for something of a high-stakes gamble for plaintiffs: Proceed with discovery and keep their case moving forward or await resolution of the anti-SLAPP motion first.

The case is Gopher Media LLC v. Melone, 9th Cir., 24-2626, 10/9/25.

In another dizzying plot point around President Donald Trump’s attempts to federalize the National Guard, three judges on the federal Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a 2–1 decision on Monday that Trump has the authority to deploy the Guard in Portland.

Hoan Huynh in Albany Park on Tuesday afternoon after blocking his vehicle in and holding phones up to the windows, according to a statement from his office.

“My staff is a little shaken up, but we’re OK,” Huynh told the Chicago Sun-Times.

Huynh had been informing local businesses of their rights regarding the use of their property by federal agents when he and his staffers were alerted to the presence of federal agents nearby, the statement said. He and the staffers drove to Montrose and Kimball avenues to warn others of the federal agents by honking and yelling when six agents in two vehicles blocked Huynh’s vehicle from the front and back.

Huynh said one of the agents pointed a weapon into the open passenger window and demanded they identify themselves as another agent threatened to break another window. He said he didn’t immediately take his phone out to record the incident fearing the agent would think he was reaching for a weapon and open fire.

In video taken by one of Huynh’s staffers that was shared with the Sun-Times, Huynh can be heard identifying himself and noting the agent had been pointing a weapon as several masked agents in tactical gear move away from Huynh’s car as the camera turns to capture them. An agent circles Huynh’s car, filming the occupants inside. When the lead car of agents, a charcoal gray Kia minivan, moves, Huynh’s staffer follows it north on Kimball Avenue and west onto Montrose Avenue before the video ends.

“I never would have imagined in 2025, we would be living in an authoritarian regime in the United States,” Huynh said. “Once my colleague pulled out his camera, the agent put away the gun. ... [But] if they can do this in broad daylight to an elected official, and point a gun at someone, imagine what’s happening behind closed doors.”

After following the vehicles for another minute, he said agents once again got out of their vehicles and blocked his car while putting their hands on their sidearms before driving away.

The Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

Huynh said the agent pulling a gun was intended to “silence” rapid responders and others trying to alert community members to the presence of federal agents, but he said it didn’t deter him and his staff from continuing to do so. He said his staff believes that at least four people were taken in the area Tuesday.

The incident involving Huynh comes the same day that 26th Ward Ald. Jessie Fuentes filed a federal tort claim after she was handcuffed by federal agents in a Humboldt Park hospital emergency room Oct. 3 while attempting to see a constituent whose leg was severely injured during an immigration raid.

Huynh, who came to the U.S. as a refugee from Vietnam, noted that the state Legislature was working on legislation to ban federal agents from wearing masks in public and stop them from operating on school grounds, among other places. Earlier in the day, an employee with a Chicago Public Schools vendor was detained by federal agents outside a North Side school.

“We’re going to go down to Springfield next week,” Huynh said. “It’s horrific that they’re entering places where folks feel are safe places. ... [But] we have to stay strong, we cannot waver. Our job is to protect our neighbors.”",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/416bf2c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6758x3858+0+325/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F99%2F14%2Fb9b46e8e46a18da985a4c6b0671c%2Fhoan-huynh.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 14:01:51.477749

Read the latest on a case brought by some fired federal workers to pause the latest wave of shutdown layoffs.

As the shutdown drags on, here's the latest on what we know.

Jump to state-specific impacts.

Why did the federal government shut down?

A partisan argument over if and when lawmakers need to act to extend subsidies for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces led to the current shutdown. Some 24 million people — who don't have insurance through their jobs or a public program like Medicaid — use the system to buy health plans.

Prominent Republican lawmakers have claimed the Democrats are looking to provide tax dollars to help pay for the heath care of undocumented immigrants. That is not true.

Democrats in the Senate refused to vote for the Republican short-term funding bill that passed the House but did not include an extension of the health care tax credits. Democrats are also hoping to repeal cuts to health care programs that were put in place as part of the GOP spending and tax bill that passed over the summer.

NPR's Deirdre Walsh reports that some Democrats say Nov. 1 could be a key date in talks to loosen the current gridlock. That date marks the beginning of open enrollment for people getting coverage through the ACA, when most states will send notices to subscribers laying out the cost of coverage without subsidies.

In Vermont, where notices started going out on Oct. 15, for example, some families are facing increases of $25,000, according to Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt.

Will the military get paid on Oct. 29?

The Trump administration earlier this month found unused research and development funds to pay active military members, according to a Pentagon official not authorized to speak publicly. So they didn't miss a full paycheck, but it only covered one pay cycle. That was on Oct. 15; troops get paid every other Wednesday.

Military families are already seeking additional assistance from food banks and other groups to help with paying bills.

Are government workers being laid off during the shutdown?

The Trump administration has been following through on threats to further slash the size of government during the shutdown, seeking to layoff roughly 4,000 workers earlier this month. Some workers are fighting back in court; the judge overseeing the case issued a temporary restraining order directing the Trump administration to pause reduction in force (RIF) efforts that affect certain unionized employees.

What about WIC and SNAP benefits?

Funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) food program was estimated to run out after about two weeks. But USDA has distributed money from the previous fiscal year, helping at least some states continue to fund the program. The White House has said it will use tariff revenue to keep WIC afloat, though has provided few details. Trump's budget proposal earlier this year had looked to cut WIC funding.

Beyond WIC, the country's much larger food aid program — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (or SNAP, previously known as food stamps) — is funded through October.

That's because the debit-like cards people use to buy food are loaded a month in advance. USDA earlier this month told state agencies to hold off paying for November benefits for lack of sufficient funding, ""until further notice.""

And what about school lunches?

Some state agencies say they may not have the funds to reimburse schools providing free and low-cost meals.

Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, says some agencies have told her organization they don't have the money to pay schools back for meals during the shutdown.

""There is a strong commitment on both sides of the aisle to make sure that kids have access to healthy meals at school, so we are hopeful that the administration and Congress will act before this becomes an issue.""

According to Pratt-Heavner, USDA released funds to regional offices for meals served in October. But some states report they have yet to receive any money, she said. Before the shutdown, USDA released a contingency plan outlining funds states could tap into to cover any gaps. A USDA spokesman did not directly answer NPR when asked if the agency would advance funding to state agencies should the shutdown persist.

USPS is 'open for business as usual'

""U.S. Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown,"" according to a statement by USPS. The postal service is primarily self-funded and doesn't depend on the appropriations process to continue running as usual.

IRS furloughs nearly half its staff

A contingency plan from the Treasury Department says that slightly more than half of the IRS' approximately 74,000 workers remain on the job and will continue to work for the foreseeable future. Some IRS employees were issued reduction in force, or RIF, notices on Friday and posted screenshots of those notices informing them of their last day, Dec. 9.

The contingency plan says nearly all of those employees who continue to work will be paid using sources other than annual appropriations, which are on hold during the shutdown. Tasks will include completing and testing systems to handle next year's tax-filing season, and maintaining computers to prevent the loss of data.

Teachers and schools won't be directly impacted, but federal education functions might

Eighty-seven percent of Department of Education employees have been temporary furloughed, as detailed in agency shutdown contingency plans.

At the same time, the administration is trying to use a new round of layoffs to gut multiple offices inside the department, including the Office for Civil Rights and the office responsible for overseeing special education, according to multiple sources within the department.

This latest reduction-in-force (RIF) cut at least 121 staffers responsible for overseeing roughly $15 billion in special education funding and for making sure states provide special education services to the nation's more than 7.5 million children with disabilities. According to multiple sources, the special education office is now left with just a handful of top executives and support staff.

In addition, many Department of Education employees who were furloughed were surprised to see a message blaming Democrats for the government shutdown inserted into their out-of-office replies. A federal workers union is suing the Trump administration for inserting the language into employees' out-of-office email messages.

— Shannon Bond and Cory Turner, NPR

The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for 2026 went live as scheduled at the start of October. As WPR's Corrinne Hess reports, the U.S. Department of Education says that student financial aid programs will continue, despite the shutdown.

National Parks are a mixed bag

Across the country, the National Park Service (NPS) have brought their operations to a halt. That includes the National Zoo and other Smithsonian facilities. NPR's Alana Wise reports that the Smithsonian assured the public that animals would still be cared for during the zoo's closure. Animal cams are considered nonessential and will be turned off for the remainder of the shutdown.

As KQED's Sarah Wright and Carly Severn reported, a contingency plan for the NPS says that park roads, lookouts and trails ""will generally remain accessible to visitors"" for the duration of the shutdown, but other services such as regular road and trail condition updates would not be provided.

Concerns have also been raised about the safety and responsibility of keeping parks open without having a robust number of employees available to conduct critical services.

Salem will be open through Halloween thanks to community support

WBUR's Andrea Shea reports that local leaders in Salem, Mass., learned a National Park Service visitor center and its bathrooms would be closed during their busiest tourist season so they took action on a plan to keep them open.

Shea reports that NPS agreed to let Salem reopen the center if the community covered costs through Halloween weekend. Annie Harris — CEO of the non-profit Essex Heritage that helps staff and run the facility — sent out a flurry of emails including to the mayor. Within 48 hours businesses and non-profits raised $18,000 — keeping the center open until Nov. 2.

Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits will continue

Social Security, VA and other benefits will continue.

But employees at Social Security field offices earlier this month said the government shutdown has left them unable to carry out an important service for some recipients. As NPR's Ashley Lopez reports, workers say they are unable to provide benefit verification letters to people calling in to request them. These official letters act as a sort of income verification and are therefore key to obtaining aid like housing assistance, fuel assistance and help from nonprofits.

In an Oct. 21 email to users answering commonly asked questions about how shutdown impacts, SSA noted the online portal can still be used to access benefit verification letters.

As NPR's Scott Horsley reports some furloughed employees at the Labor Department are coming back to work, in order to complete the September inflation report, which is a key ingredient used to calculate the cost of living adjustment that Social Security recipients will receive next year. The report will come come out on Friday, nine days late.

ICE will mostly continue uninterrupted

Immigration cases and enforcement are proceeding as usual during the government shutdown, with a few small exceptions. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed that the employees in the Office of Detention Oversight, which inspects immigration detention centers, is currently not working. ""We hope Democrats will open up the government swiftly so that this office can resume its work,"" McLaughlin said.

According to DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, DHS law enforcement, including ICE agents, will be paid for work done during the shutdown.

""More than 70,000 sworn law enforcement officers across DHS including those serving in CBP, ICE, Secret Service, TSA and other critical mission areas will be paid for all hours worked during the shutdown period,"" Noem posted on X on Thursday. ""By Wednesday, October 22, law enforcement officers will receive a ""super check"" – which covers the 4 days lost, their overtime, and their next pay period.""

The U.S. Coast Guard, which is housed within DHS, will continue to be paid, according to a post earlier this week from Noem, from funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill earlier this year.

If you're flying soon …

Air traffic controllers and most Transportation Security Administration employees are considered ""essential workers"" and have to stay on the job.

Travelers across the U.S. are beginning to feel the impacts of the government shutdown, as air traffic control staffing shortages disrupt flights across the country.

Air traffic controllers helped to end the last government shutdown, and could help end this one as well. A ""slight increase"" in sick leave at two facilities on the East Coast threw some major airports into chaos.

Read more on what a shortage of air traffic controllers could do to bring an end to the shutdown from NPR's Joel Rose.

The impact of the shutdown looks different in different parts of the country

Some states across the country are uniquely positioned to feel the impact of the government shutdown. Reporters from the NPR Network are digging into the ways the government shutdown is playing out in their region.

Here's what we know so far about how the shutdown is affecting specific communities across the country:

Alaska

The U.S. Transportation Department says it has secured funding to continue the Essential Air Service program, subsidizing routes to 65 Alaska communities and more than an additional 100 communities nationwide, through Nov. 2. [Alaska Public Media]

About 15,000 federal employees live in Alaska, one of the highest percentages of federal employees when compared with other states. President Trump's threat that federal employees could receive termination notices increases the uncertainty around how this crucial workforce to Alaska's economy could be affected. [Alaska Public Media]

Arizona

Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said she would not spend state funds to keep Grand Canyon National Park open should the government shutdown. [KJZZ]

Social services in Grand Canyon Village are gearing up to support non-essential employees at Grand Canyon National Park, including food pantry resources. [KNAU]

Sen. Ruben Gallego said the shutdown would also not affect federal relief money to communities in the Miami-Globe area after torrential monsoon rains caused flash flooding in the region [KJZZ]

Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport joined a handful of other airports across the country that have refused to display a video from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem blaming Democrats for the government shutdown. [KJZZ]

California

The shutdown of the federal government has brought the full or partial closure of many National Park Service sites across California: Muir Woods is fully closed. Alcatraz Island is slated to stay open. Other sites like Point Reyes National Seashore and Fort Point have partial closures, with some parking lots blocked or bathrooms locked. Even some park staff said they didn't learn the plan until Sept. 30 — the afternoon before the government shut down. Yosemite is open, but with lots of changes for visitors. [KQED]

Colorado

Sites and lands in Colorado operated by the National Park Service are open, but ""some services may be limited or unavailable,"" according to the agency's website. [Colorado Public Radio]

In Colorado, the federal government employs thousands of workers at climate or land-management agencies. An EPA spokesperson told CPR News that the agency is operating under its shutdown plan, which would furlough thousands of employees. [Colorado Public Radio]

Unemployment claims from Colorado's federal workers are surging amid the U.S. government shutdown. Stephanie Rogers, a Colorado-based microbiologist with the Food and Drug Administration, told CPR she filed for unemployment the day after the shutdown started. [Colorado Public Radio]

Connecticut

Connecticut will continue federally funded food assistance programs for state residents during the government shutdown, Gov. Ned Lamont said on Wednesday. But he said the state's reserve money for SNAP, the food assistance program for low-income families, will run out by the end of the month. [WSHU]

Connecticut has a $2.5 billion budget surplus this year — its second largest in history. Advocates are asking Lamont to consider using it to help offset the federal shortfall. [WSHU]

Georgia

For federal workers living paycheck to paycheck, one option to get through being furloughed could be filing for unemployment insurance, Georgia Labor Commissioner Barbara Rivera Holmes said. The employees will have to pay the benefits back once the shutdown ends and they receive back pay, but the benefits can help them make ends meet while they are not being paid. [GPB]

Georgia farmers could also face delays in block grant funding and commodity data they rely on during the time-sentitive season of planting and harvesting. [NPR]

Kansas

If the federal government shutdown continues, the Mid-America Regional Council said it may need to temporarily close Head Start centers serving more than 2,300 Kansas City children beginning Nov. 1. [KCUR]

Kansas farmers face several uncertainties, as payments from some federal programs are in limbo. In addition, nearly half of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's employees will be furloughed, and many offices will be closed. [KCUR]

During the last two shutdowns, the USDA did not publish its monthly crop reports. This comes at an inconvenient time as Midwest farmers are in harvest season. [KCUR]

Louisiana

The National Flood Insurance Program, or NFIP, is managed by FEMA and provides flood insurance to those who don't have a private option. It has grown in size as most homeowner's insurance policies across the U.S. have dropped flood damage entirely. It covers nearly half a million Louisianans. Policyholders with expiring contracts could lose coverage and funds to pay claims have dropped $30 billion due to the shutdown. [WWNO/WRKF]

Illinois

Three workers who spoke with the Chicago Sun-Times said they haven't been furloughed, but they've dealt with uncertainties and fragmented coordination since the federal government shut down Oct. 1 on top of a year of uncertainty. [Chicago Public Media]

Maine

Even though much of the staff of Acadia National Park in Maine has been furloughed, it was a popular weekend at the park. [Maine Public]

Minnesota

Thousands of Minnesotans might not receive federal food aid benefits if the government shutdown continues into November, as federal officials have told states that funding for SNAP benefits is running out. [MPR News]

Missouri

Families enrolled in the Missouri WIC program — which provides supplemental food, nutrition education and support to low-income women and children — will not be immediately impacted by the shutdown. [St. Louis Public Radio]

The Gateway Arch and Old Courthouse in downtown St. Louis are temporarily closed, with National Park Service work largely on hold. [St. Louis Public Radio]

New Hampshire

There are more than 5,000 civilian federal employees in New Hampshire, at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, the Manchester VA Medical Center, the White Mountain National Forest, the Berlin federal prison, the passport processing center at Pease and at other federal agencies. How the shutdown might affect them isn't entirely clear. [NHPR]

The White Mountain National Forest will remain open, but some say earlier staff cuts are hampering critical activities. Firefighting and disaster response activities will also continue, according to federal officials. [NHPR]

On Oct. 7, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., the veteran appropriator who has helped broker past bipartisan deals, told NPR, she has been working behind the scenes with senators from both parties to ""find common ground."" [NPR]

North Dakota

The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is partnering with local banks and credit unions to provide short-term low interest loans to federal government employees and members of the armed services stationed in North Dakota, if they experience financial hardship because of the federal government shutdown. [Prairie Public]

Oklahoma

With the federal government shut down, National Park rangers are not present at the Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum. Victims, family members and first responders are stepping in to educate visitors on the location's story.⁠ [KOSU]

Oregon

The federal government program used to subsidize commercial flights in Pendleton got a last-minute reprieve from grinding to a halt due to the partial government shutdown. But as of Wednesday, immediate answers on how that might affect Eastern Oregon's only commercial airport are in short supply. The municipally operated Eastern Oregon Regional Airport in Pendleton holds the only Essential Air Service (EAS) contract in the state, a federal program that helps rural airports operate. [OPB]

Pennsylvania

Tens of thousands of Pennsylvania-based federal workers furloughed during the government shutdown may be eligible for unemployment compensation through the state Department of Labor & Industry. [WITF]

Tennessee

On Oct. 7, the FAA notified local officials in Nashville that flights in and out of Nashville International Airport (BNA) would be reduced Tuesday afternoon due to a shortage of air traffic controllers during the government shutdown. Nashville's airport was back to normal by Wednesday morning. [WLPN]

Texas

U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees who inspect cargo at the 32 other official ports of entry are among the essential federal workers who must remain on the job unpaid. The longer the shutdown lasts, the greater the risk of cargo backups at these Texas ports due to unpaid employees calling in sick. [Houston Public Media]

Utah

In Ogden, Utah, about 10 percent works for the IRS, and when federal workers stop getting paychecks, impacts are felt quickly and broadly. (KUER)

Washington

On Oct. 6, state officials say they have enough to cover WIC for the next two weeks. Seattle and King County have partnered to dedicate nearly $2 million to provide one-time vouchers to an estimated 30,000 clients in King County who rely on WIC. [KUOW]

The Employment Security Department says the 80,000 federal workers in Washington State may qualify for unemployment benefits. [OPB]

Wyoming

On Oct. 3, Gov. Mark Gordon said Wyoming will cover gaps in funding to federally funded state employees who are in the state budget ""in the short-term."" [Wyoming Public Media]

(KOIN) – KOIN 6 News has obtained footage of a blind man being violently detained by federal agents at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building in South Portland.

These videos, each taken from different sides of the building on Saturday, show Quinn Haberl wearing a neon vest and sitting on the side of the driveway to the facility. Next to him is a thick blue line on the ground, which federal agents made to indicate when protesters are crossing onto the federal property — effectively allowing them to arrest people for trespassing.

That’s when the videos show several federal agents circling around Haberl before grabbing him by his limbs and carrying him into the ICE building before dropping him on his head.

They can then be seen dragging him past the gate with more agents getting involved, cuffing him as the man wiggles on the ground. One agent could be seen picking up Haberl’s white cane.

Two men who saw the incident unfold Saturday night said Haberl is a joy to be around — usually dancing and having a good time while protesting outside of ICE.

“It was heartbreaking to see him being dragged the way he was,” one of the men said. “The visceral reaction was to just not continue videotaping and get the angle, but I just couldn’t keep it out. I had to keep him in frame. I had to keep him in frame and it just hurt my heart.”

The other man, Sterling Anderson, said it was shocking to witness.

“You can see in the video where I’m very vocal, and then you can see my breath and my breath was taken away,” Anderson said. “It’s like, what threat does that man represent to, you know, agents of the state or property?”

KOIN 6 News reached out to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which sent the following statement:

“This rioter was arrested after he blatantly disobeyed law enforcement orders to remain off federal property, obstructed law enforcement, and continued to block the driveway so vehicles could not enter or exit the ICE facility.”

Haberl spoke with KOIN 6 News over the phone. He said he is too emotional to speak as of Tuesday — too afraid even to leave his home. But he does want his story told.

Haberl said he is being charged with failure to comply. His friends set up a GoFundMe to help him with medical bills and legal support.

KOIN 6 News also reached out to the FBI for updated arrest data. The agency said they are no longer releasing daily arrest data and are switching to a weekly announcement.

Introduction

The first six months of the second Trump administration have been characterized by a haphazard yet comprehensive evisceration of basic government institutions. From the mass firing of federal workers to the effective shuttering of entire agencies, Trump and his billionaire allies have pillaged public-serving institutions while giving themselves cover by claiming to promote “efficiency” (Gangitano 2025; Shao and Wu 2025; Rubin 2025).

Some of the most critical targets of these attacks have been independent agencies. Unlike executive agencies, which are overseen by the White House and accountable to the president through a cabinet secretary that is part of the president’s administration, independent agencies are established by Congress to serve a specific public purpose. While housed within the executive branch, they are not subject to day-to-day control by the White House. These agencies are supposed to perform essential watchdog functions—protecting individuals like workers, consumers, and retirees from being abused by better-resourced and more powerful corporate actors. The United States Government Manual lists over 55 such permanent independent agencies in the federal government, including well-known entities like the Federal Reserve Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, as well as lesser-known agencies like the Merit Systems Protection Board (Federal Register 2025).

These agencies have been among the earliest targets of Trump’s governmental dismantling. First, he has taken the historically unprecedented (and clearly unlawful) step of firing dozens of board members and commissioners before the expiration of their terms in office—not for any allegations of misconduct, but solely due to political disagreement or assertions of presidential prerogative (EPI 2025a; EPI 2025b; Peck 2025; EPI 2025c; Goldstein and Steel 2025). He has also issued multiple executive orders asserting new levers of control over independent agencies—giving the White House unprecedented control over these agencies’ regulations, enforcement decisions, and day-to-day operations (The White House 2025a, 2025b). More recently, President Trump has gone as far as publicly attacking and then firing Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, a move that could have long-lasting economic implications (Rugaber and Weisser 2025). The Federal Reserve is perhaps the most well-known independent agency among the public; its mandates include promoting full employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates, among others.

Many of these changes have largely flown under the public radar screen, but the implications for the U.S. public are significant. While many government agencies have enforcement authority that can serve as a check on corporate power, independent agencies are unique in their ability to hold powerful actors accountable, regardless of political influence. The structure of independent agencies also promotes stability and prioritizes expert decision-making on topics of critical national importance. From the Federal Reserve’s decisions about interest rates to the Consumer Product Safety Commission’s evaluation of car seat safety, the work of independent agencies impacts working families’ lives every day. The public deserves to know that these agencies are working as Congress intended: to serve the people of the United States. The Trump administration’s actions are threatening the effectiveness of these agencies and putting people’s lives and well-being at risk.

This report will explore the structures and protections that characterize independent agencies and the multifaceted attacks that these agencies have experienced in recent months. We will then examine several case studies of key independent agencies that protect workers and consumers: the National Labor Relations Board, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and the National Credit Union Administration. We will explore why and how Congress designed them to be independent, the important role their independence has played in protecting the U.S. public, and how their functions will be compromised if brought under the direct control of the Trump White House.

As these case studies will show, the devastation of independent agencies by the Trump administration creates tremendous potential for abuses of power that could let wealthy corporations pad their profits at the expense of ordinary people’s lives and livelihoods. The systematic attack on independent agencies deserves more attention and opposition from Congress, both to defend its prerogative to create public watchdogs within the executive branch and to protect the people these important agencies were designed to serve.

The characteristics of independent agencies

The history of independent agencies dates back to the 1880s when Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate railroad rates. Businesses were so reliant on the railroads that Congress decided it was important to minimize the potential for disruption by insulating the regulatory system from the vagaries of the political process (Inskeep 2025). Many additional independent agencies were created by Congress during the New Deal. It is commonly thought that these New Deal agencies were created to be independent because Congress wanted their decisionmaking to benefit from specialized expertise and—for several of these agencies—because they were tasked with performing adjudicative functions and, thus, were structured more like courts to preserve the integrity of the deliberative process and promote collaborative and consensus-based decisionmaking (Corrigan and Revesz 2017, 639).

Unlike executive departments—which are run by a single cabinet secretary who is a part of the president’s administration, tasked with advancing the president’s agenda in how they execute their statutory functions, and can be removed by the president at will—the design of independent agencies reflects a judgment made by Congress that they could not perform their essential functions properly if they were subject to presidential pressure. For example, early legislative proposals to house the Federal Communications Commission within the Department of Commerce were rejected out of fear that concentrating power over such important means of communication (at that time, the radio system) in the hands of a politically accountable cabinet secretary would create too much potential for political manipulation (Stella 2025).

While no two independent agencies look exactly alike, the common thread among these agencies is some level of independence from direct presidential control. Congress uses a variety of tools to insulate independent agencies from White House influence. Most importantly, these agencies generally have some ability to make policy decisions in service of the agency’s mission independent of substantive influence from the president.

Independent regulatory authority

One of the most important protections that most independent agencies have from White House influence is their historical ability to use their regulatory authority independently. For decades, traditional executive branch agencies have been required to submit all regulatory actions to the Office of Management and Budget’s Office of Information and Regulatory Analysis (OIRA) for substantive review and input (including interagency review by other executive agencies) and cannot move forward with regulatory actions without OIRA approval. There is abundant evidence that this process causes excessive delays and can hamstring the regulatory effectiveness of executive departments by reducing transparency and opening the door for political manipulation (Copeland 2013; Goodwin 2020). But, until recent executive orders by President Trump, independent agencies have been largely exempt from this review (Dudley 2025; OMB 2025). This exemption has helped to limit the influence of political actors—who are not experts in the substance of the agency’s work—on the regulatory process and has allowed independent agencies to act more nimbly to protect the public from imminent threats.

Independent enforcement and litigating authority

Since the 1960s, the Department of Justice (DOJ) has had centralized authority to engage in litigation on behalf of the United States government. Thus, while some traditional executive agencies continue to have a significant degree of freedom to pursue enforcement actions under the statutes they administer (DOL n.d.), many do not necessarily have final say about which cases they bring in court or which arguments they make, as such decisions are ultimately controlled by DOJ. However, Congress has given most independent agencies some level of independent litigating authority (though the extent of such control varies from agency to agency). This authority is essential to the watchdog functions of these agencies. It allows them to control their own enforcement agenda because they can independently initiate and litigate enforcement actions in court. It also ensures that agency leaders’ expertise about laws they administer is respected, because they control which legal arguments the agency makes. Finally, this authority preserves agencies’ ability to protect the public by promoting consistent and evenhanded interpretation of the law and ensuring that the meaning of the law is being dictated by experts, not politics.

Removal protections

To ensure that these agencies can truly exercise their regulatory and enforcement powers independent of White House influence, Congress has made a judgment that independent agency leadership should be protected from removal by the president in the absence of misconduct. Removal protections are a key component of agency independence because they ensure that agency leaders cannot be fired based on policy disagreements with the president or the leadership of other executive agencies. These protections also play a valuable role in ensuring that agency enforcement of the law is not influenced by partisanship or political favoritism. It is essential that watchdog agencies have the ability to evenhandedly enforce the law against anyone who threatens the public’s interests, regardless of whether the subject of the agency’s enforcement is a presidential friend or donor.

Multimember structure

Most (but not all) independent agencies are designed to be governed by a multimember group of commissioners or board members. These boards are designed with staggered terms that are usually longer than a single presidential administration. Congress has explicitly required that some agencies have bipartisan balance, while other agencies have developed to be bipartisan as a matter of practice even if not required by law (Datla and Revesz 2013). Some agency leaders are required by Congress to have particular backgrounds or expertise as well. These requirements are intended to foster expertise and continuity and to limit the influence of partisanship in agency operations. Longer terms allow agency leaders to gain expertise, while limiting the influence of any particular president over agency leadership (as typically a board will not entirely turn over during a single presidential administration). Staggered terms also provide stability in agency operations and enforcement of the law, facilitating institutional memory and preventing dramatic shifts when there are changes in the presidential administration. Bipartisanship and background requirements promote expert decision-making and ensure that agency decisions benefit from a variety of perspectives.

Independent control over congressional testimony, legislative proposals, and budget submissions

Finally, independent agencies benefit from being able to speak with their own voice. For example, in communicating with Congress, traditional executive agencies must coordinate with the White House and get approval of testimony and other formal communications. By contrast—while the details vary from agency to agency—many independent agencies communicate directly with Congress in providing information and responding to congressional oversight. Independent agencies often submit their own legislative proposals and comment on proposed legislation when requested by Congress without coordinating with the White House or other executive branch agencies. In addition, while independent agencies’ budget requests are included as part of the president’s budget request to Congress, many independent agencies control the content of those submissions, including descriptions of agency priorities and how funds will be allocated. These unfiltered channels of communication facilitate a relationship of trust between independent agencies and Congress, allowing Congress to objectively and carefully monitor whether these agencies are effectively performing their critical watchdog functions. Finally, while many federal agencies are tasked with conducting independent research and producing independent data, independent agencies have the ability to control their own research agendas and produce reliable findings and data that are trusted by outside parties and insulated from political influence.

The Trump administration’s broad attacks on agency independence

In the first few months of his administration, President Trump has taken dramatic steps to exert control over agencies that were intentionally designed by Congress to be insulated from the immediate control of the White House. Most notably, he has fired numerous independent agency heads and board/commission members without cause and has issued several executive orders seeking to fundamentally upend the relationship between independent agencies and the White House.

Firing independent agency leaders

As explained above, most independent agency leaders (at least those on multimember boards and commissions) are protected from removal unless they commit misconduct. Since the start of his administration, President Trump has fired numerous independent agency leaders, either citing no reason at all or explicitly citing policy disagreement, rather than misconduct, as the rationale for the dismissal (Cantor and Sobran 2025). Many of these communications emphasized the administration’s view that statutory “for-cause” removal restrictions do not preclude President Trump from firing independent agency commissioners because such protections are an unconstitutional restriction on the president’s executive authority under Article II of the Constitution.

These firings are blatantly unlawful. In Humphrey’s Executor v. United States 90 years ago, the Supreme Court established that it is consistent with the Constitution for Congress to establish independent agencies and commissions whose leaders can only be removed by the president for cause. Humphrey’s Executor rejected the president’s claim of authority—despite statutory removal protections—to terminate without cause a member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The Court distinguished a prior decision affirming the president’s authority to terminate a postmaster from office by looking to Congress’s purpose in creating the FTC and the functions commissioners perform. The Court explained that the FTC was “created by Congress to carry into effect legislative policies embodied in the statute in accordance with the legislative standard therein prescribed, and to perform other specified duties as a legislative or as a judicial aid,” in contrast to the postmaster, whose duties were restricted to “performance of executive functions” and who was “charged with no duty at all related to either the legislative or judicial power.” The Court concluded that in light of these duties, the FTC “cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive” because “its duties are performed without executive leave, and, in the contemplation of the statute, must be free from executive control.” The same constitutional principles have been applied to uphold removal protections at other agencies performing “quasi-legislative” or “quasi-judicial” functions, not executive functions—insulating them from removal does not intrude on the president’s constitutional authority to “take care that the laws be faithfully executed” because they are largely not performing purely executive functions.

Several fired members of independent agencies and commissions have now filed lawsuits challenging their removals as inconsistent with both their agencies’ authorizing statutes and the Supreme Court’s decision in Humphrey’s Executor (Newhouse 2025). The administration’s response to these lawsuits has made clear that President Trump’s goal is for the Supreme Court to revisit Humphrey’s Executor and ultimately rule that the president has unconstrained authority to fire all agency leaders in the executive branch, including those at independent agencies.

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has strongly signaled that these removal protections may be deemed unconstitutional in the future, at least for agencies that exercise any level of “executive” authority. While it is unclear how broadly the Court’s ruling will sweep, eliminating these removal protections would jeopardize all facets of agency independence, as agency leaders would be reluctant to engage in regulatory or enforcement actions—or even day-to-day agency decision-making—without coordinating with the White House for fear of termination.

Implementing new levers of control over day-to-day agency operations

At the same time their leadership was being removed from office, these agencies were also targeted by a wave of new executive orders that undermine their independence in dramatic and unprecedented ways. The first such order, issued on February 18, was entitled “Ensuring Accountability for All Agencies” (The White House 2025a). The order purports to “improve the administration of the executive branch” and “increase regulatory officials’ accountability to the American people” by asserting unprecedented new presidential powers to control the day-to-day operations of independent agencies. These new powers would include:

giving the director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) the authority to control expenditure of the agency’s funds, including defunding “particular activities, functions, projects or objects”;

requiring all “agency heads” (including, it would seem, each individual member of bipartisan boards, whether Republican or Democrat) to employ a “White House Liaison” as a senior staffer in their offices;

requiring independent agency chairpersons to “regularly consult with and coordinate policies and priorities with the directors of OMB, the White House Domestic Policy Council and the White House National Economic Council”; and

giving the director of the OMB the authority to establish and evaluate the “performance standards and management objectives” for independent agency heads.

This level of White House micromanagement undermines the basic structure and function of independent agencies. Congress designed these watchdog agencies to be independent so that they could make decisions—whether about how to prioritize agency objectives, how to most effectively enforce the law, or how to best allocate resources—free from political influence. Independent agencies are often tasked with making decisions that will serve the long-term public interest but may be politically unpopular in the short term. The Federal Reserve provides the most obvious example: It is charged with setting interest rates at a level that will balance the need for maximum employment with the need for stable prices. It is widely acknowledged that allowing an elected official like the president direct control over the Federal Reserve would result in excessive pressure for interest rate reductions that would provide the president with a short-term economic boost, but that would cause long-term inflationary pressure that is detrimental to the economy (Wessel 2025).

Independent agencies are also charged with evenhandedly enforcing the law without favoritism. Giving the White House the ability to pick and choose which prosecutions to fund or which agency objectives to prioritize is fundamentally incompatible with those goals, rendering independent agencies virtually indistinguishable from nonindependent ones, contrary to the clear intentions of Congress.

Usurping independent agency rulemaking authority

President Trump has also used executive orders to undermine independent agencies’ use of their rulemaking powers. These new orders seek to impose a variety of unprecedented constraints on agencies’ ability to use their independent regulatory authority:

Independent agencies are instructed to review all regulations in their jurisdiction and seek to repeal those deemed inconsistent with “Administration policy.” This substantive review and repeal process must be conducted “in coordination with their DOGE Team Leads and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget” (The White House 2025b).

Independent agencies must now “consult with their DOGE Team Leads and the Administrator of OIRA” before considering any potential new regulations.

Independent agencies are now required to submit all new regulatory actions to OMB for substantive review before publication (The White House 2025a);

Independent agencies must seek to immediately repeal any regulation that could be deemed in tension with newer Supreme Court precedents.

While policies differ from agency to agency, most independent agencies have historically had independent authority to consider and promulgate new regulations or repeal existing regulations based on their expert judgment, not directives from the White House (or mysterious White House-adjacent entities like DOGE). And they have controlled their own decisions about how to best comply with the Administrative Procedure Act to ensure that their regulatory efforts can survive judicial review. Such independent control of the regulatory process is a critical tool to ensure that watchdog agencies can prioritize protecting the public and serving their statutory missions over politics. In the few months since President Trump issued these orders, the Environmental Protection Agency, for example, has already published a proposed rule to repeal greenhouse gas emissions standards for fossil fuel-powered power plants, citing multiple executive orders by President Trump as the reason for its review of the standard.

Attacks on the independence of agency enforcement

The February 19 order also directly impacts independent agency enforcement of the law, including by:

giving the president and the U.S. attorney general the ability to override the agency’s own interpretation of the law(s) it administers; and

directing agency heads to consult with the director of the Office of Management and Budget and then “direct the termination of all . . . enforcement proceedings that do not comply with the Constitution, laws, or Administration policy (emphasis added).”

At most independent agencies, any requirement to coordinate enforcement actions with OMB or to terminate enforcement actions deemed inconsistent with “Administration policy” represents a tectonic shift in enforcement practices. Even traditional executive agencies often retain significant discretion about how they enforce the law and have the authority to initiate and direct their own enforcement actions (DOL 2025). Independent agencies, of course, have traditionally had far greater autonomous control of their enforcement activity. Indeed, these agencies are structured with insulation from political forces precisely so that they can fairly and evenhandedly enforce the law.

Giving the White House control over the enforcement process could effectively nullify important laws protecting the public if the president chooses to override or undermine enforcement efforts. Such interference would be deeply problematic even at traditional executive departments—it is even more untenable at agencies specifically designed by Congress to be insulated from political influence. The potential for political favoritism to influence the enforcement process allows these agencies to be used as tools for corruption and abuse of power, rather than forces for public good.

Case studies

In recent weeks, significant attention has rightly been given to the egregious firing of Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the implications it will have on our economy in both the short and long term. The following case studies highlight four other independent bodies, illustrating the potential consequences for working families when the autonomy of these agencies are compromised. Each of these agencies plays an essential watchdog role in protecting the public from being abused or cheated by more powerful corporate actors. It is clear that greater presidential interference in their operations could undermine their ability to serve the public.

The National Labor Relations Board

Congress established the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) in 1935 following decades of strife between management and labor. In the years prior to the Board’s creation, violent labor disputes were common and workers seeking to join unions and improve working conditions faced brutal repression by corporations, private militias, and police (Andrias 2024). Presidents deployed troops to crack down on labor protests and courts frequently stepped in to suppress labor activity (Taft and Ross 1969).

In response to this crisis of labor unrest, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (NLRA). The NLRA empowered workers, giving them a legal right to form and join unions and to bargain collectively for better wages and working conditions. It also protected workers from retaliation for joining together and speaking up about unfair treatment. In service of these goals, the Act established the NLRB to serve as a neutral adjudicator of labor disputes.

While housed within the executive branch, the Board was created to be “an independent quasi-judicial body” that would adjudicate labor disputes as a court. The NLRB was designed with many of the classic characteristics of independent agencies. For example, board members are protected from removal by the president except for cause, and serve staggered terms of five years—longer than a single presidential administration.

The Board hears cases involving both allegations that an employer or union has committed an unfair labor practice (such as threatening a worker for discussing working conditions with colleagues or refusing to bargain with the workers’ union) and cases involving objections that arise during a union election. In hearing these cases, the NLRB acts very much like any other court. Board members are charged with adjudicating each case on its merits free from influence by personal interests or the political process. The Board’s decision-making procedure must provide parties with due process. The NLRB follows its own precedents and Board decisions can be overturned by federal courts of appeals if the agency fails to act consistently with precedent (unless a majority of the Board votes to revisit or overturn precedent in a case). The Board keeps its deliberations confidential and communications with parties or outside entities about pending cases are considered a violation of government and judicial ethics rules.

In addition to these core adjudicative functions, the NLRB also occasionally engages in rulemaking, either to establish agency procedures or to articulate general principles of substantive law. The Board has historically acted independently in these functions and not been subject to substantive regulatory review by the White House.

Throughout its 90-year history, the NLRB has played an essential role in safeguarding the well-being of working people across the country. Because the NLRA protects both the right to form and join a union and the right to engage in employment-related collective action by workers, it is a vital tool to address a myriad of concerns that workers face in the modern economy, including sexual and racial harassment, employee misclassification, and the impact of new technology, among others. In recent years, the NLRB has been extremely effective in serving its statutory goals. In fiscal year 2024, for example, the agency recovered $56.5 million in backpay and other compensation for workers whose rights were violated and secured reinstatement offers for more than 1200 workers who were unfairly terminated from their jobs for trying to unionize or speak out about their working conditions.

The agency has been able to fulfill its mission successfully because it can enforce the law comprehensively and evenhandedly. Independence is a necessary foundation for its success. The NLRB enforces the law—against both employers and unions—without regard for whether the employer or union in question might be a close ally of the president or a supporter of the president’s political party.

How the independence of the agency has been compromised

Since President Trump took office, the historically independent functioning of the NLRB has been severely compromised. On January 28, President Trump fired Gwynne Wilcox, a NLRB member serving in her second term on the Board, whose term was not scheduled to expire until 2028. The removal of Member Wilcox from office was the first time in history that an NLRB member was removed from office by the president. Her departure left the Board without a quorum to hear cases. If the Supreme Court ultimately affirms the president’s ability to terminate NLRB members without cause, the integrity of the Board’s adjudicative process will be severely compromised, as board members will be forced to make decisions with the looming threat of termination hanging over their deliberations. For the same reasons that the framers of the Constitution protected federal judges from termination without cause, Congress should similarly be able to protect board members who adjudicate cases so they can do their jobs fairly.

President Trump’s executive orders also significantly implicate the operations of the NLRB. To be sure, the new executive orders do not expressly give the White House authority to decide or override the outcome of individual cases before independent agencies like the NLRB. However, the unprecedented level of control that the White House is now asserting over agencies could certainly be used that way. Many of the levers of control in these orders—like the ability to fund or defund particular agency actions, the requirement that all board members employ a “White House liaison,” or the unprecedented declaration that independent agencies cannot take legal positions inconsistent with the White House—would potentially allow Trump to directly dictate the outcome of cases before the Board and the substance of federal labor law. This is hardly a farfetched concern. A recent Trump executive order attempts to do just that: It directly instructs the Board to address an unsettled issue of labor law—namely, whether student athletes are considered “employees” or not—in the context of an order that makes clear what Trump’s preferred resolution of this issue would be (The White House 2025e). Such presidential interference into the day-to-day decision-making of the NLRB is completely unprecedented and undermines the fairness and impartiality of the agency’s adjudicative process.

Workers rely on the NLRB to protect critical workplace rights. A worker who has been fired for talking to coworkers about unsafe working conditions or whose employer refuses to bargain with the workers’ chosen union needs somewhere to turn to put a stop to such unfair labor practices. Without any assurance that they will get a fair hearing at the NLRB in the future, workers will be forced to resort to other strategies to make their voices heard and neither workers nor employers will have a path to resolve their disputes and move forward.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

Following mass protests against Jim Crow segregation and a decades-long Civil Rights Movement, Congress established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Aiken, Salmon, and Hanges 2013). Title VII represents one of the cornerstones of our national promise of equal opportunity, protecting workers from discrimination on the job based on their race, color, national origin, religion, sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity), age, disability, pregnancy, or genetic information (Couch, Hersch, and Shinall 2025). If a worker experiences employment discrimination—such as unfair treatment in hiring, firing, promotions, job assignments, or on-the-job harassment—the EEOC is where they can turn to for help.

To fulfill this vital mission, the EEOC performs three main functions. First, for workers in the private sector, it oversees a thorough process to consider each charge of discrimination (EEOC 2025c). The EEOC will investigate charges; facilitate mediation and conciliation; and—if the agency finds cause to believe that discrimination has occurred, and conciliation fails—can opt to file a lawsuit to enforce the statute. While the EEOC commissioners do not directly adjudicate these cases, they must vote on whether the agency will go to court and pursue certain types of significant cases, especially those presenting novel or unsettled legal issues likely to generate public controversy (EEOC 2021).

Second, for complaints where a federal government agency is the employer, the EEOC performs a judicial role. Federal employees who file a discrimination complaint have the right to request a hearing with an administrative judge from the EEOC. If the complainant or the employing agency does not agree with the administrative judge’s decision, they can appeal to the EEOC, which hears and votes on the case as a panel of judges (EEOC 2025e).

Finally, the EEOC issues regulations, guidelines, and formal enforcement guidance, which must be approved by a majority of commissioners (EEOC 2025f, 2025g). The EEOC also issues resource documents, which do not require Commission approval (EEOC 2025h).

From the agency’s inception, Congress took steps to ensure the EEOC’s bipartisan and independent nature. No more than three of the Commission’s five members can be of the same political party and commissioners serve staggered terms of five years—longer than a single presidential administration. While Congress did not specifically provide “for-cause” removal protection for commissioners, the EEOC’s structural components qualify it as an independent agency whose commissioners are protected by Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey’s Executor. Additionally, the statute contains a “holdover cause” enabling sitting commissioners to serve until their successors are appointed and qualified, with limits on the maximum length of the holdover period. Such holdover provisions are common in independent agencies; they provide continuity and preserve institutional knowledge, while avoiding the uncertainties associated with transitions in presidential administrations and the often lengthy Senate confirmation process.

The EEOC has been extremely effective in accomplishing its mission and its work yields a high return on investment. In 2024, using a $455 million budget, the EEOC secured almost $700 million in monetary relief for about 21,000 victims of employment discrimination and educated more than 268,000 individuals nationwide about employment discrimination and their workplace rights (EEOC 2025a). In the last few years, the Commission has undertaken a number of important initiatives through both rulemaking and litigation, including implementing the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act’s protections to ensure that pregnant workers receive reasonable accommodations in the workplace; educating the public about the implications of artificial intelligence for workplace civil rights; issuing long-awaited guidance on workplace harassment; and historically advancing employment discrimination protections for the LGBTQ+ community (EEOC 2024, 2025a).

How the independence of the agency has been compromised

On January 27, President Trump fired EEOC Chair Charlotte Burrows and Vice Chair Jocelyn Samuels before their terms were set to expire in 2028 and 2026, respectively. Their unprecedented removals left the EEOC without a three-member quorum and unable to vote on litigation recommendations or issue federal sector decisions, regulations, enforcement guidance, and other critical rulings.

The impact of Trump’s encroachment on the EEOC’s independence has already been felt. For example, the Commission recently dropped lawsuits it had filed on behalf of transgender workers. While agreeing that these workers are protected under civil rights laws, Commission Chair Andrea Lucas explained to Congress that she dropped the cases because her agency is not independent and must comply with President Trump’s orders targeting transgender and nonbinary people (Senate HELP 2025). In June, the EEOC also moved to drop a racial discrimination lawsuit relying on a well-established legal theory regarding the lawfulness of facially neutral policies that have a disproportionately negative impact on disadvantaged groups, again citing an executive order from President Trump (Olson and Savage 2025). According to former EEOC General Counsel David Lopez, dropping these lawsuits constitutes an “unprecedented abdication of [the agency’s] enforcement responsibilities” (Lopez 2025). By abandoning individual lawsuits in response to presidential directives that are contrary to well-established federal laws, the EEOC has effectively empowered the White House to define the contours of civil rights law, contrary to the will of Congress in establishing the EEOC.

Acting Chair Lucas has also undermined the agency’s decision-making process in response to presidential orders. Following Trump’s March 6 executive order, “Addressing Risks from Perkins Coie LLP,” which directs the acting chair of the EEOC to investigate the practices of large law firms, Lucas demanded information from 20 prominent law firms about diversity fellowships and other programs (The White House 2025c; EEOC 2025b). In a letter to Acting Chair Lucas, eight former EEOC members explained that this demand for information exceeds Lucas’s authority as chair. No single member of the Commission has the authority to unilaterally change the EEOC’s long-standing position—reflected in the agency’s majority-approved strategic enforcement plan—regarding employers’ diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Such policy shifts have historically required a vote by the full Commission, consistent with the intent of Congress that the EEOC—like many other independent agencies—should engage in collaborative and deliberative decision-making.

The EEOC plays a critical role in ensuring that all workers in the U.S. can receive fair treatment and have an equal opportunity to succeed at work. To fully execute its mission, the EEOC must be able to interpret and enforce our civil rights laws free from political influence and presidential whims. The removal of EEOC commissioners who disagree with the president’s agenda, along with recent intrusions into the agency’s prosecutorial independence and deliberative process, is inconsistent with both the independent nature of the agency and the will of Congress, threatening the fundamental protections that everyone should enjoy in the workplace.

Consumer Product Safety Commission

Every day, hundreds of millions of consumers across the U.S. purchase new products that, if not properly designed and built, could inadvertently harm them and their families. In worst case scenarios, companies will recall faulty items from shelves, like when Samsung recalled a version of its Galaxy phone because it could overheat and catch fire; or when Infantino recalled an infant carrier due to faulty buckles that posed a fall hazard; or when Midea recalled specific window AC units because they led to mold growth and respiratory issues (CPSC 2016, 2020, 2025d). These, of course, are the very scenarios companies and consumers hope to never experience. Today, thanks in large part to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, consumers can purchase goods with a certain degree of confidence that what they are bringing into their homes won’t pose a risk to their health and safety. And when things do go wrong, consumers know that systems and processes are in place to remove dangerous goods from our stores.

Congress established the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) as an independent agency in 1972, charged with protecting consumers from unreasonable risks of injuries (Carpenter 2018). The creation of the CPSC was the result of work under a bipartisan presidential commission examining the mechanisms available at the time to protect consumers. The Commission ultimately recommended Congress pass legislation to create the CPSC. Importantly, during hearings, Congress considered whether to place the CPSC within the then Department of Health, Education and Welfare, but ultimately decided to create an independent agency to insulate the agency’s work from political pressure (Page 1974). Congress empowered the CPSC with authorities to achieve four main objectives: first, conduct research into the injuries and illnesses associated with the use of consumer products; second, facilitate the development of and adherence to safety standards—both through formal rulemaking and engaging industries to adopt voluntary standards; third, aid consumers as they seek to understand and compare the safety risks of various products; and finally, protect consumers from unreasonable risks associated with the goods they purchase.

Today, the CPSC’s efforts cover an extremely broad set of consumer products—from children’s toys, to household appliances, cribs, and mattresses. Importantly, the CPSC authority covers products made both domestically and abroad. Beyond advancing research and standard-setting, the CPSC has numerous enforcement tools at its disposal, including conducting compliance inspections at factories, warehouses, or establishments where products are made or held. The CPSC also has the authority to obtain samples of products imported into the U.S. When the CPSC determines that a product that is already on the market poses a substantial hazard to consumers, it seeks remedial actions either by engaging companies directly to negotiate a corrective action agreement or pursuing administrative actions that culminate in a vote by the Commission and mandate for specific corrective actions. While recalling products is perhaps the most widely recognized corrective action of the CPSC, there are several actions that CPSC and companies can undertake, including: notifying the public of the hazard; modifying the product so that it is in compliance with safety standards; and providing refunds to consumers, among other actions.

The CPSC has many of the classic characteristics of independent agencies. It is led and overseen by five commissioners, one of which is designated as the chair. Commissioners are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate, serving seven-year terms. By statute, they can only be removed from office for “neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.” Congress has also stipulated that no more than three members of the Commission could be from the same political party.

How the independence of the agency has been undermined

Last year, consumers spent more than $6.2 trillion on consumer goods, many of which are regulated by the CPSC. Most products purchased every day are safe for consumers to use in large part thanks to the ongoing efforts by the CPSC to develop and update standards as new or improved products enter the market. Nonetheless, in this year alone, CPSC has issued numerous recalls, including in once instance bike helmets which failed to protect individuals and could result in head injury (CPSC 2025a). The purpose and independence of the CPSC is as crucial as ever to consumers’ health and safety. Alarmingly though, Trump has sought to politicize this little-known agency that plays an outsized role in the day-to-day lives of everyone in the U.S.

In May, Trump fired three members of the Commission who were nominated by President Biden and had not yet served their full terms: Mary Boyle, Alexander Hoehn-Saric, and Richard Trumka Jr. (Quinn 2025). While a federal district court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals both found the firings unlawful and temporarily reinstated the commissioners, the Supreme Court stayed the district court’s order and they were removed from office again (Quinn 2025; Howe 2025). The activities that unfolded at the Commission during the initial period that these three Commissioners were gone highlight the potential damage of politicizing this independent agency. On May 13, 2025, the remaining two commissioners voted to stop the Federal Register from publishing a proposed regulation establishing safety standards for Lithium-Ion batteries in micro mobility products, such as e-bikes and e-scooters (CPSC 2025c). The Commission had previously approved the adoption and publication of this proposed rule in April in response to its finding that over 220 people were injured or killed by such batteries between 2019 and 2023 (CPSC 2025b). While the district court’s reinstatement of the fired commissioners enabled them to (at least temporarily) correct the actions taken in their absence, the danger to consumers of a politicized CPSC was clear.

Now that the three commissioners have been removed again, the risk to consumers returns. For example, the chair of the Commission serves as the principal executive of the CPSC and has the authority to appoint, upon approval of the Commission, a number of positions with the CPSC, including an executive director; general counsel; and assistant executive directors of compliance and administrative litigation, health sciences, and engineering, among others. Now that the three commissioners have been removed again, the chair (with the approval of the remaining member) could potentially take significant personnel actions, such as replacing industry experts with political operatives.

When Congress created the CPSC it sought to create an independent agency that established and enforced safety standards that were driven by the independent expertise of the agency and without influence from conflicts of interest or political swings of power. Yet the Trump administration’s recent efforts to undermine the CPSC and politicize its actions not only runs counter to the intent of Congress but also puts the health and safety of U.S. families at risk.

National Credit Union Administration

For more than 115 years, credit unions have provided vital financial services to individuals, businesses, and communities across the United States (NCUA 2023). As nonprofit financial institutions that are membership-based, credit unions have long provided services—including low-interest car loans and mortgages—to individuals and communities that may be underserved by corporate banks. Today, more than 143 million people in the U.S. are members of a credit union (NCUA 2025c). This includes, for example: the Teachers Credit Union, which was founded more than 70 years ago by educators in New York; credit unions that serve rural areas like the Guadalupe Credit Union in Santa Fe, New Mexico; and credit unions like the State Employees Credit Union, which provides services to state employees in North Carolina, among others.

The first credit unions in the United States were established in the early 1900s and continued to grow in numbers as states—beginning with Massachusetts—passed laws to certify and regulate them (NCUA 2023). In 1934, following the financial crisis of the Great Depression, Congress passed the Federal Credit Union Act (FCUA), which created a uniform federal standard and process for certifying and regulating credit unions. Originally, Congress charged the Farm Credit Administration—an independent agency—to implement the FCUA (NCUA 1989). In the years following, the federal credit union system moved to a variety of federal agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). By 1970, Congress created a stand-alone independent agency—the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)—headed by a single administrator. And then in just a few short years, Congress again amended the Act in 1978 to establish the structure that remains in place today (NCUA 2023). Most notably, Congress replaced the single administrator of the NCUA with a three-member board, capping a long series of actions to ensure the federal oversight of credit unions in the United States was entrusted to an independent agency and sufficiently insulated from swings in the political views of the executive branch. The NCUA’s independence allows it to make unbiased decisions based on sound financial principles to best serve the communities that credit unions support (ACU 2025).

Today, the NCUA charters and regulates credit unions, ensuring that members’ hard-earned money remains safe and that they can access the financial resources they need to pursue dreams like higher education and home ownership. By the beginning of 2025, there were more than 143 million members of federally insured credit unions across the United States. Combined, these members have nearly $2.4 trillion dollars invested in their credit unions (NCUA 2025c). The NCUA plays a vital role in ensuring that credit unions are stable institutions and that members’ deposits are adequately protected, most notably through the management of the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund. Like the FDIC, this fund insures members’ deposits up to $250,000 (NCUA 2025b). The NCUA also enforces a range of regulations that aim to maintain the strength and stability of the credit union system. This includes, for example, regulations regarding the investment and deposit activities, capital adequacy, and mergers of credit unions, among other activities

Since 1979, a three-member board has led and managed the activities of the NCUA. The board is structured similarly to other independent agencies. Under the FCUA, board members are appointed by the president and approved by the Senate to serve a six-year term. The statute states that “[n]ot more than two members of the board shall be members of the same political party.” Importantly, when Congress restructured the NCUA so that it was led by the board, it removed all references in the statute to the leadership “serving at the pleasure of the President.” While many day-to-day functions of the agency, including examination and supervision of credit unions, are executed by agency staff, the board approves and carries out crucial functions of the agency. Specifically, the board sets policies and procedures for the agency; directs and approves its regulatory actions, including proposed and final rules; and serves as a final appeals board for agency actions against credit unions. Under the statute and regulations, the board meets every month and must have a quorum of a majority of board members to hold meetings.

How the agency’s independence has been undermined

In April, President Trump took unprecedented actions that undermined the NCUA’s overall independence and ability to function. Specifically, Trump fired two Democratic members of the board—Todd Harper and Tanya Otsuka—leaving a single board member. Harper and Otsuka have sued President Trump over their firing claiming that the actions violated both the Federal Credit Union Act as well as the Constitution. While a district court found they were unlawfully terminated, a court of appeals stayed the district court’s order and they remain unable to perform their duties. While this litigation is pending there is significant confusion and uncertainty about how the NCUA board can or will function.

As discussed above, the FCUA states that there must be a majority of board members to have a quorum and meet. Crucially, the statute does not explicitly contemplate a situation in which there are vacancies on the board, let alone only one member left. Indeed, the statute has holdover protections to ensure there aren’t vacancies on the board, allowing members to serve beyond their six-year term until a replacement member is approved.

The actions taken by Trump in the short term will likely hamper the ability of the NCUA to carry out important functions, including an annual rolling review of one-third of its regulations. This year the NCUA has identified 36 regulations which will be reviewed by the agency (NCUA 2025a). Additionally, fired board member Harper recently highlighted that there are a number of individual credit unions whose ratings by the NCUA indicate that the board should be engaging more closely in the review and potential regulatory actions against these entities, which combined hold $112 billions in assets (Mullen 2025). Without a full board in place to take necessary actions, these credit unions and their members may be at financial risk.

Conversely, if the single remaining board member attempts to move forward with typical board actions on his own, this would directly undermine the intent of Congress and the statute, i.e., ensuring that the agency and board are not influenced entirely by a single political party. These actions would also most likely be subject to legal challenges, creating additional uncertainty in the credit union market. Similarly, if courts eventually allow the firings of the Democratic board members to stand, this would be a significant departure from Congress’ clearly expressed intent to move the management of the NCUA away from a structure that is under the direct influence of the president.

Trump’s executive orders intruding on agency independence also pose challenges for the NCUA. For example, the new requirement that agencies submit proposed and final regulations to OMB for White House review and approval is particularly challenging for the NCUA, which reviews one-third of its regulations every year and issued 12 new proposed or final regulations in 2024 alone. At a minimum, extensive involvement by the White House will inevitably delay the regulatory process. More alarming is the prospect that the White House will demand substantive changes to regulations (whether new proposals or regulations already on the books) that undermine the NCUA’s independence or do not reflect the best judgments of its expert leaders, putting the communities that rely on affected credit unions at risk.

For the 143 million people who have their savings in a credit union, the uncertainty at the NCUA board at best may cause greater financial stress and uncertainty. For some, the administration’s actions may call into question the ability of the federal government to fairly and adequately regulate the financial institutions people have entrusted their savings with or secured loans from. Over time, undue political influence over the NCUA—either through changes in the board structure or overt influence of its regulatory process—could create instability in the credit union system and subsequently motivate members to move out of the system entirely, undermining the financial security of the many unique communities that credit unions serve.

Conclusion

For more than 100 years, the United States has relied on independent agencies to provide essential protections to workers, consumers, retirees, and the general public. Congress carefully and intentionally designed these agencies—like the Federal Reserve and the Environmental Protection Agency—to ensure they could fully realize their missions without being directly affected by political influence, presidential favoritism, or interest group politics. While the laws these agencies administer have been modified periodically through the years, Congress has not wavered from its commitment to preserve their independence. These agencies can serve the public effectively because they prioritize expertise, promote stable and consistent enforcement of the law, and make policy choices that elevate long-term public good over short-term political gain.

Preserving independence is about more than good governance: It’s about protecting the public. These agencies ensure that workers are able to join together with their co-workers to form a union and bargain for better wages and working conditions, apply for a job knowing that they are protected from discrimination, put their earnings in a local credit union, and purchase household goods without fear of them being unsafe.

Since taking office, President Trump has waged an unprecedented assault on independent agencies, in some cases firing board members and commissioners despite explicit legal prohibitions, politicizing agencies’ rulemaking processes, and—in many instances—bringing the functions of these agencies to all but a halt. These actions not only have immediate consequences for workers and the public—they also create tremendous potential for abuses of power over time that could let wealthy corporations pad their profits at the expense of ordinary people’s lives and livelihoods. The systematic attack on independent agencies deserves more attention and opposition from Congress, both to defend its prerogative to create public watchdogs within the executive branch and to protect the people these important agencies were designed to serve.

Notes

28 U.S.C. § 516 (2017).

Sometimes agencies only have independent authority to litigate in certain subject matter areas, while others have independent authority to litigate only until a matter gets to the Supreme Court (at which point the agency is represented by the solicitor general). Rarely, an agency will have independent litigating authority that encompasses even Supreme Court litigation—with the primary modern example being the Federal Trade Commission.

The precise statutory language establishing such removal protections can vary but typically says that appointed officials can only be removed for “inefficiency, neglect of duty, and malfeasance in office” or some similar standard and sometimes requires elements of due process before a removal can take place, such as notice and opportunity for a hearing.

See Table 4 in Selin and Lewis (2018).

The National Labor Relations Act, for example, does not contain any requirement that the National Labor Relations Board be comprised of bipartisan members, but historically a bipartisan balance has been maintained.

For example, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency must have extensive understanding of financial management, capital markets, mortgage securities, and housing finance. For further information, see Table 7 in Selin and Lewis (2018).

See Table 12 in Selin and Lewis (2018).

See Table 12 in Selin and Lewis (2018).

For example, Merit Systems Protection Board Chair Cathy Harris’s termination message cited no reason for her dismissal (Harris v. Bessent, D.C. Cir. R. 2025); Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner Jocelyn Samuels’s termination message criticized her for “enacting or enforcing the Biden administration’s radical Title VII guidance” (Samuels v. Trump, D.D.C. 2025); and National Labor Relations Board Member Gwynne Wilcox termination message cited, among other things, “improperly cabin[ing] employers’ rights to speak on the subject of unionization” and supporting the Board’s joint-employer rule (Bruenig 2025).

While the Supreme Court subsequently narrowed the scope of Humphrey’s Executor’s reach to exclude independent agencies headed by only one official rather than a multimember body (see Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 2020) the Court subsequently reaffirmed that Humphrey’s Executor remains good law. See Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. (2021) explaining that Seila Law “did not revisit our prior decisions allowing certain limitations on the President’s removal.”).

See Acting Solicitor General Harris’s February 2025 letter to Senator Dick Durbin (Harris 2025), indicating the Department of Justice’s intention to argue that Humphrey’s Executor should be overruled.

See The White House (2025d). The order strongly implies that any regulation whose legality was previously upheld under the deferential Chevron standard of judicial review applied by the federal courts before the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (U.S. 2024) should be considered for immediate repeal. (This directive is of dubious legality, as it instructs agencies not to use the notice-and-comment process required by the Administrative Procedure Act to repeal a substantive regulation. It also stands in significant tension with the Supreme Court’s explicit direction in Loper Bright that prior cases upholding agency action under the Chevron standard remain good law).

See Starbucks Corp. v. McKinney, 602 U.S. 339, 355 (2024) (Jackson, J., concurring) (describing federal courts’ “ignominious history”); see also Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U.S. 235, 250 (1970).

See Roosevelt (1935) noting these functions “should not be confused.”

The Act thus adopted the same independent agency model that the Supreme Court had endorsed for the Federal Trade Commission in Humphrey’s Executor, a decision handed down less than two months before Congress established the Board. See Free Enter. Fund v. Public Co. Accounting Oversight Bd. (2010), 561 U.S. 477, 547 (Breyer, J., dissenting); Dish Network Corp. v. NLRB (2020). 953 F.3d 370, 375 n.2 (5th Cir. 2020).

The five-member commission is now comprised of only two members: Republican Chair Andrea Lucas and Democratic Commissioner Kalpana Kotagal. EEOC’s general counsel, Karla Gilbride, was also fired that same day. Former Commissioner Samuels has since filed a lawsuit.

The EEOC initiates most investigation in response to complaints filed by employees. Commissioners can file their own charge, but it would not be made public and would require the commissioner to provide evidence of discrimination under penalty of perjury. This is to prevent the Commission from seeking to intimidate employers through public pressure.

On Wednesday, the executives will meet with several lawmakers to ask them, for the umpteenth time, to push through a reform that would facilitate work permits for undocumented immigrants, essential to the survival of their businesses but who are now failing to show up for work, either out of fear of being detained or because they have already been deported.

Under the slogan “Secure America’s Workforce,” the three-day mission was organized by the American Business Immigration Coalition (ABIC), a bipartisan coalition of more than 1,700 CEOs, business owners, and trade associations in 17 states. The organization has been warning for months about the catastrophic consequences that the deportations are having on their businesses. “Thanks to their efforts, lawmakers in Washington are hearing our message loud and clear: The U.S. economy cannot grow without legal avenues for the workers who power industries like construction, agriculture, hospitality, healthcare, and so on,” says Rebecca Shi, CEO of ABIC.

Eight million jobs

According to the coalition, there are eight million unfilled jobs across the country, which is increasing prices across the economy, from food to construction materials, and limiting access to everyday products and services for Americans.

ABIC is advocating for Congress to pass the Dignity Act, introduced by Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar and Texas Democratic Representative Veronica Escobar.

The bill has been unsuccessfully introduced three times in Congress. The latest version, introduced in July, differs from the 2023 version in one important respect: it eliminates the path to citizenship. Instead, it offers “dignity” status, a permit to legally reside and work in the United States.

According to the proposal, to qualify for the permit, migrants must have been in the country for more than five years, have not committed any crimes, and pay a $7,000 fine for being undocumented. Additionally, as a penalty, the government will seize 1% of their wages for a period of seven years.

“This is a situation we need to change now,” Salazar declared Tuesday at a meeting with business leaders at a Washington, D.C., hotel, where she warned of the consequences the deportation campaign will have on the Republican Party in next year’s midterms. “We’re sending the wrong message that we don’t want those people here,” she stated. Salazar was applauded when she said that the current situation “is a mess” because employers are breaking the law by hiring undocumented immigrants, who, in turn, are in the country illegally. Salazar argued that they can’t do anything else because no one wants those jobs.

The fear of going to work and being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, along with the deportations already carried out, have emptied out farms, factories, and service sectors. The detention centers have not been filled with dangerous criminals, as Trump promised, but largely with workers who have spent many years building a life in the country.

The U.S. workforce shrank for three consecutive months in July, for the first time since 2010. The hardest hit sectors are those where workers are predominantly migrant. Fifty-one percent of dairy industry workers are immigrants, as are 45% of meatpacking workers, and 29% of construction workers.

Trump won the 2024 election thanks in part to the support he got from the Latino vote, which has historically been Democratic. For the first time in history, a majority of the Latino male electorate voted for the Republican candidate. The deportation campaign and the racial profiling used by immigration agents to carry out arrests, however, have eroded Hispanic support, and polls already show their discontent.

In next year’s midterm elections, the Republican Party is expected to suffer from Trump’s immigration policies. Salazar was born in the United States, but her parents are Cuban refugees, and her vision of immigration differs from the more extreme positions of the Republican Party, which supports the expulsion of all undocumented immigrants.

Rubén Gallego and the Democrats’ mistake

Similarly, Arizona’s Democratic Senator, Rubén Gallego, is distancing himself from his own party’s position. Gallego, born in the United States to immigrant parents (a Colombian mother and a Mexican father), also introduced his own immigration reform bill in May. The senator addressed business leaders who arrived in Washington yesterday to explain that the Democratic Party has a misconception that Latinos are liberal when it comes to open borders and immigration. Gallego asserted that those who live near the border with Mexico advocate for stricter control, and that Democrats have lost votes for believing otherwise. “My party was wrong because it was uncomfortable about hearing what those who live on the border were saying.” “Although Donald Trump had the most extreme position on the border, it was closer to that of the average voter than to the Democratic position,” he added.

One of the pillars of his proposal is to strengthen border control. The other pillar advocates granting citizenship to Dreamers, migrants who came to the United States as children, although he advocates taking it slowly when negotiating with Republicans.

In his opinion, his party’s “big mistake” has been calling for a complete overhaul of the current system. “We can’t bring 11 million people out of the shadows and give them a path to citizenship,” he asserts. In his state, Latinos make up more than a third of the workforce, and paid $700 million in taxes. Yet, it’s one of the states where ICE has most heavily targeted immigrants.

Gallego wants a more moderate approach, moving forward little by little on the immigration agenda to reach an agreement with the Trump administration. “We have to find a middle ground. Maybe we don’t have to grant them citizenship, but rather let them remain legally in the country, pay taxes, and avoid being deported,” he suggests as a way to negotiate with Republicans.

At the time of her abduction, she had over 93,000 followers on Facebook, where she would post criticism of abuses by the Myanmar junta following the February 2021 military coup.
It also stated that it had sought assistance from the International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL, to inform Myanmar junta authorities of the family’s disappearance.
Civil society supporting Myanmar nationals in Malaysia, including UNHCR-registered refugees, told Human Rights Watch of growing fears of arrest and forced returns.
The Myanmar junta has arrested an estimated 30,000 activists, journalists, humanitarian workers, and others since the coup, including thousands under the Counter-Terrorism Law.","(Bangkok) – The Malaysian government should press Myanmar’s junta for the immediate release of a refugee family abducted from Kuala Lumpur in July 2023, Human Rights Watch said today. More than two years after her disappearance, Myanmar junta authorities announced on October 17, 2025, that they were detaining Thuzar Maung, a Myanmar pro-democracy activist, along with her husband and three children.

The junta said that Thuzar Maung, 48, and her family members were arrested for “illegally reentering” Myanmar and that an arrest warrant had been issued for her under Myanmar’s counterterrorism law in January 2023. Malaysian authorities should urgently reopen their investigation into the abduction of Thuzar Maung and her family from their home in Kuala Lumpur, which may amount to transnational repression, a cross-border violation of human rights against a country’s nationals.

“The Malaysian authorities should publicly press Myanmar’s junta to free Thuzar Maung and her family and investigate how this prominent refugee ended up in Myanmar,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The Malaysian government is failing to protect refugees at risk, including children, and the role of Myanmar’s junta and possibly other governments needs to be fully explored and brought to light.”

Thuzar Maung is a longtime advocate for democracy in Myanmar and for refugee and migrant rights in Malaysia. She fled Myanmar for Malaysia in 2015 to escape growing violence against Muslims. The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, recognized her and her family as refugees. At the time of her abduction, she had over 93,000 followers on Facebook, where she would post criticism of abuses by the Myanmar junta following the February 2021 military coup.

The junta reported that the Myittha Township Court in Mandalay Region had issued an arrest warrant for Thuzar Maung under the junta-amended section 52(a) of the Counter-Terrorism Law and section 512 of the Criminal Procedure Code for providing support to the opposition National Unity Government, which it has declared as a “terrorist organization.” Section 52(a) carries a prison sentence of three to seven years.

The announcement includes a photo allegedly of the five family members in custody with their eyes blacked out. It states that action will be taken “against those living abroad contacting terrorist groups, opposing the state, and providing financial support to terrorist groups.” No information was provided regarding the date of their arrest, any legal proceedings against the family, or where they are being held, meaning they remain forcibly disappeared.

On July 4, 2023, unidentified men abducted Thuzar Maung with her husband, Saw Than Tin Win, and her daughter and two sons from their home in Ampang Jaya, Kuala Lumpur. A friend on the phone with Thuzar Maung at the time heard her yell that unknown men were entering the house, before being disconnected. CCTV footage captured a car with fake license plates entering their gated community before the call and exiting three hours later, at which point all of the family’s phones had been turned off.

On July 21, 2023, the United Nations Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances and other UN experts wrote to the Malaysian government, urging the authorities “to urgently advance an immediate, impartial, thorough, and transparent investigation of the alleged enforced disappearance” of the family. The working group expressed concern that Thuzar Maung had been targeted for her human rights activism and that the risk of forcible return “would put their personal safety, liberty, integrity and life in danger and expose her to the serious risk of arbitrary arrest, detention, torture, summary execution, and lack of a fair trial.”

In September, the Malaysian government responded that the police investigation had found no physical evidence or witness testimony to suggest that the family was abducted or forcibly disappeared and that there was no record of their leaving the country. Instead, Malaysia detailed the family’s alleged history of leaving rental houses without notice. It also stated that it had sought assistance from the International Criminal Police Organization, or INTERPOL, to inform Myanmar junta authorities of the family’s disappearance.

Since the 2021 coup, Malaysian authorities have summarily deported thousands of asylum seekers to Myanmar despite the risk to their lives and freedom, without assessing their asylum claims or other protection needs. Immigration raids and arrests have surged over the past year, with 34,000 between January and mid-May alone.

Malaysian authorities have forcibly returned foreign nationals, including asylum seekers and refugees, at the request of their home governments. Governments wrongfully designating nationals living abroad as “terrorists” reflect what UN experts said was their “profound concern regarding the reported rise in transnational repression” across Southeast Asia. Civil society supporting Myanmar nationals in Malaysia, including UNHCR-registered refugees, told Human Rights Watch of growing fears of arrest and forced returns.

The Myanmar junta has arrested an estimated 30,000 activists, journalists, humanitarian workers, and others since the coup, including thousands under the Counter-Terrorism Law. With millions of Myanmar nationals having fled the country, the junta has engaged in transnational repression to crack down on activists outside its borders, such as requesting deportations, revoking passports, and conducting digital surveillance.

Malaysia is this year’s chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). At the ASEAN summit and related events starting October 26 in Kuala Lumpur, ASEAN members and partners should urge Malaysia to reopen the investigation into Thuzar Maung’s disappearance and, more broadly, to end its abusive treatment of migrants and refugees. ASEAN as a bloc should ensure that regional instruments enshrine the rights of refugees, dissidents, activists, and other targets of transnational repression.

“ASEAN members and partners at the Kuala Lumpur summit should work together to bring an end to horrific crimes of transnational repression in the region,” Pearson said. “Refugees like Thuzar Maung and her family should be safe from harm, and Malaysia and other countries need to act to deter further efforts by the junta to abduct and disappear Myanmar refugees.”",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2023/07/202307asia_malaysia_thuzarmaung.jpg?h=ecd035fb&itok=zh0otq2U,N,,2025-10-22 10:16:50.389085

The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the incident.
Los Angeles police officers were providing outer perimeter traffic control, the FBI said.
But activists and protesters have decried what they call heavy-handed policing in Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon.
The incidents have also raised security concerns for ICE agents, attorneys, judges, and migrants, USA TODAY previously reported.","A man was shot in the elbow, and a deputy U.S. Marshal was hit in the hand by a ricochet bullet during an immigration enforcement operation in Los Angeles on the morning of Oct. 21, the Department of Homeland Security said.

The shooting occurred in downtown Los Angeles during what the DHS described as a ""targeted traffic enforcement stop."" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the DHS, said the U.S. Marshals Service was assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents conducting a traffic stop of a man who had entered the country illegally.

McLaughlin, who noted that the investigation remains ongoing and information was preliminary, said federal immigration agents and the U.S. Marshals Service had pulled the man over using a ""standard law enforcement procedure."" The man then ""weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee,"" according to McLaughlin.

""Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,"" McLaughlin said in a statement on X.

The man was shot in the elbow while attempting to flee from the scene, and the deputy U.S. Marshal was injured by a ricochet bullet, McLaughlin said. Both the deputy marshal and the suspect were transported to the hospital.

The DHS did not provide further details on what procedure ICE agents used or when the man entered the United States, but McLaughlin said he had previously escaped from custody and had attempted to evade arrest before.

Federal, local agencies investigating incident

The U.S. Marshals Service said in a statement that its Central District of California office was involved in a ""line-of-duty shooting"" on Oct. 21, in which a deputy marshal sustained non-life-threatening injuries. The deputy marshal was in stable condition, according to the agency.

The agency said it will not release the identities of the deputy marshals involved in shooting incidents ""until the conclusion of all investigations surrounding the incident."" The Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Los Angeles Police Department are investigating the incident.

The FBI said in a statement that its Evidence Response Team was processing the scene. It added that it was working with the U.S. Marshals Service, Department of Homeland Security, and the LAPD.

FBI agents were not involved in the incident, according to the agency. Los Angeles police officers were providing outer perimeter traffic control, the FBI said.

Shooting comes amid tensions over federal immigration crackdown

The incident comes amid growing tensions in major U.S. cities over President Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown. McLaughlin attributed the shooting to the ""conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest.""

But activists and protesters have decried what they call heavy-handed policing in Democratic-run cities, including Los Angeles, New York, Washington, D.C., and Portland, Oregon.

Los Angeles County has been at the epicenter of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. In June, Trump sent the National Guard and U.S. Marines into the city to protect federal buildings and protect ICE agents as they carried out raids, prompting widespread protests.

The protests in Los Angeles County began as a reaction to a handful of immigration raids, including one outside a Home Depot and another at a clothing manufacturer in the city's garment district. The raids and subsequent outrage came as the Trump administration stepped up its detention and deportation of immigrants, including at workplaces, traffic stops, and routine legal check-ins.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom, one of the leading critics of Trump's immigration crackdown, signed legislation in September that would prevent ICE officers from wearing masks to hide their identities. Critics of mask-wearing say it stifles accountability.

White House officials previously said ICE agents have experienced an increase in assaults. Over the summer, videos circulating on social media showed increasingly violent confrontations between masked federal agents and civilians seeking to document or prevent arrests.

Following recent ICE attacks, including a deadly shooting at a facility in Dallas in September, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to strengthen security at ICE facilities. The incidents have also raised security concerns for ICE agents, attorneys, judges, and migrants, USA TODAY previously reported.

As The New York Times’s Tony Romm reports, the Trump administration has “stretched its authority” to pay some workers, despite a lack of approval for the payments from Congress, which controls spending under the Constitution.

To pay members of the military, Trump has tapped $8 billion from a special fund dedicated to research and development of weaponry while giving the Pentagon approval to use any leftover funds to meet payroll. To pay immigration agents and other law enforcement officials, the White House has turned to a $10 billion fund dedicated to border protection that was created by the massive tax and policy law last summer — though those paychecks have not yet been issued. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on social media last week that more than 70,000 federal agents will receive “super” paychecks on October 22 that cover all hours worked during the shutdown.

Legal scholars have questioned the White House’s drive to expand its power over spending, largely at the expense of Congress, but the Trump administration argues that the shutdown fundamentally alters the rules. The general counsel of the White House budget office said that under normal circumstances, the executive branch cannot shift funds from one account to another, Romm reports. But during the shutdown, the lapse in funding means that payment accounts no longer exist, the administration argues, giving the executive branch more leeway to use existing funds as it sees fit.

More broadly, the Trump administration and many of its conservative supporters argue that the executive branch should have far more power than it has claimed over the last few decades, including the right to freeze or redirect spending authorized by Congress.

Although pushback from Congress on the issue has been modest, some lawmakers are raising questions about Trump’s reprogramming of funds. “Look, I want the troops to be paid,” Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said, per Politico. “But, as usual, they find the most illegal way to do everything.”

Some Republicans are concerned, as well. Sen. Jerry Moran, a senior Republican on the Appropriations Committee, told Politico that he wants the White House to follow the established rules. While paying troops is “a desired outcome,” Moran said, “there’s a process that’s required — by Constitution and by law — for Congress to be not only consulted but engaged.”

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, another appropriator, also called on the White House to play by the rules. “There’s a way we take care of this,” she said. “It’s called appropriations. It’s called reprogramming. And I don’t think that process is being respected.”",https://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/cdn/ff/RSBUk1de-XlZOCza_RRy9jLbVs2qzbWwMNB9EvJKIvs/1759217797/:relative:/themes/custom/tftng_theme/favicon.ico,N,,2025-10-22 10:56:48.091953

The shutdown’s funding squeeze is officially hampering the court system.

The creeping effects of the 21-day-old government shutdown are threatening court delays and shuttering some courthouses, all of which could lead to unpredictable disruptions in a number of cases against Trump administration policies, among others.

The federal judiciary on Monday ran out of funding to maintain the normal operations and work of roughly 30,000 staffers, two support agencies, 13 regional appeals courts and 94 district courts. Some courts are furloughing staff for the first time in three decades, requiring others to work without pay, and even operating under a limited, four-day-a-week schedule.

Beginning this week, the District Court for the Middle District of Alabama is no longer open on Fridays. Nor is the clerk’s office for the federal district court in Connecticut, which is currently fielding one of several lawsuits challenging the administration’s moves to revoke visas from some foreign students.

The courts, like federal agencies, can require “essential” employees, such as judges’ staff, to work without pay. Judges themselves cannot be furloughed or be required to work without pay, but some say they are worried that funding shortfalls will hobble ongoing casework.

The “dedicated public servants, who allow those who seek redress prompt access to Court, are now feeling the pain of their paychecks being suspended and facing difficult financial decisions to keep their families afloat because of the shutdown,” VIRGINIA KENDALL, Chief Judge of the Northern District of Illinois, said in a statement Friday. “I am concerned that the lack of appropriation will create delays in the Court’s ability to ensure timely justice.”

Kendall’s district and the Eastern District of Kentucky have paused civil cases involving the government, citing the effects of the shutdown within the executive branch, where attorneys are also either furloughed or working without pay. The Northern Illinois federal court is currently assessing a challenge to President DONALD TRUMP’s planned National Guard deployments.

The Supreme Court, meanwhile, said that it would run out of funding Oct. 18, but anticipates minimal disruptions for the time being, at least when it comes to the court’s business. The itineraries of tourists and civics nerds face a worse fate: The Supreme Court building “will be closed to the public until further notice,” but the court’s official business will continue normally, said PATRICIA McCABE, the court’s public information officer.

Historically, the judiciary has managed to operate normally during shutdowns by dipping into money collected via court fees and relying on “carryover” funds from previous fiscal years. That’s how the judiciary generally maintained operations throughout the longest government shutdown recorded: the 35-day closure during Trump’s first term.

But this time around, those funds only kept courts operating for about 20 days, after going several years without budget increases. And there’s still no clear path out of the impasse Democrats and Republicans have reached in budget negotiations.

Although a number of federal courts have affirmed that they will keep “essential” services running normally, that will become less feasible as the shutdown stretches on — and as courts continue to rely on skeleton crews working without pay.

Without a deal to reopen the government, we may soon see more of the same impacts on some courts that we saw during the 1996 and 2014 shutdowns: postponing deadlines en masse; rescheduling arguments because government attorneys were unable to attend; refusing to begin new civil jury trials; and operating on condensed criminal calendars.

POTUS PUZZLER

Which former president took up oil painting in his post-presidency?

(Answer at bottom.)

The Oval

THE FORCE IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE: Everyone’s gotten it before: You remind me of DARTH VADER.

But not everyone has received that compliment (?) from the president of the United States himself. “We have Darth Vader. You know Darth Vader, right?” Trump said at a lunch for Senate Republicans at the Rose Garden today. “Darth Vader is a man who … I think he’s sitting there. Is that Darth? Stand up, Darth.” Of course, he was talking about White House budget chief RUSS VOUGHT.

“They call him Darth Vader. I call him a fine man.”

ABOUT THOSE BLUE SLIPS: Also at the lunch, Trump pressured Republican senators to change a long-standing Senate practice related to how lawmakers vet U.S. attorney nominees, our ALEX GANGITANO reports. “You know, I have 10 U.S. attorneys who are phenomenal,” Trump said at the lunch. “And the problem is, they’re not going to ever be confirmed, I guess. I put them in, they’ll be there for three or four months, whatever it is, and then they have to leave.”

The practice Trump was bemoaning, called a “blue slip,” essentially allows senators to veto nominees to district courts and U.S. attorneys’ offices from their states by not returning a paper called a “blue slip.” This decades-old custom has been used by senators from both parties and was created to empower home-state senators to weigh in on judicial nominees that will hold sway over their constituents.

SEE YOU NEXT TIME: Trump’s second summit with Russian President VLADIMIR PUTIN is off, our ELI STOKOLS and DIANA NEROZZI report. The White House said today that the planned meeting in Budapest Trump announced just last week after his two-hour phone call with Putin was no longer in the works after Secretary of State MARCO RUBIO spoke Monday with Russian Foreign Minister SERGEY LAVROV.

“Secretary Rubio and Foreign Minister Lavrov had a productive call,” said a White House official granted anonymity to discuss the plans. “Therefore, an additional in-person meeting between the Secretary and Foreign Minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future.”

Agenda Setting

BRING OUT THE BRINKS: Trump is demanding that the Justice Department pay him about $230 million in what he claims are damages related to various federal investigations that have probed him, according to people familiar with the matter. Those people, cited anonymously, added that any settlement might ultimately be approved by senior department officials who defended him or those in his orbit, NYT’s DEVLIN BARRETT and TYLER PAGER report.

Trump submitted complaints through an administrative claims process that often is the precursor to lawsuits. The first claim, lodged in late 2023, seeks damages for a number of purported violations of his rights, including those related to the FBI and special counsel investigation into Russian election tampering and possible connections to the 2016 Trump campaign. The second complaint, filed in the summer of 2024, accuses the FBI of violating Trump’s privacy by searching Mar-a-Lago in 2022 for classified documents.

“What a travesty,” said Pace University ethics professor BENNETT L. GERSHMAN. “The ethical conflict is just so basic and fundamental, you don’t need a law professor to explain it.”

QUESTIONS QUESTIONS: The Trump administration imposed a new annual $100 fee on asylum seekers earlier this summer. But more than three months later, immigrants and their attorneys say they can’t figure out whether they owe the money or how to pay the fee, our MYAH WARD reports. Immigration attorneys and advocates say it’s another example of how the administration’s efforts to curb legal pathways for immigrants have trapped people in a bureaucratic maze.

The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. The White House deferred to the agencies implementing the policy. But in a court filing late Monday in federal district court, DOJ lawyers defended the fees and said the agencies are moving to finalize the policy’s implementation.

THE INGRASSIA FALLOUT: Senate Majority Leader JOHN THUNE said Monday he hopes the White House withdraws PAUL INGRASSIA’s Office of Special Counsel nomination, after POLITICO reported on texts that showed him making racist remarks to fellow Republicans, our HAILEY FUCHS reports. “He’s not gonna pass,” the senator told reporters. Ingrassia is scheduled to testify on his nomination Thursday before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.

At least three other Republicans are signaling they will oppose his confirmation: Sens. RICK SCOTT of Florida, RON JOHNSON of Wisconsin and JAMES LANKFORD of Oklahoma. “I’m not supporting him,” Scott said. “I can’t imagine how anybody can be antisemitic in this country. It’s wrong.”

“I have tons of questions for him,” Lankford said, adding he “can’t imagine supporting that.”

Musk Radar

HE’S BACK: A spat over the future of NASA under the Trump administration unfolded on social media today, with ELON MUSK panning Transportation Secretary SEAN DUFFY as having a “2 digit IQ” and advocating for his ally JARED ISAACMAN to run the space agency in a string of posts, our GREGORY SVIRNOVSKIY reports. “Should someone whose biggest claim to fame is climbing trees be running America’s space program?” Musk asked in a poll on X, referencing Duffy’s prior career as a professional lumberjack athlete.

One of the listed choices: “Noo, he need moar brainz!” (Isaacman had his chance at the post, but Trump pulled the nomination in May because, Trump said, he’d discovered Isaacman was a “blue-blooded Democrat.”)

WHO'S IN, WHO’S OUT

ARMY FILLS A SPOT: Trump has selected Defense Secretary PETE HEGSETH’s senior military assistant to be the Army’s second-most senior officer, shuttling a close aide to the Pentagon chief to an influential — and more senior — position in the ranks, our CONNOR O’BRIEN reports. Army Lt. Gen. CHRISTOPHER LaNEVE was nominated for the Army vice chief of staff position on Monday, according to a Senate notice, and would be promoted to the rank of four-star general if confirmed.

You guessed it: GEORGE W. BUSH. After leaving office in 2009, Bush took up oil painting at his Texas ranch. The former president displayed 64 full-color portraits and a four-panel mural painted by Bush of military members, which ran at the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas.

In 2013, he also painted a 20 x 18” oil portrait of Putin.

Pending Shadow Docket Applications Shadow Docket Applications Note: The assessment of whether the Court provided a written explanation includes cases where that explanation is scant but nonetheless still offers some modicum of a rationale.","Over the past few years, the Supreme Court has dramatically expanded the use of its “shadow docket,” a previously rarely used procedure for certain emergency decisions. Normally, the Court decides cases based on a thorough briefing and arguments that culminate in written decisions that clearly lay out the majority’s reasoning. This allows the public to evaluate the Court’s justifications and imposes discipline on the justices’ decision-making processes.

The shadow docket provides a fast-track process for the Court to hear emergency applications, which typically involve requests that the Court temporarily lift lower court orders. Historically, this process was used infrequently and limited to instances where an applicant faced serious irreparable harm, such as a death row inmate facing execution. Shadow docket cases usually involve limited briefing, no oral argument, and rulings with little or no analysis of the Court’s reasoning.

The Court is now using the shadow docket at an unprecedented rate for lawsuits challenging the Trump administration’s most controversial actions. In its first 20 weeks, the second Trump administration made as many shadow docket applications — 19 — that the Biden administration made over four years, according to an analysis by Georgetown Professor Stephen Vladeck. The Obama and George W. Bush administrations combined made only 8 requests over 16 years.

The Trump administration has prevailed in the vast majority of its requests for emergency action, as the data below shows. These rulings have allowed administration policies to move forward after lower courts had found that the administration’s actions were likely illegal. While the Court’s shadow docket decisions are not a final ruling on the legal merits, there is still significant impact on the people affected while the case remains pending, which is why the lower courts had issued their orders in the first place. Among other things, the Court’s shadow docket rulings have led to mass firings of civil servants, the defunding of scientific research, and racial profiling in immigration sweeps.

The lack of reasoning in most shadow docket rulings also leaves lower courts with little guidance about how to address similar issues in other cases.

A clear pattern has emerged: The Court is using the shadow docket to quickly and dramatically expand executive power. As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in a dissent, “Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars. Still more, it should not be used, as it also has been, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President, and thus to reshape the Nation’s separation of powers.”

This resource tracks cases on the Supreme Court’s shadow docket that relate to the administration’s policies and practices. It notes whether the Court has decided to rule in favor of the administration at least partially and whether the majority offered any reasoning for its decision. It also includes notable commentary from justices about the use of the shadow docket.

Since January 20, 2025, the Supreme Court has issued 22 decisions on the shadow docket concerning administration actions.

19 ruled for the administration at least partially

3 ruled against the administration

7 were not accompanied by any written explanation (most other rulings included only brief analysis, sometimes as short as a sentence)

Three shadow docket applications are currently pending.

Methodology: The cases below had applications that were filed on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket starting January 20, 2025. Almost all of the emergency applications were brought by the Department of Justice. Only one case was brought by a group of people seeking to urgently halt government action. The source of the information is the Supreme Court’s website, as well as information collected by SCOTUSblog and Shadow Docket Watch. A spreadsheet of the data is available here.

Note: The assessment of whether the Court provided a written explanation includes cases where that explanation is scant but nonetheless still offers some modicum of a rationale. In other words, a “Yes” does not necessarily indicate a comprehensive explanation for the Court’s decision. Two applications were ultimately withdrawn by the government: Trump v. Global Health Council and Trump v. American Federation of Government Employees. For more information on these two cases, see below.

Commentary about the shadow docket: “I view today’s decision as yet another grave misuse of our emergency docket. This Court should have stayed its hand.

Ruled in favor of the administration at least partially: Yes

Majority’s reasoning given: Yes

Concurrences and dissents: Concurrence from Justice Barrett. Chief Justice Roberts concurred in part and dissented in part, joined by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson. Justice Gorsuch concurred in part and dissented in part, joined by Justice Kavanaugh. Justice Kavanaugh concurred in part and dissented in part. Justice Jackson concurred in part and dissented in part.

Commentary about the shadow docket: “For a cautionary tale about lawmaking on the emergency docket, look no further than this newest iteration. By today’s order, an evenly divided Court neuters judicial review of grant terminations by sending plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.”

—Justice Jackson

“This Court often addresses requests for interim relief — sometimes pending a writ of certiorari . . . and sometimes after a writ of certiorari is granted. . . . And either way, when this Court issues a decision, it constitutes a precedent that commands respect in lower courts. Of course, decisions regarding interim relief are not necessarily conclusive as to the merits because further litigation may follow. But regardless of a decision’s procedural posture, its reasoning — its ratio decidendi — carries precedent weight in future cases” (internal quotations and citations omitted).

—Justice Gorsuch

Ruled in favor of the administration at least partially: Yes

Majority’s reasoning given: No

Concurrences and dissents: Justice Sotomayor dissented, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson.

Commentary about the shadow docket: “When the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary’s duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it. . . . The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave. Unable to join in this misuse of our emergency docket, I respectfully dissent.”

—Justice Sotomayor

Case history

District of Massachusetts: Ordered the Department of Education to reinstate fired employees (Judge Joun)

First Circuit: Let the decision stand (Judges Barron, Kayatta, and Rikelman)

Commentary about the shadow docket: “By needlessly granting the Government’s emergency application to prohibit universal injunctions, the Court has cleared a path for the Executive to choose law-free action at this perilous moment for our Constitution — right when the Judiciary should be hunkering down to do all it can to preserve the law’s constraints.”

—Justice Jackson

Concurrences and dissents: Justice Sotomayor dissented to the initial decision, joined by Justices Kagan and Jackson. On the granted motion for clarification, Justice Kagan concurred and Justice Sotomayor, joined by Justice Jackson, dissented.

Commentary about the shadow docket: “Rather than allowing our lower court colleagues to manage this high-stakes litigation with the care and attention it plainly requires, this Court now intervenes to grant the Government emergency relief from an order it has repeatedly defied. I cannot join so gross an abuse of the Court’s equitable discretion.”

—Justice Sotomayor

A federal raid in New York City’s Chinatown targeting criminal activity tied to the alleged sale of counterfeit goods turned chaotic Friday as protesters clashed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, prompting city officials to say they had no role in the operation.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Fox News that ICE and federal partners conducted a ""targeted, intelligence-driven enforcement operation"" on Canal Street focused on criminal activity related to the sale of alleged counterfeit goods.

""During this law enforcement operation, rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties, including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement,"" McLaughlin wrote in a statement. ""Already, one rioter has been arrested for assault on a federal officer.""

During a news conference Tuesday night, Murad Awawdeh, vice president of advocacy at the New York Immigration Coalition, said between 15 and 40 vendors were arrested, and at least two locals were taken into custody for protesting and blocking their arrest efforts.

City officials quickly moved to distance themselves from the raid.

Mayor Eric Adams’ press secretary, Kayla Mamelak Altus, told Fox News that New York City ""never cooperates with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters, in accordance with local laws,"" and had ""no involvement in this matter.""

""Mayor Adams has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue the American Dream should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,"" she said.

City officials said police were monitoring the situation near Canal Street and 26 Federal Plaza but had ""matters under control."" However, if circumstances were to escalate and an individual assaults or interferes with a legal law enforcement action, a source said Adams instructed the New York City Police Department (NYPD) to intervene.

The source added there have been numerous multi-agency enforcement actions on Canal Street this year, and any illegal activity should be addressed by the NYPD.

""We saw what looked like tanks in our streets,"" said Jumaane Williams, a New York City public advocate. ""We saw people who were armed and in tactical gear for vendors, which was planned. Many of you actually got advance notice that this was going to happen. They were targeting, in this case, Black vendors on Canal Street. That's what occurred… None of this is about public safety. It is about fear and chaos.""

He added that what gives him hope is that, in a few months, he believes ""we are going to have a mayor who actually cares about New Yorkers and who will be here joined with us.""

Filing a habeas corpus petition from immigration detention is extremely difficult.","Immigrants in detention and their loved ones and legal representatives are facing desperation and sheer exhaustion. Through a series of legal, policy and bureaucratic machinations, the Trump administration is ensuring there is almost no way out of immigration detention other than death or deportation.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has long held some people in detention without giving them a chance to ask for release on bond – a practice called “mandatory detention.” Earlier this year, Congress passed the Laken Riley Act, which expanded mandatory detention. As of October 2025, ICE has made major policy changes to expand it even further, and the immigration appeals court at the Department of Justice has signed off. The result: ICE is arresting, detaining, and refusing to release far more people than before, including many vulnerable people who were rarely detained in the past. Read below how these policy changes are harming people and who is impacted.

How is ICE ensuring that people are locked up without due process?

Indiscriminate arrests and abandonment of charging discretion: The Supreme Court has long held that ICE can choose whether or not to arrest someone and begin a deportation case. Recent ICE policy guidance, however, now tells officers they must start a deportation case for anyone they arrest – whether at the border or inside the United States. ICE is also no longer following policies that limited enforcement against people with humanitarian and medical concerns, such as pregnant women and primary caregivers.

Declaring long-time U.S. residents ineligible for bond: In July, ICE issued a policy memo declaring that anyone who originally entered the United States without permission – no matter how long they’ve lived here – is not allowed to even ask for release from detention on bond. This goes against existing law, which says that people arrested and detained inside the United States by ICE should be able to ask for bond. On September 5th, the immigration appeals court in the Department of Justice agreed with ICE’s position in a case called Matter of Yajure Hurtado. But dozens of federal district courts have disagreed with ICE’s misguided interpretation of the law in response to individual legal challenges brought through habeas petitions.

Refusing to exercise discretion for those who remain eligible for release: Even with all these changes, some people in ICE detention – especially those who came to the U.S. with valid visas – can still ask for bond. In other cases, ICE still has the power to release someone through a process called parole. However, ICE has rolled out new policies that basically follow a “detain until deport” approach. This approach takes away local officers’ ability to decide whether someone should be released and requires approval from ICE headquarters. This makes officers less likely to decide to release, because they know their decisions will be reviewed and possibly blocked by headquarters.

Routinely appealing when an Immigration Judge determines a person should be released, keeping the person trapped in detention: In the rare cases where an Immigration Judge decides someone can be released on bond, ICE is regularly appealing the bond decision. When ICE appeals, a federal rule kicks in that automatically blocks the person’s release on bond while the appeal is pending. In other words, even if a person can pay their bond and be released, they will be stuck in detention during the appeal. By the time the appeal is finished, the person has often been deported or their case has ended in another way.

Can anyone get released from immigration detention?

Very few people can. For most, the only real option for release is to ask a federal court judge to step in through a habeas corpus petition. But this option is inaccessible for most.

Filing a habeas corpus petition from immigration detention is extremely difficult. It involves complex procedural and legal steps, and about 80% of people in detention do not have lawyers to help them. Many immigration lawyers are not trained in habeas work because it has not been a common part of their practice before. When someone does manage to file a habeas petition, ICE often engages in a cat and mouse game by moving the person to a different location, exhausting and demoralizing detained individuals already separated from their loved ones.

Who is getting stuck in detention?

ICE’s indiscriminate and sweeping use of detention has even stunned loyal Trump supporters, leaving no one safe from losing their freedom.

This year, ICE arrested and detained:

U.S. citizens

Minors

Green card holders and others with legal status (like Temporary Protected Status)

DACA recipients

Journalists

Veterans and their immigrant family members (including U.S. citizen veterans)

People whose cases have been terminated by a judge

People with disabilities — for whom ICE then denies basic accommodations

Medically vulnerable individuals, including those with brain tumors and cancer

Pregnant people and nursing mothers

Grandmothers while gardening

People with U.S. citizen children, triggering a child mental health crisis in the U.S.

Long-time residents

High school students going to volleyball practice, walking the dog, reporting to their immigration court hearings, and one just weeks from graduation.

Prolonged detention has devastating consequences.

We can’t lose sight of how serious it is when the government takes away someone’s liberty. Detention separates people from their children, loved ones, and livelihoods. It destabilizes communities and leaves families struggling to pay their bills. In some cases, detention is a death sentence: suicide attempts are common and at least 20 people have died in detention since Trump took office.

The Trump administration knows that detaining people in harsh conditions makes them more likely to give up their rights and agree to deportation, even if they have a strong legal case. One former ICE official has already said he expects “legitimate lawsuits” due to horrific conditions. Research shows that the stress and hopelessness of detention often causes people to abandon their fight to stay in the United States.

Take action

NILC urges Members of Congress to work closely with legal service providers and mutual aid organizations in their states and districts and to engage actively in supporting constituents facing unjust and prolonged detention. It is critical to bear witness, amplify the stories of those harmed, and keep pushing for people to be released. We cannot let ICE carry out these abuses.",https://www.nilc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/cropped-SEO-Image.png,N,,2025-10-22 00:16:58.372097

[Related: Non-domiciled drivers say DOT's new rule violates their civil rights] “The rule on non-domiciled CDLs is about safety and the integrity of the CDL issuing process.","Unions representing government workers and teachers filed a lawsuit on Monday to “promptly invalidate” the Department of Transportation's September emergency rulemaking on non-domiciled CDLs that seeks to put roughly 200,000 current CDL holders out of work.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and the Public Citizen Litigation Group filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to challenge the new rule, calling it a threat to the livelihood of immigrants.

The rule changes from DOT's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, now in effect, limit which non-citizens can get CDLs: 194,000 of approximately 200,000 current non-domiciled CDL holders, under the rule's terms, will have their CDLs revoked or lapse without renewal possibility in the next two years.

“Asylum seekers, refugees, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients who have work authorization are barred from holding commercial driver’s licenses based on their immigration status,” a press release on the AFT’s website elaborated.

The new lawsuit, ""Rivera Lujan v. FMCSA,"" takes its plaintiff's name from a DACA recipient and owner-operator. The suit “will challenge both the substance of the rule and FMCSA’s failure to follow rulemaking procedures required by law,"" according to the release.

“Without a commercial driver’s license, I will lose my business and the income that allows me to provide for my family,” said Lujan in the release. Lujan has lived in the United States since he was two years old. “I have followed all the rules and complied with all requirements set by the government,"" he continued.

Issuing the final rule, FMCSA detailed five deadly crashes involving non-domiciled CDL drivers as basis for an emergency action, declaring a final rule without first posting notice and going through comment periods on the Federal Register before implementation. FMCSA also cited national security concerns attached to having foreign CDL holders operating big trucks.

“This unlawful rule seems intended to put people authorized to work in the United States out of work, solely because of the prejudices of the Trump administration,” said Wendy Liu, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group. “We are asking the court to promptly invalidate the rule to prevent devastating consequences for our clients and the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who depend on commercial driver’s licenses for their livelihoods.”

The lawsuit also cites an asylum seeker who joined the suit as depending on truck driving to support his family. “I’ve endured tremendous hardship but have fought to rebuild my life through trucking. For me and so many others, this rule will be a tragedy, destroying years of sacrifice and honest work,” the asylum seeker said.

Overdrive reporting has found dozens of comments echoing those from non-domiciled CDL holders already filed to the federal register under the new rule.

DOT responded to those claims by saying the rule focused on ensuring the safety of America’s roads.

[Related: Non-domiciled drivers say DOT's new rule violates their civil rights]

“The rule on non-domiciled CDLs is about safety and the integrity of the CDL issuing process. It’s really that simple,"" a DOT spokesperson said. ""The rule ensures that anyone operating a commercial motor vehicle is properly identified, vetted, and licensed under U.S. law to protect the safety of everyone traveling on American roads.”

Non-domiciled CDL applicants do not provide three years' worth of motor vehicle records when applying for a CDLs. Furthermore, people who arrive undetected across the southern border do not undergo a criminal history check, and those people sometimes go on to seek asylum.

Harjinder Singh, the driver behind the triple-fatal Florida turnpike U-turn crash, was an asylum seeker who previously had a deportation order, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Overdrive readers, polled in June, expressed support for banning CDLs for non-citizens, with 64% in favor. Survey respondents cited safety and economic fairness concerns.

Under President Donald Trump, the executive branch has sought to mandate English language proficiency for truck drivers and its Department of Homeland Security has reported apprehending dozens of “illegal alien” drivers, or drivers who entered the country illegally. However, many people legally in the country also hold CDLs and visas, and therefore would have been vetted, as the comments under the new rule on the Federal Register show.

“The administration’s new rule prevents immigrants who are lawfully present in the country and authorized to work from supporting themselves and their families,” said AFSCME President Lee Saunders.

The new rule, which impacts holders of all CDL classes, “disrupts essential services communities rely on,” Saunders continued. “Drivers who take our children to school, deliver food and medicine, and clean trash off the streets must have these commercial driver’s licenses, and denying them inflicts unnecessary pain on everyone their lives touch.”

DOT Secretary Sean Duffy, in the press conference announcing the new emergency rule, said that California had issued a Brazilian national a CDL with passenger and school bus endorsements that “was valid for months after his legal presence in America was expired.”

The AFT dismissed DOT’s justifications for the new rule.

“For the Trump administration, the cruelty is the point,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “This is a spiteful and illegal rule issued with no justification except to hurt hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants with work authorization who only want to build a better life for themselves and their families. Many AFT members require a CDL to work as school bus drivers -- and right now we are seeing people turned away from training for these positions. Their American Dream will be dashed or deferred, all because of the pettiness of the president and his advisers.”

Tuesday’s Chinatown raid is not the first in the New York City area in recent weeks.
Notably, many Ice raids have come with documented violence.","Hundreds showed up to protests that broke out in New York City on Tuesday evening after Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) raids related to “selling counterfeit goods” were conducted in the Chinatown neighborhood earlier in the day and resulted in an unknown number of people being detained.

Hours after federal agents descended on lower Manhattan, demonstrators were seen assembling near the 26 Federal Plaza Immigration Building where they believed detainees were taken. Many shouted chants including “Ice out of New York” and “No Ice, no KKK, no fascist USA.”

Videos of the raid show multiple masked and armed federal agents zip-tying and detaining a man, and shoving away onlookers. Throngs of New Yorkers followed the agents through the streets and down the sidewalks. An armored military vehicle was also seen rolling through the city streets.

“Is this worth the paycheck? Selling your soul?” one woman can be heard shouting at agents.

The raid, which onlookers say involved more than 50 federal agents, took place in a well-known area of Manhattan where counterfeit handbags, accessories, jewelry and other goods are sold daily en masse – often to tourists.

It was unclear how many people were detained in the raid, but a witness told the New York Daily News that he saw at least seven individuals taken into custody.

The Department of Homeland Security told the New York Times that the operation was “focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods”. Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for DHS, said the operation was led by the Ice agency, the FBI, US border patrol and others.

The Guardian has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment.

Murad Awawdeh, vice-president of advocacy at the New York Immigration Coalition, condemned the raid to reporters on Tuesday night and said that between 15 and 40 vendors were arrested. Awawdeh also noted that least two locals were taken into custody for protesting and blocking Ice’s efforts.

“You don’t see these scenes in democracy. You see them in fascist regimes,” Awawdeh told a crowd. “We need to continue to stand up and fight back.”

Local city council member Christopher Marte told the City that he too was alarmed by the agents’ conduct.

“The amount of weapons that they had on the street pointed at bystanders, something I’ve never seen in my life,” he said.

The NYPD distanced itself from the raids, tweeting that it had “no involvement in the federal operation that took place on Canal street this afternoon”. However, onlookers noted that NYPD riot cops appeared to arrest several people protesting the Ice raid.

Eric Adams, New York City’s mayor, quote-tweeted the NYPD’s missive and emphasized: “New York City does not cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with our local laws.”

“While we gather details about the situation, New Yorkers should know that we have no involvement. Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he wrote.

New York City mayoral candidates Zohran Mamdani and Andrew Cuomo shared similar notes of criticism, with Mamdani calling the raid “aggressive and reckless” and Cuomo calling it “more about fear than justice, more about politics than safety”.

Both men – and Kathy Hochul, New York governor – took aim at Donald Trump directly.

“[Donald Trump] claims he’s targeting the ‘worst of the worst.’ Today his agents used batons and pepper spray on street vendors and bystanders on Canal Street. You don’t make New York safer by attacking New Yorkers,” Hochul wrote.

“Once again, the Trump administration chooses authoritarian theatrics that create fear, not safety. It must stop,” wrote Mamdani.

“Today’s ICE raid in Chinatown was an abuse of federal power by the Trump administration,” wrote Cuomo.

New York City councilmember Shahana Hanif also condemned the Ice raids in a press conference, saying that politicians across the city and the state were resolutely opposed to Ice raids.

“We are against Ice’s blatantly violent tactics. Hordes of Ice agents showing up is unacceptable, immoral, unjust,” Hanif said.

Ice raids with masked agents and have become commonplace in immigrant enclaves across the country as have protests against them. Protests against Ice have brought federal crackdowns to cities including Chicago, Los Angeles and Portland.

Tuesday’s Chinatown raid is not the first in the New York City area in recent weeks. A 16 October raid in midtown Manhattan was the first known raid on a migrant shelter of the current Trump administration.

Notably, many Ice raids have come with documented violence. Ice has used extreme force in Chicago including pepper balling a priest, pepper-balling the inside of a journalist’s car, and body-slamming a US congressional candidate.

In New York, an Ice agent was “relieved of his duties” after body-slamming a woman to the ground in an immigration court house, but was reportedly back on the job shortly thereafter.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac0e0565464beb2a2d54cc28859d85074bc10348/1221_0_1732_1386/master/1732.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9ca7e9548a24d498c57ee07bdcd0459d",N,,2025-10-21 23:21:31.903324

Advocates say they welcome the reversal, but don’t expect the government to give up its fight against the settlement agreement.
Meanwhile, the ACLU remains in the dark about how many Ms. L. families are at risk of being swept up by immigration enforcement.
Without official documents, the attorneys said, Ms. L. families can’t show they have a right to be in the country if they’re stopped by law enforcement.","This story was originally published by KQED.

Seven years ago, the first Trump administration triggered global condemnation when news broke that it was forcibly separating children from their families at the U.S.-Mexico Border. The outcry led the administration to shutter the program, but thousands of families remained shattered.

The American Academy of Pediatrics called the policy “government-sanctioned child abuse.” Physicians who examined statements from many separated parents and children noted that most met the diagnostic criteria for major mental health disorders as a result of their experience at the border.

A class-action lawsuit followed, and the Biden administration later settled the case. In the settlement agreement, the federal government promised to repair some of the damage by reuniting the families in the U.S. and providing them with a path to asylum.

Now the second Trump administration is quietly abandoning that promise, putting thousands of once-separated families at risk of being split up a second time. At least four families have been deported already.

That’s according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the original lawsuit, known as Ms. L. v. ICE, on behalf of separated families. The ACLU filed a motion in federal court on Tuesday asking for the recently deported families to be returned to the U.S., alleging that at least one of the deportations violated an explicit court order.

It’s only one skirmish in a pitched battle that the ACLU and advocates across the country have been fighting since Trump was reelected. The organization said the settlement agreement is now in danger of unraveling.

Since April, the administration has chipped away at Ms. L. in a series of technical maneuvers that have profoundly impacted families covered by the settlement, according to ACLU filings. Most notably, the government pulled funding for services laid out in the agreement — like help navigating the complex immigration process, assistance with housing and medical costs, and mental health treatment. Defending its actions in court, government lawyers cited the president’s agenda to cut costs and purge contractors with diversity, equity and inclusion policies.

While the services were eventually restored, the families are still facing the consequences of the lapse, and the government has only continued to make things harder for them.

Despite orders from a judge to give Ms. L. class members more time to stay in the country legally while plodding through the asylum process, court filings say the administration has failed to demonstrate that it is doing so.

“It started off slowly, but now we’re seeing breach after breach” of the settlement agreement, said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU’s lead attorney in the case. “The administration, while claiming the settlement is still in place, is trying to undermine it in various ways that will have the effect of allowing families to be reseparated and deported.”

It’s not unusual or improper for the government to renegotiate court-ordered settlement agreements, said David Super, an administrative law expert at Georgetown University who has litigated against both Democratic and Republican administrations. But, he said, it’s “extraordinary” for the government to change its policy before receiving permission from the court, as the DOJ has done in Ms. L. this year.

“When the government unilaterally stops complying, that’s not negotiation,” he said. “That’s contempt of court.”

The Department of Justice declined to answer questions about its challenges to the settlement agreement, saying it doesn’t comment on matters that are in litigation. But in hearings before Judge Dana M. Sabraw, of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California in San Diego, DOJ attorneys have maintained that government agencies are “trying to meet their obligations under the settlement agreement,” and that the deportations are legal.

The California Newsroom also asked the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement, how it avoids reseparating families that are entitled to protection under the Ms. L. agreement.

“ICE does not separate families,” an unnamed DHS spokesperson wrote in an email. “Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates.”

Among those deported was a mother of five who was detained at a routine ICE check-in, along with her two youngest children, according to an ACLU court filing. The woman, whose family members had been separated during the first Trump presidency, had permission to stay in the United States under the terms of the settlement. She and the toddlers were deported to Honduras anyway, while the rest of their family was left behind in the U.S.

“My two youngest children cry for their father and siblings every day,” the woman, who was identified only by her initials, wrote in a declaration to the court. “It breaks my heart to see them in such pain.”

‘The sole purpose of causing them harm’

Upon approving the Ms. L. settlement agreement in December 2023, Sabraw called family separation “one of the most shameful chapters in the history of our country.”

For decades, the federal government rarely separated families at the border, often allowing them to stay in the country together while they pursued asylum. But soon after Trump took office in 2017, immigration officials began a coordinated effort to apprehend all adults who crossed without authorization, including those with children in tow. While adults were detained and deported, kids — some only a few months old — were placed in federal custody. They slept on the floors of makeshift detention centers and were later sent to other relatives or foster homes.

The Trump administration called the policy “zero tolerance.”

In its rush to scale up the campaign, the government lost track of which children belonged to which families. Anguished parents were kept in the dark about where immigration officials had taken their kids — and when they could see them again. Families remained separated for weeks, months, and in some cases even years. As many as 1,000 children, parents and guardians may still be separated today, according to the ACLU, which is struggling to locate and reunite them all.

Trump officials have said, both during and since “zero tolerance,” that the explicit purpose of family separation was to make the crossing so painful that it would discourage other families from trying.

The pain has lasted.

“These events caused by the government have integrated into the psyche,” said Alfonso Mercado, a psychologist in South Texas who has done clinical research and consulted as an expert witness in family separation cases at the border. The trauma, he added, makes it difficult for families to function as they struggle to move on with a new life in the U.S.

“We were intentionally tearing parents and kids from each other with the sole purpose of causing them harm,” said Sara Van Hofwegen of Acacia Center for Justice, the main contractor tasked with providing separated families with legal help. “Part of what the government did through Ms. L. was it promised to help people rebuild their lives and give them a small piece of redress for everything that they went through.”

In all, the Ms. L. settlement agreement applies to roughly 8,000 people, including close family members who were affected by the separation. California is home to the largest proportion — about 12% — of class members with known addresses, according to Acacia. The organization placed two of its eight contractors in California to manage the heavier caseload.

The vast majority of the families came to the U.S. seeking refuge from violence or persecution in their home countries, Van Hofwegen said. But before pursuing asylum cases, attorneys working with families through Acacia’s legal-services contract have helped them establish temporary immigration status and get permission to work, so they can support themselves and not worry about being deported during the asylum process, which can take years.

That work ground to a halt with little warning in April, when the Trump administration abruptly cut off funding for Acacia’s legal services.

Rolling back protections

Pulling the plug on the Acacia contract was only the first of a series of government steps that have made it more difficult for formerly separated families to stay in the U.S., according to the ACLU’s court filings and advocates who provide services to them.

In May, for example, the government stopped paying travel expenses for reuniting families. It also lets invoices pile up from an adjudicator who handles disputes about who qualifies for protections. Both services are required under the settlement agreement.

The next month, the DOJ let another contract lapse, this one with Oakland-based Seneca Family of Agencies, which provided mental health care, medical copays and general case management for separated families.

While the ACLU fought to get funding reinstated, some families couldn’t afford medications or access mental health care on their own. Some parents, who should have been flying to reunite with their children, were stuck in their home countries. One of the deported mothers searched for legal help to keep her family in the country, but none was available during the lapse of Acacia’s contract, according to the recent ACLU filing.

“One of the M.O.s of the Trump administration in this case has been to wait until there’s almost no time to fix things and then force us to rush into court,” said Gelernt, the ACLU attorney. “But while we’re litigating that issue, there’s this lapse in services.”

DOJ lawyers defended cutting off the Acacia contract by saying it would be cheaper for the agency to provide some legal services itself and let pro bono lawyers do the rest. The ACLU argued there aren’t enough private lawyers with the willingness and expertise to do that. The Justice Department also told the court that the government had only “temporarily paused” the travel and adjudication payments while officials reviewed the contracts for cost savings.

As for the checks the government stopped cutting to Seneca, the administration suggested the organization’s efforts to hire a diverse staff may have violated anti-discrimination laws, an allegation that Seneca rejected.

“We take pride in our compliance with civil rights and employment laws and have received no specific evidence of any violations,” Seneca wrote in a June statement. “Should such information emerge, we would welcome the opportunity to review and address it.”

In four separate orders throughout the summer, Sabraw found the government was in breach of the settlement agreement by withholding funding for services. After a series of failed attempts to push back, the DOJ finally reinstated the Acacia and Seneca contracts and paid for the other lapsed services.

Advocates say they welcome the reversal, but don’t expect the government to give up its fight against the settlement agreement.

“While we’re really grateful that our contract is reinstated and that people are getting services,” Acacia’s Van Hofwegen said, “we’re prepared for ongoing attempts to roll back protections for class members.”

‘In real jeopardy’

In fact, while Acacia and Seneca scramble to rebuild teams they were forced to lay off during the lapse in services, slog through their backlog of cases and attempt to reach families they’d turned away, the government has continued to undermine the settlement agreement and fight the court on multiple fronts.

Last month, it challenged Sabraw’s standing order that requires DHS to notify the ACLU within 24 hours if it detains anyone covered by the settlement agreement, and to provide a list of those already in ICE custody or required to check in with the agency. The DOJ told Sabraw that following the orders would be too “operationally challenging,” and in early September, it appealed them in the 9th Circuit. The case is not scheduled to be heard until December.

Meanwhile, the ACLU remains in the dark about how many Ms. L. families are at risk of being swept up by immigration enforcement.

“Everyone’s entitled to notice and everyone’s entitled to good faith in the exercise of their contractual rights,” Sabraw told DOJ lawyers during a July 17 hearing. “The fear, of course, is that the government is detaining and removing people, and to the extent they fall within the corners of the settlement agreement, it seems to me it would have an obligation, no matter how burdensome, to get it right.”

The DOJ also recently opened an entirely new objection to the settlement agreement, arguing that noncitizens applying for legal status — including Ms. L. families — should pay hundreds of dollars in fees per person and be required to reapply annually, as laid out in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed in July. Under the settlement agreement, applying should be free and status should last for three years at a time, according to an ACLU court filing.

In declarations filed with the court, legal services providers wrote that nearly 30 people protected by the settlement agreement have already been denied work authorization renewals over the fees, even though Sabraw has not yet ruled on whether they should have to pay. According to one example in the ACLU’s court filings, a family of 10 could not come up with the $2,475 to renew their papers. Several of them have lost their jobs because their work authorization expired during the lapse in legal services.

If the chaos continues, Van Hofwegen said, the added burden of renewing status more often will also tax legal-services providers, delay asylum applications and ultimately eat away at the support the settlement agreement is supposed to provide for separated families.

“It makes every piece of this legal process that’s supposed to exist for them harder and harder, with the goal of denying permanency in the U.S. to as many class members as possible,” she said.

Given the lapse in legal services, Sabraw recently extended deadlines for class members to apply for immigration documents and ordered the government to reinstate their legal status or work authorizations that expired during the stoppage.

But it’s unclear if the government has complied with that order, according to the filings. Attorneys advising class members say the administration has not responded to their requests for proof of the extension. Without official documents, the attorneys said, Ms. L. families can’t show they have a right to be in the country if they’re stopped by law enforcement.

Even if the administration eventually complies with the court’s orders, say advocates, formerly separated families can only be protected by the settlement agreement if the government is willing to honor it.

“All the work the court did and all the work the parties did over two years to reach this settlement is in real jeopardy,” Gelernt told the court during one of many hearings this summer. “We cannot leave these families drifting.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee3c40e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3424x1798+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F12%2Ff500597340eb80a63595596623ef%2Fap19050734920276.jpg,N,,2025-10-22 00:17:02.857270

Totaling $10 billion, and created to help “safeguard” the border, the funds received scant attention when Republicans in Congress adopted the mammoth law this summer. But the money has since taken on greater significance, as one of the obscure accounts that have enabled the White House to manage the fallout from the government shutdown.

Three weeks into the fiscal stalemate, the Trump administration has taken a series of unorthodox steps to reprogram billions of dollars in enacted spending, marking an escalation in its campaign to wrest control of the budget away from Congress.

The moves, which are highly unusual during a shutdown, have allowed the president to pay military service members, immigration agents and other federal law enforcement officials, even though lawmakers have not approved new money for their wages.

Normally, federal workers do not receive income until the shutdown concludes, creating hardship for millions of troops and civil servants, who are either furloughed or forced to keep working without pay. But the White House has stretched its authority in recent days to assist certain employees who are seen as central to Mr. Trump’s political agenda, including those who conduct deportations.

Using a set of funds in the president’s tax law, the Trump administration has promised pay to thousands of ICE agents and other law enforcement officials, who otherwise would not have received checks while the government is closed. And for the troops, Mr. Trump has turned to a special set of funds meant to develop weaponry, while ordering the Pentagon to explore other sources to pay the military throughout the shutdown.

Video by local news outlets showed masked agents on foot and cuffing people in the afternoon along Canal Street, a popular tourist hub in the Chinatown neighborhood. It's unclear how many people were taken into custody.

Protests ensued in the area. Traffic halted as agents took people into custody while bystanders recorded events on their phones.

Video obtained by USA TODAY showed an armored Department of Homeland Security vehicle driving down Lafayette Street, from the direction of Canal, toward a Manhattan federal building, which houses immigration court and an Immigration and Customs Enforcement holding area. Protesters are seen screaming at marching agents as they shove people out of the way to make way for the vehicle.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies conducted a “targeted, intelligence-driven operation on Canal Street” that “focused on criminal activity relating to selling counterfeit goods.”

Canal Street is a common area where people sell clothing, accessories and food on heavily congested sidewalks.

Agencies also included FBI, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, IRS Criminal Investigations and Customs and Border Protection, she said.

“During this law enforcement operation, rioters who were shouting obscenities, became violent and obstructed law enforcement duties including blocking vehicles and assaulting law enforcement,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

At least one person was arrested on suspicion of assaulting a federal officer, she said, adding more details would soon be available on people arrested.

Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, said he saw agents initially detaining African vendors on the street and putting them in unmarked vehicles. Agents refused to answer questions about who was being taken into custody, or whether agents had judicial warrants to arrest them, Awawdeh said.

Then, as advocates and bystanders began gathering, dozens of agents swarmed the area along with the military vehicle, he said. Agents used batons and mace on demonstrators.

“If they're trying to give us a warning shot, New Yorkers are ready to fight for one another, and peacefully fight for one another,” Awawdeh told USA TODAY in a phone call from the scene. “We're going to fight for our democracy, because that's what this is coming down to.”

New York City police said on social media it had no involvement in the federal operation. Mayor Eric Adams said New York City doesn’t cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportations, in accordance with local laws, which are commonly called sanctuary policies.

“Our administration has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue their American Dreams should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals,” he said on social media.

In January, ICE conducted highly publicized raids in New York City. Agents have also detained people attending immigration court hearings or ICE check-ins in lower Manhattan.

On social media, Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat, said President Donald Trump claims he was ""targeting the worst of the worst.""

Godoy tells FOX 13 Seattle federal agents gained access to local data through three different ways: Directly, by a department sharing access to federal agencies.
And indirectly, by a member of law enforcement doing searches for federal agencies.
Local public safety agencies collaborate with federal agencies on a wide variety of serious crimes, including human and narcotics trafficking and multi-jurisdictional cases.
If agencies choose to collaborate with federal agencies, that is wholly up to them.","A new University of Washington report released Tuesday shows federal agencies are accessing local police department cameras, and at least two local departments say they were unaware it was happening.

The report was released by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights. It states that U.S. Border Patrol had unauthorized direct or indirect access to traffic cameras that capture drivers’ information throughout cities.

What they're saying:

""It should be a wakeup call for all us as Washingtonians about the vulnerability of the technology that is being used to scoop up our data,"" said Angelina Godoy director of the UW Center for Human Rights.

Law enforcement says the cameras, which are through the company Flock Safety, have led to numerous arrests of violent suspects and the recovery of stolen cars.

They are installed throughout cities and read license plates as cars drive by. The report from UW shows federal agencies could also access many of the local department’s cameras.

Local perspective:

""It’s very clear both on the immigrants’ rights front and the access to reproductive healthcare front, that Washington stands firmly in favor of peoples’ rights and yet, for Washingtonians’ data to be leaked to entities that don’t share those values is worrisome,"" said Godoy.

Godoy tells FOX 13 Seattle federal agents gained access to local data through three different ways:

Directly, by a department sharing access to federal agencies.

Through backdoor access to the networks of at least 10 Washington police departments who did not authorize the border patrol searches.

And indirectly, by a member of law enforcement doing searches for federal agencies. For example, the report says the Yakima County Sheriff's office made two searches with the reason listed as ""ice"".

The Response:

""We immediately paused all access to any outside agencies while we make sure we can determine where we can put guard rails in place with Flock and with all of our detectives and investigators to make sure this doesn’t happen again,"" said Deputy Chief Ryan Rutledge with the Renton Police Department.

Rutledge tells FOX 13 Seattle the Renton Police Department had no idea its cameras were vulnerable to unauthorized federal access.

Renton is now requiring any outside agency, including other local police departments, to submit a specific request to them to access their data.

The Auburn Police Department released a similar statement saying they are working to make changes.

Big picture view:

""It’s deeply revealing if their answer is, ‘we had no idea that our tools were being used in that way.’ Well, if you have the tool, you have the responsibility to ensure you are using it responsibly, ethically, and in compliance within state law,"" said Godoy.

In regard to the report, Governor Bob Ferguson told FOX 13 Seattle, ""My team is following up with the Office of the Attorney General on the assertions made in the report, and working to ensure local jurisdictions are complying with the bipartisan Keep Washington Working Act.""

Flock Safety releases a statement in response to UW's report

The company behind the cameras, Flock Safety, provided this statement to FOX 13 Seattle:

We appreciate and value the attention that privacy advocates pay to Flock. Unfortunately, these activists published a report that is full of inaccuracies and misconceptions about our technologies and their use that we’d have been happy to clear up, had they reached out to us prior to publication.

Most importantly, there is no ""back door"" into Flock. Every Flock customer has complete control over their sharing relationships, and Flock never shares customer data without authorization. Much of this report consists of old claims and allegations that have been addressed and, in some cases, that have led to improvements in our products.

Local public safety agencies collaborate with federal agencies on a wide variety of serious crimes, including human and narcotics trafficking and multi-jurisdictional cases. If agencies choose to collaborate with federal agencies, that is wholly up to them. Flock never enrolls agencies in automatic data sharing, and sharing relationships can be revoked at any time.

We are extremely proud of the positive, community-enhancing impacts our products have had across Washington and the nation. From helping locate vehicles wanted in hit-and-runs, to identifying homicide suspects, and bringing justice to victims of kidnapping and abuse, Flock technology is making communities across Washington safer today. Activist detractors downplay and even ignore those positive impacts and outcomes; the communities that we help make safer do not.

Lawsuit Challenges FMCSA Emergency Rule

On Monday, October 20, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit against USDOT’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) over a rule increasing federal oversight of how states issue CDLs and CLPs to persons who are not from the United States.

The suit, titled Rivera Lujan v. FMSCA, was filed by the Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and drivers Jorge Rivera Lujan and Aleksei Semenovskii.

On September 29, 2025, the FMCSA issued an emergency interim final rule (IFR) to ensure that “non-citizens will not be eligible for a non-domiciled CDL unless they meet a much stricter set of rules, including an employment-based visa and undergoing a mandatory federal immigration status check using the SAVE system.”

The IFR “threatens the livelihoods of nearly 200,000 people” including asylum seekers, refugees, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients who have work authorization, according to an AFT news release announcing the lawsuit.

The lawsuit alleges that the actions taken against non-domiciled CDL and CLP holders by the IFR are illegal and that FMCSA failed to follow proper rulemaking procedures by issuing the IFR without notice or public comment period.

One of the plaintiffs, Rivera Lujan, is described in the news release as a DACA recipient and truck driver of 11 years who owns his own trucking company. He was reportedly denied a renewal of his CDL on September 30 due to the rule change, which went into effect immediately upon publication on September 29.

“Without a commercial driver’s license, I will lose my business and the income that allows me to provide for my family,” said Rivera Lujan. “I have followed all the rules and complied with all requirements set by the government.”

“This unlawful rule seems intended to put people authorized to work in the United States out of work, solely because of the prejudices of the Trump administration,” said Wendy Liu, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group. “We are asking the court to promptly invalidate the rule to prevent devastating consequences for our clients and the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who depend on commercial driver’s licenses for their livelihoods.”

“For the Trump administration, the cruelty is the point,” said AFT President Randi Weingarten. “This is a spiteful and illegal rule issued with no justification except to hurt hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants with work authorization who only want to build a better life for themselves and their families.

Jamie Raskin in demanding answers from top homeland security officials on the report.

Jayapal and Raskin (D-Md.) noted that they previously wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Director Todd Lyons in February, just weeks into President Donald Trump's second term, when the detention of US citizens ensnared in Trump's mass deportation operation was already raising alarm.

At that point, NBC News had reported on the detentions of US citizens including Native tribe members, which raised concerns about racial profiling—but in their Monday letter to Noem and Lyons, Jayapal and Raskin said the response they got in February was ""flippant and unserious,"" with the officials simply reiterating existing policies that prohibit ICE from detaining US citizens—""without providing any assurance"" that agents were ""actually following that policy.""

""This administration cannot hide behind a broad policy statement, as it continues to unlawfully detain US citizens as part of indiscriminate immigration raids,"" wrote Jayapal and Raskin.

The lawmakers emphasized that numerous arrests of US citizens by ICE and other immigration agents have been violent.

Raskin and Jayapal drew attention to four specific cases, including those of:

Rodrick Johnson, a 67-year-old man who was dragged out of his apartment in Chicago by immigration agents who zip-tied him after breaking down his door as part of a raid on his building, and then left tied up outside the building for nearly three hours;

George Retes, who was pepper-sprayed and detained for three days in a raid on a farm where he worked, with agents refusing to look at his ID and then denying him his right to see an attorney or make a phone call;

Julio Noriega, a 54-year-old man who was handcuffed by ICE officers and loaded into a van while he was handing out copies of his resume to businesses in Berwyn, Illinois; and

Leonardo Garcia Venegas, who was arrested twice during worksite raids in Alabama, even after showing agents his REAL ID that proved his US citizenship.

Other cases not mentioned in the letter include those of Job Garcia, a photographer who was tackled and held on the ground by ICE agents during a raid at a Home Depot in Los Angeles and then detained for more than 24 hours, and Debbie Brockman, a news producer in Chicago who was handcuffed by agents who accused her of throwing an object at them, and then hauled into an unmarked vehicle that crashed into another car as it sped away—only to be released later that day with no charges.

Raskin and Jayapal accused Noem and Lyons of overseeing a ""lawless 'detain first, ask questions later' approach to immigration

enforcement"" that is ""terrorizing communities across the country.""

""Masked, armed agents are snatching people on the street and refusing to identify themselves,"" said the lawmakers. ""US citizens are now afraid to speak Spanish in public and are carrying their passports everywhere they go. This administration’s failure to investigate or even acknowledge that these indiscriminate immigration raids are canceling the rights of US citizens is dangerous.""

Jayapal and Raskin demanded that Noem and Lyons provide an accounting of all the US citizens who have been detained with their identities, the length of time they were held, and their criminal records if they had any—which, according to an analysis by the CATO Institute in June, a majority of people arrested by ICE this year have not.

""We once again demand that you immediately provide a full accounting of all cases in which US citizens have been detained since January 20, 2025,"" said the Democrats, ""and explain any concrete steps your agencies are implementing to prevent such abuses from continuing.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61784213&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C470%2C0%2C470,N,,2025-10-21 21:00:33.764924

(AP) — A federal judge overseeing the Trump administration's prosecution of U.S. Rep. LaMonica McIver on charges she assaulted and impeded immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center told the government to remove social media posts he called “prejudicial” to the congresswoman.

U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper on Tuesday heard pretrial arguments in the case brought by Republican President Donald Trump's U.S. Justice Department against the Democratic congresswoman representing Newark, the state's biggest city. Semper didn't issue a ruling from the bench but told the government's attorneys nine social media posts should be removed.

The posts, which came from the Department of Homeland Security's X account as well as the account for one of its spokespeople, referred to the May 9 visit by McIver and other members of Congress as “a reckless stunt by sanctuary politicians” and said the visit was not about oversight, a key point from the congresswoman and the other lawmakers who accompanied her to Newark's Delaney Hall Detention Facility in May.

“It's not factual,” Semper said. “The prejudicial nature of it is self-evident.”

A message seeking a response from Homeland Security was sent Tuesday.

McIver's attorneys have argued the department's posts could imperil her chances for a fair trial.

The judge also told the government to turn over additional video footage to McIver after her attorneys told the court they had not received footage they knew existed but wasn't turned over.

He also said he would take time to review a motion from McIver's attorneys to dismiss the case against her based on her right as a member of Congress to conduct oversight of the federal government.

McIver, a Democrat, was charged by interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, following the May 9 visit to Delaney Hall. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses the privately owned, 1,000-bed facility as a detention center.

She has pleaded not guilty.

“This process has not stopped me from doing my job,” McIver said outside the courthouse on Tuesday.

She was indicted in June on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison.

Among those at McIver’s side Tuesday in court were Democratic Representatives Bonnie Watson Coleman, Rob Menendez and Nellie Pou, along with Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.

Baraka was arrested on a trespassing charge that was later dropped and is suing Habba over what he called a malicious prosecution.

Habba's tenure as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey is being challenged in court, with appellate judges having heard arguments in that case the day before McIver's appearance in court.

A nearly two-minute video clip released by the Department of Homeland Security shows McIver at the facility inside a chain-link fence just before Baraka’s arrest on the other side of the barrier, where other people were protesting. McIver and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor.

The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word “Police.”

It is not clear from police bodycam video if the contact was intentional, incidental or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene.

The government's complaint alleges that she “slammed” her forearm into an agent and then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him.

The indictment also says she placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest and says again that she slammed her forearm into and grabbed an agent.

Watson Coleman and Menendez were with McIver at the detention center that day and have disputed the charges.

Members of Congress are legally authorized to go into federal immigration facilities as part of their oversight powers, even without notice. Congress passed a 2019 appropriations bill spelling out that authority.

McIver first came to Congress in September in a special election after the death of Rep. Donald Payne Jr. left a vacancy in the 10th District. She was then elected to a full term in November.

Vizguerra has been in detention at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora since mid-March after being arrested outside of her workplace. The Denver activist and immigrant-rights advocate alleges she was targeted based on her protected free speech and that her deportation order from 2013 is not valid.

She has a pending habeas corpus case in federal court in Denver, which she asks to set her free or grant her a bond hearing while litigation related to her immigration status plays out.

In September, her lawyers filed an amended petition saying her six-month detention is unconstitutional. They argued that many judges rely on six factors when considering a noncitizen’s detention without a bond hearing, known as the Singh factors, after a 2019 immigration case. Those factors include the length of detention, the likely duration of future detention, the conditions of detention, delays by the detainee and by the government, and the likelihood of a final order of removal.

Federal lawyers say applying those standards would be irrelevant because they should only be considered in cases when a person is detained during removal proceedings, versus when a person is detained with a final order of removal.

“If noncitizens detained (with a final order of removal) can simply invoke the Singh factors after six months of detention, it would render the Supreme Court’s decision in Zadvydas a dead letter,” the filing reads.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — President Donald Trump keeps threatening to send National Guard troops to San Francisco next, blasting the California city as crime-ridden and saying its residents are clamoring for federal help.

But local and state leaders say that couldn’t be farther from the truth, noting overall crime is down and the city has started to turn around its downtrodden pandemic image. Residents and workers out downtown this week said they’re puzzled and concerned by Trump’s threat.

“This is a safe American city,” Mayor Daniel Lurie told The Associated Press last week. “We got this in San Francisco.”

The Republican president has referenced crime as his justification for possibly sending troops to the city of roughly 830,000. He’s deployed the Guard over crime concerns to Washington, D.C., where he has direct control of the National Guard, and Memphis, where the Republican governor supports their presence. Los Angeles was the first city where Trump deployed the Guard, arguing it was necessary to protect federal buildings and agents as protesters fought back against mass immigration arrests. He’s since said they’re needed in Chicago and Portland, Oregon, as well.

Residents and leaders in Portland were surprised by Trump’s attention when he described the city as besieged by violent protests. In reality, nightly protests were small and limited to the area outside a federal immigration building. While there were some arrests for violence, the demonstrations were far less intense than those that roiled the downtown in 2020 following the death of George Floyd.

In San Francisco, too, Trump seems to be relying on an outdated picture of a city often targeted by conservatives.

“The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco,” Trump said Sunday on Fox News. “San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world. And then, 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.”

His comments angered and baffled Kate Freudenberger, who works in retail.

“You’ve been walking around the city, it’s peaceful, there is no insurrection,” she said Tuesday morning, adding that immigration authorities have not been as active in San Francisco as in other cities, “so there’s really been nothing for us to coalesce around.”

Marc Benioff, the chief executive of San Francisco-based software giant Salesforce, caused a stir when he told the New York Times earlier this month that he’d welcome Guard troops to help quell crime ahead of his major annual business conference. He has since apologized for his remarks, saying the conference was the “largest and safest” in its history and the Guard is not needed.

The city emerges from struggles

San Francisco is still recovering from the coronavirus pandemic, which emptied its downtown and brought renewed attention to street homelessness and open drug dealing. But signs indicate a city on the upswing. Artificial intelligence startups are snapping up office space, and home rental prices are rising. San Francisco saw a 21% increase from last year in office visits, according to location analytics platform Placer.ai, and public transit ridership is at its highest levels since the pandemic.

The Wall Street Journal this week declared the city was emerging from its “doom loop,” an article the mayor eagerly shared on social media.

Sidewalks are cleaner and tent encampments have largely disappeared from view. In the Tenderloin, one of the most troubled neighborhoods, teams of city and nonprofit workers on Monday helped school children cross the street, walked around picking up trash or counseled homeless people. It was a different image than during the pandemic, when hundreds of people camped on sidewalks.

Still, the Tenderloin is a problem spot for public drug use and dealing, as are the Mid-Market and Mission neighborhoods. But overall crime is down more than 26% this year compared to the same period last year, according to the San Francisco Police Department. Vehicle break-ins — which have vexed tourists and residents alike — are at a 22-year low, Lurie said.

Lurie, a centrist Democrat who has tried to avoid confrontations with Trump by ignoring many of the president’s comments, said Monday he’d welcome more federal help to arrest drug dealers and disrupt drug markets. But sending in the Guard wouldn’t achieve that, he said.

“The National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers—and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,” Lurie said in a statement.

San Francisco voters in 2024 gave police the authority to use drones, surveillance cameras and other technology to fight crime. They also ousted politically progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin in a 2022 recall election and installed Brooke Jenkins, considered to be much tougher on crime than her predecessor. Lurie has pushed to hire and retain police officers, and entry-level police applications are up 40% over last year.

California leaders pledge to fight back

Meanwhile, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration has said it would push back forcefully on any deployment, as it did when Trump first ordered the California National Guard into Los Angeles against Newsom’s wishes. California Attorney General Rob Bonta vowed to “be in court within hours, if not minutes” if there is a federal deployment.

Lawsuits by Democratic officials in Chicago and Portland have so far blocked troops from going out on city streets.

Libby Baxter, a retired nurse, said Trump has sent the National Guard to Democratic cities to create “chaos and unrest” and she fears the same could happen in San Francisco.

“I believe that that may happen if they come to San Francisco because we are a very tolerant community, but we don’t do well with somebody coming in and trying to dictate or take over certain parts of our city,” she said.",https://www.thereporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Federal_Enforcement_San_Francisco_32147.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-10-22 12:58:19.430679

The case has become a rallying point for advocates concerned with immigrant rights, campus free speech and unchecked executive power.","From Philly and the Pa. suburbs to South Jersey and Delaware, what would you like WHYY News to cover? Let us know!

The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments in the high-profile case of Khalil v. Trump, a constitutional and immigration battle with far-reaching implications for free speech, executive power and the limits of federal immigration authority.

At the center of the case is Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and recent Columbia University graduate who was detained by immigration agents in March after helping organize pro-Palestine protests on campus.

After the hearing Tuesday, Khalil addressed supporters and media, expressing optimism despite the fact he continues to face deportation. He said the lawyers for the Trump administration were “defending the indefensible.”

“They’re trying to stop the federal court from looking at my case because they know they don’t have a case against me,” he said. “So we’ll keep fighting the legal fight until the end, and we are pretty confident that we’ll prevail at the end.”

His attorneys describe Khalil’s arrest as a politically motivated act of retaliation. A vocal leader during campus protests in spring 2024, Khalil was detained without warning, separated from his pregnant wife and flown to a remote facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he was held for 104 days.

The fight over jurisdiction

Shortly after his detention, Khalil’s legal team filed a habeas petition in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, based on the fact he lived in the district and was arrested there. The government responded the case should be heard in Louisiana, where he was ultimately being detained.

In the end, the petition was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey once it was confirmed that Khalil was held there before being moved to Louisiana.

At the center of the case is a clause in the Immigration and Nationality Act known as the “foreign policy ground,” which allows the secretary of state — currently Marco Rubio — to unilaterally declare that a noncitizen’s speech poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy. The Trump administration claims that justifies Khalil’s arrest and attempted deportation.

In June, however, U.S. District Judge Michael E. Farbiarz ruled otherwise, calling the move likely unconstitutional. He granted Khalil bail and barred the government from using the foreign policy justification to detain or remove him.

The administration appealed to the 3rd Circuit of Appeals, which hears cases originating in New Jersey, arguing that Fabiarz never had legal authority to hear Khalil’s case because Khalil was no longer in the state. At Tuesday’s hearing, Deputy U.S. Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign opened by challenging the judges’ jurisdiction.

“The District of New Jersey did not validly acquire jurisdiction,” Ensign told the panel, arguing that the petition should have been filed where Khalil was held in Louisiana. He called the entire process “improper” and said the bail order and injunction were legally defective.

The judges appeared skeptical, noting Khalil had a right to challenge his detention and that was made difficult by the fact the government misled his attorneys about where Khalil was being held.

“The district court there found that counsel for the government persistently and repeatedly misrepresented where Mr. Khalil was when he was in New Jersey and told his attorneys and his family that he was in New York,” Judge Arianna Freeman said to Ensign. “He was given misinformation and his attorneys followed that information to file in New York.”

First Amendment or foreign policy?

Khalil’s case has galvanized a broad coalition of civil liberties advocates who warn that the Trump administration is trying to rewrite the rules of free expression — starting with immigrants. His attorneys say this is part of a broader pattern of retaliatory prosecution. A related case in Boston uncovered internal Department of Homeland Security documents that flagged student activists for surveillance based on Palestine-related speech.

Brett Max Kaufman, senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said the government’s use of immigration law to silence protected political speech sets a dangerous precedent.

“People in our government didn’t like the protected pro-Palestine speech of a lawful permanent resident,” Kaufman told the court. “So they detained him, sent him far away to Louisiana and began efforts to remove him from the country — while proudly warning others that they might be next.”

Bobby Hodgson, assistant legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, added that the facts of the case well demonstrate that it does not fall within the scope of the secretary of state’s power on a foreign policy grounds, which was not written to allow the government to suppress a viewpoint.

“I think that is the quintessential case where the right is the strongest and the protections are the strongest, and also where the government has the lowest interest in imposing its power in a viewpoint discriminatory way,” Hodgson said. “So when you balance those factors, I think everything weighs in favor of a First Amendment.”

What’s next?

Even after the injunction, the Trump administration has continued trying to remove Khalil through other means. After the “foreign policy” basis was blocked, the government introduced new allegations — claiming Khalil misrepresented facts in his green card application. His lawyers call the new charges “post hoc and pretextual,” and part of the same retaliatory campaign.

An immigration judge ruled against Khalil on these new grounds but his team appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals.

“Those charges are baseless and obviously as part and parcel of the broader project of retaliation,” said Baher Azmy, legal director at the Center of Constitutional Rights, who also worked on Khalil’s case. It all “stems from the same sort of rotten root, their desire to punish him for speaking out on behalf of Palestinian human rights,” he added.

The case has become a rallying point for advocates concerned with immigrant rights, campus free speech and unchecked executive power.

“The implications are much broader and they’re broader than people who are speaking up for Palestinian human rights,” said Ramzi Kassem, founder and co-director of Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility. “It’s a template that can be mobilized against any issue set that this administration disagrees with, whether it’s reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights or racial justice, this model could be applied to those issues.”",https://whyy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mahmoud-khalil-philadelphia-federal-courthouse-el-102125-04.jpeg,N,,2025-10-21 19:16:58.591941

Zadvydas v. Davis created a standard that certain lengthy detentions of detained immigrants satisfies “due process so long as there is a ‘significant likelihood of removal in the reasonably foreseeable future,’” government lawyers wrote.

“There is a significant likelihood of her removal in the reasonably foreseeable future. The absence of a specific date when the proceedings will end does not show, for this purpose, that the proceedings are indefinite,” the filing reads.

Vizguerra’s lawyers argue that the Zadvydas decision shows that after six months, the government takes on the burden of justifying continued detention.

The case continues as the Trump administration ramps up mass deportation efforts. According to an NBC News analysis, about 60,000 immigrants without permanent legal status were detained as of Sept. 25, with only about 30% of those with criminal convictions.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dsc_0484-1024x6831753106890-1.jpeg,N,,2025-10-21 19:17:11.037351

The Trump administration’s persistent effort to add immigration strings to FEMA funding feels like a “poison pill” move, especially since Trump has openly discussed shifting responsibility for disaster aid to the states.
One simple step would be to streamline the Stafford Act to remove vagueness that allows presidents to decline disaster aid on a whim.","The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) continues to attach conditions to federal disaster assistance grants that require recipients to comply with federal immigration law, hampering the ability of states and localities to prepare for disasters.

In January, Trump issued Executive Order 14159 calling for DHS to “undertake any lawful actions to ensure that so-called ‘sanctuary’ jurisdictions, which seek to interfere with the lawful exercise of Federal law enforcement operations, do not receive access to Federal funds.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem issued a memorandum in February, directing sub-agencies such as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to scrutinize all federal financial assistance awards. The purpose was to identify funds allocated to sanctuary jurisdictions and to report on compliance within 30 days. By March, FEMA had added language to its grants requiring state and local recipients to confirm they’d help enforce federal immigration law or risk losing all federal funds administered by DHS.

The language contains six specific criteria.

Grant recipients must share information with DHS on the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of individuals.

Recipients cannot encourage or induce noncitizens to enter the country illegally.

Recipients must “honor requests for cooperation, such as participation in joint operations, sharing of information, or requests for short-term detention” of immigrants.

Recipients must provide federal immigration agents “access to detainees” in correctional facilities.

Recipients must not “leak or otherwise publicize the existence of” any federal immigration enforcement operations.

Both grant recipients and subgrant recipients, including aid organizations, are required to follow the criteria.

Finally, recipients are required to certify that none of the programs operated using federal funding can benefit illegal immigrants.

In May, 20 states and the District of Columbia, which have collectively received more than $23 billion in disaster aid since 2017, filed a lawsuit alleging DHS had no authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funds. The plaintiffs also claimed the action violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which dictates federal agencies’ regulatory processes. By September, US District Court Judge William Smith ruled that the conditions FEMA imposed on funding were “arbitrary and capricious.” He further stated that DHS failed to provide genuine, fact-based justifications for implementing broad immigration conditions across all grants. Judge Smith also pointed out that DHS didn’t follow internal advice, overlooked how states would be affected, ignored public safety, and failed to consider alternative approaches, such as pausing targeted grants.

Despite Smith’s injunction, states are arguing that the language has not been removed from the grants. DHS is claiming that the language remains as a trigger clause in the event of the injunction being “stayed, vacated, or extinguished.” Meanwhile, the general hurdles the Trump administration has placed on aid are having real-life consequences for communities across the US facing disaster. These actions, which include the elimination of programs designed to fund mitigation projects, are leaving states and localities less prepared for when disaster inevitably strikes.

The Trump administration’s persistent effort to add immigration strings to FEMA funding feels like a “poison pill” move, especially since Trump has openly discussed shifting responsibility for disaster aid to the states. It’s as if they’re actively discouraging states from accepting the funds. The problem with this approach is that it disregards the separation of powers; funds allocated by democratically elected representatives should be distributed to their constituents without additional, arbitrary, and politically motivated conditions. DHS’s efforts undermine national disaster preparedness and response efforts, leaving vulnerable populations at greater risk. For now, only the judiciary branch is standing up for the American people. It’s about time Congress started doing that as well. One simple step would be to streamline the Stafford Act to remove vagueness that allows presidents to decline disaster aid on a whim. Congress also must assert its authority over government spending by censuring the president, challenging the executive branch’s overreach.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ETH_Fema_Funds.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:57:07.434749

NewsNation correspondent Jessica Kartalija was on the ground in Lower Manhattan as multiple protesters were arrested. It is unclear if any persons suspected of illegally residing in the United States were detained.

According to NewsNation local affiliate WPIX, ICE operations ostensibly began near Canal Street between Church and Broadway.

An impromptu protest occurred as ICE officers attempted to make arrests on Canal Street, where migrants suspected of entering the country illegally often sell fake luxury goods.

Tensions rose between the protesters and ICE officers on Lafayette and Canal Street, with multiple people arrested, including one masked protester who was seen pushing federal officers.

“It’s hard to believe that this is Manhattan, and it’s 2025, and it looks like a war zone out here. People are masked up. They’re not showing their faces. … It’s just so incredibly divisive. And regardless of what your view is, it’s a difficult situation,” Kartalija said on “NewsNation Now” at the height of the clashes.

Two protesters threw themselves in front of oncoming vehicles, with one of them, a male, taken into custody. ICE officers used zip ties as a means of detaining individuals.

A female witness told NewsNation other protesters were being arrested for “simply standing and using their First Amendment right to protest.”

Some protesters were shouting “shame on you” even after ICE agents left the scene. New York police were the remaining authorities on the scene, who were being yelled at following ICE’s departure from the area.

“People are angry with us for covering this; there’s just a lot of anger overall,” Kartalija said. “They’re just so angry.

Dozens of agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) were seen wearing marked vests near the intersection of Canal and Broadway, detaining several people late Monday afternoon and loading them into unmarked vans waiting nearby.

The senior law enforcement official said ICE and HSI were looking for undocumented individuals who may have been engaged in illegally selling items on the street. Sidewalk vendors are a common sight throughout the city and have been so for decades, especially in the area of Canal Street.

Federal agents were seen taking five or six people into custody, though an official number of those detained was not immediately known. Two people who were initially seen being detained were later released; both of the men told NBC New York that they are American citizens.

Witnesses who watched the operation unfold on the street could be heard yelling at agents as they took people away.

In addition to ICE and HSI agents, there were also law enforcement officers present wearing vests that read DEA and FBI. A spokesperson for the FBI confirmed its special agents were embedded with teams from Homeland Security conducting these kinds operations not just in New York City, but around the country.

New Yorkers pulled out their cellphones and began recording the ICE operation. Some onlookers shouted at the agents, calling the arrests “disgusting” and demanding they stop as they tackled one individual to the ground.

One person told the agents, “Does that feel good? I bet your mom and dad are so proud of you….You should be ashamed of yourself.”

ICE’s Chinatown raid turns chaotic

When the agents went to arrest a vendor, who appeared to be African, members of the crowd became incensed. Some became enraged to the point of yelling in ICE agents’ faces, comparing them to Nazis and calling them fascists.

As ICE agents went to their vehicles, New Yorkers ran into the streets. The agents then began pushing people and tackling some to the ground. That led to more enraged bystanders joining the mob and lashing out at the ICE agents.

The feds then pulled out batons and riot shields in an effort to get the crowd under control, striking some in the process.

The crowd followed ICE agents retreated back to 26 Federal Plaza, the site of many immigrant detentions in recent months, shouting “ICE out of New York.” The crowd was then met by more federal agents — some of whom were equipped with machine guns and looking ready for combat.

As the agents entered Federal Plaza, the NYPD arrived on the scene in riot gear to halt the advancing crowd. As of 5:20 p.m., many crowd members remained outside Federal Plaza.

“This doesn’t make anyone safer,” Murad Awawdeh, president and CEO of the New York Immigration Coalition, told amNewYork. “It actually makes everyone a lot more unsafe when people don’t feel like they can go to the police or to law enforcement with their issues.”

Awawdeh said his organization is verifying the number of people detained and offering legal assistance to those affected. He criticized the operation as politically motivated and influenced by online calls from right-wing influencers urging ICE to act.

The operation came two days after Turning Point USA contributor Savannah Hernandez posted a video on X, formerly Twitter, urging ICE to “check out” the corner of Broadway and Canal Street.

In her post, which had more than 4.3 million views as of Tuesday, Hernandez claimed that “20 to 30 illegal immigrants” from Senegal were “operating a black market” and selling goods without licenses.

Council Member Christopher Marte, who represents the area, condemned the operation as “a horrifying display of federal overreach.”

“ICE has no place in New York City, especially not in the heart of Chinatown, terrorizing our immigrant neighbors with military vehicles and masked agents,” Marte said in a statement. “This kind of escalation is unnecessary, unacceptable, and antithetical to our city’s values as a sanctuary for all people.”

Marte said the challenges around street vending on Canal Street “are real and must be addressed,” but added that “federal agents storming our streets and targeting community members is not the solution.”

He criticized Mayor Eric Adams for “collaborating with federal immigration authorities” and deploying the NYPD’s Strategic Response Group alongside ICE agents, calling it “a clear violation of New York City’s sanctuary city laws.”

“Our communities deserve safety, dignity, and accountability, not fear, raids, and collaboration with agencies that have no place in our city,” Marte said.

An NYPD spokesperson told amNewYork that the department had no role in the federal operation carried out by ICE, and that officers were instead deployed to 26 Federal Plaza to monitor demonstrations and “keep the peace.”

The spokesperson said the deployment was similar to prior protest responses and emphasized that it was intended to allow people to exercise their First Amendment rights while ensuring public safety and protecting property.

Federal officials did not immediately comment on the incident.

City Hall spokesperson Kayla Mamelak said the Adams administration was aware of the federal law enforcement action on Canal Street, and was “gathering more details,” but that the NYPD had no role in the raid.

“We never cooperate with federal law enforcement on civil deportation matters, in accordance with local laws, and have no involvement in this matter,” Mamelak said. “Mayor Adams has been clear that undocumented New Yorkers trying to pursue the American Dream should not be the target of law enforcement, and resources should instead be focused on violent criminals.”

A City Hall official said senior administration staff were on the ground monitoring protests at 26 Federal Plaza and that the NYPD had the situation under control. The official added that if circumstances escalate and someone interferes with a lawful enforcement action, Mayor Adams has instructed the NYPD to intervene.

But divergences between Miller, Grenell and Rubio were visible earlier in the Trump administration.
“Right now, Venezuela is not being treated as a foreign policy issue,” said Carrie Filipetti, who led Venezuela policy at the State Department under the first Trump administration.
Advocates for regime change in Venezuela have praised the strikes, which are seen as adding political pressure to Maduro and the elites that support his rule.
Asked about efforts by Maduro to negotiate with the White House on Friday, Trump expressed contempt towards the Venezuelan leader.","The seven U.S. military strikes in the international waters off Venezuela, which have killed dozens of people the U.S. accuses of participating in drug trafficking, represent the most provocative shows of force against the Maduro government to date.

“There was the conventional wisdom early in the administration that Marco Rubio was marginalized and that the State Department might not be in the driver’s seat. And that’s clearly not the case with regard to Venezuela policy,” said Benjamin Gedan, who worked on South America policy on the Obama administration National Security Council. “It’s been really surprising to see an increase in tensions with Venezuela and it’s really hard to explain that other than the influence of Marco Rubio.”

Miller and Rubio are now moving in lockstep on Venezuela, the three people said. They’re both “on the same page” about the U.S. government approaching the South American petrostate as akin to a transnational criminal group, said another one of the people familiar with discussions.

Together, they’ve managed to sideline a third group: those who want to preserve some access for oil majors to the petrostate’s vast energy reserves and generally normalize relations with Caracas. That group had pushed for diplomatic engagement with Caracas. Now many in that corner are resigned to the idea that Trump will hit Venezuela hard.

That leaves few voices in the administration who might argue against further escalation toward Venezuela in the coming months. The administration has already said it would consider striking cartels on Venezuelan soil, and Trump confirmed Thursday that he had authorized intelligence agencies to conduct covert operations in the country, ostensibly to further destabilize the Maduro regime.

One of the most high-profile members of the third camp is special envoy Richard Grenell, whom Trump told to halt diplomatic outreach to Caracas earlier this month.

“We seem to be at a point now where the misfit toys have been put in their place and the administration is moving full speed ahead,” the second person familiar with discussions said, listing Grenell and energy magnate Harry Sargeant III, who has connections with the Trump administration, as the misfit toys.

White House officials have repeatedly downplayed suggestions that much daylight has ever existed between the varying schools of thought within the administration and its orbit on Venezuela.

“With the support of his entire administration, President Trump is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said.

The White House maintains that it is Trump who is driving Venezuela policy, and none of the people POLITICO spoke to who were familiar with the discussions would go as far as to say that Rubio, who is also acting national security adviser, is the primary person setting the agenda. But certainly his philosophy is permeating policy decisions.

“We’d all like a magic wand when it comes to getting our way in foreign affairs; at this juncture, Marco Rubio may just have found his,” said former U.S. Ambassador to Panama John Feeley.

Grenell and Sargeant did not respond to requests for comment.

There’s long been consensus among the three camps that Maduro isn’t an easy counterpart for the U.S. to be dealing with. But divergences between Miller, Grenell and Rubio were visible earlier in the Trump administration. Grenell’s trip to Caracas in the early weeks of the administration — where he met with Maduro and secured the release of Americans in Venezuelan custody — elicited public expressions of displeasure from State Department officials at the time.

The split between Rubio and Miller has been less public. The first person familiar with the conversations in the administration over Venezuela emphasized that Miller “has always been consistent on security threats from the Maduro regime.” But Miller was seen as more supportive of Grenell’s early efforts, which led to the resumption of deportation flights from the U.S. to Venezuela.

Now the two men generally agree that treating Venezuela as a “criminal cartel structure” is the best course of action, even if it breaks the mold of how the United States has typically approached adversaries in Latin America, according to the second person familiar with the discussions.

“Right now, Venezuela is not being treated as a foreign policy issue,” said Carrie Filipetti, who led Venezuela policy at the State Department under the first Trump administration. “It’s being treated as a homeland security issue, and rightfully so.”

That has resulted in unified messaging from the White House — and the Venezuelan opposition — about how much of a threat Venezuela poses as a hub for global drug trafficking.

Asked about the administration’s Venezuela policy in an Oct. 5 Fox News interview, Rubio emphasized that the White House is taking action “against these traffickers of poison who are ultimately winding up in our streets, contributing to crime in our streets, not to mention the death of Americans.”

It’s unclear the extent to which Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is involved in strategy for Venezuela. A defense official said Hegseth and Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Dan Caine have been involved in the planning of the strike campaign. Hegseth, per another defense official, is very involved in the internal debates on the deployment and planning, and is pushing for tangible results, including strikes and metrics, to be shown quickly.

In previous administrations, and even in the first months of Trump’s second term, the U.S. approach to Venezuela often involved backchanneling with Caracas and cycles of imposing and removing sanctions as a lever for change.

There is practically no sympathy for Maduro within the administration’s ranks and there is a broad recognition that the current government in Caracas isn’t aligned with U.S. interests, according to the first person and another one of the people familiar with the discussions. Even so, those who are aligned on the current approach to Venezuela have different long-term goals.

Where Rubio and others want to see Venezuela move towards a democratic government, ideally led by an opposition movement friendly to Washington, other factions have been seen as far more agnostic about the ultimate shape of a Venezuelan state.

In the first months of Trump’s second term, the administration also oscillated between revoking and extending a Treasury Department license allowing Chevron to drill in Venezuela. Rubio and his allies on Capitol Hill — Florida Republican Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Giménez and Maria Elvira Salazar — used their influence to push for the license’s revocation, arguing the drilling revenue propped up Maduro. Others in the administration, including Miller and Grenell, were seen as less concerned about the need to cancel the license, especially given their desire to continue working with Venezuela on deportation flights.

The license was revoked in March, though Chevron was granted a new license in the summer, as tensions with Caracas were rising.

It’s unclear how long the unity between the camps will last. Advocates for regime change in Venezuela have praised the strikes, which are seen as adding political pressure to Maduro and the elites that support his rule.

The strikes also establish more deterrence against the drug traffickers Miller has focused on. Yet hawks outside the White House — including Salazar and Gimenez — have continued their calls for supporting a democratic transition in Venezuela and forcing Maduro to cede power to the opposition, which international observers say rightfully won last year’s presidential election.

Those calls intensified after Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

For now, there’s a clear focus in the administration on punishing Maduro and projecting U.S. strength. Asked about efforts by Maduro to negotiate with the White House on Friday, Trump expressed contempt towards the Venezuelan leader.

“He’s offered everything. You know why? He doesn’t want to fuck around with the United States,” Trump quipped.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F71%2F2e%2Ff3cdb25b40a4a3c7d710a4196a91%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2239438430,N,,2025-10-21 17:57:46.512257

“Over the weekend, ICE dismantled an illegal horse-racing, animal fighting, and a gambling enterprise operation …,” DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a written statement. “As part of the operation ICE law enforcement officers arrested 105 illegal aliens. Under President Trump and (Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem, we are dismantling criminal networks in the United States.”

After FBI raid in southwest Idaho, advocates denounce ‘military-style’ tactics and detaining kids

FBI spokesperson Sandra Yi Barker previously said ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations division helped “process individuals who were found to have potential immigration violations during the course of the investigation. Their presence was limited to that specific federal responsibility and was separate from the criminal gambling investigation being led by the FBI.”

Advocates who were at the scene of the raid have denounced aggressive tactics they say they saw used, including law enforcement detaining everyone at the venue, children being zip-tied, and people being struck with rubber bullets.

“The government came in full force, military-style, helicopters, drones and arrested and handcuffed, everyone … including children,” ACLU of Idaho Executive Director Leo Morales told reporters at a news conference Monday. “No person, no Idahoan, no American should ever accept whenever a government does this to its own people.”

The FBI canceled a press conference scheduled Monday, saying law enforcement officials didn’t have more information to share publicly beyond a criminal complaint filed in federal court. The document details the investigation, but does not specify law enforcement’s tactics during the raid.

In a press release issued Tuesday afternoon, the Idaho governor’s office said about 400 people were in attendance on Sunday and that none of the 105 people in ICE custody are children.

“Illegal gambling operations involving animals often accompany drug trafficking, animal abuse, illegal weapons trafficking, and large sums of money that end up in the hands of cartel bosses. The State of Idaho provided support in the service of a warrant issued by a federal judge in connection with the illegal activities taking place in Wilder,” Idaho Gov. Brad Little said in the release.

The FBI led a “monthslong investigation in coordination with the Treasure Valley Metro Violence Crime and Gang Task Force and served a warrant, issued by a federal judge, at the Canyon County facility,” according to the governor’s office. “When serving a search warrant, it is common practice for law enforcement to detain others present while processing the scene to ensure the safety of both the civilians and officers present and to preserve evidence.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251019_190036-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:17:24.185138

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said agents were conducting a “targeted enforcement traffic stop” when the undocumented immigrant tried to evade arrest. According to DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin, the immigrant had “previously escaped from custody.”

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents opened fire at around 8:52 a.m. on E. 20th Street near Washington Boulevard when the suspect allegedly rammed a law enforcement vehicle with his car as he tried to run away.

“Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,” McLaughlin said in a statement.

The suspect was shot in the elbow while a deputy U.S. Marshal was hit in the hand after a bullet ricocheted, according to the DHS.

The U.S. Marshals Central District of California confirmed a deputy was involved in a “line-of-duty shooting,” saying that the Marshals were trying to assist in an operation to detain a “suspect wanted for illegal entry.” The deputy is in stable condition, the U.S. Marshals Service said.

Law enforcement sources had also told NBC Los Angeles that the deputy U.S. Marshal and another person were wounded although the injuries were thought to be non-life threatening.

WASHINGTON—Yesterday, the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) filed a brief in the full Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting en banc. The full court is considering a law in Texas called S.B.4, which protects Texas’s border with Mexico. Activist groups have sued to strike down the law, claiming it conflicts with federal immigration law.

In its brief supporting S.B.4, FAIR shows that the law is permissible under the Constitution as a war measure by the state of Texas. During the Biden Administration, Mexican cartels, which control the Mexican side of the border, ran massive numbers of foreign nationals from around the world, along with massive quantities of drugs and other contraband, into Texas and other states.

In response to this invasion by the cartels, Governor Greg Abbott declared war under Section 10 of Article I of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that states, “without the Consent of Congress,” may “engage in War” if they have been “actually invaded.” In addition to enacting S.B.4, Texas has taken other steps to wage this war, including placing floating barriers in the Rio Grande and stringing razor wire to block invaders, and people who fund the cartels, from entering the state.

FAIR argues in its brief that the questions of whether Texas has been invaded and whether its chosen means of waging war are appropriate are both what are called “nonjusticiable political questions”—meaning they have no legal answers, and so courts should decline to decide them, but rather leave them to the political branches of state government. Then FAIR shows that Texas’s valid exercise of its constitutional power to repel an invasion overrides any conflicting federal laws for the duration of the conflict.

“Whether to go to war and how to wage it are not legal questions,” said Christopher J. Hajec, deputy general counsel of FAIR. “The Constitution accordingly gives the power of deciding them to states, not to courts. We hope the court sees that Texas acted in good faith in invoking its war power, that its valid exercise of direct constitutional power cannot be overridden by acts of Congress, and upholds S.B.4.”

McIver’s defense attorneys said such messages could undermine the charges by showing agents were not afraid of McIver, a potential element in an assault case.","The alleged assaults occurred during a 68-second span in the midst of a three-hour tour of the Delaney Hall detention facility, when McIver, Watson Coleman and Menendez were part of a chaotic scrum as immigration agents moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka on a trespassing charge that was later dropped.

Another judge called the Baraka prosecution embarrassing. Now the McIver case is another test of New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, who is battling to preserve her post following a separate August court ruling that she is unlawfully serving in the job. An appeals court heard arguments about that case on Monday.

McIver attorney Paul Fishman argued McIver was prosecuted because she was a Democrat, meanwhile Trump pardoned hundreds of people who attacked police at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the Justice Department dropped numerous additional assault cases at Trump’s direction, despite video evidence of the attacks.

“She was charged with something she never would have been charged with if she was a Republican,” Fishman said.

But Semper repeatedly came back to the fact that neither Watson Coleman or Menendez were charged, even though they were in the same scrum as McIver. (Watson Coleman, Menendez and Rep. Nellie Pou were all in the courtroom Tuesday as spectators to support McIver.)

Semper then heard attorneys try to leverage complex and uncertain case law about congressional immunity. He cited case law that worried too much immunity could make members of Congress “super citizens” immune from the law, but he also entertained arguments about how prosecutors could try the case in front of a jury without showing them evidence that steps on her constitutional protections.

“It’s going to be about what the jury sees on those videos,” assistant U.S. Attorney Mark McCarren said, referring to videos of the scrum that the government alleges shows McIver assaulting two officers and impeding the arrest of Baraka.

But defense attorneys said to get those events, the jury needs to hear that McIver was there exercising her oversight authority and hear evidence that federal immigration agents tried to impede her work — work the Constitution’s “speech or debate” clause protects from being used in court. Her attorneys have also cited the Supreme Court ruling last year that gave Trump immunity from criminal prosecution for some actions he took during his first presidential term while fighting to subvert the 2020 election.

“You can’t try the case the way the government pretends they can try it,” Fishman said.

McIver is accused in a three-count indictment of slamming a federal agent with her forearm, “forcibly” grabbing him and using her forearms to strike another agent. Allegations of physical violence by a sitting member of Congress are rare.

At one point, the hearing in front of the judge turned to perhaps the most famous case from history, the caning of Sen. Charles Sumner by Rep. Preston Brooks in 1856. Prosecutors argued that Brooks was prosecuted, suggesting congressional immunity doesn’t cover assaults. But defense attorneys said the case wasn’t analogous, in part because Brooks was a member of the House who had come into the Senate with a specific intent not related to his legislative activity.

Semper also told the government to look at taking down statements that Trump administration officials made about the case that have “absolutely no connection” to the indictment, including remarks suggesting she was trespassing or part of Antifa. Prosecutors said the government had taken down some but conceded other statements remained on social media.

That alone represents a rare concession by the Trump administration: Prosecutors said a half dozen statements had been taken down, while the defense team argued nine others remained online.

Semper said he wanted the government to be proactive in removing such posts and didn’t want to force the defense team to play “whack-a-mole.”

Semper also asked the government to tell him about text messages among agents on the scene.

Attorney General Dan Rayfield filed a motion Monday in Eugene U.S. District Court to dismiss the lawsuit, which county officials filed Aug. 18 to seek clarity on whether they could share contact information and other details about men on parole with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Because state law unequivocally prohibits Marion County from producing the requested information without a court order, and because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies, there is nothing further for this court to do,” Rayfield wrote.

The motion is the latest in an ongoing back-and-forth between Marion County, the state and federal authorities who say they are trying to locate several men in Salem who served prison time for violent crimes and should be deported.

ICE sent subpoenas to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office on Aug. 1 asking for information about five men on parole, according to the county’s lawsuit.

The lawsuit named Gov. Tina Kotek, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons.

Marion County said that a federal judge needs to resolve conflicts between Oregon’s so-called sanctuary law, state public records law and federal law. The county compiled information to respond to the ICE subpoenas but has not provided them as of Tuesday, according to Marion County counsel Steve Elzinga.

Oregon sanctuary law generally bars agencies from sharing information with immigration authorities for enforcement purposes, unless ordered to do so by a judge.

Rayfield argued that ICE does not have authority to inspect the information under the state’s public records law.

The subpoenas sent to Marion County were signed by a special agent, not a judge. That means they are not to be cooperated with under Oregon law, Rayfield argued.

Rayfield said that previous court rulings have made clear that sanctuary and federal law do not conflict, and that if a judge orders to enforce subpoenas, agencies are then required to provide the information.

“And yet, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed this lawsuit instead, seeking an advisory opinion from this court rather than following well-established processes under state and federal law – processes that have been in place for many years without the need for lawsuits or further clarification,” Rayfield wrote in the motion.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office separately filed a lawsuit Oct. 1 to enforce subpoenas sent to Marion, Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas counties requesting information on 10 men previously convicted of crimes in the counties.

In that case, Marion County asked a judge to order it to release information to ICE, according to an Oct. 6 filing. No such order has been issued yet, federal court records show.

Twenty Oregon counties and all but two of the state’s sheriffs support Marion County’s lawsuit seeking clarification on immigration subpoenas.

In a letter sent to Rayfield and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi Oct. 6, counties said Marion County should ask a judge to “issue a detailed opinion that provides the type of clarity that will help all local governments ensure they are properly following federal, state and local laws.”

READ IT: Motion to dismiss Marion County lawsuit

In its subpoenas, ICE sought personal information on five men on parole in Marion County for serious crimes, including rape, sexual abuse, kidnapping and theft. ICE later rescinded one subpoena due to “discrepancies in biographical information,” an email from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said.

Salem Reporter filed a public records request Sept. 18 for the information ICE requested in its administrative subpoenas and received the records a week later without exemptions or redactions. The news publication was not charged for the records.

The records, which include home addresses, employers and phone numbers for each of the men, were also provided to OPB and KOIN 6, according to a declaration by Elzinga.

Providing the records to news outlets underscores a key claim in Marion County’s lawsuit. The county argued that under state public records law, information about people on parole is a public record that anyone can obtain through a public records request.

READ IT: Marion County ICE lawsuit

Until Monday, Rayfield had not previously addressed the county’s claim about conflicts between sanctuary and public records law.

In the motion, he cited state law that says people who are allowed to inspect public records include “any natural person, corporation, partnership, firm, association or member or committee of the Legislative Assembly.”

Public bodies and the federal government are not included in Oregon’s definition of who is allowed access to public records, Rayfield said.

“Here, the administrative subpoenas issued by ICE are issued under federal government authority, not in anyone’s individual capacity, do not state that they are public records requests and do not invoke the Oregon public records law on their face,” he wrote in the motion.

The ICE special agent who signed the subpoenas could have access to the information if the information was requested on behalf of an individual, and not a public agency, according to Rayfield’s motion.

Tran told WJZ she was ""blessed"" on Monday.","Melissa Tran, a mother of four from Hagerstown, Maryland, reported to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Baltimore for the first time since a judge ordered her release following months in custody.

Tran came to the United States legally as a refugee from Vietnam in 1993, but a conviction involving theft from her employer in 2001 left her vulnerable for deportation.

She had been checking in regularly with immigration officials for more than 20 years without issue until they held her last May.

Fear at the federal ICE building

An anxious Melissa Tran spoke to WJZ Investigates when she arrived for her check-in with ICE just after 8 a.m. Monday.

""I feel nervous, very nervous, because I don't know what's going to happen to me,"" she said.

Tran already had a difficult conversation with her family and told them she may not make it home.

""My children asked me if I would be detained, and I said, 'I don't know. I hope not,'"" Tran told WJZ.

She then went inside to join her lawyer with her future uncertain.

Journey from Vietnam

Tran came to the United States legally at age 11 as a refugee from Vietnam.

But decades ago, she said she stole money from an employer, under pressure from an abusive ex-boyfriend.

Tran paid back the debt and served her time. However, the conviction for that single, non-violent crime led to an order of removal.

Still, for more than 20 years, the government allowed her to stay and build her family in Hagerstown where she owns a business.

In May, Tran was detained and transported around the country until a federal judge ordered her release.

What happened Monday?

After several hours, Tran emerged from Baltimore's federal building with her lawyer with good news.

She would be allowed to return home.

""I'm glad I get to go home with my family today, but I don't know what's going to happen the next time,"" Tran said.

She said she continues to live in fear.

""It's fear all the time,"" Tran told WJZ.

There was one catch: ICE demanded she wear an ankle monitor.

Her lawyer, Bernard Semler, planned to fight that.

""She should be released under the same conditions prior to when she was detained, so it's our position with the ankle monitor is not the same conditions and would violate the order,"" Semler said.

Semler also reflected on the hours he spent inside the federal building where people lined up early to check in with ICE.

""When you're up there, and there's a long line of people, you can kind of see the fear in each one of their eyes,"" Semler said.

That is why he is thankful she walked out with him Monday, unlike what happened to Kilmar Abrego Garcia at the same office in August.

""We just tried to stay positive because in the end to not be detained, you've got to look at the glass half full,"" Semler said.

Tran told WJZ she was ""blessed"" on Monday.

She has a court hearing coming up soon.

Tran is not only fighting to stay in the United States but also deportation to a third country.

""I feel very happy that I will get to walk out because I was very scared when I was sitting there for over an hour. I was like, 'Uh-oh something is going to happen like last time,'"" Tran said.

Conditions at ICE facility in Baltimore

Following her release last week, Tran described how she was taken into custody for five days in Baltimore.

She said she was housed with nine women in unsanitary conditions.

""No shower, nothing. No personal hygiene. No toothbrush to brush your teeth,"" Tran described.

The women were kept in one room with an inflatable mattress and no blankets.

""I was in shock,"" Tran said.

She was then taken to Louisiana, Arizona and ended up in Tacoma, Washington.

She said she was always shackled on various buses and planes but relied on the many letters of support she received from friends in Maryland to keep her spirits up.

""When you're sitting there—and you don't know what's happening to you—and you think all these negative thoughts, it's the letters that I received from the people in the community saying you have to stay strong. We are fighting for you. We are praying for you.

That compares to $9,715,843 in the equivalent period in 2024 under Trump’s predecessor, Joe Biden, and an average annual spend of just $8.4 million in the current president’s first term between 2017 and 2021.

“Small arms” refers to armor, explosives, chemical weapons, pistols, and rifles while “ordnance and ordnance accessories manufacturing” denotes other materials like artillery, barrels, extractors, and mounts.

While the majority of the money has been spent on guns and armor for field agents, the outlay has also seen ICE purchase “guided missile warheads and explosive components,” according to Popular Information.

The Independent has contacted the White House, the DHS, and ICE for comment on the reasoning behind the drastically increased investment.

Despite the rapid uptick in investment, officials from the agency claimed that more money from Congress would be needed to expand the use of bodycams, the Associated Press reports.

The comments came from Shawn Byers, deputy field office director for ICE, at a hearing on Monday as he addressed complaints that ICE agents are using increasingly combative tactics.

Trump’s mission to bring about the “largest mass deportation program in history” by rounding up and removing undocumented immigrants in the United States illegally has seen ICE’s role greatly expanded and the agency flooded with federal funding.

It currently estimates that it has approximately 20,000 active agents but Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin recently said it has received “more than 175,000 applications” to join its ranks as a result of an ad blitz on platforms like Spotify, X, Meta, YouTube, and LinkedIn, with “more than 18,000 tentative job offers” issued.

McLaughlin added that the department’s “incentive processing,” such as signing-on bonuses, will continue during the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, which she blamed Democrats for.

Official data published at the end of September reported that there are currently 59,762 people being held in ICE detention centers.

The agency’s increased prominence has brought increased criticism over its methods, however. In June, its operations in downtown Los Angeles attracted mass protests, prompting Trump to activate the National Guard against the wishes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who warned it would escalate the existing tensions.

ICE has also attracted a deluge of unwanted headlines for the administration, including the recent revelation that it has arrested at least 20 children who are American citizens this year, two of whom had cancer.

Reports of operations involving armed agents “traumatizing” mothers and children and firing pepper balls at a priest attending a demonstration have not helped their publicity drive.

“What we’re seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers,” Ed Yohnka of ACLU Illinois told NPR recently.

Yohnka has filed a lawsuit on behalf of protesters who believe that ICE’s tactics have violated their constitutional rights, stating: “All over the country, federal agents have shot, gassed, and detained individuals engaged in cherished and protected activities.”

The suit accuses ICE and other federal agencies of “the dangerous and indiscriminate use of near-lethal weapons such as tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper-balls, flash grenades, and other unwarranted and disproportionate tactics.”","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/09/30/3/07/GettyImages-2237820258.jpg?trim=1,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-10-21 17:17:57.951312

The decision from the Sixth Circuit came down to a 30-day deadline to request the case move to federal court, which the court determined Enbridge missed.
“The Supreme Court should see through Enbridge’s transparent attempt at gamesmanship.” The Tribal Nations also argued that federal courts should not “encroach” on state court jurisdictions.
“The Supreme Court review will resolve this conflict in the courts of appeals.” This story was updated with comment from Enbridge.","Updated at 4:32 p.m.

Ten Tribal Nations in Michigan have filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court urging them to reject an attempt by Canadian oil pipeline company Enbridge Energy to have a federal court settle a lawsuit first brought by Attorney General Dana Nessel in 2019, asking instead to have the case remain in state court.

“For many years, Tribal Amici have called on the State to uphold its public-trust obligation to protect the Straits of Mackinac and the Great Lakes, including the fisheries, from these known dangers of the aging Straits Pipelines,” the Tribal Nations wrote in their brief. “Michigan’s suit against Enbridge is a long-overdue course correction.”

The brief cites the leak of a different pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 6B, into the Kalamazoo River in 2010, and the environmental harms that resulted from that.

Nessel is seeking to close the pair of pipelines that run through the Straits of Mackinac as the pipes were aging, looking to prevent a leak that could substantially contaminate the Great Lakes. While the suit was initially filed in state court, it has bounced between state and federal court in a question of who has jurisdiction.

The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals last year sent the case back to state court, which was a win for Nessel, but in June, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to take up the case on an appeal from Enbridge. While the case had been in the federal appellate court, 63 tribal nations — again led by the Bay Mills Indian Community — filed a similar brief seeking to have the case return to state court.

The decision from the Sixth Circuit came down to a 30-day deadline to request the case move to federal court, which the court determined Enbridge missed. The Supreme Court took up the case in June, and will decide whether Enbridge should be granted an exemption to that 30-day deadline.

“No part of Section 1446 allows a defendant to escape the 30-day deadline by asserting that it only recently discovered that a federal court might be more sympathetic to its arguments,” the amicus brief reads. “But at bottom, that is Enbridge’s explanation for what it attempted here.”

“Enbridge missed a court deadline by more than two years, without excuse, and now they want to change the rules,” Caroline Flynn, a lawyer at Earthjustice who is representing the Tribes, added in a press release. “The Supreme Court should see through Enbridge’s transparent attempt at gamesmanship.”

The Tribal Nations also argued that federal courts should not “encroach” on state court jurisdictions.

“If it were not for Enbridge’s procedural gamesmanship, the merits of this state public-trust dispute may well have been settled long ago — and the risks to Tribal Amici’s critical treaty-protected resources addressed,” the brief continues.

The Tribal Nations that joined the amicus brief are Bay Mills Indian Community, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Hannahville Indian Community, Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi Tribe (NHBP), Pokagon Band of Potawatomi, and the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians.

“The continued operation of Line 5 puts my Tribal Nation in grave danger,” said Whitney Gravelle, President of the Bay Mills Indian Community, in the press release accompanying the brief.

“We are encouraged the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review the June 2024 decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit remanding to state court the Michigan Attorney General’s lawsuit against Enbridge seeking to shut down Line 5,” Ryan Duffy, a spokesperson for Enbridge wrote to the Advance.

Duffy did not specifically comment on the amicus brief.

“The 6th Circuit’s remand decision is in conflict with decisions from two other federal Circuit Courts of Appeals, which both held that there can be exceptions to the 30-day limit,” he added. “The Supreme Court review will resolve this conflict in the courts of appeals.”

“Homeless, incarcerated, or dead” While the Trump administration works overtime to criminalize all immigrant populations, disabled immigrants have been hit especially hard, though they rarely receive extensive media coverage.
A lack of showers and food and exposure to extreme temperatures inside detention centers can also exacerbate medical issues.
Democratic lawmakers who toured the facility over the summer said immigrants detained inside reported that they went 10 days without a change of clothes, underwear, or towels.
However, after speaking to immigrants detained at the facility recently, it appears that “many of the same problems persist,” Diaz said.","President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown has led to an increase in raids carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), resulting in a myriad of human rights abuses—including the abuse and neglect of disabled immigrants in federal custody.

In June, the largest disability rights group in the nation, Disability Rights California (DRC), conducted a monitoring visit at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in California’s San Bernardino County after receiving reports that disabled people were being held in unsafe conditions.

The facility is run by the GEO Group, one of the largest private prison companies in the U.S. and one that has experienced a financial boon from the Trump administration’s soaring detention numbers. There are at least 59,700 immigrants in detention centers nationwide—a historic high—and many of these facilities are run by GEO, a company long synonymous with neglect, abuse, and in-custody deaths.

On Sept. 22, 39-year-old Ismael Ayala-Uribe died while detained at Adelanto. The Mexican immigrant and former recipient of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals was detained at the facility for a little more than a month before his in-custody death from unknown causes. Ayala-Uribe, who was apprehended as part of a workplace raid at an Orange County, California, car wash, was the 14th person to die in ICE custody this year.

According to DRC, about 300 immigrants were detained at Adelanto just before the group’s June visit. A few weeks later, when members of the organization revisited the facility, that number skyrocketed to nearly 1,400. The dramatic increase led the already abhorrent conditions inside to further deteriorate, according to DRC’s report released in July.

“They Treat Us Like Dogs in Cages: Inside the Adelanto ICE Processing Center” details the conditions immigrants have experienced inside the facility, including inadequate access to medical treatment; exposure to widespread respiratory illnesses; inadequate access to food and water; inadequate access to clean clothes, with many remaining in soiled clothing for long periods of time; and minimal opportunities to contact family.

“Further intensifying these issues, many of the people DRC interviewed had never experienced incarceration and felt overwhelmed and terrified by their confinement in a locked, jail-like facility,” the report noted.

Neither ICE nor GEO Group responded to Prism’s request for comment.

“Homeless, incarcerated, or dead”

While the Trump administration works overtime to criminalize all immigrant populations, disabled immigrants have been hit especially hard, though they rarely receive extensive media coverage.

As Prism previously reported, deaf immigrants in Los Angeles were particularly vulnerable during the raids that roiled the region this summer. Also in California, a Deaf asylum-seeker from Mongolia who has been detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center since February never saw a judge or had the ability to communicate with anyone familiar with Mongolian Sign Language before being released in July.

More recently, the Houston Chronicle reported on the case of Emmanuel Gonzalez-Garcia. The 15-year-old autistic teen was reported missing by his mother on Oct. 4 after he wandered away from the corner where she sold fruit. After locating the teen, who has the cognitive ability of a 5-year-old, the Houston Police Department claimed that it could not locate a member of his family, so police instead contacted ICE. The teen is now in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the federal agency responsible for detaining immigrant minors who are unaccompanied by adults.

Like in Gonzalez-Garcia’s case, disabled people and their families often can’t access the financial, educational, legal, or informational resources they need. Richard Diaz, senior attorney with the investigations unit at DRC, told Prism in an email that there are many cases in which “a person’s disabilities are not identified or tracked, leaving them without proper accommodations in immigration court proceedings and in immigration detention.”

Recent changes to federal public benefits by the Trump administration now also bar undocumented immigrants and even some green card holders from using certain services important for their health and well-being, KFF reported. This includes the federal Health Center Program, which funds a network of community health centers that provide a range of medical, behavioral, and supportive services to patients regardless of their ability to pay.

Mia Ives-Rublee, the senior director of the Center for American Progress’ Disability Justice Initiative, told Prism in an email that “the mishandling of undocumented individuals will likely exacerbate” the issues faced by a population that is more likely to be disabled or chronically ill. Examples of these violations include medical devices such as wheelchairs or inhalers being stripped away and immigrants being forced to go without their medications for weeks. A lack of showers and food and exposure to extreme temperatures inside detention centers can also exacerbate medical issues.

In June, prior to the release of DRC’s report, the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California also sounded the alarm on unsafe and unsanitary conditions inside Adelanto, the largest detention center in California. Democratic lawmakers who toured the facility over the summer said immigrants detained inside reported that they went 10 days without a change of clothes, underwear, or towels. Detention center employees even told the Los Angeles Times that the facility was unprepared to handle the recent surge in detained immigrants.

“It’s dangerous,” a longtime staffer told the publication, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We have no staffing for this and not enough experienced staff. They’re just cutting way too many corners, and it affects the safety of everybody in there.”

But immigrants outside of detention also face serious issues accessing health care due to fear of immigration enforcement.

Historically, hospital administrators have the power to “medically deport” undocumented immigrants in critical condition who are unable to pay for their care. In California, ICE is now regularly appearing inside medical facilities, creating a chilling effect and potentially forcing disabled or other chronically ill immigrants to miss necessary appointments. If deported, disabled people also face “a lack of community support or infrastructure to help address their disability or chronic illness,” Ives-Rublee said. Without support or care, “these individuals may end up homeless, incarcerated, or dead,” she told Prism.

Since DRC published its report, Diaz said the organization followed up with ICE, which agreed to implement “remedies” based on DRC’s advocacy. However, after speaking to immigrants detained at the facility recently, it appears that “many of the same problems persist,” Diaz said.

As organizations like DRC advocate on behalf of the people currently detained inside Adelanto, there are ways people can help their disabled undocumented neighbors on the outside.

Ives-Rublee suggested checking on community members, verifying their needs, and offering aid, especially to prevent them from having to go to areas where ICE is confirmed to be carrying out raids and other immigration enforcement. She stressed that disability is a “Western idea,” and individuals who qualify as disabled under U.S. law may not identify as disabled. “They may be eligible for certain protections under the Americans with Disabilities Act or Rehabilitation Act even if they don’t self-identify,” Ives-Rublee said, which is why black and white questions about whether someone is disabled may not provide a true sense of a neighbor’s specific needs.

After obtaining consent from an individual or their family, community members can help neighbors with grocery shopping or even accompany them to certain medical appointments. You can also serve as a point of contact if an undocumented neighbor fears they may be detained and will require legal representation. If they don’t have a lawyer, Ives-Rublee also suggested seeking out legal aid, especially through a disability rights group in your state that may be able to help get a person released.

DRC developed a disability accommodations card that can be used in conjunction with a know your rights card. These can be shared with undocumented neighbors in case they interact with immigration or law enforcement.

While ICE’s unjust and often unlawful treatment of immigrants and people with disabilities will continue as long as the federal immigration agency exists, concerned people nationwide can also continue to fight back on behalf of their neighbors.

(KOIN) – Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Marion County concerning the state’s sanctuary state laws.
The subpoenas led Marion County to file a federal lawsuit seeking clarity on whether the county has the authority to turn over the records of the alleged undocumented immigrants under Oregon’s sanctuary state laws.
“Oregon law is straightforward,” said Attorney General Rayfield.
“The Ninth Circuit has already ruled that there is no conflict between our sanctuary law and federal law.
Public bodies can’t use state resources to help enforce federal immigration law.","PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) – Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield is asking a federal court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Marion County concerning the state’s sanctuary state laws.

On Monday, Attorney General Rayfield filed the motion to dismiss in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon — arguing the state’s sanctuary laws are “straightforward.”

Marion County’s lawsuit goes back to Aug. 1, when the county received five subpoenas from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, requesting the records of four alleged undocumented immigrants on parole for crimes including multiple rape convictions, multiple sexual abuse convictions and convictions for kidnapping/robbery. According to court documents, a fifth subpoena was served for an individual whose identity was not clear at the time.

According to court documents, ICE’s subpoenas ask the county to turn over information on the individuals such as home addresses, phone numbers, country of birth, name and address of employers along with “‘[d]ocuments sufficient to show the underlying criminal charge,'” including police reports, probable cause documents, booking photos and release agreements.

The subpoenas state that the production of “‘the indicated records is required in connection with an investigation or inquiry relating to the enforcement of U.S. immigration laws,'” court documents say.

The subpoenas led Marion County to file a federal lawsuit seeking clarity on whether the county has the authority to turn over the records of the alleged undocumented immigrants under Oregon’s sanctuary state laws.

Trump administration aims to remove second order blocking troops from Portland

In Monday’s filing, Rayfield argued that Oregon’s sanctuary state laws are clear, stating, public bodies and law enforcement agencies in the state cannot release immigration information to federal officials in response to federal subpoenas unless a judicial order requires them to do so.

“Oregon law is straightforward,” said Attorney General Rayfield. “The Ninth Circuit has already ruled that there is no conflict between our sanctuary law and federal law. Public bodies can’t use state resources to help enforce federal immigration law. That’s been the law for nearly four decades, and it is a law that has coexisted peacefully under seven presidential administrations. There’s nothing confusing about that.”

Under Oregon’s sanctuary law – which was enacted in 1987 and reaffirmed by voters in 2021 – state and local officials cannot give out certain immigration information in response to subpoenas from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, unless ICE obtains a judicial order requiring the subpoena, the Oregon Attorney General’s Office explained, noting this law ensures that a judge has an opportunity to review and determine if the subpoena meets legal requirements before state and local officials comply.

“Our system respects state sovereignty, federal authority, and public safety while keeping local resources focused on local priorities. There is simply nothing for the court to resolve here,” said Attorney General Rayfield.

In a statement shared with KOIN 6 News, Marion County Counsel Steve Elzinga countered, “The state’s assertion that there is no legal uncertainty fails a basic smell test when there is an obvious federal-state clash over subpoenas requesting public records of violent criminals and the majority of Oregon’s sheriffs and counties who are caught in the middle say that legal clarity is needed.”

KOIN 6 News also reached out to Oregon Governor Tina Kotek, who is listed as a defendant in Marion County’s lawsuit. Kotek’s office said the governor cannot comment on pending litigation.

Marion County has seen support, with 34 Oregon sheriff’s offices signing a letter in support of the litigation and 20 of Oregon’s 36 counties signing a separate letter in support.

The suspect — who had reportedly escaped from custody on a previous occasion — allegedly rammed into federal vehicles, prompting agents to surround and box in the immigrant’s car, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to The Post.

“ICE law enforcement officers, assisted by U.S. Marshals, pulled the illegal alien over in a standard law enforcement procedure,” McLaughlin said.

“The illegal alien weaponized his vehicle and began ramming the law enforcement vehicle in an attempt to flee. Fearing for the safety of the public and law enforcement, our officers followed their training and fired defensive shots,” she said.

The illegal immigrant was shot in the elbow and the US Marshal was struck in the hand by a ricochet bullet, according to McLaughlin.

Both were rushed to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, according to Fox News.

McLaughlin, in her statement, accused lefty politicians like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass of triggering similar anti-ICE violence through incendiary rhetoric.

“These are the consequences of conduct and rhetoric by sanctuary politicians and activists who urge illegal aliens to resist arrest. Resisting arrest puts the safety of illegal aliens, law enforcement, and the public at risk,” McLaughlin fumed.

McLaughlin also lambasted the disturbing uptick in attacks on federal immigration agents.

“Our law enforcement officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them including vehicle rammings by illegal aliens,” she said.

“We are once again calling on sanctuary politicians, agitators, and the media to turn the temperature down and stop calling for violence and resistance against ICE law enforcement,” she said.

The shooting took place during an immigration operation involving a known gang member on East 20th Street, just south of Downtown LA, shortly before 9 a.m. local time, a DHS source told the Los Angeles Times.

McLaughlin pointed to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez hosting a webinar including tips on how to defy ICE raids in February, as well as Gov. Newsom and Mayor Bass releasing guides and sanctuary laws providing advice to illegal aliens.

The LAPD did not respond immediately to requests for comment.

The administration, in filings, said that many of those to whom it had issued RIFs were unaffected by the order, as many departments and agencies had stopped recognizing those collective bargaining units over the summer in compliance with a March executive order.

Head Start programs that serve tens of thousands of the nation’s neediest preschoolers are facing a cutoff of federal funding at the end of the month because of the government shutdown, leaving many scrambling to figure out how to keep their doors open. The early education initiative is funded almost entirely by the federal government, making it particularly vulnerable to funding disruptions. The programs — which are run by schools, local governments and nonprofits — receive new grants annually and are not allowed to carry over unspent money. (Balingit, 10/20)

AP: Nuclear Security Agency Starts Furloughing Workers

The federal agency tasked with overseeing the U.S. nuclear stockpile has begun furloughing employees as part of the ongoing federal government shutdown, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said Monday. In a visit to Nevada, Wright said the National Nuclear Security Administration is furloughing 1,400 federal workers as part of the shutdown, which began Oct. 1. Nearly 400 federal workers will remain on the job, along with thousands of NNSA contractors, the Energy Department said. The NNSA, a semi-autonomous branch of the Energy Department, also works to secure nuclear materials around the world. (Daly, 10/20)

CNN: What’s Happening To End The Government Shutdown? Nothing

No end is in sight to a government shutdown now tied for the second-longest ahead of President Donald Trump’s expected departure for Asia at the end of the week for summits. There’s no sign he’ll emulate his first predecessor, President Barack Obama, who canceled a tour of the region in 2013 because of a similar stalemate. (Collinson, 10/20)

The city first informed residents it expected ICE agents in Evanston in a Sept. 8 statement.

The agents’ presence is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Operation Midway Blitz, a federal immigration crackdown targeting undocumented immigrants in the Chicago area, first announced in September.

This page will be updated with credible reports of federal immigration enforcement in the city. Updates will be posted as activity is confirmed by official government sources at the local, state and federal levels as well as through verified alerts from the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights. ICIRR operates a text alert system to inform community members on ICE sightings. According to ICIRR’s website, alerts are only issued when recent sightings are verified by an affiliated rapid response team.

Since the beginning of the year, the city has taken efforts to protect residents against federal agents, such as strengthening the Welcoming City ordinance. More recently, City Council voted to establish “ICE free zones” on city property, and Mayor Daniel Biss urged community members to “keep (their) neighbors safe.”

“In short: ICE is not welcome in Evanston,” Biss wrote in an Oct. 17 email to residents.

Community members and leaders have also taken action through community workshops, protests and nonprofit work. Many have encouraged reporting ICE activity by calling the ICIRR hotline at 855-435-7693.

This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available.

OCT. 21 — last updated 9:45 a.m.

At least four ICE agents were reported in Evanston on Tuesday morning, according to an ICIRR alert around 9:30 a.m. At least one person was detained, the alert read.

The agents were seen parked in the Home Depot parking lot and Salvation Army near south Oakton Street and Dawes Elementary School. They are wearing tan vests and driving a black Chevy SUV and a black Kia Carnival, according to the alert.

Agents were also spotted at the Home Depot in Lincolnwood, the alert read.

This follows an uptick in immigration enforcement throughout the city.

On Oct. 17, federal agents detained one person at an Oakton Street Home Depot around 10:35 a.m., according to an ICIRR text alert sent that day. The alert stated agents were seen driving a black Chevy SUV.

At least one person in Evanston was taken by federal immigration agents the morning of Oct.16, Biss wrote in an X post the same day.

An ICIRR text alert sent earlier that day said federal agents were spotted at Dodge Avenue and Oakton Street — adjacent to Dawes Elementary School — around 8:50 a.m. Agents were seen driving a black Chevy and a silver Hyundai Elantra, the alert read.

Residents previously saw ICE agents in the area by the Home Depot on Oakton Street on Oct. 12, causing American Youth Soccer Organization Evanston coaches to cancel its games at James Park across the street. In an X post the same day, Biss confirmed ICE took multiple community members.

The Department of Homeland Security also arrested an individual in Evanston near the intersection of Church Street and Brown Avenue on Sept. 10, according to a city statement later that week. The agents are not confirmed to be ICE agents, Evanston Police Department Cmdr. Scott Sophier said, but ICE is housed in DHS.

here, demanding the feds drop all charges against the congresswoman and dismiss the case against her.

FOR MORE FROM INSIDERNJ ON THIS CASE, PLEASE GO HERE.

District Judge Jamel Semper was upstairs at the same time, hearing oral arguments from McIver's legal team.

Judge Semper this afternoon said he would issue a written opinion in response to the Congresswoman's argument to dismiss the case.

McIver pleaded not guilty in June to the three criminal charges stemming from an incident Delaney Hall in May, when McIver tried to protect Newark Mayor Ras Baraka. Armed and masked ICE agents had thrown the mayor in handcuffs as he and a congressional team, including McIver, U.S. Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, and U.S. Rep. Rob Menendez sought information about detainees inside the immigration detention facility.

“The legal process will expose this prosecution for what it truly is — political retaliation against a dedicated public servant who refuses to shy away from her oversight responsibilities,” said Paul Fishman, former U.S. Attorney of New Jersey, who represents the congresswoman.

In the words of Amol Sinha, executive director of the NJ-ACLU: ""Vengeance, not governance.""

U.S. Rep. Ilhan Abdullahi Omar (D-MN), U.S. Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-Ca), U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-

TX), and U.S. Rep. Yvette Clark (D-NY) stood in front of the front steps of the federal building in support of their colleague.

""Our sister,"" they said.

Crockett pointedly noted that a Trump-pardoned Jan. 6 rioter faces felony charges for making a terroristic threat against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Christopher Moynihan today pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.

FROM CNN: According to New York State Police, an anonymous source told the FBI that the man, Christopher Moynihan (pictured on Jan. 6th, 2021, left), had said on Friday that “in a few days, he would kill Congressman Jeffries in New York City for ‘the future,’” court records say.

As for McIver, surrounded by masked and armed agents as she tried to shield Baraka, ""She shouldn't even be on trial,"" civil rights leader Larry Hamm, founder of the People's Organization for Progress, declared. ""Donald Trump should be on trial.""

""LaMonica McIver is my congresswoman,"" Hamm told the crowd. ""I've lived in the 10th Congressional District all my life. LaMonica was arrested on May 9th. Why was she arrested? For doing her job. What was her job? Her job was to make sure there were no children in cages in Delaney Hall. Her job was to make sure our immigrant brothers and sisters were being treated like human beings in Delaney Hall. ...Immigrant rights are human rights. They think they have LaMonica McIver on trial? We're all on trial.""

Who should really be on trial, he asked.

""ICE should be on trial,"" said Hamm. ""The people who should be on trial are the people who are trying to build a fascist movement in this country. What we experiencing today is the kind of fascism that reminds me of McCarthyism.""

It equally bothers state Senator Joe Cryan (D-20), who grew up in Newark in the Vailsburg section, and

is a former law enforcement officer, and the son of a law enforcement officer.

""I had the honor of being Union County sheriff,"" said Cryan. ""When I watch people in masks, so afraid to do their job, I think to myself, 'How could this be in the United States of America?'""

Someone in the crowd yelled, ""ICE out of New Jersey!""

Cryan said, ""ICE out of New Jersey is absolutely right. When I watch that I'm absolutely horrified. This is your time. We've got our inspiration. Her name is LaMonica McIver.""

He added another observation.

""When I played basketball here, and if you watch [ICE reacting to McIver trying to defend herself and the mayor], watch it, and you say, 'How could this even be a foul? When I was playing three-on-three in Vailsburg if I called foul for that, I would get laughed at and told to man up.

""You and me together,"" Cryan told the crowd. ""It's time we man up.""

Arrested on May 9th outside Delaney Hall, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka addressed the crowd in support

of McIver, his longtime friend and ally and former student.

""We can't be the first generation to decide not to sacrifice for those who come after us,"" said the mayor. ""We have to lay it all on the line. All on the line. I don't know about you but we're willing to do that. LaMonica grew up in a community that taught her how to fight. She's been fighting all her life. Say something to her, you put your hands on her, you're going to have a fight.

""And now she's upstairs in a fight - and we want them to know there are lot of people downstairs in this fight for her. We're not going to sit idly by.""

The crowd roared its support, among them labor leader Ana Maria Hill of 32BJ SEIU, Amol Sinha, executive director of ACLU NJ, Democratic State Party Chairman LeRoy Jones, Essex County Commissioner Brendan Gill, Newark Councilman Larry Crump, Nedia Morsy of Make the Road NJ, and Sue Altman, state director for U.S. Senator Andy Kim (D-NJ).

Good evening and welcome. It’s electrifying to be here with so many friends, supporters, and allies in one room. Thank you for joining us, and special thanks to our Champion Supporters, Humanitas Media and Pyrra, our all-star Board, and welcome to our newest Board member – Mike Posner, who joined the Board today and whom some of you might have met before!

For those of you I haven’t had a chance to meet yet, Hello! I am Uzra Zeya, Human Rights First’s new President and CEO.

I took on this role of a lifetime last April, after having fought for decades to advance and defend universal human rights internationally as an American diplomat. From launching global partnerships to defend LGBTQI+ equality, to building a pipeline to relocate over 200,000 Afghans to the United States after the Taliban takeover, to rebuilding a decimated U.S. refugee admissions program to reach a 21st century resettlement peak, I’ve seen what’s possible when policymakers, civil society, and diverse stakeholders unite behind ambitious rights goals.

And I also know that, even in the best of times, the U.S. government needs robust civil society activism, embodied by this storied organization, to hold its feet to the fire to do the right thing.

But these are NOT the best of times. This is a moment when the authoritarian playbook I spent decades fighting overseas, has come home to our shores. And it’s on steroids.

You’ve seen it. Weaponization of government institutions to consolidate power, target perceived enemies, and enrich cronies. Vilification of the vulnerable – be it immigrants, trans people, people of color or persons with disabilities. Militarization of our cities, with New York looming large on the target list. Bullying and harassment of universities, law firms, and media companies, alongside targeting of rights advocates, the International Criminal Court, and philanthropic organizations – all for the exercise of their First Amendment rights.

Never has Human Rights First’s mission been more at risk, and never has it been more important. And the urgency of this moment is why tonight’s gathering is so important. Human Rights First is all-in for the fight, but we can’t do it alone or simply by preaching to the choir.

We know this, because everybody has human rights.

Let me say this another way: Human rights are for everybody.

So if we are going to rise to meet the moment–defeat authoritarianism, uphold the rule of law and protect the American way of life–we need EVERYBODY to be in the fight for human rights.

Inspired by this evening’s honorees, we are working to strengthen solidarity. To make sure that human rights advocacy is a big tent–where we welcome everybody who is willing to stand up for basic freedoms to join us in the fight.

And working with everyone in this room to make that a reality–well, that certainly is the opportunity of a lifetime.

So what does it mean to say that human rights are for everybody, and what does that look like?

At Human Rights First, we see three urgent, overlapping imperatives.

Defend the vulnerable.

Protect democracy.

Step up and lead on international human rights as the United States steps back.

And we’re doing all three by doubling down on our well-honed legal prowess, ability to unite unlikely allies, and bias towards innovation.

Defending the vulnerable:

Right now, in the United States, immigrants and refugees are bearing the brunt of the administration’s illegal power grab. Masked federal police have forced immigrants into unmarked vans. Arrested students for thought crimes. Separated families. Detained them in deplorable conditions, disappeared them, and flown them in shackles to dangerous destinations unknown to them.

It’s no time for business as usual. This is why we’re catalyzing a rapid response model that integrates our powerhouse refugee representation, policy advocacy, and litigation efforts with the cutting-edge work of our Innovation Lab.

We’re leaning in on strategic litigation, having more than quadrupled in-house capacity this year, thanks to the generosity of champions like Tracy Aanenson, Matthew Dontzin, and Tom Bernstein. We have taken the Trump administration to court to stop third country transfers without due process to war-torn countries like Libya and South Sudan and notorious torture centers like El Salvador’s CECOT prison.

We’ve sued to protect over a half million people granted humanitarian parole who face dire risks if forcibly returned to Haiti, Ukraine, Afghanistan, Cuba, Venezuela, or Nicaragua.

We’ve documented abuses in U.S. immigration detention facilities. And we’ve accompanied members of Congress as they demand access to those facilities to exercise oversight.

And speaking of oversight, we’ve been so fortunate to take the baton from Tom Cartwright, one of tonight’s honorees, and continue his pioneering work tracking ICE deportation flights. HRF’s new ICE Flight Monitor brings transparency to hidden detention and enforcement operations. Tom’s example, as a retired finance exec who volunteered his time to build this methodology from scratch, reminds us of what is possible when everybody is for human rights and how it is up to each of us to protect our democracy.

So many of you in this room are also the human rights champions rising to meet this moment. With your help we continue to represent survivors of persecution. From enduring Kremlin chemical weapons attacks targeting their political activism, to facing death threats for whom they love or how they worship, to defying the will of MS-13 and other abusive thugs, our clients’ courage and resilience are inspirational. And with your help and in spite of the odds stacked against our clients, we continue to WIN these asylum cases at a success rate above 90%.

Later tonight, we will recognize our Marvin E. Frankel award winner and celebrate that lawyers are still standing beside refugees–even when cases are more challenging than before. When it feels risky.

When it’s needed more than ever.

But connecting with a lawyer is all the more difficult in today’s scorched earth environment. That’s where our Innovation Lab’s new app ReadyNow! comes in – by giving individuals at risk of ICE arrest ability to send emergency notifications with one click. Users have peace of mind to ensure their kids are picked up from school, loved ones know where they are, and that a lawyer can help them in the event the worst happens.

Defend democracy:

As I’ve seen elsewhere in the world, anti-immigrant overreach connects to a broader, ongoing assault on our democracy, as every would-be autocrat needs an enemy to scapegoat.

But in this country we still have the freedom to speak and assemble. And so, we successfully blocked the Trump administration from arresting and detaining a Columbia University student who followed her conscience to attend peaceful demonstrations.

We continue to partner with veterans who share our belief that service is about an oath to the Constitution–not to any one man. And we are recharging partnership with retired military leaders which secured bipartisan policy wins against torture over decade ago. This time it’s an even bigger battle, to protect against misuse of our military for anti-democratic ends, that requires an even bigger tent. This is where HRF’s ability to build broad-based coalitions with unlikely allies comes to the fore.

In partnership with our allies, we’re campaigning against efforts to punish and criminalize dissent. As part of that effort, our Innovation Lab created an AI-powered tool that tracks pending legislation nationwide that would infringe on people’s rights. Because in order to protect our freedoms, we need aware and engaged citizenry. And right now we’re at over 3200 regressive bills and counting in all 50 states.

Projecting international leadership on human rights:

Last month I was here in New York for the UN General Assembly. Frankly, our allies–and in fact the entire international system–are still reckoning with what it means to have the United States not only disavow, but actively undermine the rights-based order that our country did so much to bolster since World War II.

So we are rebooting our playbook. Our amped-up litigation prevented the Trump administration from punishing a prosecutor at the International Criminal Court working for justice for Darfur – a concrete step toward preserving the ability of that institution to act against impunity.

The lead litigator on that case, HRF Special Counsel Josh Colangelo, authored a memoir – a gift to all of you tonight – on his harrowing experience representing clients at Guantanamo. His is a cautionary tale on what happens when impunity is normalized in the name of security.

Rebooting our playbook and ending impunity also means not overrelying on one government to uphold the international human rights ecosystem. That’s why our powerful human rights accountability coalition of 340 organizations in 50 countries pivoted to rally the UK, Canada, EU and Australia to fill the vacuum left by retreating U.S. leadership.

That’s why we’re continuing to work with human rights defenders from Ukraine to Syria to elevate their struggles, enable their work, and help them secure new means of support.

It’s why we rallied 270 organizations worldwide to join us in urging UN member states to uphold human rights and humanitarian treaties under threat.

The odds against us may seem overwhelming, but I draw inspiration from tonight’s honorees who stood up to dictators and never wavered.

I am inspired by Evgenia and Vladimir Kara-Murza, who never stopped advocating for democracy in Russia despite Vladimir’s unjust imprisonment and multiple Kremlin attempts to poison him.

I am inspired by Richard Gere, who never ceased championing the rights of Tibetans, and spoke human rights truths to the Chinese Communist Party from the platform of the Academy Awards and paid a price for it. We might not all be movie stars, but standing strong for principles is within the power of all of us.

And finally, I am inspired by Cristosal, this year’s William D. Zabel awardee, named in honor of our Chair Emeritus, a fearless, lifelong champion for human rights and loyal benefactor to this organization. The same courage that young Bill showed in standing up to the KKK and segregationists in the 1950s and 60s is mirrored in Cristosal’s brave stance exposing rights abuses and pursuing justice for victims across Central America these last 25 years.

A few years ago it was possible to think that the task ahead of us was about returning to normalcy. Restoration.

That theory has clearly been disproven by the last 10 months, as well as the chapters of injustice that preceded it, from Guantanamo to Gaza. That’s not to say there haven’t been some positive developments as of late. We welcome the long overdue and breakthrough release of all living hostages and cessation of hostilities, as we reiterate the urgency of surging humanitarian aid, releasing all arbitrarily detained and hostage remains, and accountability for all crimes perpetrated since October 7, 2023.

But a return to a status quo that failed so many would not be desirable even if it were possible. If we are to build a future where everybody’s human rights are truly protected, our job is nothing less than reinvention.

Now, I can’t tell you exactly what that reinvention will look like. But here are some of the things I’ll be looking for:

The future we want to build will be one with a thriving multi-racial democracy where we debate differences vociferously but political violence, anti-semitism, Islamophobia, racism and all forms of hate are anathema.

Where Constitutional rights are protected no matter what you look like, whom you love or whether or not you have friends in high places.

Where human rights defenders hold their governments to account without reprisal–and are bolstered by a multi-stakeholder, cross-regional alliance for human rights.

Where the anti-immigrant tide is turned, refugees are welcomed, asylum systems are modernized and resourced, and immigration enforcement is humane and grounded in law.

Where international accountability dismantles double standards and builds guardrails to prevent tools designed to bring abusers to justice from being turned on advocates.

We may disagree about which routes to take to this destination, or how fast or far, but we can only get there together. In that spirit of solidarity, we are unveiling a branding refresh intended to uplift and bring forward more allies to step up for human rights.

So let’s get moving. Human rights are for everybody. And right now we urgently need everybody to be for human rights.

Thank you for being with us and helping us get there.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Title-Card-2.png,N,,2025-10-21 15:01:52.466801

In June, Farbiarz, a Biden appointee, blocked the Trump administration from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds.
Ensign challenged that finding at Tuesday’s hearing, but all three appeals court judges cast doubt on Ensign’s arguments.
Khalil’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Farbiarz had correctly blocked the Trump administration from using the foreign-policy provision.
Khalil’s lawyers have said they intend to appeal the deportation order.","Bibas, in particular, scoffed at an argument by a lawyer for the government that the lower-court judge, Michael Farbiarz, didn’t have jurisdiction over the case because Khalil’s lawyers hadn’t properly filed a petition for his release in the appropriate district. In the hours following his arrest on March 8, Khalil was moved several times over the course of a weekend, and his lawyers filed the petition in Manhattan based on inaccurate information provided by the government.

The government lawyer, Drew Ensign, suggested Khalil’s lawyers should have waited to file the petition.

“They’re dealing with a situation where, you know, immigrants have been spirited out of the country in a matter of a day or two,” Bibas said to Ensign. “Are they acting unreasonably?”

After Ensign began to answer, Bibas interrupted him, saying: “I’m asking, should we adopt a rule that allows the executive to remove someone from the country in 24 to 48 hours and say there’s no jurisdiction anywhere until the courts open on Monday, by which time he’s on a plane?”

Bibas continued: “If our rule says, wait until … the system is updated Monday morning, the executive might spirit the person out of the country over the weekend. Are you asking us to adopt a rule that says when there’s a lag in the database that’s all on their lawyers and then Monday morning — ‘Sayonara, sorry, he’s gone’?”

For more than three months earlier this year, Khalil was held in detention in Louisiana after the Trump administration arrested him, invoking a rarely used provision of immigration law that allows the government to deport any noncitizen — even a legal resident — if the secretary of State determines that the person’s continued presence harms U.S. foreign policy interests.

In June, Farbiarz, a Biden appointee, blocked the Trump administration from deporting Khalil on foreign policy grounds. Days later, the judge ordered Khalil’s release after determining that he was not a flight risk or danger to the community.

Farbiarz also ruled that continuing to detain Khalil while his immigration case proceeded would have impeded his First Amendment rights. Ensign challenged that finding at Tuesday’s hearing, but all three appeals court judges cast doubt on Ensign’s arguments.

Khalil’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Farbiarz had correctly blocked the Trump administration from using the foreign-policy provision. One judge, Hardiman, asked “why shouldn’t the government have the power to remove people from the country that are harmful to the country?”

“I think the answer is, it has many means to do so, but it can’t be based on lawful, protected speech, political — particularly core political — speech,” said Bobby Hodgson, a lawyer for Khalil. “And I think to find otherwise, and to find that Mr. Khalil cannot make out a First Amendment claim.”

Hardiman asked if the argument would be the same if it wasn’t core political speech, but instead “material support for terrorism.”

“I think that is a different analysis, and reasonably so,” Hodgson replied. “I think this is the exceptional case where it is about core political speech.”

Last month, an immigration judge in Louisiana ordered Khalil deported to Syria or Algeria based on another rationale the Trump administration tacked on after Khalil’s arrest in Manhattan: failing to disclose certain information, including all his past employment and membership in organizations, on his green card application.

,Policy,2025-10-21 17:16:54+00:00,POLITICO,Trump put a new fee on asylum seekers. Many say they don't know how to pay. - POLITICO,Myah Ward,,,,,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/21/trump-put-a-new-fee-on-asylum-seekers-many-say-they-dont-know-how-to-pay-00616987,"Payment notices to asylum seekers have been sporadic, and misinformation has run rampant on social media.
The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a membership organization that serves asylum seekers in the U.S., sued the Trump administration this month after hearing from thousands of members confused by the new asylum policy.
“We don’t want the annual asylum fee to be used to wrongfully dismiss peoples’ asylum cases, especially since asylum seekers may not know about this fee or have no mechanism to pay it,” said Conchita Cruz, co-founder and co-executive director at ASAP.
The agency began sending notices to asylum seekers on Oct. 1, instructing recipients to pay the fee within 30 days.
USCIS launched a portal to pay soon after, but a number of asylum seekers are still awaiting official notification and instructions for how to pay.","“It just feels like people are being cornered from every angle, and the lack of clarity just causes that much more fear and intimidation,” said Robin Nice, an immigration attorney in Boston. “It’s hard to know if it’s weaponized incompetence in how they’re rolling it out, or if it’s straight up malicious … but it’s really hard to advise clients.”

The fees, which are new, were part of the GOP’s domestic policy and tax law President Donald Trump signed on July 4, but the administration’s rollout has been plagued by mishaps: The two agencies collecting the fees initially released different instructions, and only one has offered a vehicle to pay the annual fee.

Payment notices to asylum seekers have been sporadic, and misinformation has run rampant on social media.

Some asylum seekers who have opted to pay the immigration courts $100 say there’s no way to know whether that’s the correct way to pay or whether the federal government will ask them to pay again, according to court filings, immigration attorneys and asylum seekers who spoke with POLITICO.

“I don’t think chaos and confusion is part of the point. The fee amounts themselves are designed to be prohibitive while being just under the line of impossible,” said an administration official, granted anonymity to discuss internal thinking.

The new fees are just one component of the administration’s sweeping effort to permanently alter the immigration system. They come after the White House announced plans last month to overhaul H-1B visas, a move that briefly spurred panic inside corporations. The One Big Beautiful Bill also included a number of other new fees and fee increases for immigration benefits, including an initial $550 fee for asylum work permit applications.

The administration has also revoked Temporary Protected Status, a program that allows immigrants from countries facing humanitarian crises to remain in the U.S. and work legally, and terminated parole for millions of immigrants.

The new $100 fee for every year an asylum application is pending, which is in addition to a new $100 application fee, is in part, designed to deter mass migration and limit access to legal pathways Republicans say have long been abused and have contributed to a massive backlog in the immigration courts. It’s a similar rationale the administration gave for curtailing TPS and reforming the H-1B program.

The Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and the Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. The White House deferred to the agencies implementing the policy. But in a court filing late Monday in federal district court, DOJ lawyers defended the fees and said the agencies are moving to finalize the policy’s implementation.

“Congress made clear that these new asylum fees were long overdue and necessary to recover the growing costs of adjudicating the millions of pending asylum applications,” the lawyers wrote.

The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a membership organization that serves asylum seekers in the U.S., sued the Trump administration this month after hearing from thousands of members confused by the new asylum policy. The organization filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, arguing that the fees should not apply to those who had cases pending before the president signed the bill into law and that it’s a misread of the legislation.

“We don’t want the annual asylum fee to be used to wrongfully dismiss peoples’ asylum cases, especially since asylum seekers may not know about this fee or have no mechanism to pay it,” said Conchita Cruz, co-founder and co-executive director at ASAP.

Alba, an ASAP member, applied for asylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in 2024 after coming to the United States from Honduras. She has not received official notice from the agency about her fee, and as of Monday, is still unable to submit the $100, she said. POLITICO agreed to only use her first name because she fears retribution.

“We have had so much fear, so much anxiety,” said Alba, adding that she is worried she won’t have the cash on hand to pay when the government gives her official notice. “And then you have to be ready to pay at whatever moment [the government] tells you that you have to pay.”

Asylum seekers’ cases are handled by either USCIS or the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review. Depending on the circumstances, immigrants sometimes begin their asylum process with one agency, and are later asked to apply with the other — adding another challenge to the Trump administration’s implementation.

USCIS’ initial instructions said the first payments would not be due until Sept. 30, at the earliest, for those who filed applications before October 2024. The agency began sending notices to asylum seekers on Oct. 1, instructing recipients to pay the fee within 30 days. USCIS launched a portal to pay soon after, but a number of asylum seekers are still awaiting official notification and instructions for how to pay.

EOIR, for its part, announced the first annual fees would affect those who applied for asylum a year or more prior to July 5, but it has yet to provide a mechanism to submit those payments. The website only has a place for immigrants to submit the $100 initial asylum fee.

Justice Department lawyers on Monday said that while EOIR and USCIS initially released differing instructions, EOIR has revised its position to reflect USCIS’ timeline and is “taking steps to finalize” its payment process. The agency, like USCIS, will send official notices to applicants once its payment mechanism is finalized, and asylum seekers will then have 30 days from the date of the notice to make the payment.

“There was no unreasonable delay here in EOIR’s implementation,” the filing said. “The record shows several steps were required to finalize EOIR’s process, including coordination with USCIS. Regardless, Plaintiff’s request is now moot.”

The government also argued that the law intended the fees to be retroactive, and said the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that its members will suffer irreparable harm — requesting that the court deny the request for a preliminary injunction.

But ASAP has received reports that some immigration judges at EOIR have already required applicants to have paid the application fee, and in one case, rejected an asylum application and ordered the person to be deported for non-payment, according to the organization’s Oct. 3 filing.

Other asylum seekers with pending cases before the courts, out of desperation, have submitted $100 toward the initial application fee to EOIR, leaving them unsure if the money will ultimately count as their annual fee — or if the government will soon request $100 more.

“A good number of clients have against our advice, frankly, have paid that initial fee with the idea that it should be applied for the annual fee,” Nice, the Boston attorney, said. “I’m skeptical that it’ll be interpreted that way.”

Jorge, another ASAP member whose last name is being withheld for fear of retribution, came to the U.S. in 2023 from Colombia and has an asylum case before EOIR. On Oct. 1, he saw posts on social media about the money being due and has repeatedly tried to pay through the USCIS portal. The website has crashed and denied his payments. He tried again on Monday, but the website says his fee isn’t due.

“I am willing to pay, and have been trying to pay, but it is necessary that the government give clear and precise instructions, because what I don’t want to do is pay $100 and then be told that I didn’t pay the right $100 or to lose those $100,” he said. “I’m so worried that they’re going to close my case and deport me if I don’t pay.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F12%2Fef%2Fb05600f5475cb642cfbf30b25c1e%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2179739846,N,,2025-10-21 14:04:30.012698

In June, four detainees escaped Delaney Hall amid unrest caused by a lack of meals, according to ABC News.
Outside the barbed wire fence of Delaney Hall, people of diverse faiths and religious backgrounds remain present: praying, singing, and fighting for the rights of those locked inside.","Rev. Dr. Robin Tanner braced herself as Newark, New Jersey, police officers and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, some with their faces covered by masks or bandanas, approached.

Behind Tanner—who serves at the Beacon Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Summit, New Jersey—and the fifty or so other clergy members with her at the protest on May 12, 2025, loomed the hulking gray form of Delaney Hall, surrounded by fences topped with barbed wire. Delaney Hall is a for-profit ICE detention center run by the GEO Group, one of the two largest private prison operators in the United States, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.

The clergy, among them eight UU ministers, blocked the flow of traffic in and out of Delaney Hall, attempting to disrupt operations as much as possible. The group sang hymns and protest songs together, including the civil rights anthem, “Ain’t Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around.”

Demonstrators who spoke with UU World described the conditions within Delaney Hall as not just immoral but illegal, saying that ICE has denied family visitation rights, prevented state officials and members of Congress from inspecting the facility, and not released the names of people being detained.

When the law enforcement officers and federal agents drew closer, Tanner recalls, they reached down to separate her from the others who were sitting in a row, arms linked in solidarity. Tanner and the rest of the clergy were pulled apart from each other and forcibly taken from the gate, she said.

While no clergy were arrested at the event, two activists were, according to The Jersey Vindicator. Protesters described the scene as frightening and stressful, and they feared they would be arrested as police rushed and surrounded them.

In the fight against the Trump administration’s agenda of mass incarceration and deportation of migrants, Delaney Hall is one of many flashpoints. These kinds of demonstrations joined or led by leaders from different religions are part of a broader faith-based resistance movement challenging ICE’s tactics. In some cases, as in Newark, the actions are met with force.

Despite the risks, Tanner said she felt called by her religious beliefs to oppose the detention center and its reported practices.

“This just can’t happen under our watch,” said Tanner. “They’re creating these detention facilities that are like concentration camps where basic human rights are being denied.”

When reached for comment by email, GEO Group referred UU World to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees ICE. A DHS public affairs officer responded to UU World’s questions about the May 12 protest—which happened about five months before the magazine emailed for comment—and related issues, with a statement asserting that ICE “will not comment on articles or events that are more than six months old.”

“Allegations and politically driven claims about ICE’s Delaney Hall Detention Facility made six months ago or more do not accurately represent the current conditions at the facility,” according to the DHS statement. “ICE never purposely puts others in danger.”

Though the agency made no mention of the clergy members, it argued that “public safety is of the upmost concern and extreme individuals causing chaos, ensuing violence or obstructing operations outside of our gates will be thwarted.”

Newark Police Department emailed UU World a statement asserting that during the May protests, it provided “public safety services and crowd support” and dealt with mostly traffic incidents.

“Police response was aimed at ensuring the safety of protesters outside the facility, which is located along a high-traffic thoroughfare,” according to the police statement.

Tanner and other Unitarian Universalists expressed outrage at the federal government’s actions and described their resistance to ICE as a matter of moral, spiritual, and legal urgency.

“Our religion called us to this place, to expose this evil,” said Tanner.

Prophetic Witness at a Dangerous Scene

Some UUs at Delaney Hall described the protest as an act of necessary prophetic witness against ICE.

Rev. Anya Sammler-Michael, who serves at the UU Congregation of Montclair, New Jersey, said her UU faith drives her to “struggle against” the treatment of immigrants at the facility.

“We are witnessing incredible acts of hate being perpetuated by our government, across our nation and to the most vulnerable among us,” Sammler-Michael said.

Erol Delos Santos, a graduate of Union Theological Seminary who is preparing for the UU ministry, said he was inspired to protest ICE after witnessing the agency’s wave of arrests and deportations in other parts of the country, such as the arrest of legal U.S. resident and pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil.

“I felt like I had to do something,” said Delos Santos, who is a first-generation Filipino immigrant. “All it would take for ICE to arrest me is for me to not have ID with me that day.”

At the Delaney Hall protest in May, Delos Santos said, ICE agents trying to break the line of protesters grabbed and pushed him aside.

Delos Santos said he felt a moral and spiritual imperative to protest ICE, even at the risk of arrest and physical harm.

“Immigrants are the driving force of this country,” he said. “And it’s not fair to be able to lock people up for no reason.

A Pattern of Violence Against Protesters—and Members of Congress

Three days before the clergy protest, on May 9, another confrontation with ICE officers at Delaney Hall led to the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka.

Baraka and three members of Congress, including New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver, attempted to tour and inspect the detention center and were told to leave, according to NBC News.

“The situation devolved when ICE ran out of the gate and roughed up the congressional delegation,” said Tanner, who was there during Baraka’s arrest.

ICE agents were “being incredibly rough,” pushing and shoving the congressional delegation, and Tanner said she witnessed “an arm jab to the shoulder of one of the congresspeople.”

Federal prosecutors accused Baraka of trespassing. He was released that same evening. The charges against him were later dropped.

As of October 16, McIver faces charges of felony assault and having resisted and impeded law enforcement officers, which she says are baseless and politically motivated, reports the Associated Press. She has pleaded not guilty and faces up to seventeen years in prison if convicted.

Charlene Walker, executive director of Faith in New Jersey, a nonprofit that helped to coordinate the interfaith clergy protest, was present at both events. Walker, who attends the Beacon UU congregation, said police at the May 12 demonstration dragged her away from Delaney Hall by her leg.

“I feel like I should be more traumatized than I am,” said Walker. “But there’s something about standing in righteousness, in my faith, and saying that we can’t tolerate our neighbors being disappeared that I think has given all of us some level of strength.”

Regarding Baraka’s arrest, Walker said that ICE was intentional and aggressive in targeting the mayor and congresspeople.

“If they will put their hands on members of congress,” said Walker, “we have to ask the question: What are they doing behind closed doors where nobody can see?”

‘There is Something that Everyone, Every Single Person, Can Do’

Following the protest, Walker said the situation remains morally and legally dire.

Some lawyers have still been denied visits at times per a NJ.com report, and detainees reportedly have faced inhumane conditions such as hunger. In June, four detainees escaped Delaney Hall amid unrest caused by a lack of meals, according to ABC News.

Sammler-Michael emphasized the value of nonviolent resistance and partnership with other groups and faith communities.

“We should not try and do the work alone,” she said, “and I would say that there is something that everyone, every single person, can do.”

Prophetic witness at Delaney Hall has continued since May. Local congregations and nonprofits regularly lead vigils.

Ruben Torres, 40, has no criminal record apart from minor traffic infractions, according to court records his attorney filed.

“Later that day, he told me he was thinking that he felt like he made it in life,” Ofelia Torres said.","LAKEVIEW — When 16-year-old Ofelia Torres’ father called from the Broadview ICE facility to say he had been taken by four masked federal immigration agents, the teen’s mother was at home helping drain the small IV port that keeps Ofelia nourished and alive during Stage 4, while the teenager showed her cousins how the small medical contraption worked.

For almost a year, Ofelia Torres, a student at Lake View High School, has been receiving treatment for a rare and aggressive form of cancer. She had been home from the hospital for less than a day when the call came Saturday.

She’d just finished 39 days of treatment at Lurie Children’s Hospital, including another grueling round of chemotherapy. The night before her dad disappeared, she walked slowly through her backyard and lay in her own bed for the first time in weeks. The familiar smell of her house, the weight of her blankets, “felt like a dream,” she said.

When the call from an unknown number came in, the dream turned into a nightmare.

“In my head, I knew it,” she said. “I knew they got my dad.”

Ruben Torres, a house painter and self-employed contract worker who has lived in Chicago since 2003 with his partner of 20 years, was detained Saturday in suburban Niles by ICE agents, according to court documents.

Ruben Torres’ attorney, Kalman Resnick, filed an emergency motion asking a federal judge to order his release, arguing that his detention is unlawful and violates his constitutional right to due process.

On Saturday afternoon, Ruben Torres was coming out of a Home Depot at 8650 Dempster St. in Niles when federal agents called for him by name, family members said. Photos and video show signs of forced entry to Ruben Torres’ truck. The passenger-side window was cracked in multiple spots.

Ruben Torres’ partner and Ofelia’s mom, Sandibell, is a DACA recipient who has lived in the United States since 1998. She’s now taking care of their two children alone.

Ruben Torres, 40, has no criminal record apart from minor traffic infractions, according to court records his attorney filed. He’s been his family’s sole provider, working for the same boss for 20 years, while Sandibell cares for their children, Ofelia and 4-year-old Nathan.

Resnick’s filing argues that ICE is holding Ruben Torres under a new interpretation of immigration law rolled out by the Department of Homeland Security in July, which treats long-term residents who entered without inspection as “applicants for admission” subject to mandatory detention — a policy multiple courts around the country have found unlawful.

ICE has not filed formal charges with the immigration court, but Resnick believes the government intends to initiate removal proceedings on the grounds that Ruben Torres entered the United States without inspection. His case is assigned to the Chicago Field Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations.

A bond hearing for Ruben Torres is scheduled for Thursday morning.

“Absent relief, he faces the prospect of months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his community and family, including his terminally ill daughter who may die in the interim,” according to Resnick’s petition.

The doctor overseeing Ofelia Torres’ care at Lurie Children’s Hospital wrote that her “ongoing complex medical care requires the support of both her parents during this very difficult time,” according to court documents.

Valerie Wadycki, Ofelia’s in-home teacher for the past nine months, started a fundraiser to help pay for Ruben Torres’ legal fees. It’s raised over $23,000 in less than two days.

Any funds that are collected that the family doesn’t need will be donated to other families impacted by ICE activity. That was Ofelia Torres’ idea.

“This is a testament to the kind of person her family raised,” Wadycki wrote.

Ofelia Torres decided to share her family’s story thanks to an unrelated nudge her dad gave her at the beginning of her cancer treatment. He thought she should document and share her journey to show people what she’s going through. He thinks vulnerability is a sign of strength, Ofelia Torres said.

“I didn’t want to because I was scared,” she said. “I was scared of what people would think of me.”

But now, things are different. Ofelia Torres didn’t feel like hiding anymore, she said. When she posted a video on social media explaining what happened to her dad, it was the first time even some family members had seen her without her long, dark hair.

“Now he’s in a vulnerable situation, and I feel like I have to step up,” she said. “This is partially a way I can fulfill that. I let everyone know my diagnosis. Most importantly, I let them know what they did to him and what type of person he is.”

Her dad is the “hardest working person” she’s ever met, Ofelia Torres said. He would go to work on three hours of sleep and wouldn’t complain a bit. He’ll often get work based on his reputation alone, she said.

The guys who work with Ruben Torres told Ofelia Torres her dad takes the extra effort to do his work the right way. And yet, he somehow always makes time for his family.

“He’s such a good dad,” Ofelia Torres said. “He’s such a present dad.”

Ofelia Torres got a car for her 15th birthday. After she took it for the ceremonial ride around the block, music blaring from the speakers, her dad was waiting for her on the front porch. He was staring at her when she walked up the sidewalk, but in a weird, dad kind of way, Ofelia said. She thought she had something on her face.

“Later that day, he told me he was thinking that he felt like he made it in life,” Ofelia Torres said. “That everything he had worked for, everything, all those hours he put in, everything he sacrificed, everything that he did was worth it, because his daughter was driving a car by herself.”

The thought of federal agents aggressively removing her dad from his own car ​​is too much to bear.

“To be aggressive with him and violent with him when all he’s wanted in life is to come to this country and work for his kids, it breaks my heart,” Ofelia Torres said. “That’s the case for so many other families, too, and it’s horrible.”

On the morning Ruben Torres was taken, Ofelia Torres had made herself a cup of coffee at home and gave her dad a hug before he left for work. She forgot to eat, so later that morning, she texted him and asked if it was OK to use his card to order breakfast.

Ruben Torres texted her back right away.

“Si,” he wrote.

“He never cares how much I spend on it; he just wants me to let him know ahead of time,” Ofelia said. “And I knew he would see $30 and ask, ‘How much McDonald’s did Nathan eat?’”

She laughed at the thought of the imaginary reaction he would have had, but never got the chance to give.

Her dad sounded calm on the phone, Ofelia said. Strong too.

Like father, like daughter.

end of list

The two countries signed the agreement on Monday, with Belize calling it an act “grounded in the commitment of states to cooperate under the 1951 UN Convention on the Status of Refugees”.

In a statement posted on Facebook, its government press office wrote, “The Agreement reinforces Belize’s commitment to international law and humanitarian principles while ensuring strong national safeguards.”

The US State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, meanwhile, thanked Belize in a post on X.

The deal, it said, was “an important milestone in ending illegal immigration, shutting down abuse of our nation’s asylum system, and reinforcing our shared commitment to tackling challenges in our hemisphere together.”

“Safe third country” agreements are a controversial tactic used to restrict asylum applications: They identify countries asylum seekers can be safely removed to, regardless of whether that is their intended destination.

The details of Monday’s agreement are as yet unclear. But the Central American country indicated it would receive US asylum seekers in exchange for “financial and technical assistance to enhance Belize’s asylum and border management policies”.

Criticisms of third-party deportations

Since Trump returned to office for a second term in January, his administration has repeatedly lobbied third-party countries to accept deportations, though few such deals have been termed “safe third country” accords.

Nearly a dozen countries — including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Eswatini, Mexico, Panama, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda — have since agreed to receive US deportees with no existing ties to their nations.

Just this month, Guatemala received its first deportation flight from the US carrying third-country immigrants.

How safe some of those countries are has been a point of contention. Critics have pointed out that deportees could face abusive prison conditions or a lack of due process in countries like South Sudan, where the US State Department advises its citizens not to travel for fear of armed conflict.

Already, lawyers for five men deported to Eswatini have claimed they have been incarcerated and denied legal hearings.

“Safe third country” agreements, by contrast, are specifically for asylum seekers, and they are meant to assure the rights and wellbeing of those involved.

But critics have long argued that they fail to fully guarantee the safety of asylum seekers, some of whom are removed to countries near the ones they fled, where they could still be vulnerable to persecution.

Some human rights experts also believe “safe third country” agreements could be used to erode adherence to international humanitarian law, allowing wealthy countries like the US to shirk their legal responsibilities to asylum seekers.

In Monday’s statement, Belize sought to dispel any accusation that the Trump administration might be using the Central American nation as a “dumping ground” for migrants, as advocates in other third-party countries have alleged.

Belize claimed it retained “an absolute veto over transfers, with restrictions on nationalities, a cap on transferees, and comprehensive security screenings”.

“No person who is deemed to be a threat to the public safety or national security will be allowed to enter or stay in Belize,” it added.

The deal still needs approval from the Belize Senate.

A growing trend

For its part, the Trump administration has argued that deals with third-party countries are necessary in cases where migrants and asylum seekers are unable to return to their home countries.

In the case of asylum seekers, however, it would be a violation of US and international law to return them to countries where they might face persecution.

Still, in other cases, the US has argued that the deportees’ home countries have refused to accept them.

But recent events have cast doubt on that rationale. In September, for instance, one man deported from the US to Eswatini was sent back to his home country of Jamaica.

This month’s deportation flight to Guatemala also saw Honduran passengers returned to their home country.

Some countries, however, do have policies refusing to accept deportations from the US, even if those transfers involve their own citizens.

Venezuela, for instance, has intermittently refused deportation flights from the US, though in March it reversed course and began accepting them.

The South American had protested the deportation of its citizens from the US to El Salvador, where more than 200 people were sent to a maximum-security prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT) that month.

In July, the Trump administration struck a deal that allowed the Venezuelans imprisoned in El Salvador to be returned to their home country, in exchange for the release of US citizens and political prisoners held in Venezuela.

But Venezuela-US relations have since soured once more, leaving the future of deportation flights to Caracas unclear.

As Belize faces the prospect of accepting asylum seekers who are unable to return to their home country, some politicians have already voiced strong opposition.

Tracy Taegar Panton, an opposition leader in Belize, questioned whether her country should even qualify as a “safe third country”.

“To be designated a ‘Safe Third Country,’ Belize must demonstrate that it can guarantee human rights protections and provide a high standard of care including access to housing, healthcare, legal representation, and social services for asylum seekers,” she wrote on social media.

“The reality, however, is stark. Our immigration and asylum systems are understaffed, underfunded, and overwhelmed.”

She added that the agreement was beyond the country’s capacity to fulfil.

If Trump has become a king, then Congress is the court jester who has allowed it to happen.
Under President George W. Bush, Congress passed the Patriot Act which transferred significant decision-making authority from the courts and Congress to the executive branch allowing surveillance, searches and detentions with minimal external review.
The Bush administration also promoted Unitary Executive Theory which justified the President’s ability to interpret laws independently of Congress and the court.
Following the lead of his predecessors, President Trump has pushed the limits of executive branch authority.","This past weekend, hundreds of thousands of people participated in “No Kings” rallies across the country, including here in West Virginia, to protest Trump administration policies. The overarching theme of the rallies was that President Trump has pushed the authority of the executive branch too far and by doing so has turned the presidency into the singular source of power in the government.

If Trump has become a king, then Congress is the court jester who has allowed it to happen.

Since the turn of the century, Congress has become a vestigial organ of the three equal branches of government, unable to perform the most basic duties. The federal government is shutdown and federal employees are either furloughed or working without a paycheck because members of congress are unable to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government for several weeks, let alone pass all 12 appropriations bills on time.

Republicans and Democrats the House of Representatives and the Senate have been willing participants in the expansion of executive branch authority and only raise alarm when a member of the opposite party is in the White House.

Under President George W. Bush, Congress passed the Patriot Act which transferred significant decision-making authority from the courts and Congress to the executive branch allowing surveillance, searches and detentions with minimal external review. The Bush administration also promoted Unitary Executive Theory which justified the President’s ability to interpret laws independently of Congress and the court.

President Barack Obama continued the trend of expanding presidential authority using executive action in 2012 to establish the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. The administration delayed key provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) despite statutory deadlines in the law itself. The administration unilaterally set new climate regulations, used executive orders to establish new restrictions on the Second Amendment and used signing statements challenging or interpreting congressional intent in appropriations and national security legislation.

Congress even conceded its power to approve treaties when it passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, allowing President Obama to lift sanctions on Iran and implement a new nuclear agreement without formal congressional approval.

The expansion continued under the Biden administration as the president used executive orders to reverse many of the policies of the first Trump presidency, bypassing Congress to set policy in key areas like civil rights, climate and public health. President Biden attempted to cancel vast amounts of federal student loan debt through executive action and sidestep Congress setting new immigration policy for asylum seekers, refugee caps and enforcement protocols.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress have taken turns over the last quarter century expressing their outrage or approval of the executive branch’s actions, depending on who is in the White House. Congress has allowed current and past presidents to assume increasing authority either through legislative action or by simply ignoring its responsibilities.

Following the lead of his predecessors, President Trump has pushed the limits of executive branch authority. He is not a king and a new president will be elected in 2028. It is up to Congress to restore balance and to fulfill its responsibilities and obligations rather than engage in political theatre that more closely resembles a satirical skit befitting the court jester, than actual governance.",https://wvmetronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/metronews-plug.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 18:57:14.450583

Expulsions and deportations of people to third countries where they face arbitrary imprisonment, torture, return to danger in home countries, and other rights violations.
“Every act of dehumanization sends a dangerous message to the world that human rights are negotiable.
We are deeply grateful to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for its work monitoring and speaking out against the unlawful human rights violations perpetrated by the U.S. government.
We urge the Inter-American Commission to investigate — the United States should not be held to a different standard than the rest of the international community.”","Following a July 24, 2025 public hearing held by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) that examined widespread human rights and refugee law violations inflicted by the U.S. government, a coalition of immigrants’ rights organizations that participated in the hearing submitted a follow-up report to the Commission this week. The organizations include Al Otro Lado, Americans for Immigrant Justice, Amnesty International, the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, Haitian Bridge Alliance, Hope Border Institute, Human Rights First, Immigrant Defenders Law Center, Instituto para las Mujeres en la Migración, the International Refugee Assistance Project, Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, RAICES, and Refugees International.

The report addresses questions raised by the Commissioners during the public hearing and includes recommendations for IACHR to investigate and document the mass human rights abuses committed by the United States. Since the hearing took place, the human rights situation in the United States has only deteriorated further. The report documents worsening abuses in the immigration context including:

Disappearances of immigrants who are unfindable in government custody for prolonged periods, causing severe anguish for families and making legal representation impossible. Recently, over 1,000 people reportedly disappeared from a single detention center.

Arbitrary detention in life-threatening conditions, including in dangerous ICE jails where at least 16 people have died from January to September 2025, with reports of delayed or denied medical care leading up to some of the deaths.

Skyrocketing illegal arrests, detention, deportation, and assaults against immigrants, including families with children, U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, refugees, asylum seekers, and people with Temporary Protected Status.

Unbearable conditions, medical neglect, and abuses in immigration jails that inflict trauma on adults and children, with one fourteen-year-old child recounting: “[b]eing here has affected my little brother a lot. He doesn’t sleep well. He cries all night. Yesterday he had an attack where he would not stop crying from 7pm to 9pm and he was outside the room crying that he didn’t want to go back in and that he wanted to be free.”

Widespread separation of immigrant parents from their babies, toddlers, and children, with reports of families seeking asylum in the United States forced to choose between being separated from their children or returning to persecution; children placed in foster care after their parents are detained; and children dragged from their beds, zip-tied, and separated from parents.

Expulsions and deportations of people to third countries where they face arbitrary imprisonment, torture, return to danger in home countries, and other rights violations. The U.S. government has carried out some of these forced removals in violation of court orders and with little to no transparency around the terms of the agreements with third countries.

Mass violations of due process protections and refugee law resulting from the government’s systematic efforts to strip people of the right to an immigration hearing regardless of how long they have lived in the United States, and to shut down asylum processing for people fleeing to the United States-Mexico border.

Attempts to conceal abuses and block legal access, including reprisals against lawyers, advocates, journalists, and governmentofficials; the dismantling of oversight agencies; and the denial of statutorily-mandated access to detention centers for Members of Congress.

“The disappearances, mass arrests and detentions, abusive detention conditions, and other human rights violations occurring in the United States threaten all communities and undermine our Nation’s most fundamental values,” Sui Chung, Executive Director, Americans for Immigrant Justice. “We call on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the U.S. Government, and the public to shine light on these problems and take decisive action to end them. The time is now to confront these violations with transparency and urgency.”

“The Trump administration is terrorizing immigrants in the United States through mass disappearance and detention tactics that have caused family separation, increasingly concerning deaths in detention, and third country deportations to danger,” said Margaret Cargioli, directing attorney, policy and advocacy, at Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef). “We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to continue to monitor and report on the Trump administration’s immigration tactics, as well as to conduct site visits of detention facilities as people’s lives are at risk.”

“In less than a year, we have seen this administration strip noncitizens of due process rights, separate families, and deport people to countries they’ve never been to before,” said Maria Fernanda Palacios Herrera, Policy Counsel at the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP). “The international community must speak out against the widespread terror and violence inflicted upon asylum seekers, refugees, and immigrant communities by the Trump administration. We respectfully request the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights call on the United States government to cease these human rights violations immediately.”

“The cruelty inflicted on immigrants in the United States reverberates far beyond its borders,” said Taylor Koehler, Policy & Programs Staff Attorneyat theCenter for Human Rights and Constitutional Law (CHRCL). “Every act of dehumanization sends a dangerous message to the world that human rights are negotiable. As a global community, we cannot allow that precedent to take hold. We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to act with urgency and use every tool within its power to protect immigrants and uphold fundamental human rights in the United States.”

“The Trump administration’s policies are sowing fear and forcing people to make terrible decisions, violently uprooting community members, separating families, disappearing people to abusive detention conditions and to countries where they are in danger or that they don’t know,” said Yael Schacher, Director for the Americas and Europe at Refugees International. “We ask that the IACHR help to stop these violations of human rights by documenting harm, demanding accountability, and promoting an alternative, humane approach to migrants and asylum seekers in countries throughout the Americas.”

“Over the course of the past 10 months, the administration has continued to escalate its attacks on immigrants throughout the United States, both living in our communities and in immigration detention,” said Laura St. John, Legal Director at the Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project. “Our clients are reporting extremely alarming conditions in detention centers, more people are at risk of being removed to third countries to which they have no ties, and immigration enforcement is terrorizing our communities. We urge the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to sound the alarm on danger and violence that immigrant communities in the United States are being subjected to and ask the Commission to demand that the U.S. government immediately halt all actions that violate the human rights of immigrants in the United States.”

“My colleagues and I know the truth behind the charade. The goal is the money. The strategy is shock and awe. The tactic is terror. The tactic is violence. The tactic is torture. Sadly, this administration no longer needs to work with Central American dictators to house innocent men in mega-prisons because there’s a burgeoning one here at Ft. Bliss,” said Marisa Limón Garza, Executive Director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center.

“This year, we have witnessed people kidnapped from their communities, separated from their children, and arbitrarily detained in deplorable conditions,” said Yannick Gill, Senior Counsel at Human Rights First. “The escalating violations of U.S. and international law deny migrants and asylum seekers their rights under the law. We are deeply grateful to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for its work monitoring and speaking out against the unlawful human rights violations perpetrated by the U.S. government. We urge the United States to end its systematic attacks on immigrants, the dismantling of oversight mechanisms, and retaliation against advocates who seek to shine a light on its rights abuses.”

“The U.S. government is terrorizing people, destroying their physical and mental health in horrendous detention conditions, refusing to listen to their asylum claims, retaining their personal property including original ID documents, and then sending them to Mexico,” said Gretchen Kuhner, Director of the Institute for Women in Migration (IMUMI). “Once in Mexico they have no information, no documentation, and are either dumped in the streets near the Mexico-Guatemalan border or deported to their countries of origin. In just nine months, Mexico has received over 11,000 third country nationals from the U.S., many of whom have been separated from their families. We urge the IACHR to denounce these egregious human rights violations that have stripped people of their basic dignity.”

“The United States government continues to wield its outsized and unaccountable geo-political power to enact brutal, prevention-through-deterrence migration policies—where brutality towards certain people seeking lawful protections is the point—and to strong-arm other States in the Americas to do the same,” said Erik Crew, Staff Attorney at Haitian Bridge Alliance (HBA). “These policies continue to target those who should be protected by the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Inter-American Democratic Charter, and the American Convention on Human Rights. We urge the Commission to investigate these escalating violations and hold accountable all States in the region whose bilateral agreements empower these attacks on international human rights, refugee protections, and basic human dignity.”

“As we continue to support migrant families on the U.S. side of the border looking for their relatives in immigration detention, attending to their urgent needs for pastoral and mental health care, and arranging care for their kids in the midst of the true fear of being separated, we also accompany others stranded in Mexico due to the closure of our border to those most vulnerable. This is not just a law enforcement campaign, it’s terror,” said Jesús de la Torre, Assistant Director for Global Migration at the Hope Border Institute. “We thank the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights for listening to the testimonies of all the mothers, neighbors and friends who have been brutally impacted by these policies, and we encourage the Commission to keep shedding light on these systemic abuses. The borderlands know well that, in the persistent fight for human dignity, fear never has the last word. We stand committed to uphold our welcoming identity and will continue to organize to support policies that keep families together and help our communities thrive.”

“From Inauguration Day onward, the Trump administration has weaponized racist pretext as a means to further the president’s anti-immigrant agenda,” said Javier Hidalgo, legal director at RAICES. “At RAICES, we are deeply troubled by the administration’s consistent opacity and lack of procedural safeguards, but we will not be swayed from our fight for due process and against the unlawful disappearance of people and families. Let us be clear, what we say to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, we also say to the world: fundamental humanitarian protections should never be up for debate.”

“The U.S. government has long treated immigrants with cruelty — abusive detention practices, family separation, and racial profiling are not new. What’s different now is the scale,” said Hollie Webb, Supervising Attorney for Al Otro Lado’s Border Rights Project. “The Trump administration has taken decades of abusive policies and turned them into a machinery of mass disappearance, deportation, and fear. These practices never should have been allowed to exist, and it’s because past abuses were ignored that this government can now act with total impunity. We urge the Inter-American Commission to investigate — the United States should not be held to a different standard than the rest of the international community.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/acf6ac_885405d6f8aa4a65bc54f0a9e839f951~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_940,h_705,al_c/acf6ac_885405d6f8aa4a65bc54f0a9e839f951~mv2.png",N,,2025-10-21 16:01:33.576674

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) says an illegal immigrant who was previously deported allegedly killed a 61-year-old man in September.

The DHS said Wilmer Fuentes Mejia allegedly killed 61-year-old Richard Ferguson Jr. in a hit-and-run crash in Durham, North Carolina, on Sept. 13. ICE lodged an immigration detainer for Mejia.

The agency said Mejia first entered the U.S. illegally in 2015 and was released into the country during the Obama administration.

He was ordered to be removed by an immigration judge in December 2019 and was removed by ICE in 2020 during the first Trump administration, but illegally returned at a later date, officials said. Mejia is from Guatemala.

Mejia has a criminal history that includes prior arrests for assault and driving under the influence.

""Wilmer Fuentes Mejia is a criminal illegal alien from Guatemala who has a history of driving while intoxicated and was previously deported by ICE in 2020. A local DA allowed him to walk free after multiple DUIs only to then cause this fatal hit-and-run that killed an innocent 61-year-old man in North Carolina,"" said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. ""Richard Ferguson Jr. will get justice. ICE lodged a detainer for this criminal to ensure this menace and public safety threat isn't released back onto America’s streets.""

According to WRAL, Ferguson Jr. was killed after Mejia allegedly drove off the road and hit two signs before hitting the 61-year-old.

News of the meeting alarmed some immigration advocates, who have requested more information from the Sheriff’s Office and Board of Supervisors.","Federal authorities pressed Sonoma County Sheriff Eddie Engram in a face-to-face meeting earlier this month to expand cooperation with their immigration agents by easing limits on information his department shares about detainees in county jail.

Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Sgt. Juan Valencia said Engram declined to change the department’s policies.

The Oct. 8 meeting at the Sheriff’s Office was requested by Sergio Albarran, field office director for removal operations at Immigration and Customs Enforcement in San Francisco, with jurisdiction that includes Sonoma County.

In addition to Albarran, the meeting also included two other representatives of the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, as well as Engram and two other members of the Sheriff’s Office. Sonoma County Board of Supervisors Chair Lynda Hopkins also attended at the sheriff’s invitation.

Immigration officials acknowledged pressure from within the Trump administration to meet certain targets and objectives tied to the president’s vow to carry out the largest mass deportation in modern U.S. history, Hopkins said, although they didn’t share what those metrics are.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to emailed questions.

State laws tightly limit cooperation between California law enforcement agencies and ICE, including restricted access to local jails and information about people in custody unless they’ve committed “serious” or “violent” felonies. Local jurisdictions can go even further.

In Sonoma County, Engram has taken steps to narrow when his agency responds to requests from ICE – no longer notifying ICE about people with offenses that fall on the line between a misdemeanor and a felony or when someone is just charged versus convicted of a crime.

Immigrant rights advocates have been pushing the Sheriff’s Office to end any information sharing at all with ICE, especially as immigration enforcement has ramped up, with aggressive tactics that have pushed legal boundaries to meet quotas tied to President Trump’s mass deportation campaign.

Immigration enforcement in the area would continue to be targeted for now, Homeland Security officials said in the Sheriff’s Office meeting, according to Hopkins, in contrast with the larger sweeps deployed in other communities.

Hopkins specifically asked they not target people seeking social services, she said, and brought up the ICE arrest in March of a man in the lobby of the county probation department. The undisclosed operation by plainclothes agents in an unmarked white van caused panic and confusion among county workers and community members.

“They said they’re not planning at this point to target people accessing social services and regional parks or churches, schools and farms – that that is not their current strategy,” Hopkins said. Still, she acknowledged, “we don’t know at what point people and policies change.”

Generally, the meeting was framed as an opportunity for Homeland Security leadership for the region, which spans from Santa Clara up to the Oregon border, to meet the heads of law enforcement in the territory, Valencia and Hopkins said.

Valencia described it as casual and conversational. Hopkins said the meeting remained so after Engram rejected the request to loosen local policy. “It certainly wasn’t confrontational,” Hopkins said.

Hopkins made brief mention of the meeting when the Board of Supervisors convened Oct. 14 and at a previous meeting with immigration advocates, although few details were shared at the time.

News of the meeting alarmed some immigration advocates, who have requested more information from the Sheriff’s Office and Board of Supervisors.

“Any increase in ICE activity in our county is alarming and terrifying not only to people who are undocumented but to their families and to the communities who care about them,” said Renee Saucedo, who helps lead the Sanctuary Coalition of Sonoma County.

“I think that every single person in our county should be alarmed and worried about people’s basic civil rights and human rights being violated,” she said.

She noted that at least 20 people have been arrested by ICE this year, according to the North Bay Rapid Response Network, which responds to immigration raids and arrests with legal and other support.

Escalating immigration enforcement and tactics have intensified local advocates’ calls for Sonoma County to follow some other jurisdictions’ lead and enact a sanctuary ordinance, including full noncollaboration by the Sheriff’s Office with ICE.

“As far as we know in places like Portland and Chicago, (ICE) is still covering their faces, still heavily armed, they’re still breaking car windows, hitting cars with their vehicles, still pushing people down to the ground and using violence, and even if none of those abuses were happening – which they are – we don’t want them in our county,” Saucedo said.

While a sanctuary ordinance “is not a solution to all our problems,” she said, and local officials can’t keep ICE out of the county entirely, “it will send a very loud message that Sonoma County will do everything it can” to protect its immigrant community members, “and that is what we can hope for form our local government.”

The Board of Supervisors in September introduced a proposal to restrict the use of facial coverings by law enforcement officers seeking to hide their identities. The urgency ordinance, put forward by Hopkins and Supervisor Rebecca Hermosillo, would also require officers wear identification and agency insignia when conducting operations in the county-governed area outside cities. It is similar to a new state law set to take effect in January.

Engram has emphasized that beyond the limited information shared about inmates with ICE, which he said is public record, the Sheriff’s Office and local police departments do not enforce federal immigration law, participate in raids, reach out to immigration officials or track immigration status of people booked into the jail. His stance and policies come down to “a balance” between public safety and protecting immigrant communities, he’s said.

The board has so far expressed support for Engram’s position and also resisted calls for a full sanctuary ordinance. Hopkins pointed instead to other opportunities, being undertaken or explored, to support local immigrant communities.

Especially against the backdrop of massive cuts in social safety net funding, “there is a huge world of need,” she said.

The deal appears to be similar to one with Paraguay announced by the U.S. State Department in August that included a “safe third country” agreement in which asylum seekers currently in the U.S. could pursue protections in the South American nation.
In Trump’s first term, the U.S. signed several such agreements that would instead have asylum seekers request protections in other nations, like Guatemala, before proceeding north.
The U.S. has also signed agreements, such as deportation agreements, with war-torn South Sudan, Eswatini and Rwanda.
Belize cannot and must not be used as a dumping ground for individuals other countries refuse to accept,” she wrote.","MEXICO CITY (AP) — The small Central American nation of Belize has signed a “safe third country” agreement with the United States, the two sides said on Monday, as the Trump administration seeks to ramp up deportations and dissuade migration north.

What the agreement entails wasn’t immediately clear, but it comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has increasingly pressured countries in Latin America and Africa to help him carry out his immigration agenda.

The deal appears to be similar to one with Paraguay announced by the U.S. State Department in August that included a “safe third country” agreement in which asylum seekers currently in the U.S. could pursue protections in the South American nation.

In Trump’s first term, the U.S. signed several such agreements that would instead have asylum seekers request protections in other nations, like Guatemala, before proceeding north. The policy was criticized as a roundabout way to make it harder for migrants to seek asylum in the U.S. and was later rolled back by the Biden administration.

Earlier this year, Panama and Costa Rica also accepted U.S. flights of hundreds of deportees from Asian countries – without calling the deals “safe third country” agreements – and thrusting the migrants into a sort of international limbo. The U.S. has also signed agreements, such as deportation agreements, with war-torn South Sudan, Eswatini and Rwanda.

The Belize government said in a statement on Monday that it “retains an absolute veto over transfers, with restrictions on nationalities, a cap on transferees, and comprehensive security screenings.”

The government of the largely rural nation wedged between Mexico and Guatemala reiterated its “commitment to international law and humanitarian principles while ensuring strong national safeguards.” No one deemed to be a public safety threat would be allowed to enter the country, it said.

On Monday, the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs thanked Belize in a post on X, calling the agreement “an important milestone in ending illegal immigration, shutting down abuse of our nation’s asylum system, and reinforcing our shared commitment to tackling challenges in our hemisphere together.”

The decision prompted fierce criticism from politicians in Belize, who railed against the agreement, calling it a “decision of profound national consequence” announced with little government transparency. The agreement must be ratified by Belize’s Senate to take effect.

“This agreement, by its very nature, could reshape Belize’s immigration and asylum systems, impose new financial burdens on taxpayers, and raise serious questions about national sovereignty and security,” Tracy Taegar Panton, an opposition leader in Belize’s parliament, wrote on social media.

She noted fierce criticisms of human rights violations resulting from similar policies carried out by both the U.S. and Europe.

“Belize is a compassionate and law-abiding nation. We believe in humanitarian principles. But compassion must never be confused with compliance at any cost. Belize cannot and must not be used as a dumping ground for individuals other countries refuse to accept,” she wrote.",https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/bec95f2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4823x2713+0+251/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fdd%2Fac%2F711bd638e911f162a836d36f1d96%2F1ba90741828f4db09b588cf457c64791,N,,2025-10-21 12:56:39.685903

Following the Observer’s reporting, the account was set to private, but it is still active and routinely opines on issues including immigration.
Veasey is one of three Congress members who have requested information from the agency about Rodden.
A spokesperson for Veasey told the Observer the congressman has since continued to seek answers from ICE regarding Rodden.
“It’s ridiculous that there’s a white supremacist that would be working at an ICE facility.","Democratic Congressman Marc Veasey made an unannounced visit to a Dallas Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) processing facility on Monday in an effort to demand accountability from the agency, which has failed to substantively respond to multiple inquiries from the congressman—including one stemming from a Texas Observer investigation earlier this year.

“I’m here today to get answers,” Veasey said. “I have letters from myself and other members of Congress and we’re simply asking for answers.”

Veasey, who wanted to carry out an inspection at the Dallas Field Office (which is part processing center and part administrative space), was not granted entry despite having authority as a member of Congress to conduct unannounced oversight visits to Department of Homeland Security facilities. “There’s a lot of secrecy and game playing right now,” Veasey said. “I’m sick of it.”

On February 19, the Observer reported that James “Jim” Joseph Rodden—an ICE assistant chief counsel representing the agency in immigration court in Dallas—operates a white supremacist X account named GlomarResponder, based on an overwhelming number of biographical details that the Observer matched through publicly available documents, other social media activity, and courtroom observation. Reached in-person at the time, Rodden said only to “call [his] press office,” and an ICE spokesperson said the agency “will not comment on the substance of this article pending further investigation.”

The GlomarResponder account has posted that “Migrants’ are all criminals” and that “All blacks are foreign to my people,” in addition to posting apparent praise of Adolf Hitler, among numerous other similar posts. Following the Observer’s reporting, the account was set to private, but it is still active and routinely opines on issues including immigration. “How about we deport all the people who don’t belong here, rather than turn nice neighborhoods into third world bug hives,” GlomarResponder wrote on June 28.

It is unclear whether Rodden still works for ICE.

Following the Observer‘s initial story, Rodden was not present at court hearings where he was scheduled to appear. “Rodden has not been spotted at the Executive Office for Immigration Review courts, but the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor also has not confirmed if he was fired,” an immigration attorney who works in Dallas and asked not to be named told the Observer on Monday. “Even the government attorneys I’ve spoken with cannot get a clear answer on that.”

The Observer has repeatedly requested an update from ICE about Rodden’s employment, but the agency has declined to answer. Veasey is one of three Congress members who have requested information from the agency about Rodden.

On February 24, Veasey sent a letter about the Observer’s reporting to then-acting deputy director of ICE Kenneth Genalo demanding “a full and transparent account of what actions your agency is taking to investigate this matter” and a response within 30 days.

On March 6, ICE responded to Veasey in a letter, in which it acknowledged “recent media reports alleging an ICE employee operated a white supremacist social-media account” and stated that the ICE Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) “understands the seriousness of the allegations and will ensure the allegations are addressed appropriately, fairly, and expeditiously.”

The letter, which the Observer reviewed, further stated that typically “OPR administrative investigations are completed within 120 days” and that “OPR is unable to share additional information regarding this matter.” The letter did not confirm Rodden’s status with the agency, and Veasey condemned the lack of clarity later that month.

A spokesperson for Veasey told the Observer the congressman has since continued to seek answers from ICE regarding Rodden. Now, well past ICE’s own internal 120-day estimate for the duration of the investigation, Veasey’s office still has not received a second response or any substantive information.

“We have not heard anything back,” Veasey told the Observer. “It’s ridiculous that there’s a white supremacist that would be working at an ICE facility. That makes absolutely no sense other than the fact that they want to signal to the other white supremacists and other KKK people out there that under this administration things are going to be different and you’re not going to have to worry about losing your job.”

The status of the investigation into Rodden wasn’t the only unanswered inquiry Veasey sought to address during his Monday visit to the Dallas ICE center.

On July 28, Veasey sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Acting Director of ICE Todd Lyons, demanding immediate answers regarding credible reports of inhumane treatment of detainees at the facility. And on September 30, Veasey sent another letter to Noem and Lyons demanding immediate answers regarding the handling of immigration appointments at the location, following the September 24 shooting at the site, which ultimately left two detainees dead, and the ongoing federal government shutdown, which has caused appointments, including citizenship ceremonies, to be canceled.

“We’ve heard awful stories about sleep deprivation, about people being denied food and water, and about people being held in this facility longer than they should,” Veasey said during a press conference following his attempted site visit. “I don’t know what’s going on in there, but if what is being told to me is wrong, open up the doors and show me.”",https://www.texasobserver.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/BeFunky-collage-9-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 13:17:37.028843

In Klickitat County in southwest Washington, Sheriff Bob Songer has publicly supported immigration enforcement efforts and expressed willingness to collaborate with federal agents.","OLYMPIA, Wash. — A new report reveals federal immigration authorities have been accessing automated license plate reader systems operated by local police departments across Washington state, potentially violating a state law that prohibits collaboration with civil immigration enforcement.

The disclosures, contained in a report released by the University of Washington Center for Human Rights, show that U.S. Border Patrol conducted thousands of searches using data from 31 Washington police agencies, many of which did not authorize such access.

The findings have prompted several police departments to restrict access to their surveillance systems and investigate how federal agents gained entry.

Widespread access through local systems

The automated license plate readers, primarily Flock-brand cameras mounted along busy streets, are designed to help local police find stolen vehicles, track criminal suspects and solve crimes. When officers input a license plate number or vehicle description, the systems generate alerts if matching vehicles pass by.

But records obtained by University of Washington researchers show U.S. Border Patrol, ICE and other federal agencies appear on approved user lists for some departments, including Auburn, which operates 20 Flock cameras throughout the city.

""I worry it's being used for civil immigration enforcement,"" said Angelina Godoy, director of the UW Center for Human Rights. ""I worry it could be used to just round up people where there's no criminal case whatsoever. And that's a violation of our state law.""

In a statement, Auburn police said the department is ""still working to determine how Border Patrol was able to gain access"" to its system and has begun running monthly reports to identify and revoke access for agencies using the data for immigration purposes.

'Side door' access creates accountability gap

Even departments that never approved access for immigration agents discovered their data had been shared with federal authorities through what researchers describe as ""side door"" access.

In Renton, which operates 24 Flock cameras, Police Chief Jon Schuldt said he only recently learned that immigration agents had been accessing his department's data through other law enforcement agencies, including Michigan State Police and Florida Highway Patrol, which searched Renton's system on behalf of Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""That would be absolutely unauthorized on our end,"" Schuldt said. ""We did not give permission for any federal agencies to be able to have access into our system.""

The chief said Renton has restricted access for all outside agencies until the department can determine how the breach occurred.

""I can't say enough appreciation for the University of Washington for sharing this information with us,"" he said.

State law prohibits immigration collaboration

The data sharing appears to violate Washington's Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, which prohibits local law enforcement agencies from using state resources to collaborate with civil immigration enforcement.

""Local law enforcement agencies in our state are prohibited by state law from using state resources to collaborate with civil immigration enforcement,"" Godoy said.

The University of Washington findings follow a KING 5 investigation in July that revealed the Washington Department of Licensing had unknowingly shared licensing data with immigration authorities, also in violation of state law.

Researchers say many of the data releases may have been unintentional, though not all cases appear accidental.

In Klickitat County in southwest Washington, Sheriff Bob Songer has publicly supported immigration enforcement efforts and expressed willingness to collaborate with federal agents.

""I want to send a message to ICE: If you need any help at all, put me on speed dial,"" Songer said in a Facebook video. The sheriff's office has been seeking to install Flock cameras in the county.

In an interview with KING 5, Sheriff Songer said he has not been able yet to find the funding for Flock cameras, but he would likely allow immigration agents to access that data if he had it. Sheriff Songer said law agencies have an obligation to assist immigration efforts.",https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/a66988e5-0f4d-4125-9f47-e83dbac7e66b/20251021T045843/a66988e5-0f4d-4125-9f47-e83dbac7e66b_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 11:58:00.373150

So, it’s important for those who work in health care to have an awareness of that.","Increased immigration enforcement and policy changes have resulted in a record-high number of people, including children, being held in detention facilities. This has exacerbated the health threats these communities face, says Faisal Al-Juburi, chief external affairs officer for the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services (RAICES), a Texas-based nonprofit that provides legal aid to immigrants, refugees, and asylum seekers.

Lawyers and immigration advocates have sounded the alarm about conditions in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities, from family separations to poor nutrition and water to failure to provide access to medical care.

“These are all things that don’t just yield acute concerns, but also long-term health considerations,” Al-Juburi says.

The recent policies may damage the trust between doctors and their patients, potentially preventing people from seeking medical care for fear of being detained.

It’s a challenge that doctors and health systems across the country will have to grapple with, particularly in Texas and Florida, where hospitals have been directed to collect information on patients’ legal statuses.

Al-Juburi will join John Garland, pastor of San Antonio Mennonite Church, to speak about current strategies for health care professionals to face these challenges at Beyond the Chart: Stories at the Intersection of Immigration and Health, a session at Learn Serve Lead 2025: The AAMC Annual Meeting in San Antonio on Nov. 3, 2025.

AAMCNews spoke with Al-Juburi about the changes in immigration enforcement, their impact on health, and what leaders in academic medicine can do about it.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

What is RAICES’ mission?

RAICES has been around for nearly 40 years. We’re headquartered in San Antonio, but have a presence across Texas and a strong national reach. We center our programming on legal services for immigrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking people and families, because access to legal representation is one of the single most effective ways to ensure that members of our community can secure some type of relief.

Success rates are currently fluctuating amid changes within this administration. Historically, however, people and families with legal representation are anywhere from two times to ten-and-a-half times more likely to receive immigration relief than those without, depending upon the circumstances of their respective cases. We see a direct correlation between access to legal representation and the ability to exercise fundamental due process rights.

At Learn Serve Lead, you’ll be speaking about stories at the intersection of immigration and health. From what you’ve seen through your work and through your own experience, how does immigration intersect with health care, and what does that look like when those two issues come together?

The important thing to remember is that immigrants are not a monolith. “Immigrant,” in and of itself, is not an identity. Immigration advocacy is one of the most intersectional policy issues because it intersects with every aspect of what it means to be a human, from health care and the economy to labor and racial justice. Immigration policy can perpetuate systemic disenfranchisement, leading to economic issues, including and especially obstacles to health care access. We are looking into the conditions within detention facilities run by private prison contractors, where the United States holds people and families, and where children are being subjected to circumstances that have led to significant weight loss in infants, premature graying in teens, and notable mental and behavioral health concerns. We’re also starting to see the recurrence of family-separation practices.

These are all things that don’t just yield acute concerns, but also long-term health considerations, including compounded multigenerational trauma within immigrant families. When anyone immigrates to the United States, we must remember that they do not easily leave their countries of origin. These are not decisions that are made on a whim. They are often fleeing life-or-death circumstances. So, they experience not only the trauma from their lived experiences abroad, but also the trauma of the migration experience, as well as the trauma that is, again, inflicted by the policies of this country.

How have conditions changed for these communities under the current administration?

Unfortunately, circumstances for immigrant people and families have deteriorated under the current administration. However, I often say that, for those of us working in immigration, it is easy to be nonpartisan because neither side of the aisle has done right by this community and, because of that, has not done right by the American people. What is concerning is the perpetuation of a culture of fear. To be able to create a larger deportable population, lots of people with temporary lawful status have had that status revoked, thereby making certain communities more vulnerable to apprehension and deportation.

Since March we’ve seen that the extended detention of families has recommenced. Conditions under which children are held in government custody have historically been governed by the Flores Settlement Agreement, which was established in 1997 and created guardrails for the treatment of children. But these guardrails have largely been ignored under this administration. Children are not supposed to be held in government custody for more than 20 days. Now RAICES is seeing detentions of 80 or more days in family detention centers.

We’re also seeing families being separated and this being used as a weapon against those who have endeavored to exercise their due process rights. Families that RAICES has served this year have been separated for periods as long as five months.

Those impacted are not only families that were apprehended at the border, but also families that have been here for as long as 10 years, if not longer. We’ve seen families who had active asylum cases and were apprehended when they showed up to fulfill their lawful obligation at immigration court, for their asylum hearing. These conditions are quite different from even those under the first Trump administration.

One of the goals of your session is to talk about creating a safe space for healing for people in these immigrant, refugee, and asylum-seeking populations. What do you think doctors and people giving care to these communities should be keeping in mind as they do their work?

I’m not in the medical field myself, but my whole family is in the medical field. My father is a physician. In any space, but especially here, you look at the importance of trust building. The reality is, the stronger the trust bond, the greater the likelihood of more complete disclosure from patients to doctors, thereby ensuring they can receive adequate treatment. But this is a community with whom trust building will likely be a lot more difficult moving forward.

For instance, in Texas, the governor issued an executive order that directs both public and private hospitals receiving public funding to ask the immigration status of their patients. That has definitely created fear and consternation among our community members. So, it’s important for those who work in health care to have an awareness of that.

For families that have been detained, there’s a strong likelihood that there will be several issues, specifically for children, to watch out for as a result of their time in detention: undernourishment, severe gastrointestinal issues, mental health conditions, and other results of negligence.

With these patient populations, doctors should be aware, especially in the increasingly corporate mindset at health systems, that efficiency is probably not going to be what will yield the strongest health outcomes.

What do you hope attendees take away from your talk?

I hope attendees gain an understanding of the diversity of the populations we’re talking about when we discuss immigration, as well as the diversity of their needs, the impact of public policy, specifically as it revolves around immigrant health, and, particularly, the long-term impacts on immigrant health. I also hope that people, especially those in positions of power, grasp the importance of not relinquishing the fundamental human and legal rights of this population.

The fact of the matter is that, if we care about public health, then we should care about how public policy — immigration policy — is impacting the lives of millions, and the long-term ramifications that impact holds.

I want this session to be an opportunity for them to learn about what is happening now. Educating ourselves is the most important first step. The second step is to use whatever positions of power and privilege we have individually and collectively to further that education and to ensure that we, as a nation, are not perpetuating these harms.",https://www.aamc.org/sites/default/files/aamcnews-faisal-al-juburi.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 11:58:04.434647

Gutting the staff who administer IDEA not only threatens the quality education disabled children need, but also undermines Congress’s constitutional authority — and underscores why legislators must enact safeguards[3] to ensure that the Administration follows the laws Congress passes.
With this latest action, the Trump Administration is effectively shuttering OSEP, which distributed $15 billion in federal grants to schools in 2025.
The Administration has been vocal about its desire to dismantle the Education Department, but it lacks the legal authority to make such a change.
And Congress has shown no interest in either ending the Department of Education or moving the special education office.","Earlier this month, the Trump Administration took aim at a vital program with deep bipartisan support[1] that provides screening, accommodations, and interventions for 7.5 million disabled children each year, imperiling their access to the accommodations and services they need to succeed at school. The Administration announced[2] that it intends to fire nearly all the staff responsible for distributing federal funding and ensuring states use it to provide disabled students the supports and services they need to succeed in school, from assistive technology to specialized teachers. Their work makes it possible for students with disabilities to get the free, appropriate public education they are guaranteed by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).

Gutting the staff who administer IDEA not only threatens the quality education disabled children need, but also undermines Congress’s constitutional authority — and underscores why legislators must enact safeguards[3] to ensure that the Administration follows the laws Congress passes.

This reckless and illegal action is another step toward the Administration’s goal of dismantling the Department of Education, which started with firing nearly half its staff in March[4], including the legal staff in the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), who protect disabled students’ rights. With this latest action, the Trump Administration is effectively shuttering OSEP, which distributed $15 billion in federal grants to schools in 2025. These grants pay for special education teachers and aides, speech and occupational therapists, assistive technology, screening and early intervention for infants and toddlers, and other critical services and supports that millions of families rely upon.

IDEA requires that the Education Department verify that states are lawfully supporting students with disabilities before granting funds, and to require states to take corrective action if they are not. Without OSEP staff, it is unclear who will review and certify states’ grant applications and ensure funds are lawfully distributed and that states are using them appropriately.

OSEP staff use a system of reporting, analysis, and auditing to ensure children’s needs are being met. They intervene[5] if a school district systematically isn’t providing an accommodation that students need — for example, not hiring enough speech therapists or purchasing devices that allow non-verbal students to communicate. These cuts come as funding for public schools and the students they serve is already under threat from a growing list of sources[6], including state tax cuts, private school vouchers, and other federal actions.

About 15 percent of students receive services under IDEA. They have conditions such as vision and hearing impairments, speech and language delays, learning disabilities, and developmental disabilities such as autism, Down Syndrome, and intellectual disability. Meeting their needs requires not only funding, but continual oversight and assistance, because school districts often struggle to comply with the law’s requirements. OSEP gives states and school districts the assistance and assurance they need to avoid penalties or prevent a loss of federal funds in the future and, most importantly, to meet the needs of their disabled students.

IDEA has a long history of bipartisan support. Congress and President George H.W. Bush enacted the law on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis in 1990. In 2004, President George W. Bush and Congress reauthorized IDEA with substantial amendments, again with strong bipartisan approval. Despite President Trump’s call during the shutdown to end “Democrat programs[7],” federal IDEA funding benefits students and families in every state[8] and across all political affiliations.

The Administration has been vocal about its desire to dismantle the Education Department, but it lacks the legal authority to make such a change. The President issued an executive order[9] calling for the dissolution of the department, and he has spoken[10] about moving IDEA administration to the Department of Health and Human Services. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought’s Project 2025[11] proposed turning IDEA into a block grant with “no strings attached.”

But an act of Congress is required to dismantle the Department of Education or undo the statutory requirements for the department to administer IDEA[12] and maintain[13] an Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services. The Administration has not requested these changes, including as part of its 2026 budget request[14]. And Congress has shown no interest in either ending the Department of Education or moving the special education office. The 2026 education funding bills approved by the House and Senate Appropriations Committees would not defund the Department of Education nor change its legal responsibility to implement IDEA.",https://www.cbpp.org/sites/default/files/styles/report_580_high_dpi/public/iStock-1134338125.jpg?itok=zbWqi_Gi,N,,2025-10-21 10:57:52.687797

Sheriff: 23 arrested in Butler County during 'Operation Deportation' with ICE

Law enforcement officials have arrested 23 people in connection with a ""targeted operation"" over several days in Butler County. Butler County Sheriff Richard Jones said the arrests were part of an effort called ""Operation Deportation"" where the sheriff's office worked with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The operation resulted in the arrests of 23 people this week who Jones said are ""unlawfully present in the United States.""""The targeted operation, conducted over several days across multiple locations in Butler County, focused on identifying and apprehending individuals with prior criminal convictions, active warrants, or violations of immigration law,"" Jones said.This comes as the federal government will soon pay the Butler County jail even more money to house ICE detainees.Earlier this year, the Butler County Jail restarted it's federal contract with the Department of Homeland Security.When the contract was first approved in February, the county was charging $69 a day for every bed occupied by an ICE detainee.That number is now increasing by more than 50 percent, to $108 a day.The price hike is expected to go into effect sometime next month.The sheriff's department says they expect to bring $14.5 million dollars into the county by the end of the year solely from holding ICE detainees.That's $3 million more than they originally projected. “Our goal is to keep Butler County safe,” Sheriff Jones said. “The 287(g) partnership allows our deputies to work hand-in-hand with ICE to remove individuals who have broken our laws or pose a risk to our community.”

Trump hosts GOP senators in Rose Garden amid White House construction work

Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest news over the next few hours.

We start with the news that president Donald Trump will host Senate Republicans for lunch in the White House’s Rose Garden later today as ongoing demolition work takes place on the building’s East Wing.

A GOP source confirmed the plan for the White House visit to Rollcall, as the president bulldozes on with plans for a new $250m ballroom. The visit also comes amid the partial government shutdown that shows no signs of abating.

Construction crews started demolishing part of the East Wing of the White House to make way for Trump’s planned ballroom, prompting widespread criticism on social media and beyond. One former lawmaker even called the renovation an “​​utter desecration”.

The Washington Post, which obtained and published photos of the demolition activity and cited two eyewitnesses, reported on Monday that demolition was under way, and shared an image showing construction in progress and parts of the exterior ripped down.

Other images, including ones seen in the New York Post, also show demolition of parts of the East Wing. The White House did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.

On his Truth Social platform on Monday, Trump said “ground has been broken on the White House” to build the new ballroom.

President Donald Trump claimed a key victory in a US appeals court Monday as a divided three-judge panel decided he is allowed to deploy federal troops to the city of Portland, Oregon. Trump had claimed the right to send the national guard to the liberal stronghold for the purported purpose of protecting federal property and agents. The ruling marks an important legal victory for Trump as he continues to send military forces to Democratic-led cities.

Oregon governor Tina Kotek, has called on a federal appeals court to review and overturn a decision made by a three-judge panel on Monday that would permit Trump to deploy federalized national guard troops to the streets of Portland against the wishes of state and local officials. Kotek said she hoped the full ninth circuit court of appeals vacates the panel’s 2-1 decision, as the dissenting judge, Portland-based Susan Graber, urged her colleagues to do.

Former FBI director James Comey formally asked a federal judge to dismiss criminal charges against him, arguing he was the victim of a selective prosecution and that the US attorney who filed the charges was unlawfully appointed.

The US government shutdown extended into its 21st day on Tuesday with no resolution in sight, as a prominent Republican lawmaker publicly broke ranks with party leadership over the decision of Mike Johnson, the House speaker, to keep Congress shuttered for weeks.

Trump reposted an AI-generated video of him flying a fighter plane emblazoned with the words “King Trump” and dumping brown sludge onto protestors, in what appears to be a retort to the widespread No Kings protests that took place Saturday against his second presidency.

Trump welcomed Australian PM Anthony Albanese to the White House, signing a rare earth minerals deal. It came amid rising trade tensions with China, which tightened its rare earth exports and is facing a 100% tariff threat from the US.

Johnson says lawmakers are working on 'maximum transparency' in Epstein investigation

At a press conference on day 21 of the government shutdown, Mike Johnson said that lawmakers on the House oversight committee are “working around the clock” to ensure “maximum transparency” in the ongoing investigation into the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein case.

Johnson added that the committee’s work is “already accomplishing” what the bipartisan discharge petition, which would force a vote on the House floor to release the full tranche of Epstein records, seeks to do achieve. The House speaker also said that the commitee’s investigation is “far broader in scope” than what is covered by the discharge petition, and has “already yielded significant results”.

The House oversight committee chair, congressman James Comer of Kentucky, said today that Democrats are using the Epstein case to deflect from the ongoing shutdown. “Let’s be clear, Democrats don’t care about transparency or accountability in this matter,” he said. “The evidence we’ve gathered does not implicate president Trump in any way.”

On Friday, the committee released the transcript of the closed-door interview with Alex Acosta, the labor secretary during Trump’s first administration and the former US attorney for the southern district of Florid, who was accused of giving Epstein a “sweetheart deal” in 2008 – which sentenced the late financier to a 13 month sentence on state prostitution crimes.

In a short while, we’ll hear from House Republican lawmakers as the government shutdown enters day 21, one of the longest on record.

There isn’t a vote scheduled in the Senate on the stopgap funding bill that has failed 11 times in the upper chamber.

However, Senate majority leader John Thune told reporters on Monday that it may be time for the House to consider returning to work in order to pass another resolution, considering the original bill would only keep the government funded until 21 November. “Every day that passes, we’ve got less time to fund the government,” Thune said.

Trump says 'end to Hamas' will be 'fast, furious and brutal' if fighting continues

In a post on Truth Social, the president said that several allies in the Middle East have told him they would “welcome the opportunity” at Trump’s request to go into Gaza “with a heavy force” and “straighten our Hamas” if they “continue to behave badly”.

This comes after the 11-day ceasefire in Gaza was seriously undermined on Sunday when Israel launched waves of deadly airstrikes and said it would cut off aid into the territory “until further notice” after a reported attack by Hamas, which the militant group denied being involved in.

“There is still hope that Hamas will do what is right. If they do not, an end to Hamas will be FAST, FURIOUS, & BRUTAL! I would like to thank all of those countries that called to help,” Trump wrote today, reiterating his threat on Monday, when he said that Hamas would be “eradicated” if they did not “behave”.

JD Vance meets with top envoys in Israel

Vice-president JD Vance touched down in Tel Aviv a short while ago. He then caught up with special envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner for about two hours.

He is currently taking part in private briefings with members of the Israeli military, according to the press pool traveling with the vice-president.

Vance will hold a press conference at 11am ET/6pm local time. And tomorrow he’s set to meet with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

My colleagues, who are covering the latest developments in the Middle East, report that Gaza’s health ministry said in its latest update that the bodies of 13 people were brought to hospitals across the territory in the last 24 hours. It said eight people had been injured over this time period.

This means that at least 68,229 Palestinian people have been killed and 170,369 others injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since 7 October 2023.

Republican senators indicate they won't confirm Paul Ingrassia to special counsel role

Some Republican senators have said they don’t support Paul Ingrassia’s nomination to lead the Office of Special Counsel, ahead of his confirmation hearing on Thursday.

A reminder, Politico reported on Monday that Ingrassia told other Republicans he “has a Nazi streak” and that holidays commemorating Black people should be “eviscerated,” in a private group chat.

Senate majority leader, John Thune, told Politico that Ingrassia is “not gonna pass”. While Republican senator Rick Scott of Florida, told reporters that he would not support the 30-year-old Trump ally.

Politico also reported that James Lankford, the Republican senator from Oklahoma, has “tons of questions” for Ingrassia, adding he “can’t imagine supporting that”.

Donald Trump will be in Washington today. At 11am ET, he’ll take part in a ceremony for the Richard Nixon Architect of Peace Award. This will be in the Oval Office and closed to the press, but we’ll let you know if that changes.

Then, he’ll host a lunch in the Rose Garden, where we can expect Senate Republicans to attend. This, on day 21 of the government shutdown.

At 4pm ET, the president will take place in a Diwali celebration also in the Oval Office, before hosting another function in the Rose Garden at 7pm ET.

A retired member of the US navy who alleges to have lost thousands of dollars meant for his dying dog when the Donald Trump-freed George Santos defrauded him says he now views the president as a “walking middle finger”.

Richard Osthoff’s emotional comments on Monday on MSNBC’s Chris Jansing Reports came three days after Trump commuted Santos’s seven-year, three-month prison sentence, which was given to the former New York representative in connection with federal fraud charges.

Osthoff has previously accused Santos of raising $3,000 on the GoFundMe platform in 2016 to benefit the military veteran’s dying service dog, Sapphire. But Osthoff said Sapphire ended up dying after Santos kept the money for himself – accusations that never led to criminal charges.

Santos has previously called “reports that I would let a dog die … shocking and insane” and denied wrongdoing in a text to the outlet Semafor.

Santos made history in 2022 as the first out LGBTQ+ Republican elected to Congress. He was later exposed for having lied prolifically about his biography, and a House ethics committee detailed how Santos used campaign funds for personal travel, cosmetic treatments and luxury goods.

He ultimately was expelled from Congress, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and identity theft, reported to a federal prison in New Jersey in July, and served three months of the sentence given to him before Trump commuted the punishment on Friday. The commutation from Trump – who won a second presidency in 2024 despite a criminal conviction of falsifying business records – set the stage for Santos to be released from prison on Saturday.

“He lied like hell,” Trump said of his fellow Republican to Newsmax. “But he was 100% for Trump.”

CIA playing ‘most important part’ in US strikes in the Caribbean, sources say

Aram Roston

The Central Intelligence Agency is providing the bulk of the intelligence used to carry out the controversial lethal air strikes by the Trump administration against small, fast-going boats in the Caribbean Sea suspected of carrying drugs from Venezuela, according to three sources familiar with the operations.

Experts say the agency’s central role means much of the evidence used to select which alleged smugglers to kill on the open sea will almost certainly remain secret.

The agency’s central role in the boat strikes has not previously been disclosed. Donald Trump confirmed last Wednesday that he had authorized covert CIA action in Venezuela, but not what the agency would be doing.

The sources say the CIA is providing real-time intelligence collected by satellites and signal intercepts to detect which boats it believes are loaded with drugs, tracking their routes and making the recommendations about which vessels should be hit by missiles.

“They are the most important part of it,” said one of the sources. Two sources said that the drones or other aircraft actually launching the missiles used to sink the boats belong to the US military, not the CIA.

Information the agency gathers against any of the alleged smugglers – dead or alive – is likely to remain classified and out of public view. That is in spite of the worldwide public interest and debate over the killing of civilians.

The agency’s intelligence, unlike information gathered by the DEA or the Coast Guard, which used to handle maritime interdiction operations against smugglers, is not designed as legal evidence.

US district and appeals courts are increasingly rebuking Donald Trump’s radical moves on tackling crime, illegal immigration and other actions where administration lawyers or Trump have made sweeping claims of emergencies that judges have bluntly rejected as erroneous and undermining the rule of law in America.

Legal scholars and ex-judges note that strong court pushback has come from judges appointed by Republicans, including Trump himself, and Democrats, and signify that the administration’s factual claims and expanding executive powers face stiff challenges that have slowed some extreme policies.

Among the toughest rulings were ones this month by Judge Karin Immergut in Oregon and Judge April Perry in Chicago. Both district judges sharply challenged Trump’s plans to deploy national guard troops to deal with minimal violence that Trump had portrayed as akin to “war” zones, spurring the judges to impose temporary restraining orders.

Immergut, whom president Trump nominated for the court in his first term, rejected Trump’s depiction of Portland as “war-ravaged”, and in need of saving from “Antifa and other domestic terrorists” concluding that the “president’s determination was simply untethered to the facts”. But a court of appeals ruled on 20 October that Trump could send national guard troops to the city.

Elsewhere, district judge William Young in Boston issued a scathing 161-page ruling last month calling some of Trump’s deportation policies illegal efforts to deport non-citizen activists at colleges in violation of their first amendment rights “under the cover of an unconstitutionally broad definition of antisemitism”. Young was nominated by Ronald Reagan.

Some former appeals court judges say that the district courts and courts of appeals are responding appropriately to a pattern of unlawful conduct by Trump and his top deputies.

A Donald Trump nominee who is scheduled for a confirmation hearing this week told other Republicans he “has a Nazi streak” and that holidays commemorating Black people should be “eviscerated,” according to a report based on a private group chat.

Trump nominated Paul Ingrassia to serve as special counsel of the United States, a role charged in part with safeguarding federal whistleblowers from retaliation. His confirmation hearing is set for Thursday.

Politico reported on Monday that Ingrassia told other Republicans in a group chat that the Martin Luther King Jr holiday, which celebrates the civil rights icon, should be ended.

“MLK Jr was the 1960s George Floyd and his ‘holiday’ should be ended and tossed into the seventh circle of hell where it belongs,” Ingrassia wrote in the messages from early 2024, Politico reports. He also wrote that holidays commemorating Black people, such as Black history month or Juneteenth, should all be “eviscerated”, though he used an Italian slur for Black people.

His comment about a “Nazi streak” came amid a discussion of a Trump campaign staffer who wasn’t being deferential enough to the founding fathers being white, Politico reported. Another participant said Ingrassia “belongs in the Hitler Youth”, to which Ingrassia responded: “I do have a Nazi streak in me from time to time, I will admit it.”

Donald Trump has strongly endorsed the Aukus pact and praised prime minister Anthony Albanese as a “great” leader, but the president’s navy secretary says the US may seek to “clarify some ambiguities” in the nuclear submarine deal.

Trump and Albanese also signed a multibillion-dollar agreement for Australia to supply the United States with critical minerals, amid a deepening trade war as China threatens to cut its supply of rare earth elements. But the president also downplayed any prospect of cutting tariffs on Australian goods.

“We do actually have a lot of submarines. We have the best submarines in the world, and we’re building a few more currently under construction, and now we’re starting we have it all set with Anthony [Albanese],” Trump said.

“We’ve worked on this long and hard, and we’re starting that process right now. I think it’s really moving along very rapidly, very well … we have them moving very quickly.”

In a wide-ranging 35-minute press conference at the White House before his first formal meeting between the pair, Trump assured the future of Aukus and said America had no better friend than Australia, but told ambassador Kevin Rudd “I don’t like you” after his former comments about the president were brought up.

In comments nearly entirely positive about Australia and his relationship with the prime minister, Trump did not repeat previous demands for Albanese’s government to raise defence spending, and Albanese suggested Trump visit Australia for the President’s Cup golf tournament to be held in Melbourne in 2028.

One of the longest government shutdowns in US history just got longer after the Senate again failed to pass a funding resolution after a majority of Democrats continued their pressure campaign after the No Kings nationwide weekend protests.

The Senate vote fell for the 11th time with a vote of 50 to 43, with no new defectors from the Democratic side.

Mike Johnson, the House speaker, has for weeks kept the House shuttered on an extended recess, and defended his strategy as necessary to push Senate Democrats into passing the House’s continuing resolution without policy additions. But Democrats have refused to support the measure without provisions addressing healthcare subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which are set to expire at the end of the year.

Johnson, in a Monday morning press conference flanked by other Republican congressional leaders including Andy Harris, the House freedom caucus chair, said the reason for the shutdown was to appease Democratic voters, particularly putting blame on the No Kings rallies.

“It is exactly why Chuck Schumer is pandering, in this whole charade. We’ve explained from the very beginning, the shutdown is about one thing and one thing alone: Chuck Schumer’s political survival,” Johnson said.

The stuffed vote also came after a prominent Republican lawmaker, representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, on Monday morning criticized Johnson’s strategy, calling on the House to return to session immediately.

Former FBI director James Comey has formally asked a federal judge to dismiss criminal charges against him, arguing he was the victim of a selective prosecution and that the US attorney who filed the charges was unlawfully appointed.

“The record as it currently exists shows a clear causal link between President Trump’s animus and the prosecution of Mr Comey,” Comey’s lawyers wrote in their request to dismiss the case, calling a 20 September Truth Social post in which he disparaged Comey and called for his prosecution “smoking gun evidence”. They continued: “President Trump’s repeated public statements and action leave no doubt as to the government’s genuine animus toward Mr Comey.”

Comey’s lawyers attached an exhibit to their filing on Monday, which contains dozens of public statements from Trump criticizing Comey.

Comey was indicted on 25 September with one count of making a false statement and one count of obstructing a congressional proceeding. The charges are related to Comey’s September 2020 testimony before Congress, and are connected to Comey’s assertion he had never authorized anyone at the FBI to leak information. The precise details of the offense have not been made public and Comey has pleaded not guilty. He has forcefully denied wrongdoing.

Charges were filed against Comey even though career prosecutors in the justice department determined that charges were not warranted. Trump forced out Erik Siebert, the US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia, in September and installed Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide. The Comey charges were filed days later.

US appeals court could reconsider ruling in Trump’s favor on Portland troop deployment

Victoria Bekiempis

A decision in Donald Trump’s favor by a three-judge panel issued on Monday, which lifted a block on his planned deployment of Oregon national guard troops to Portland, could be reconsidered by a new, larger panel of federal appeals court judges.

Hours after the three-judge panel decided, 2-1, that Trump has the legal authority to deploy federalized troops to Portland, a judge on the ninth circuit court of appeals formally requested “a vote on whether this case should be reheard” by a larger panel of judges.

That triggered a formal order for lawyers for the state of Oregon and the city of Portland to submit written briefs arguing for a rehearing, and lawyers for the Trump administration to argue against it, by midnight on Wednesday.

After those briefs are submitted, all 29 active judges on the appeals court, the country’s largest, will vote on whether or not to rehear the case.

Oregon’s governor, Tina Kotek, said that she hopes the full ninth circuit court of appeals vacates the panel’s 2-1 decision, as the dissenting judge, Portland-based Susan Graber, urged her colleagues to do.

“I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek told reporters. “I still urge the Trump administration to send all the national guard members home.”

If the vote for a new hearing wins, legal journalist ‪Chris Geidner‬ said, the case will be heard again by 11 judges, including the court’s chief judge, Mary Murguia, an Obama nominee, and 10 randomly assigned judges.

Americans blame Republican lawmakers more than Democratic lawmakers for a partial government shutdown, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll that also showed Republican president Donald Trump’s approval rating increasing slightly.

The six-day poll, which closed on Monday, showed Trump’s approval at 42%, up two percentage points from earlier in the month, within the poll’s two-point margin of error. Trump’s rating has held between 40% and 44% since early April.

The poll found that 50% of respondents see the Republican congressional leadership as deserving the most blame for the shutdown, while 43% see top congressional Democrats as the main culprits. The third-longest government shutdown in US history entered its 21st day on Tuesday.

The shutdown started on 1 October and has left hundreds of thousands of federal workers on furlough, hitting a sliver of the workforce in what economists see as a tiny drag on economic growth, though many Americans are feeling the shutdown via a wave of air traffic delays.

About one in five poll respondents said they have been financially impacted by the shutdown, while two in five said they know someone who is feeling the pinch, Reuters reported.

President Donald Trump’s hopes for a quick summit in Budapest with Russian president Vladimir Putin stalled after a preparatory session between the leaders’ top foreign-policy aides this week was put on hold, CNN reported on Monday.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNN said the reason for postponing the meeting between US secretary of state Marco Rubio and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was unclear. One source cited differing expectations about ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, CNN said.

Rubio and Lavrov may talk on the phone again this week, CNN reported, after the two held a call on Monday that Moscow called “constructive.”

Russia’s foreign ministry could not immediately be contacted outside business hours.

The anticipated meeting between Rubio and Lavrov was considered to be the key preparatory step for the second summit this year between Trump and Putin. The two leaders agreed in a phone call last Thursday to meet soon in Budapest, Hungary.

NEW LAWSUIT CHALLENGES THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S TERMINATION OF TPS FOR SYRIA

Without Court Intervention, Thousands Could be Forcibly Deported to a Humanitarian Crisis in Syria

(New York, NY) – Today, seven Syrian nationals who have planted roots in the United States for years filed a federal lawsuit in the Southern District of New York challenging the Trump administration’s decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Syria. The International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), Muslim Advocates, and Van Der Hout LLP represent the plaintiffs, who are community members living all across the United States, including New York, Virginia, Florida, and Illinois. The TPS holders are family caretakers, doctors, students, teachers, business professionals, and others whose work and identities contribute to the rich fabric of our communities. Without court intervention, on November 21, 2025, more than 6,100 Syrians could lose their legal status and work authorization and could be forced to relocate to Syria – a country ravaged and still reeling from nearly 14 years of civil war.

Syria was first designated for TPS in 2012 in recognition of the danger Syrians would face if forced to return to the country’s civil war. While the Assad regime fell in December 2024, the U.S. government’s own analysis shows that armed conflict, violence, and a severe humanitarian crisis persist, making it unsafe for Syrian nationals to return. Several of the plaintiffs fled Syria to the United States for safety over a decade ago and are now facing the risk of returning to the grave danger and instability that TPS was designed to protect against. Others have never even lived in Syria and would be forcibly separated from their family members in the U.S., including young U.S. citizen children, parents, grandparents, and siblings.

The Trump administration’s decision to terminate TPS for Syria follows similar efforts to strip TPS status from hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, and Venezuela earlier this year. President Trump previously tried and failed to end TPS during his first administration, and multiple administration members have made comments condemning TPS. It’s clear that the overhauling of the TPS program is driven by anti-immigrant sentiments about who deserves safety, belonging, and protection in the U.S. – with non-white and Muslim immigrants bearing the brunt of these discriminatory immigration policies.

“Through Temporary Protected Status, I’ve been able to pay it forward by serving and working with vulnerable communities in the U.S.,” said plaintiff Mustafa Doe from New York. “But the crisis in Syria is far from over. The U.S. itself warns against travel there because of ongoing violence and instability. Ending TPS now would send people like me back into danger for no reason other than anti-immigrant policies. TPS is not a loophole—it’s a promise that America will not turn its back on those who have nowhere safe to go.”

The following are quotes from co-counsel and community advocates:

“Terminating TPS for thousands of Syrians is part of a broader campaign to kick immigrants of color out of this country, regardless of the law or whether it is safe for them to return to their countries of origin,” said Lupe Aguirre, Senior Litigation Attorney at IRAP. “This was a decision determined by politics and animus, not facts, and was driven by the Trump administration’s desire to strip legal status from non-white and Muslim immigrants and rip them from the communities where they have lived for years.”

“It is galling that the current administration is forcing families to pack up a lifetime in the U.S. in less than two months and into a dire humanitarian crisis in Syria,” said Sadaf Hasan, Staff Attorney at Muslim Advocates. “This is exactly what systemic anti-Muslim and anti-Arab racism looks like – to dehumanize and deliberately ignore the safety of the very people the TPS program was designed to protect. The government’s decision to dismantle the overall TPS program for non-white beneficiaries with little to no notice is the latest in the administration’s white nationalist and anti-immigrant agenda. We’re committed to fighting for the rule of law and dignity for the Syrian community and all TPS holders.”

“This is yet another example of the Trump administration’s racist and ethnocentric worldview in action,” said Johnny Sinodis, Partner at Van Der Hout LLP. “Intent on doing Trump’s exclusionist bidding, Noem continues to target non-white, non-European, and non-Christian immigrants in ways that reach new heights of hatefulness and hypocrisy every day. The decision to terminate Syria’s TPS designation is completely untethered to the facts on the ground, which show that Syria remains the site of one of the most devastating humanitarian crises of the 21st century. A legitimate, objective review of conditions–which is what the law requires–could not have led to the end of TPS for 6,000 Syrians who deserve to live a life free of such peril. We look forward to challenging Trump and his cadre in court.”

“The decision to end TPS for Syrians comes far too soon. Syria remains deeply unstable, with cities destroyed, infrastructure in ruins, and parts of the country still under armed conflict,” said Farrah AlKhorfan, co-founder of Immigrants Act Now. “Many Syrians on TPS have U.S. born children, own homes, and run businesses—they have built their lives here. The termination notice was issued less than ten days before TPS for Syria was set to expire, falling short of the 60-day statutory notice period required under federal law. This abrupt timing caused widespread confusion and distress among Syrian TPS holders. At the very least, more time and clarity should have been provided to ensure fairness, compliance, and stability for affected families.”

Manuel Nieto Jr. and his sister had just pulled into a gas station to buy cigarettes and Gatorade when he noticed a sheriff’s deputy standing over two Latino men on the ground.

Their north Phoenix neighborhood was on alert. Sheriff’s deputies had been targeting day-labor centers in the area and making traffic stops — arresting people who couldn’t prove their immigration status. They had one thing in common: They looked Latino.

“No diga nada. Pídale un abogado,” Nieto’s sister, Velia Meraz, yelled to the detained men, according to court testimony. (“Don’t say anything. Ask for an attorney.”)

The deputy warned Nieto and Meraz: “You need to get out of here, now.”

Nieto drove around the corner to his dad’s auto repair shop as another deputy on a motorcycle followed him, siren and lights on, and patrol vehicles swarmed. Deputies approached — guns drawn.

Nieto dialed 911 for help: Officers were harassing him, he would later testify in court. One pulled Nieto from his vehicle. Others pinned him to the ground and handcuffed him.

Nieto’s father came running from his shop.

“Let my children go,” Manuel Nieto Sr. said. “They’re U.S. citizens. What did they do wrong?”

The raid that ensnared Nieto Jr. and Meraz 17 years ago was carried out under a federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that grants local police powers to check immigration status during traffic stops and other routine encounters. The Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office, under then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio, was among the first in the nation to test out ICE’s 287(g) task force program.

Since President Donald Trump retook office in January, similar scenes of local officers joining in aggressive immigration arrests have multiplied as ICE has rapidly expanded the 287(g) task force program to deputize local police officers as de facto deportation agents.

Moments after Manuel Nieto Sr. stormed out of his north Phoenix auto shop, the deputies left without arresting or citing his children. But Nieto Jr. and Meraz didn’t move on. They joined three other county residents in suing the sheriff’s office, accusing deputies of targeting them solely because they were Latino.

A federal judge agreed that the task force’s traffic stops and raids on Hispanic neighborhoods, day-labor centers and other businesses had violated Latinos’ civil and constitutional rights. Even after the ruling, the judge found Arpaio continued to detain people based solely on suspected civil immigration violations.

The U.S. Department of Justice also conducted a civil rights investigation into the sheriff’s office’s discriminatory practices, and ICE ended Arpaio’s 287(g) agreement. In 2012, ICE suspended all local police deportation task forces nationwide, only restarting them after Trump began his second term in January.

Many Arizonans who lived through Arpaio’s 287(g)-fueled immigration-enforcement campaign see parallels between what happened in Maricopa County and what’s now playing out across the country as local officers join forces with ICE. They also foresee costly troubles for local agencies that follow in Maricopa County’s footsteps, including difficulty regaining the trust of Latino residents whose constitutional rights are violated by local officers.

The White House and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to Arizona Luminaria and ProPublica’s questions.

Arpaio told Arizona Luminaria and ProPublica that he became a target of political persecution for helping enforce immigration laws, which he saw as part of his job.

“I’d do it over again,” Arpaio said. “I tell everybody: I didn’t do anything wrong. I had a federal court who was biased against me. And all they could get me out on was a contempt of court? Think of that.”

Meanwhile, Maricopa County continues to reckon with its time allowing deputies to act as immigration officers.

Under a settlement agreement, the court mandated broad oversight of the sheriff’s office and appointed a monitor to track its compliance. Since then, the law enforcement agency has been required to meticulously document all interactions with the public. In the 12 years since, the department has yet to convince the judge that its deputies don’t racially profile Latino drivers and that it adequately investigates deputies’ alleged misconduct.

Salvador Reza is a longtime community organizer who advocates for day laborers in Phoenix. He said his work put him in the crosshairs of Arpaio’s immigration enforcement, leading to his arrest for obstruction during a protest. (The county declined to pursue charges against him.) Because of what happened in Maricopa County, he believes Latinos, including in the communities whose police departments have joined forces with ICE, are now more likely to be racially profiled.

“At that time, we were a laboratory,” Reza said. “They did the experiment, and basically now they’re implementing it at the national level.”

368 Paragraphs on Required Reforms

The lawsuit brought by Nieto Jr., Meraz and the other county residents became known as Melendres v. Arpaio — for Manuel de Jesus Melendres Ortega, a legal resident who was arrested in one of Arpaio’s sweeps.

When U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow certified it as a class-action suit in December 2011, he indicated racial profiling by the sheriff’s office had been so widespread it could have violated the constitutional rights of any Latino in Maricopa County, one-third of the population.

The settlement contains 368 paragraphs outlining reforms. They range from creating a policy that bars racial profiling to developing a system that collects data on traffic stops to identify disparities in the race of motorists who are pulled over.

To end court oversight, the sheriff’s office must be in “full and effective compliance” with the reforms continuously for three years. The department currently complies with more than 90% of the requirements, according to the monitor, but falls short in the two areas that most directly impact Latino drivers: eliminating racial bias in traffic stops and quickly investigating allegations of deputy misconduct.

Snow found that traffic stops involving Latino drivers and passengers dragged on “beyond the time necessary to resolve the issue that initially justified the stop.”

Ricardo Reyes said he repeatedly endured traffic stops as a young Latino growing up in the Maryvale neighborhood of west Phoenix, where three-quarters of the residents identify as Latino. He drove a nice car and believes deputies under Arpaio racially profiled him.

“They would ask me for my license, they take it and then, ‘You’re free to go,’” recalled Reyes, who leads an advocacy group for military veterans. “Why was I stopped? I never got an answer.”

Snow’s order requires deputies to document 13 data points for every traffic interaction, including when a stop began and ended, the reason for the stop, the driver’s perceived race and whether the deputy inquired about immigration status.

In a preliminary injunction, Snow wrote that sheriff’s deputies, “including officers associated with the special operations, circulated emails that compared Mexicans to dogs, ridiculed stereotypical Mexican accents, and portrayed Mexicans as drunks.”

He singled out two of the deputies Nieto Jr. and Meraz encountered in north Phoenix for making arrests based on race during 287(g) operations. Roughly 77% of all arrests by the first deputy the siblings saw at the gas station had Hispanic surnames, the judge found. The deputy who pulled over Nieto Jr. arrested only Latinos during the operations he participated in.

Even more concerning to Snow was that Arpaio continued such operations as a matter of policy after ICE pulled its 287(g) agreement in 2009. In other words, deputies continued making immigration arrests without authority from the federal government. The judge said that violated constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizures.

After Arpaio defied the order and refused to implement many of the reforms, Snow issued additional mandates in 2016. He also found Arpaio and three of his aides in civil contempt of court and referred all four to face criminal contempt charges, a misdemeanor. Another federal judge convicted only Arpaio of criminal contempt in 2017 and was set to sentence him to up to six months in jail. Two months before sentencing, Trump pardoned Arpaio. However, voters had already voted Arpaio out of office.

His successors have faced the same oversight and have not fully complied with the court’s orders, according to the monitor’s reports.

Kevin Johnson, an immigration law author and professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who runs the Immigration Professor’s Blog, said settlements related to discrimination and civil rights violations often take a long time to resolve. He pointed to the 28-year-old Flores settlement, which still dictates the federal government’s treatment of children in border and immigration custody. “There may be complaints about the court monitoring, but the burden is on the leaders and the agencies to show that monitoring is no longer necessary,” he said.

This January, newly elected Sheriff Jerry Sheridan, a Republican who had worked as Arpaio’s second-in-command, inherited the Melendres settlement. He argues the department has made enough progress to end the judge’s oversight.

Snow acknowledged recently in court that Sheridan and the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office had made significant gains. “But the areas where he’s not in compliance are pretty important areas,” he said.

The sheriff’s office analyzes traffic stop data quarterly to identify deputies with notable disparities in who they stop. An outside auditor evaluates annually any departmentwide disparities.

The latest annual report shows improvements over the past decade, but also that deputies still arrest Latino drivers at higher rates than white drivers. Data from this past year also show that Black drivers, who are not covered by the Melendres settlement, face longer stop times and higher arrest rates. And all drivers of color are more likely to be searched than white drivers.

In addition, the sheriff’s office acknowledged it has not investigated 640 deputy misconduct claims, some dating to 2015, according to the department’s most recent court filing. Snow had ordered that the backlog be cleared to hold the sheriff’s office more accountable after he found that Arpaio refused to implement many reforms.

Raul Piña, a retired educator, witnessed the fear caused by Arpaio’s raids in his Latino-majority school district and surrounding neighborhoods in Maryvale. He has for the past decade served on the court-mandated Community Advisory Board, tasked with relaying to the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office any community concerns about policing that may violate the court orders.

Piña says the department hasn’t done enough to regain the trust of Latino residents and its deputies continue targeting Latinos disproportionately. He worries that without court oversight, the department will backslide on policing based on skin color.

“I strongly believe that the only thing holding MCSO back from a very public and enthusiastic participation in workplace raids and other forms of anti-immigrant practices — the only thing holding them back — is Melendres,” he said.

“The Model Was Maricopa County”

Nationwide, ICE now has more than a thousand 287(g) agreements with local law enforcement. Half are task force agreements like the one Arpaio deployed.

In May, the Tennessee Highway Patrol was carrying out a task force operation in Nashville when troopers pulled over Edgardo David Campos, who had just left a vigil at his church. Campos pulled into a gas station south of the airport, where a swarm of uniformed and plainclothes immigration officers wearing green vests with the word “police” on the back surrounded his car. One began to pull him out of his vehicle, a video of the incident shows, drawing the attention of people nearby, including Dinora Romero. She grabbed her phone and began to record.

“Si se lo llevan, no diga nada,” Romero yelled. (“If they take you, don’t say anything.”)

ICE touted the Nashville operation as a success, even though the agency’s data showed more than half the nearly 200 people arrested had no criminal record.

Advocates accused ICE and the Highway Patrol of using race and ethnicity to target drivers in Nashville’s Latino and immigrant neighborhoods. One in four residents of the neighborhood where Campos was stopped is Latino. In August, the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition filed a lawsuit against the Highway Patrol seeking access to public records about the May sweeps.

Attorneys for the state argued in court that releasing those records would endanger officers. The Highway Patrol and state attorney general did not respond to requests for comment.

With enforcement expanding, U.S. citizens have been wrongfully detained recently, like Nieto Jr. and Meraz were in 2008. In May, an 18-year-old Latino citizen recorded his arrest during an operation by the Florida Highway Patrol and Border Patrol targeting landscapers in West Palm Beach under a 287(g) agreement. He was released after six hours.

In a statement, DHS said the teen “was part of a group of illegal aliens that resisted arrest during a traffic stop.” The Florida Highway Patrol said he “interfered” with a lawful investigation and was charged with obstruction. State prosecutors declined to pursue the charge, citing “insufficient evidence.”

The Trump administration is trying to enlist even more local officers to help ICE and is offering financial incentives for departments that participate in the 287(g) program. Starting this month, the federal government will pay the salaries of officers certified under 287(g) agreements and offer “performance awards” of up to $1,000 for helping ICE with arrests and deportations.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration has gutted federal offices that investigate police misconduct and civil rights violations.

Advocates say some of the tactics used by local and federal officers to target Latinos in Trump’s deportation effort draw from Arpaio’s playbook.

“The model was Maricopa County,” said Piña, the advisory board member in the Maricopa County lawsuit.

“The very public, very humiliating, demoralizing approach to the raids, and the cruelty — more than just the images in the television that were humiliating, it was the cruelty — and the violent apprehension of people in front of children,” Piña added. “All of those behaviors. All of those tactics. They stem from Maricopa County.”

Arpaio said he did not want to take credit for the Trump administration’s work but was proud that deputies under his command were among the first local officers to help ICE make immigration arrests.

In Florida, which has more departments with 287(g) agreements than any other state, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has spent $245 million to set up a temporary detention center nicknamed Alligator Alcatraz. There, migrants are housed in chain-link cells inside tents. Some have compared it to Arpaio’s “Tent City,” where prisoners were held outdoors in sweltering desert temperatures. (It closed after Arpaio lost reelection in 2016.)

In California, federal agents have focused on Home Depot stores, arresting people in parking lots — echoing Arpaio’s raids on day laborers. Maricopa County deputies, after getting 287(g) certified in 2007, carried out 11 immigration sweeps within five months outside a former furniture store in Phoenix that was a popular gathering spot for laborers. Snow noted that nearly everyone arrested there was Latino.

“Trump is creating this complete culture of fear and terror in our community. And I think this is exactly what happened under Arpaio, with the workplace raids and the threat of deportation,” said Christine Wee, lead attorney for American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of Nieto Jr., Meraz and Melendres.

In July, a group that includes U.S. citizens, detained immigrants and advocacy groups sued the Trump administration, arguing that “indiscriminate” raids in Los Angeles targeted people with brown skin. A federal judge granted a temporary restraining order, barring immigration arrests based on race, speaking Spanish, type of employment or presence at a particular location.

But on Sept. 8, the Supreme Court stayed the order in a 6-3 vote. Justice Brett Kavanaugh was the lone conservative justice to explain his decision. He affirmed the government can use a combination of factors like race and language to establish reasonable suspicion that a person is in the country unlawfully during the operations in Los Angeles. “To be clear, apparent ethnicity alone cannot furnish reasonable suspicion; under this Court’s case law regarding immigration stops, however, it can be a ‘relevant factor,’” Kavanaugh wrote.

Even though the case continues, immigration advocates and the attorneys who filed the lawsuit said the court’s action essentially legalized racial profiling.

Experts say that approach could filter down to local agencies partnering with ICE under the 287(g) program. “When you have ICE relying on racial profiling and promoting it as an effective immigration enforcement strategy, you can expect state local governments that are working with ICE to use race immigration enforcement,” said Johnson, the UC Davis law professor.

That idea was echoed in Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent to the ruling lifting the order in the Los Angeles case. She argued the decision makes all Latinos, including U.S. citizens, targets and “improperly shifts the burden onto an entire class of citizens to carry enough documentation to prove that they deserve to walk freely.” Sotomayor added, “The Constitution does not permit the creation of such a second-class citizenship status.”

Arpaio said he believes that had the Supreme Court rendered such a decision two decades ago, the Melendres lawsuit and the legal troubles that followed would not have happened.

“I was vindicated by the Supreme Court,” Arpaio said. “Everything they went after me is legal.”

Civil rights experts dispute that, noting that Arpaio’s enforcement relied on race alone, which remains illegal.

“It Seems Like It’s Never-Ending”

As the Maricopa County Sheriff’s Office struggles to fully implement the court-mandated reforms, elected officials are losing patience with the requirements and the costs.

By March, spending on the Melendres case and the implementation of its reforms had surpassed $300 million, the bulk of which — nearly $245 million — has gone to the sheriff’s office.

Sheridan, the new sheriff, attributed those expenses to the creation of two divisions for implementing the settlement and the hiring of investigators to tackle the backlog of complaints against deputies. Thirty million dollars has gone to the monitor team since the monitor was appointed in 2013.

In 2024, the last full fiscal year for which data is available, the county spent more than $39 million on the settlement. “That’s a recurring cost every year in perpetuity,” Sheridan said. Or at least until the settlement ends.

But a report commissioned by Snow last year and published on Oct. 8 found that the sheriff’s office had “consistently overstated” costs attributed to compliance under the Melendres settlement.

Sheridan questioned the report, telling Phoenix talk radio station KTAR that its authors “don’t have the expertise” to audit a large government agency. He said his office will hire an independent accountant to dispute the findings. “There’s no fraud here,” he said.

The Republican majority on the county’s Board of Supervisors is calling for an immediate end to court oversight.

“We just have to figure out a way to end this because it seems like it’s never-ending because the judge, they put on a new order, they change things, they move the goalposts, and so we need to resolve this,” Republican Supervisor Debbie Lesko, who represents communities policed by the sheriff’s office, told Arizona Luminaria and ProPublica.

But the decision to end court oversight rests solely with Snow. During a recent hearing, the judge was clearly unhappy with a recent community meeting. The court-mandated meetings provide the plaintiffs — all Latino drivers in Maricopa County — a venue to get updates on progress toward reforms and to voice concerns to the sheriff and the monitor team.

At the July gathering, Sheridan’s supporters packed the room and took control, shouting at speakers and interrupting the interpreter’s translations of the discussion into Spanish. The mostly older, white group of Sheridan supporters demanded an end to court oversight, citing the costs. They outnumbered the Latino community members and activists who want to keep the monitor in place until the sheriff’s office proves to Snow it no longer discriminates against Latinos.

Snow said he would host the next community meeting inside the federal courthouse in downtown Phoenix.

Sheridan also wants out of the settlement. He believes the strict mandates hinder deputies’ ability to do their jobs. “There’s no law enforcement agency that I’m aware of in this country under the same level of scrutiny,” Sheridan said.

Latino advocates and community members worry complaints about the court mandates and the price tag will become an excuse, distracting from the root issue — the need to end racial profiling by the sheriff’s office.

“When Sheridan tells us that it’s done, I’m not going to take his word for it,” said Reyes, who endured repeated traffic stops when Arpaio was sheriff. “I’m going to wait on the monitor. I’m going to wait for the judge. And when they say, ‘You know what? They are compliant.’ Then I’ll believe it. And even then, it’s going to be suspicious.”

Cheers, yells and a faint drum beat from the more than 100 protesters who gathered in the rain outside the Cumberland County building on Northport Drive could be heard inside the meeting room as the commissioners heard public comment from activists. While commissioners were discussing their votes, protesters outside started tapping on the windows and chanting “end the contract.”

Community members want the commissioners to reconsider the jail’s federal contract with the U.S. Marshals Service, which pays the jail $150 per day for each federal inmate held at the facility, including those held for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Protesters have turned out for months at the commissioners’ meetings, demanding the officials remove a section in the agreement that includes ICE detainees.

After an hourslong meeting in the full conference room, the commissioners voted 3-2 to reject a proposal that would have allowed the county manager to notify the federal government about the proposed change.

But Commissioner James Cloutier moved to withhold the vote for 30 days, which a majority of commissioners supported.

Cloutier said in an interview after the meeting Monday night that having the extra time will allow the commissioners to seek outside support to help them weigh the consequences. Currently, he said if the contract is canceled, people who are detained by ICE risk being transferred to more remote facilities with less access to legal support.

He said he hopes that before the next meeting, the commissioners can decide how to “implement further protection” for people detained by ICE.

The contract accounts for $2.5 million of the jail’s annual budget, according to the meeting agenda.

Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce said in an interview Monday afternoon that regardless of how the commissioners vote, the jail can’t refuse any detainees brought by ICE “because it’s the law.”

At the meeting, he said that the jail will continue to accept all state and federal inmates, as is required by the Maine Department of Corrections standards.

As of Monday afternoon, the jail was holding 62 people in ICE custody, Joyce said. Data provided to the commissioners last month shows that about two-thirds of ICE detainees at the jail had been arrested in another state, and most are accused of committing civil offenses.

Crystal Cron, the executive director of nonprofit Presente! Maine, said in an interview that activists have been working for more than six months to pressure commissioners into canceling the contract.

Cron said her group has heard several stories from people in the community who are living in fear of ICE and its practices. Removing ICE from the jail would be one step to combat that, she said.

After the meeting, Cron said she was disappointed about the vote, but thankful for the number of protesters who turned out Monday night.

“I feel very energized by that, sharing in prayer and song and feeling the unity,” Cron said. “So that’s giving me energy to continue the work. Given that they’ve tabled it for 30 days, that means we have 30 days to plan our next step and come back.”

Rep. Chellie Pingree, D-1st District, sent a letter to commissioners Monday, encouraging them to amend the contract to “thwart the harmful immigration enforcement policies being carried out in our state.”

“If the Department of Homeland Security cannot provide credible assurances, continuing this relationship with ICE may cause irreparable harm to those in custody and to the trust our constituents put in us,” Pingree wrote in the letter.

Commissioners and county leaders have previously said that they weren’t sure what obligations they had under state law to cooperate with ICE.

An August memo from the Maine Department of Corrections states that both Maine law and correctional standards require that county jails across Maine must accept anyone detained by law enforcement, including by federal agents.

But advocates, including attorney Shelby Leighton from the No ICE for ME group, have challenged that claim.

Leighton said at a county workshop last month that the state laws had been taken out of context, and questioned whether the Department of Corrections could require the county jails to hold people for ICE.",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/10/43142165_20251020_commissioners_1.jpg?w=780,N,,2025-10-21 09:16:56.017769

“We call for the immediate release of Ali Faqirzada,” said Bishop Matthew Heyd of the Episcopal Diocese of New York.","Annandale-on-Hudson, New York — The Episcopal Diocese of New York, Human Rights First, and Bard College are calling for the immediate release of Ali Faqirzada, a 31-year-old Afghan student who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after appearing for a scheduled interview at the New York Asylum Office.

Ali arrived in the United States with his family more than three and a half years ago after fleeing persecution in Afghanistan due to their women and human rights activism, as well as work for the former government of Afghanistan. His asylum application has been pending since 2022. On October 14, Ali attended a fear screening interview — which he passed. Immediately afterward, ICE agents detained him.

All of Ali’s family members, who fled Afghanistan with him, have been granted asylum. His detention has caused significant emotional and financial strain on his family, who have spent years rebuilding their lives in the Hudson Valley of New York.

“This is a family that has done everything possible to comply with U.S. immigration laws,” said Senior Director of Legal Strategy for Refugee Programs at Human Rights First Anwen Hughes. “When they arrived in 2022, they immediately sought protection from U.S. officials and filed their asylum applications. The family members who have had immigration hearings appeared in court, and two judges granted them asylum. Ali was waiting for his turn when the government told him to come in for an interview — then ICE detained him. We do not understand why ICE has chosen to target this smart, hardworking young man. Ali and his family were allies of the United States, working alongside the United States to rebuild democracy in Afghanistan. That is why the Taliban targeted them. He came here seeking safety. Instead, he’s been treated like a criminal.”

Ali, the eldest son of a family of six, is known as a kind, hardworking, and compassionate member of the Ulster County community. He contributes to the United States as a security guard while pursuing a degree in computer programming as a student at Bard College. His professors, classmates, and neighbors have joined local faith leaders and advocates in urging his release.

“We call for the immediate release of Ali Faqirzada,” said Bishop Matthew Heyd of the Episcopal Diocese of New York. “We stand with Ali, his family, and the communities that care for them. Welcoming people from all over the world who are seeking safe belonging is the best of America and the call of our Christian faith — we all care about an immigration and asylum process that shows care and not cruelty and chaos.”

Bard College President Leon Botstein said: “Ali is known for his kind spirit, hard work, and dedication to learning. It is my hope that he will be able to return to Bard and resume his studies as soon as possible.”

Gary Jacobson, friend of Ali and his family said the following: “Ali Faqirzada embodies the morals, values and behaviors held by members in our society who are universally respected. He and the community ask for his release from detention until he has an opportunity to find further justice at an asylum hearing.”

Ali’s case underscores growing concerns about the treatment of asylum seekers in the United States and the use of detention against individuals who pose no threat and have deep ties to their communities.",https://humanrightsfirst.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Free-our-client.png,N,,2025-10-21 11:58:13.082729

The hearing was the latest test in a lawsuit by news organizations and community groups witnessing protests and arrests in the Chicago area. Ellis said earlier this month that agents must wear badges, and she banned them from using certain riot control techniques against peaceful protesters and journalists.

Then last Thursday, she said she was a “little startled” after seeing TV images of street confrontations in which agents used tear gas and other tactics.

Harvick defended the use on tear gas on protesters in a Chicago neighborhood on Oct. 12, saying residents who had gathered “would not allow agents to leave the scene.”

“The longer we loiter on a scene and subjects come, the situation gets more and more dangerous,” Harvick said. “And that’s a safety concern, not just for my brother Border Patrol agents but the detainee and other people who come out to see what’s going on.”

Government attorneys said Shawn Byers, deputy field office director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would also appear in court.

News media and community groups submitted five pages of proposed topics for the hearing.

Below is a description of the federal agency’s purchases to scale up its operations across the country:","Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is ramping up its surveillance capabilities to advance the government’s immigration agenda on an unprecedented scale. According to the federal spending site USASpending.gov, the agency signed contractual obligations in September for a $1.4 billion order — the highest in 18 years — for the acquisition of new technologies such as an iris-scanning app they plan to use in the field, spyware that can remotely hack smartphones, and location software that can track phone activity without a warrant, including nearly all social media platforms.

The plan has drawn criticism from Democratic members of congress, civil rights advocates, and former officials who claim that these programs could be used to attack free expression protected by the First Amendment. In this context, Donald Trump ordered an investigation into Antifa, a designated domestic terrorist organization that, in his words, “demands the overthrow of the United States government, law enforcement, and our legal system.” The White House has not presented evidence that the violent attacks against Trump supporters or the federal agency are the work of this group, rather than individual actors.

Added to all this is the tender for the launch of social media monitoring centers in Williston, Vermont, and Santa Ana, California, which seek to expand the agency’s anti-immigrant hunt by collecting data on its targets. The plan (which is subject to change) includes tracking accounts on Facebook, X, TikTok, LinkedIn, Reddit, WhatsApp, YouTube, Pinterest, Tumblr, Instagram, Flickr, Myspace, and Google+. ICE indicates that undocumented immigrants who have committed serious crimes are the main target, but also considers domestic terrorism a top priority and establishes that the contractor must “shift priorities” when necessary.

In response to these actions, the United Auto Workers, Communications Workers of America, and American Federation of Teachers unions filed a lawsuit last week against the Departments of State and Homeland Security for “ideological surveillance” of immigrants in the United States using artificial intelligence (AI), alleging that they seek to “punish” the views of their opponents. Meanwhile, White House press secretary Abigail Jackson issued a statement alleging that left-wing organizations “fueled violent riots, organized attacks against law enforcement officers, coordinated illegal doxxing campaigns, arranged drop points for weapons and riot materials and more.”

New technologies acquired by ICE

Since its founding in 2003, ICE has deployed a sophisticated arsenal of surveillance technologies, ranging from biometric databases to wiretapping tools. How its new acquisitions will be used remains an open question. Oregon Democratic Senator Ron Wyden told The Washington Post that the agency is still drafting usage policies and only gave its staff a briefing on the matter in mid-September.

Why it matters: Public defenders and immigrant advocates say the order is needed to protect residents who fear U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or Border Patrol officers might detain them at the courthouse — a fear that's kept some people from showing up, even for domestic violence or family court hearings.

Reality check: Being in the U.S. without authorization or overstaying a visa are civil offenses, not criminal ones.

Online job listings showed at least 45 open positions within the agency's Health Service Corps as of Monday, ranging from dental hygienists through psychiatric nurse practitioners to medical risk managers and data scientists.

""Provides direct patient care during ICE removal missions and DHS operations, including emergency response and medical oversight in austere environments,"" said one advert for a physician to travel between multiple detention facilities.

""Delivers psychiatric care to ICE detainees, including evaluations, treatment plans, medication management, and crisis intervention,"" said another for a psychiatric provider.

The recruiting drive, first reported by Politico, comes after a spate of lawsuits alleging that ICE has failed to provide proper medical care to the people it detains, with officials warehousing prisoners in rapidly built temporary detention centers as they race to fulfill Donald Trump's mass deportation drive.

Last week, Washington representative Pramila Jayapal, the ranking Democrat on the House subcommittee that monitors ICE, said that 20 people have died in its custody since Trump took office. That's nearly as many as in the entire Biden presidency — although still lower as a percentage of the total number of people detained.

Experts say the massive increase in detentions under Trump has increased the risk of unsafe conditions at ICE detention centers, which have already faced allegations, including sexual abuse, medical neglect, and even forced sterilization, dating back long before 2025.

""Compared to the population that is traditionally seen in the immigration system, the level of trauma and psychological distress of those caught up in this new abduction machine will be much greater,” Jonathan White, a former U.S. Public Health Service Corps commander who worked with detainees during Trump’s first term and is now running for Congress as a Democrat, told Politico.

""These people are proportionally much more likely to have the most severe psychological reaction to being removed, because they have many years in this country, roots in their communities, and U.S. national children who they’re being separated from.

ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has previously denied accusations of medical neglect.

“Any claim there are 'inhumane' conditions at ICE detention centers are false,"" she said last month. ""All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members.

""It is a longstanding practice to provide comprehensive medical care from the moment an alien enters ICE custody. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives.""

Nearly 60,000 people were being detained by ICE or its sister agency CBP as of September 21, according to the detention tracking service TRAC. That same month, Trump's border czar Tom Homan told reporters the system was ""almost at capacity"".

Many of those people have been held at impromptu detention complexes such as Texas's Fort Bliss or Florida's notorious 'Alligator Alcatraz', both of which have been accused of inhumane conditions.

At the latter, detainees are kept packed together in metal cages inside gigantic heavy-duty tents in the midst of the sweltering Everglades swamp. Detainees and their families have reported worm-infested food, routine medical neglect, unreliable air conditioning, and inadequate toilets that overflow and cover the floor with feces.

Detention centers in multiple states have sometimes refused to allow unannounced inspections by members of Congress and their staffers, which Democrats contend is illegal under federal law.

In some cases, legislators or local officials have even been arrested while trying to inspect detention centers or monitor immigration courts.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/08/07/22/45/US-POLITICS-JUSTICE-IMMIGRATION-PRISON-02rbsi83.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-21 11:18:36.576397

The extended civil restraint order will be in place for three years.","A former solicitor struck off for advising an undercover BBC reporter how to make a fraudulent visa application has been subjected to an extended civil restraint order following his latest challenge to his ban.

Sheikh Asif Salam was an immigration solicitor and sole practitioner at Cheshire firm Salam & Co Solicitors. He was recorded covertly advising an undercover journalist on how to obtain fraudulent accountancy evidence for a spousal visa application. Extracts from the recordings were broadcast on the BBC Radio 4 programme File on Four. Following a hearing before the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, Salam was struck off the roll in 2023.

The Solicitors Regulation Authority brought two applications, before Ms Justice Obi sitting in the Royal Courts of Justice, to strike out Salam’s latest claim on grounds of abuse of process and for an extended civil restraint order.

Benjamin Tankel, for the SRA, said: ‘Mr Salam has made eight totally without merit orders in relation to these disciplinary proceedings alone. The SRA will be inviting my lady to find this is the ninth.’

He added that the ‘sheer number of applications’ by Salam was ‘out of proportion to the sheer complexity’ of the case. Between June 2017 to December 2018, there were ‘hearings of 59 applications of judicial review lodged by Salam, he said, '18 of 59 were found to be totally without merit’.

Tankel said: ‘Mr Salam’s skeleton argument in response to the civil restraint order is also damaging. He takes the position he does not accept any of the findings of the SDT. He continues to maintain he is the victim of a gross injustice and continues to maintain every single one of the applications he has made, no matter how much the tribunal and courts have found otherwise, was justified.

‘It has already been suggested by the High Court that the time may be approaching for a civil restraint order. That time has now come.

‘We held off making the application because we suspected, wrongly as it turns out, that the appeal would bring an end to the matter and it has not. I am sorry to say the weeks leading up to this hearing, Mr Salam renewed his campaign of writing letters to individual solicitors who were involved in this disciplinary proceedings…[it] looks like preparatory work for further claims.’

Salam, who represented himself, told the court that he had ‘practised for 45 years and had an unblemished career except for this thing’. He added: ‘I am not guilty. This is a problem... I am the one that has been the victim. My life has been destroyed these [last] eight years.’

Referring to the civil restraint order application, Salam said: ‘I am just trying to clear my name. I am just trying to get my honour back. I have every right to do that. It is not vexatious.’

Following the day hearing, the judge granted the SRA’s application to strike out Salam’s claim, finding it to be abusive, totally without merit and an abuse of process.

Salam ‘does not accept the findings of the SDT [and] does not accept the decision of the court’, the judge said, adding: ‘There is no conduct on behalf of the SRA that can properly be concluded as fraud. [Salam’s] claim is factually misconceived.’

Referring to the extended civil restraint order application, the judge said the court was ‘satisfied’ Salam’s conduct was vexatious.

The judge noted Salam’s ‘sustained refusal to accept findings’ and his choice to ‘challenge their legitimacy through repetitive complaints or claims’ in which he ‘returned to the same issues…not withstanding clear judicial findings rejecting them. Those warnings have been disregarded. In those circumstances I am satisfied the threshold [for an extended civil restrain order] has clearly been met.’

‘Looking at Mr Salam’s litigation in the round, he has a profound sense of grievance and an inability to accept defeat.'

The extended civil restraint order will be in place for three years. Salam was also ordered to pay £24,000 costs.",https://d1d8vslyhr7rdg.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/6/6/0/125660_royalcrtsofjustice_297_602444.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 09:56:51.872058

So Section 3 is when you can — the president can — federalize the National Guard because they're having difficulty enforcing the laws.","PORTLAND, Ore. — A three-judge panel on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 Monday to issue a stay on the temporary restraining order that was preventing President Donald Trump from deploying Oregon National Guard troops to Portland, effectively giving Trump a green light to move forward.

It's the latest development in an escalating legal battle centered on protests at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland. Trump ordered the Guard deployment on Sept. 28, saying the troops were necessary to maintain order. Oregon immediately sued, saying Trump was grossly exaggerating the situation on the ground.

U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut granted the state's request for a temporary restraining order, which the Trump administration quickly appealed.

Following the appellate court ruling on Monday, KGW's Stephanie Domurat spoke with Willamette University Law Professor Laura Appleman to learn more about what it means for the legal case and Trump's ability to follow through with the deployment. The conversation below has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Stephanie Domurat: Laura, thanks for being with us. Let's start with this: was the outcome of this a surprise to you?

Laura Appleman: Hi, Stephanie. Thanks for having me. No, not at all. I think anyone who watched the hearing of the 9th Circuit last week (saw) it was pretty clear that Judge Nelson and Judge Bade were going to likely rule for the government, and that Judge Graber was going to write a dissent, and that is exactly what happened.

SD: Let's talk about what was in this. It was a 92-page opinion. You briefly reviewed that for us — what are your takeaways from what the judges had to say?

LA: Sure. Well, the first part, the most important for the binding law part, is what's called the per curium opinion. So this is where ... Judge Nelson and Judge Bade agreed and they held — it was a long holding, but they held essentially that Subsection 3 of (U.S. Code) 12406, which allows the president to federalize the National Guard, gives the president a tremendous discretion to do so, and thus the stay put on the president's initial grant of power to do so is dissolved. So the TRO that the district court extended last week is now no longer in effect. Short summary of that is that we can now send the Oregon National Guard to Portland.

SD: Yes, so the appeal from the lower court from Judge Immergut has now been overturned and Trump may now, as you mentioned, send the troops here to Portland as he wishes.

LA: Correct.

SD: Where can the state of Oregon and Portland go from here?

LA: Well in theory, the state of Oregon and Portland can try to appeal this to the Supreme Court. One of the things that I think is interesting about this opinion: there's the first part — what's called the per curium — where we have the two judges that agree, but then Judge Nelson actually wrote a concurring opinion ... where he explains what he believes is the 9th Circuit reasoning for this, and he says that this should be something that's reviewable not by the courts or by political power.

So actually, let me correct myself — I said the Supreme Court. What might happen next is that Portland and Oregon may call for an en banc Ninth Circuit hearing. So since the 9th Circuit is so large, that wouldn't be the entire 9th Circuit, that would be probably 10 of the judges plus of course the 3 original judges. So it's likely the next step.

SD: I want to speak to that, as you mentioned. So, Oregon's Attorney General Dan Rayfield did release a statement just in the last hour saying, ""Oregon joins Judge Graber in urging the full 9th Circuit to act swiftly en banc to vacate the majority's order before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur. And, like her, we ask those who are watching this case unfold to retain faith in our judicial system for just a little while longer.""

He also went on to say, ""Members of the Oregon National Guard are our neighbors, family members and friends. Their safety is important. As a community we need to come together and help make sure they are sent home as soon as possible. That means keeping Portland peaceful and safe while our fight in the court moves forward.""

So all of this is really complicated. I feel like I've gotten a lot of lessons in in law recently, but what exactly would that look like then, if you were using the en banc to vacate the majority? How would that work?

LA: Essentially, Judge Graber can actually ask for an en banc. She's a senior judge, but she can still ask for a 9th Circuit holding to be reviewed as long as you're on the panel, and so then the 9th Circuit needs to decide whether it votes to grant that en banc.

Now again, normally in all other circuits that's the entire judiciary, but because the 9th Circuit is so large, it has so many judges, they usually limit it to 10. And usually those hearings take place in San Francisco, although of course now you can do it on Zoom.

And so I assume that the request has already been (made through) AG Rayfield and through Judge Graber, and so now I guess really the next step is we wait to see.

SD: How long typically would that take?

LA: I'm assuming that since all of this is deemed pretty time-sensitive, that we will likely have an answer in the next couple of days, but there's no sort of set rule for this.

SD: What does this say about the president's power when it comes to section 12406 in other states as well?

LA: Right, so in the 9th Circuit — and of course the 9th Circuit involves Oregon, California, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Arizona — this means that the president's power, especially in Section 3, right? So Section 3 is when you can — the president can — federalize the National Guard because they're having difficulty enforcing the laws. But basically his power is, if not entirely unreviewable, highly, highly discretionary.

And this does seem to conflict a little bit with what a different 9th Circuit panel held in Newsom v. Trump, and so it's not uncommon for there to be slightly different interpretations of things, both within a circuit and of course outside of the circuit.

This is where, again, Judge Nelson's concurrence really spends a lot of time and actually goes back and talks about three tax rebellions — Shay's Rebellion, the Whiskey Rebellion, etc. — where the predecessor to 12406 was used, and looking to what was the original intent, which Judge Nelson notes that that should be the view viewpoint as well, saying this is something where the president should not be cabined by the judiciary at all. This is the political process.

SD: Can you remind viewers what Section 12406 is in layman's terms, and and kind of what was the crux of the argument that these two judges sided with to allow this appeal to happen or stay?

LA: Of course. So, 12406 is the statute that allows the president to federalize the National Guard, and (it has) three sections. The one subsection that we care about here is when the president federalizes the National Guard because the area or the people cannot uphold the law.

Now, a lot of the actual opinion is very factually based, so they held that the district court committed error in their interpretation of the facts, particularly in the sense of timeframe. That's a fancy word that means how far do we look back when we look at the September 27th, 28th order saying we need to federalize the National Guard?

So Portland and Oregon said, well right before that in September things were very quiet. In fact, Judge Graber's dissent pointed out there was a two week period where virtually nothing was happening. The government and the president are saying, no actually, if you look back towards June and July, there was a lot of unrest and we needed we need the the National Guard to help.

The other issue that they're arguing about, sort of two-to-one fashion, is the Federal Protective Services sent 25% of its force to help support ICE, to make sure everything is fairly calm ... and so the government is arguing because that takes the Federal Protective Services, those people, away from their other work, they need something like the National Guard.

Now let me say, I think if the Oregon National Guard is sent to Portland, we will likely see an uptick in protests. In fact, we've seen an uptick in protests since September 28, just for reacting.

SD: I wonder, did the justices or did the judges mention anything about that, or was that an argument in the case, that this may cause more harm down the road?

LA: No no, this is just a purely on the facts that had happened, not looking forward.

SD: So of course we saw Judge Immergut block the Oregon National Guard troops from deploying into Portland and then we saw President Trump bring in troops from other states including California. They are still training, they are on standby. How do they play a role here, and what does it mean for the troops from other states now?

LA: Right. So this is why this case is incredibly complicated. So there are actually two, or there were two temporary restraining orders. The first temporary restraining order on which this opinion today directly addresses is the Oregon National Guard, who are in Oregon but of course not in Portland.

The second temporary restraining order is on the California and Texas National Guards, which have also been sent to Oregon. And the 9th Circuit held today that their opinion deals with both temporary restraining orders or TROs, and so presumably if Oregon can come also California and Texas can come, although I think if Oregon can come here to Portland, I think the need for California and Texas will be moot.

SD: So just to be clear, the ruling today basically stayed both of the temporary restraining orders that we saw weeks ago?

LA: They dissolved them.

SD: They dissolved them. So in both of those cases the troops would would be able to come in, whether from Oregon or in another state?

LA: That's right.

SD: Ok. I want to read some of Judge Graber's dissent now that we have here. She said ""today's decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles including sovereign states' control over their state's militias and the people's First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government's policies and actions. I strenuously dissent.""

What stood out to you about her dissent and her opinions here?

LA: Well first, in general, her view of the facts really supports the district court's. But in the bit that you've just read to us and put on the screen, she is arguing a 10th Amendment argument. So the 10th Amendment, for those of you who don't recall, says that all rights not used by the government are reserved to the states.

So she's arguing that this order of federalizing the National Guard is taking away Oregon's right to decide how to use its own state militia. And of course this is also, I would say, a primary aspect of this case — where does the federal government's power end? Where does the state's power begin?

Because of course, this is not as we've seen in the past, where the government of a state or a city has asked the National Guard to come in. This is the government forcing the National Guard in over the protest of both the mayor and the governor, and so I think that's why — and I think it's an interesting fact to note that Judge Graber is a longtime Oregonian, right? She sat on our court of appeals, she sat on our state Supreme Court, and so she is tied to the community in a lot of very important ways.

SD: How would that differ from our two other judges, Nelson and Bade?

LA: Two other judges are more recently appointed in 2019, and neither of them are from Oregon (that I know of) off the top of my head; they're not long-term Oregonians, and so not to say that a judge's opinions on this are totally driven by their backgrounds — I think all of the opinions are deeply steeped in fact and law — but I think my sense is that Judge Graber's strenuous dissent might also stem not just from her reading of law and the facts but also that she is an Oregonian who lives in Portland.

SD: I think it's also important to note though that Judge Karen Immergut also is a Multnomah County judge and she was also appointed by Trump, so she ruled against the government and in favor of the state of Oregon for, of course, that temporary restraining order, and so it is interesting to see that playing out differently.

LA: Right. I think a lot, there's a lot of airtime of who is appointed to the 9th Circuit or the district court by what president. I think when these judges actually begin to serve, it means a lot less.

SD: Do you anticipate that we will see more of these troop deployments now happening around the country now that we have had this ruling, or this decision today?

LA: I think it's possible. Now of course, not all other circuits agree with the 9th Circuit, but I think other circuits may stay if they feel it's correct. If there is trouble or protest outside of ICE facilities, that there's another circuit that is allowing the sending in of the National Guard over both the governor and the mayor of Portland. So I think it could definitely give support. Now, if we have lots of different circuits disagreeing, this might be something that the Supreme Court could pick up, but that I don't know.

SD: We've been waiting for this ruling from the 9th Circuit, for a week and a half, so it's been a while. What does that say to you about maybe what was going on behind the scenes with this?

LA: First of all, I think for those people not used to the pace of appellate courts, this is a really fast opinion. I know I was checking for this opinion about once an hour, roughly. But this is quick.

Now again, this is sort of me reading the tea leaves with no personal knowledge; I think it's because not only do we have a three-judge panel which is divided, but we have, as I said earlier, the per curium opinion, which is a fancy way of saying two judges agree.

And then not only do we have Judge Graber's lengthy dissent, but we have a Judge Nelson's concurrence. And so what often happens in writing these opinions is that they they are circulated — these three pieces of writing are not written in secret and then brought out. They circulate them to each other. And so I'm sure there's been a lot of writing and a lot of rewriting, and I know that the judges were all working very hard and very long hours, as most judges on the Ninth Circuit do.

SD: It is interesting that you mentioned this is actually very quick, right? Because like you said, for us it feels long. We wait every day, it's a big decision for people. I want to ask finally today, what does this say and how does this play a role into the larger lawsuits that we have from the state of Oregon and the government around this issue?

LA: Obviously this is just a smaller facet, really focusing on what's the correct use of ordering the federalization of the National Guard. I do think it's interesting that one of the ways that Portland is trying to deal with the ICE facility entirely is zoning.

Not only have they filed a zoning complaint against ICE for boarding up their windows, they are now also — and this is I believe in the New York Times today — filing a zoning complaint against the ICE building because evidently when ICE decided to rent the building, it said it wouldn't hold people for longer than 14 days and it may be in violation.

So, some of this may actually come down to zoning and property law, which I think is not what people are thinking about when they think about protesting ICE and the federalization of the National Guard.

SD: Yeah, it feels like technicalities, right?

LA: Technical, although I will say that Oregon is famous for having a very strict and very unique zoning. It's a very special Oregon thing. So if this is for some reason decided on zoning, that would be a very Oregon determination.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/d28c8cc2-94e2-4afd-a40c-c5b3329472cf/20251021T011547/d28c8cc2-94e2-4afd-a40c-c5b3329472cf_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 09:56:56.013853

Why it matters: The Trump administration's $100,000 fee for every new H1-B visa applicant is poised to hit small tech companies and startups hard, stifling competition and innovation in the U.S.

Driving the news: Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are calling on Trump and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to come to the table to negotiate a policy solution to H1-B visa issues.

""Together, we should evaluate options that include restrictions on outsourcing firms, visa portability to counter wage suppression, revising eligibility and skill classifications, improving enforcement, and modifying the fee structure,"" the letter, shared first with Axios, states.

Rep. Sam Liccardo (D-Calif.) led the letter, with Reps. Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.), Maria Salazar (R-Fla.) and Don Bacon (R-Neb.) signing on.

Behind the scenes: Liccardo, who represents Silicon Valley, told Axios that he's been surprised at how many early stage founders and venture capitalists have told him they're worried that the visa fee is going to undermine small companies.

The mood is different from major players that can ultimately afford the cost, with Nvidia's Jensen Huang and OpenAI's Sam Altman speaking optimistically about the move.

Liccardo declined to comment on specific companies he spoke with, but said that ""what I consistently hear from early stage innovators, venture capitalists and corporate leaders in Silicon Valley in quiet conversations is very different than what is heard at White House press conferences.""

State of play: The Chamber of Commerce last week sued the Trump administration, contending the fee contradicts immigration law passed by Congress.

Liccardo said he believes Trump's proclamation will be struck down, providing an opportunity to reform the program.

Yes, but: Even before Trump's disregard for congressional authority, lawmakers struggled to pass reforms to the H1-B visa program.

This story is republished from ProPublica, a nonprofit, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

When Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers stormed through Santa Ana, California, in June, panicked calls flooded into the city’s emergency response system.

Recordings of those calls, obtained by ProPublica, captured some of the terror residents felt as they watched masked men ambush people and force them into unmarked cars. In some cases, the men wore plain clothes and refused to identify themselves. There was no way to confirm whether they were immigration agents or imposters. In six of the calls to Santa Ana police, residents described what they were seeing as kidnappings.

“He’s bleeding,” one caller said about a person he saw yanked from a car wash lot and beaten. “They dumped him into a white van. It doesn’t say ICE.”

One woman’s voice shook as she asked, “What kind of police go around without license plates?”

And then this from another: “Should we just run from them?”

During a tense public meeting days later, Mayor Valerie Amezcua and the City Council asked their police chief whether there was anything they could do to rein in the federal agents — even if only to ban the use of masks. The answer was a resounding no. Plus, filing complaints with the Department of Homeland Security was likely to go nowhere because the office that once handled them had been dismantled. There was little chance of holding individual agents accountable for alleged abuses because, among other hurdles, there was no way to reliably learn their identities.

Since then, Amezcua, 58, said she has reluctantly accepted the reality: There are virtually no limits on what federal agents can do to achieve President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations. Santa Ana has proven to be a template for much larger raids and even more violent arrests in Chicago and elsewhere.

“It’s almost like he tries it out in this county and says, ‘It worked there, so now let me send them there,’” Amezcua said.

Current and former national security officials share the mayor’s concerns.

They describe the legions of masked immigration officers operating in near-total anonymity on the orders of the president as the crossing of a line that had long set the United States apart from the world’s most repressive regimes. ICE, in their view, has become an unfettered and unaccountable national police force. The transformation, the officials say, unfolded rapidly and in plain sight. Trump’s DHS appointees swiftly dismantled civil rights guardrails, encouraged agents to wear masks, threatened groups and state governments that stood in their way, and then made so many arrests that the influx overwhelmed lawyers trying to defend immigrants taken out of state or out of the country.

And although they are reluctant to predict the future, the current and former officials worry that this force assembled from federal agents across the country could eventually be turned against any groups the administration labels a threat.

One former senior DHS official who was involved in oversight said that what is happening on American streets today “gives me goosebumps.”

Speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, the official rattled off scenes that once would’ve triggered investigations: “Accosting people outside of their immigration court hearings where they’re showing up and trying to do the right thing and then hauling them off to an immigration jail in the middle of the country where they can’t access loved ones or speak to counsel. Bands of masked men apprehending people in broad daylight in the streets and hauling them off. Disappearing people to a third country, to a prison where there’s a documented record of serious torture and human rights abuse.”

The former official paused. “We’re at an inflection point in history right now and it’s frightening.”

Oversight of ICE gutted

Although ICE is conducting itself out in the open, even inviting conservative social media influencers to accompany its agents on high-profile raids, the agency operates in darkness. The identities of DHS officers, their salaries and their operations have long been withheld for security reasons and generally exempted from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

However, there were offices within DHS created to hold agents and their supervisors accountable for their actions on the job. The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, created by Congress and led largely by lawyers, investigated allegations of rape and unlawful searches from both the public and within DHS ranks, for instance. Egregious conduct was referred to the Justice Department.

The CRCL office had limited powers; former staffers say their job was to protect DHS by ensuring personnel followed the law and addressed civil rights concerns. Still, it was effective in stalling rushed deportations or ensuring detainees had access to phones and lawyers. And even when its investigations didn’t fix problems, CRCL provided an accounting of allegations and a measure of transparency for Congress and the public.

The office processed thousands of complaints — 3,000 in fiscal year 2023 alone — ranging from allegations of lack of access to medical treatment to reports of sexual assault at detention centers. Former staffers said around 600 complaints were open when work was suspended.

The administration has gutted most of the office. What’s left of it was led, at least for a while, by a 29-year-old White House appointee who helped craft Project 2025, the right-wing blueprint that broadly calls for the curtailment of civil rights enforcement.

Meanwhile, ICE is enjoying a windfall in resources. On top of its annual operating budget of $10 billion a year, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill included an added $7.5 billion a year for the next four years for recruiting and retention alone. As part of its hiring blitz, the agency has dropped age, training and education standards and has offered recruits signing bonuses as high as $50,000.

“Supercharging this law enforcement agency and at the same time you have oversight being eliminated?” said the former DHS official. “This is very scary.”

Michelle Brané, a longtime human rights attorney who directed DHS’ ombudsman office during the Biden administration, said Trump’s adherence to “the authoritarian playbook is not even subtle.”

“ICE, their secret police, is their tool,” Brané said. “Once they have that power, which they have now, there’s nothing stopping them from using it against citizens.”

Tricia McLaughlin, the DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, refuted descriptions of ICE as a secret police force. She called such comparisons the kind of “smears and demonization” that led to the recent attack on an ICE facility in Texas, in which a gunman targeted an ICE transport van and shot three detained migrants, two of them fatally, before killing himself.

In a written response to ProPublica, McLaughlin dismissed the current and former national security officials and scholars interviewed by ProPublica as “far-left champagne socialists” who haven’t seen ICE enforcement up close.

“If they had,” she wrote, “they would know when our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs” and other criminals.

McLaughlin said the recruiting blitz is not compromising standards. She wrote that the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center is ready for 11,000 new hires by the beginning of next year and that training has been streamlined and boosted by technology. “Our workforce never stops learning,” McLaughlin wrote.

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson also praised ICE conduct and accused Democrats of making “dangerous, untrue smears.”

“ICE officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism,” Jackson said. “Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals are simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens and fueling false narratives that lead to violence.”

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the Trump pick who fired nearly the entire civil rights oversight staff, said the move was in response to CRCL functioning “as internal adversaries that slow down operations,” according to a DHS spokesperson.

Trump also eliminated the department’s Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, which was charged with flagging inhumane conditions at ICE detention facilities where many of the apprehended immigrants are held. The office was resurrected after a lawsuit and court order, though it’s sparsely staffed.

The hobbling of the office comes as the White House embarks on an aggressive expansion of detention sites with an eye toward repurposing old jails or building new ones with names that telegraph harsh conditions: “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades, built by the state and operated in partnership with DHS, or the “Cornhusker Clink” in Nebraska.

“It is a shocking situation to be in that I don’t think anybody anticipated a year ago,” said Erica Frantz, a political scientist at Michigan State University who studies authoritarianism. “We might’ve thought that we were going to see a slide, but I don’t think anybody anticipated how quickly it would transpire, and now people at all levels are scrambling to figure out how to push back.

“Authoritarian playbook”

Frantz and other scholars who study anti-democratic political systems in other countries said there are numerous examples in which ICE’s activities appear cut from an authoritarian playbook. Among them was the detention of Tufts University doctoral student Rümeysa Öztürk, who was apprehended after co-writing an op-ed for the campus paper that criticized the school’s response to the war in Gaza. ICE held her incommunicado for 24 hours and then shuffled her through three states before jailing her in Louisiana.

“The thing that got me into the topic of ‘maybe ICE is a secret police force’?” said Lee Morgenbesser, an Australian political science professor who studies authoritarianism. “It was that daylight snatching of the Tufts student.”

Morgenbesser was also struck by the high-profile instances of ICE detaining elected officials who attempted to stand in their way. Among them, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander was detained for demanding a judicial warrant from ICE, and U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a DHS press conference.

And David Sklansky, a Stanford Law School professor who researches policing and democracy, said it appears that ICE’s agents are allowed to operate with complete anonymity. “It’s not just that people can’t see faces of the officers,” Sklansky said. “The officers aren’t wearing shoulder insignia or name tags.”

U.S. District Judge William G. Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, recently pointed out that use of masked law enforcement officers had long been considered anathema to American ideals. In a blistering ruling against the administration’s arrests of pro-Palestinian protesters, he wrote, “To us, masks are associated with cowardly desperados and the despised Ku Klux Klan. In all our history we have never tolerated an armed masked secret police.”

The Trump administration has said it will appeal that ruling.

Where the fallout is felt

The fallout is being felt in places like Hays County, Texas, not far from Austin, where ICE apprehended 47 people, including nine children, during a birthday celebration in the early morning of April 1.

The agency’s only disclosure about the raid in Dripping Springs describes the operation as part of a yearlong investigation targeting “members and associates believed to be part of the Venezuelan transnational gang, Tren de Aragua.”

Six months later, the county’s top elected official told ProPublica the federal government has ignored his attempts to get answers.

“We’re not told why they took them, and we’re not told where they took them,” said County Judge Ruben Becerra, a Democrat. “By definition, that’s a kidnapping.”

In the raid, a Texas trooper secured a search warrant that allowed law enforcement officers to breach the home, an Airbnb rental on a vast stretch of land in the Hill Country. Becerra told ProPublica he believes the suspicion of drugs at the party was a pretense to pull people out of the house so ICE officers who lacked a warrant could take them into custody.

The Texas Department of Public Safety did not respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has yet to produce evidence supporting claims of gang involvement, said Karen Muñoz, a civil rights attorney helping families track down their relatives who were jailed or deported. While some court documents are sealed, nothing in the public record verifies the gang affiliation DHS cited as the cause for the birthday party raid.

“There’s no evidence released at all that any person kidnapped at that party was a member of any organized criminal group,” Muñoz said.

McLaughlin, the DHS spokesperson, did not respond to questions about Hays County and other raids where families and attorneys allege a lack of transparency and due process.

In plain sight

Months after ICE’s widely publicized raids, fear continues to envelop Santa Ana, a majority-Hispanic city with a large immigrant population. Amezcua, the mayor, said the raids have complicated local policing and rendered parents afraid to pick up their children from school. The city manager, a California-born citizen and Latino, carries with him three government IDs, including a passport.

Raids of car washes and apartment buildings continue, but the community has started to “push back,” Amezcua said. “Like many other communities, the neighbors come out. People stop in the middle of traffic.”

With so few institutional checks on ICE’s powers, citizens are increasingly relying on themselves. On at least one occasion in nearby Downey, a citizen’s intervention had some effect.

On June 12, Melyssa Rivas had just started her workday when a colleague burst into her office with urgent news: “ICE is here.”

The commotion was around the corner in Rivas’ hometown, a Los Angeles suburb locals call “Mexican Beverly Hills” for its stately houses and affluent Hispanic families. Rivas, 31, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, belongs to Facebook groups where residents share updates about cultural festivals, church programs and, these days, the presence of Trump’s deportation foot soldiers.

Rivas had seen posts about ICE officers sweeping through LA and figured Downey’s turn had come. She and her co-worker rushed toward the sound of screaming at a nearby intersection. Rivas hit “record” on her phone as a semicircle of trucks and vans came into view. She filmed at least half a dozen masked men in camouflage vests encircling a Hispanic man on his knees

Her unease deepened as she registered details that “didn’t seem right,” Rivas recalled in an interview. She said the parked vans had out-of-state plates or no tags. The armed men wore only generic “police” patches, and most were in street clothes. No visible insignia identified them as state or federal — or even legal authorities at all.

“When is it that we just decided to do things a different way? There’s due process, there’s a legal way, and it just doesn’t seem to matter anymore,” Rivas said. “Where are human rights?”

Video footage shows Rivas and others berating the officers for complicity in what they called a “kidnapping.” Local news channels later reported that the vehicles had chased the man after a raid at a nearby car wash.

“I know half of you guys know this is fucked up,” Rivas was recorded telling the officers.

Moments later, the scene took a turn. As suddenly as they’d arrived, the officers returned to their vehicles and left, with no apology and no explanation to the distraught man they left on the sidewalk.

Through a mask, one of them said, “Have a good day.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.investigativepost.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/h_16365414.jpg.webp?fit=2000%2C1333&ssl=1,N,,2025-10-21 06:57:45.410976

The official DHS account posted the video on Friday, which features an on-screen message that reads: “ICE We’re on the way. Word in the streets cartels put a $50k bounty on y’all.”

Noem herself claimed that drug cartels were placing bounties on agents’ heads in an interview with Fox and Friends earlier this month.

The department’s own comment in its post declared: “FAFO. If you threaten or lay hands on our law enforcement officers we will hunt you down and you will find out, really quick. We’ll see you cowards soon.”

However, social media users soon claimed to have tracked down the original version of the video and alleged it was first uploaded with an entirely different caption, in which the participants jokingly threaten Iran, not U.S. federal immigration agents.

California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell was reportedly one of the first to rebuke Secretary Noem over the post but has since deleted a tweet that read: “Kristi – DELETE THIS TWEET or answer for it in Congress. It’s FAKE. You’re the Queen of Photoshopping.”

Democratic congressional candidate Danny D Glover was among those to subsequently share a new TikTok video by the young man featured most prominently in the clip in which he explained that he had been notified about the controversy the DHS post had stirred up and said: “I saw the caption and I was like, ‘I didn’t do that!’”

He continued: “I’ve still got the video saved in my drafts on TikTok. Here’s the messed-up part: the federal government is involved with something that I didn’t do. What?”

A DHS spokesperson has since told The Independent in response: “This young man posted violent threats of murder against our law enforcement. He then deleted it when he was called out and attempted to deny all wrongdoing. We have the receipts, and the internet is forever.

“DHS did not edit, change, use AI, or in any other manner or form alter this video. It was downloaded directly from this individual’s account on Friday, October 17th after it had already acquired over 40,000 likes and hundreds of comments urging individuals to target our ICE officers.

“The willful ignorance and intentional blindness by leading Democrats to the massive increase in violent rhetoric against our agents due to their actions is both disgusting and disappointing. Violence against our agents and officers MUST STOP.”

The DHS has received regular criticism this year for its social media output under Noem’s leadership, which has often seen it mix memes with aggressive posturing against undocumented migrants.

It received a savage response from the creators of South Park after it attempted to repurpose a still from a recent episode satirising ICE, the Trump administration and Noem herself, while the pop star Jess Glynn said she felt “sick” when one of her songs was used in a video about mass deportations.

Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the estates of Woody Guthrie and Tom Petty have similarly complained about their songs being used in DHS posts and the painter Morgan Weistling and the estate of another artist, Thomas Kincaid, have also complained about their work being appropriated.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has previously said of the DHS’s online messaging strategy: “The Department of Homeland Security is bypassing the mainstream media to give Americans the facts, debunk the lies, and unapologetically celebrate our homeland, heritage, and the rule of law.

“We are pleased that the media is highlighting DHS’s historic successes in making America safe again.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/b4071ae7e31f04ae563e6e4230215610,N,,2025-10-21 10:17:03.200545

Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.
During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.
The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.
Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.","Maria worked cleaning schools in Florida for $13 an hour. Every two weeks, she’d get a $900 paycheck from her employer, a contractor. Not much — but enough to cover rent in the house that she and her 11-year-old son share with five families, plus electricity, a cellphone and groceries.

In August, it all ended.

When she showed up at the job one morning, her boss told her that she couldn’t work there anymore. The Trump administration had terminated President Joe Biden’s humanitarian parole program, which provided legal work permits for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans as well as Nicaraguans like Maria.

“I feel desperate,” said Maria, 48, who requested anonymity to talk about her ordeal because she fears being detained and deported. “I don’t have any money to buy anything. I have $5 in my account. I’m left with nothing.”

President Donald Trump’s sweeping crackdown on immigration is throwing foreigners like Maria out of work and shaking the American economy and job market. And it’s happening at a time when hiring is already deteriorating amid uncertainty over Trump’s erratic trade policies.

Immigrants do jobs — cleaning houses, picking tomatoes, painting fences — that most native-born Americans won’t, and for less money. But they also bring the technical skills and entrepreneurial energy that have helped make the United States the world’s economic superpower.

Trump is attacking immigration at both ends of the spectrum, deporting low-wage laborers and discouraging skilled foreigners from bringing their talents to the United States.

And he is targeting an influx of foreign workers that eased labor shortages and upward pressure on wages and prices at a time when most economists thought that taming inflation would require sky-high interest rates and a recession — a fate the United States escaped in 2023 and 2024.

“Immigrants are good for the economy,” said Lee Branstetter, an economist at Carnegie-Mellon University. “Because we had a lot of immigration over the past five years, an inflationary surge was not as bad as many people expected.”

More workers filling more jobs and spending more money has also helped drive economic growth and create still-more job openings. Economists fear that Trump’s deportations and limits on even legal immigration will do the reverse.

In a July report, researchers Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the centrist Brookings Institution and Stan Veuger of the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute calculated that the loss of foreign workers will mean that monthly U.S. job growth “could be near zero or negative in the next few years.”

Hiring has already slowed significantly, averaging a meager 29,000 a month from June through August. (The September jobs report has been delayed by the ongoing shutdown of the federal government.) During the post-pandemic hiring boom of 2021-2023, by contrast, employers added a stunning 400,000 jobs a month.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, citing fallout from Trump’s immigration and trade policies, downgraded its forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to 1.4% from the 1.9% it had previously expected and from 2.5% in 2024.

‘We need these people’

Goodwin Living, an Alexandria, Virginia nonprofit that provides senior housing, health care and hospice services, had to lay off four employees from Haiti after the Trump administration terminated their work permits. The Haitians had been allowed to work under a humanitarian parole program and had earned promotions at Goodwin.

“That was a very, very difficult day for us,” CEO Rob Liebreich said. “It was really unfortunate to have to say goodbye to them, and we’re still struggling to fill those roles.”

Liebreich is worried that another 60 immigrant workers could lose their temporary legal right to live and work in the United States. “We need all those hands,” he said. “We need all these people.”

Goodwin Living has 1,500 employees, 60% of them from foreign countries. It has struggled to find enough nurses, therapists and maintenance staff. Trump’s immigration crackdown, Liebreich said, is “making it harder.”

The ICE crackdown

Trump’s immigration ambitions, intended to turn back what he calls an “invasion” at America’s southern border and secure jobs for U.S.-born workers, were once viewed with skepticism because of the money and economic disruption required to reach his goal of deporting 1 million people a year. But legislation that Trump signed into law July 4 — and which Republicans call the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — suddenly made his plans plausible.

The law pours $150 billion into immigration enforcement, setting aside $46.5 billion to hire 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents and $45 billion to increase the capacity of immigrant detention centers.

And his empowered ICE agents have shown a willingness to move fast and break things — even when their aggression conflicts with other administration goals.

Last month, immigration authorities raided a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia, detained 300 South Korean workers and showed video of some of them shackled in chains. They’d been working to get the plant up and running, bringing expertise in battery technology and Hyundai procedures that local American workers didn’t have.

The incident enraged the South Koreans and ran counter to Trump’s push to lure foreign manufacturers to invest in America. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned that the country’s other companies might be reluctant about betting on America if their workers couldn’t get visas promptly and risked getting detained.

Sending Medicaid recipients to the fields

America’s farmers are among the president’s most dependable supporters.

But John Boyd Jr., who farms 1,300 acres of soybeans, wheat and corn in southern Virginia, said that the immigration raids — and the threat of them — are hurting farmers already contending with low crop prices, high costs and fallout from Trump’s trade war with China, which has stopped buying U.S. soybeans and sorghum.

“You got ICE out here, herding these people up,” said Boyd, founder of the National Black Farmers Association . “[Trump] says they’re murderers and thieves and drug dealers, all this stuff. But these are people who are in this country doing hard work that many Americans don’t want to do.”

Boyd scoffed at U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins’ suggestion in July that U.S.-born Medicaid recipients could head to the fields to meet work requirements imposed this summer by the Republican Congress. “People in the city aren’t coming back to the farm to do this kind of work,” he said. “It takes a certain type of person to bend over in 100-degree heat.”

The Trump administration itself admits that the immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages on the farm that could translate into higher prices at the supermarket.

“The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce,” the Labor Department said in an Oct. 2 filing of the Federal Register, “results in significant disruptions to production costs and [threatens] the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers.”

“You’re not welcome here”

Jed Kolko of the Peterson Institute for International Economics said that job growth is slowing in businesses that rely on immigrants. Construction companies, for instance, have shed 10,000 jobs since May.

“Those are the short-term effects,” said Kolko, a Commerce Department official in the Biden administration. “The longer-term effects are more serious because immigrants traditionally have contributed more than their share of patents, innovation, productivity.”

Especially worrisome to many economists was Trump’s sudden announcement last month that he was raising the fee on H-1B visas, meant to lure hard-to-find skilled foreign workers to the United States, from as little as $215 to $100,000.

“A $100,000 visa fee is not just a bureaucratic cost — it’s a signal,” Dany Bahar, senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, said. “It tells global talent: ‘You are not welcome here.’”

Some are already packing up.

In Washington D.C., one H-1B visa holder, a Harvard graduate from India who works for a nonprofit helping Africa’s poor, said Trump’s signal to employers is clear: Think twice about hiring H-1B visa holders.

The man, who requested anonymity, is already preparing paperwork to move to the United Kingdom. “The damage is already done, unfortunately,” he said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/10/Immigration.jpg,N,,2025-10-21 08:57:31.132899

During a hearing Monday, she pressed two federal officials over the response to ongoing and intense protests in Chicago amid Operation Midway Blitz, especially after she expanded her temporary restraining order to include having agents on the ground turn on their body worn cameras when encountering demonstrators.

She tried to get a better sense of which agency has responsibility over what, how her restraining order has been disseminated to federal agents working in Chicago, how extensive training on crowd control and protests have been and what happened at certain fraught encounters over the last few weeks.

Here are the main takeaways from Monday’s hearing.

Judge wants body cameras on all officers at protests, not all have them

Ellis early this month issued a sweeping order restricting agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists documenting protests in Chicago. During a hearing last week, she said she had concerns about whether her order was being followed.

During the hearing, she added mandatory body-worn cameras to her earlier restraining order, saying it appeared agents were not warning demonstrators before deploying tear gas and firing pepper balls at them.

The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras but her order does not require them if they are undercover, not in uniform or exempt by Customs and Border Protection, ICE or DHS policy.

Every CBP agent on duty in Chicago – more than 200 – has a body camera and knows they are required to use it, CBP Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick said during Monday’s hearing.

ICE’s Special Response Teams, however, have not been issued body cameras, ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers testified. They went to one or two field offices but stopped being issued, and would need to go through Congress to get approved, Byers said without elaborating.

Federal agents are trained on how to respond to protesters

ICE agents have been trained on how to respond to demonstrations and how to arrest protesters as part of their use of force training, Byers said. They have the ability to issue felony and misdemeanor citations during demonstrations.

Members of ICE’s Special Response Team have been outside the Broadview detention facility, the center of many anti-immigration enforcement demonstrations monitoring protests, and Byers indicated they too, are extensively trained.

ICE agents are also specifically trained on how to handle reporters and direct press questions to public affairs. He added journalists have the right to observe, as long as they do not interfere.

“As long as they’re in the media area, we shouldn’t have a problem with press,” Byers said.

When questioned about an incident outside the Broadview facility in which a pastor said he was hit with pepper balls, Byers said the pastor did not leave federal property when given multiple commands to do so.

Rev. David Black said he was outside the facility praying for the ICE officers and those detained inside when he was hit. He told CNN’s Erin Burnett on October 9 there was no warning before less-than-lethal force was used during the demonstration.

“After they shot me in my head and my face, and multiple times in my torso, arms and legs, I was shielded by the bodies of others who were there who rushed in to support me and took many more hits that were intended for me,” Black said.

Federal leadership’s a ‘revolving door,’ with multiple agencies on the ground

Operation Midway Blitz is Trump’s recent ICE deployment across Chicagoland, yielding more than 1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois between September 8 and October 3, DHS said.

Harvick on Monday reiterated the White House’s denials of news coverage of tear gas used on protesters without warning in a recent demonstration in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood, although he acknowledged he had not seen it personally. Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney representing the Trump administration, last week said the judge was relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”

When force is used during protests, reports are reviewed by ICE leadership, the Office of Professional Responsibility and a review committee to determine if the use of force meets policy, Byers said.

The agency’s Special Response Team falls under the same enforcement mission as ICE, but members report directly to Byers, he said, adding ICE leadership has been “kind of a revolving door.”

Harvick and Byers testified Monday after Russell Hott, the former interim head of Chicago’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, had left the Chicago area to return to his permanent job as field operations director in Washington, DC.

Ellis will continue to question top brass at a later time after saying Monday she will still depose Hott and Gregory Bovino, chief patrol agent at CBP.

She added since Hott was the highest officer in Chicago at the time the protests occurred, he should be able to speak to what happened on the ground.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2240700506.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-21 11:18:43.591965

Immigration, gratitude and mutual transformation Christian theology invites us to see immigration through the lens of grace.
A liberal democracy rooted in Christian moral soil cannot discriminate by race or religion without betraying its own essence.","From time to time, the debate about immigration flares up again in Australia — as it does across much of the secular, liberal West. Anti-immigration rallies, political posturing and cultural anxiety all point to something deeper: a crisis of confidence in Western civilisation itself. Our arguments about border protection, population size and cultural change are rarely only about economics or security. They are about belonging, about who “we” are and who “we” imagine we might cease to be.

Some Christian commentators lament the “de-Christianisation” of Australia through non-European immigration, while others celebrate multiculturalism as a sign of moral progress. Yet both responses are often superficial. They treat immigration as a problem to be managed or a virtue to be signalled, rather than an invitation to re-imagine what belonging itself means. A properly theological account of immigration remains rare.

Unlike either side of the debate, Christian theology offers a vision of what it means to be human and to belong. It affirms that the best achievements of the West — the rule of law, human rights, education, welfare, civic virtue — are rooted in Christian moral soil. These are not merely cultural conventions, but the social fruit of a vision of humanity grounded in divine image-bearing and neighbourly love. Yet when “Western values” are defended in exclusionary or ethnocultural terms, Christianity itself is distorted. For the Christian faith is not the possession of one people, but a trans-ethnic, trans-cultural story that continually crosses borders.

The immigration debate often mirrors our wider political polarisation: cosmopolitan progressives who downplay national identity and border integrity versus local or regional communities who feel the pressure of rapid change, economic dislocation and cultural loss. In Australia, this tension produces an oscillation between liberal universalism (“we’re all the same”) and reactionary nationalism (“this is our country”). Both are inadequate.

Liberalism sees individuals with rights, not communities with histories. Nationalism tends to see tribes with enemies, not humanity created in God’s image. Both neglect what I believe Christianity uniquely offers: a moral and imaginative vision of shared creaturehood, capable of honouring difference without collapsing into division.

Creation, fall and the nations

The biblical story begins with the creation of humanity in God’s image — a shared origin that unites all peoples in a common vocation to steward the earth. To be human is to be entrusted to exercise dominion not by exploitation but by care, and to build cultures and communities that reflect divine goodness. Each people, each language, each tradition bears traces of that creative purpose.

Yet sin fractures this unity. Cain kills Abel; brother turns on brother. Human life becomes marked by fear, rivalry and displacement. The story of Babel dramatises this fall into self-enclosure: a human city built to reach heaven and make a name for itself. The scattering of nations that follows is both judgement and mercy — judgement upon pride, mercy in the preservation of difference. Humanity becomes a fellowship of strangers: alienated yet still bound by shared dignity and divine calling.

God’s redemptive purpose begins not with the erasure of difference but through a particular story. Abram and Sarai are called to leave their land and kindred to become the parents of a nation through whom “all the families of the earth shall be blessed” (Genesis 12:3). Israel’s election is thus never for itself alone; it is a vocation to hospitality.

Throughout Scripture, the foreigner is a test of Israel’s faithfulness. The Torah repeatedly commands love for the stranger, “for you were strangers in the land of Egypt” (for example, Exodus 22:21 and Deuteronomy 10:19). The story of Ruth, the Moabite widow who becomes the ancestor of David, shows that belonging to God’s people depends not on ethnicity but on faith and fidelity. The prophets envision a time when Israel’s enemies — Egypt and Assyria — will join her in worship (Isaiah 19:25).

This pattern continues through exile and return. Israel learns that home and holiness are not simply a matter of territory but of covenant. When the nations come streaming to Zion in Isaiah’s vision, they bring their cultural distinctiveness with them. God’s purpose is not homogeneity but reconciled diversity — a communion of the different. The question is not whether the nations will be gathered, but how: by coercive assimilation, or by the reconciling work of God.

The church as a model of reconciled diversity

That question is answered in Christ. In the one man Jesus — the Son of David and the Son of God — God creates a new humanity (Ephesians 2:15), reconciling Jew and Gentile into one body. The hostility between peoples is not managed but abolished in him.

The early church was a sociological impossibility. Jews and Gentiles shared table fellowship without one absorbing the other. The apostle Paul fought tirelessly to defend this radical experiment in unity: Gentile believers need not become Jews, nor Jews cease to be Jews. Their fellowship was grounded not in cultural sameness but in a common confession of Christ’s lordship.

The church’s earliest controversies — over food laws, circumcision and worship — were all struggles over belonging. The apostles insisted that the new community must reflect God’s impartial welcome: “God shows no favouritism” (Acts 10:35). The Acts of the Apostles depicts this as a continual conversion of the church itself — a learning to recognise the Spirit at work beyond familiar boundaries.

Pentecost becomes the mirror image of Babel. The nations hear the gospel in their own tongues. Unity does not come through the loss of language but through shared praise. The final vision in the Book of Revelation brings this to fulfilment: “the kings of the earth bring their glory into the city” (21:24) and “the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations” (22:2).

Here is the Christian imagination at its fullest: humanity reconciled without uniformity, difference cherished without hostility. The church’s calling is to embody this future in the present. While the state is not the church, it can echo this moral grammar of shared life — justice, hospitality, mutual responsibility. Christian discipleship, properly lived, cultivates the civic virtues on which plural societies depend: patience, humility, forbearance and hope.

Liberalism’s strengths and blind spots

Modern liberal democracy, for all its achievements, now struggles to articulate a moral centre. Historically, liberalism arose from Christian convictions about conscience and equality before God. It sought to protect the individual from tyranny and to guarantee freedom of belief. But in severing itself from its theological roots, liberalism risks losing the moral imagination that once sustained it.

Procedural neutrality — the idea that the state should not privilege any moral vision — was meant to secure fairness. Yet it has left many societies unsure of what the common good actually is. Immigration debates thus tend to devolve into technocratic calculations (“how many?”) or tribal reactions (“who belongs?”), rather than moral reflection (“what kind of community are we becoming?”).

Because liberalism is formally blind to culture and creed, it cannot easily affirm the goods of its own heritage. Australia’s civic values — equality, tolerance, the fair go — are now defended as pragmatic conveniences rather than moral commitments. Even our national rituals and holidays are sites of division and embarrassment.

What is missing is a moral narrative: a story of who we are and what we owe one another. The fading of the Christian imagination among the host culture, rather than the arrival of migrants, explains much of our insecurity. Liberal order depends on moral capital it cannot itself replenish.

Christian nationalism, the reactionary counterpart to secular liberalism, fares no better. It mistakes faith for heritage and confuses the church’s mission with the preservation of cultural dominance. Christianity cannot be reduced to civil religion. It can, however, remind liberal democracy of its deepest inheritance: that freedom is a gift, not a possession, and that human dignity is grounded not in consent but in creation.

Immigration, gratitude and mutual transformation

Christian theology invites us to see immigration through the lens of grace. The land itself is not our possession but God’s gift: “The earth is the Lord’s and everything in it” (Psalm 24:1). Israel was commanded to hold its inheritance lightly, to remember that it had been a landless people. Gratitude, not entitlement, was to shape its life.

A Christian posture toward nationhood begins with that same gratitude rather than fear: “What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits to me?” (Psalm 116:12) — the text, incidentally, of the first Christian sermon preached on Australia soil in 1788. Gratitude reorders our imagination. It reminds us that none of us is native to grace; we are all guests at a table not of our own making.

Such gratitude opens the door to hospitality. Immigration policy must, of course, reckon with practical limits — infrastructure, housing, labour needs, social cohesion. But when we welcome others, we do so not as economic units or potential threats but as fellow image-bearers whose presence can enrich and transform us.

Australia’s post-war history illustrates this vividly. Migrants from southern Europe, then Asia, the Middle East and Africa reshaped the nation — rebuilding its cities, staffing its hospitals, enlivening its churches, enriching its cuisine and language. The resilience, family loyalty and communal ethos many brought have gently rebuked Western individualism. Far from eroding social fabric, they have often renewed it.

Immigration is thus not a one-way act of charity but a reciprocal moral encounter. The host is changed by the guest. Our challenge is not to preserve cultural purity but to discern, within change, the opportunity for moral renewal. The biblical pattern of hospitality always involves transformation: both guest and host emerge different. Abraham, welcoming strangers under the oaks of Mamre, finds himself addressed by God.

The goal, then, is neither assimilation (which demands sameness) nor relativistic multiculturalism (which denies shared goods). It is a covenantal vision of belonging — a moral horizon within which both host and newcomer are invited to grow in gratitude and mutual responsibility.

Australia and the question of religious diversity

By global standards, Australia has managed multiculturalism remarkably well. We are a nation of immigrants living on land long inhabited by others. The presence of Indigenous Australians reminds us that belonging carries responsibilities — to place, to memory, to stewardship. Any theology of migration in this land must begin with that older story of dispossession and endurance.

Yet anxiety persists, especially around Islam. Islamist extremism abroad has fed fears that Muslim migration threatens Western values. Some claim that liberal societies, bound by neutrality, cannot defend themselves against illiberal ideologies. Such fears, however, too often conflate cultural difference with moral threat.

A liberal democracy rooted in Christian moral soil cannot discriminate by race or religion without betraying its own essence. What it can do, however, is insist that all who come share in a covenant of civic responsibility. Shared life requires moral commitments: respect for law, freedom of conscience, the dignity of labour, care for neighbour.

Christians, of all people, should be first to defend religious freedom for others — including Muslims. The same liberty that allows Muslims to practice their faith allows Christians to live out theirs. Moreover, devout Muslims and Christians often find common cause in defending the sanctity of life, the integrity of family and the necessity of moral seriousness in public life. Their coexistence can remind a secular culture that belief is not a private eccentricity but a public good.

The challenge is to cultivate moral confidence without moral arrogance — to know and cherish the Christian roots of our civilisation without idolising them. Our task is not to restore Christendom (even if that were that possible) but to live wisely in its aftermath. That wisdom begins in humility: remembering that we too are heirs of grace, not architects of it.

Hospitality with moral confidence

Biblical hospitality is not sentimental but moral; it is a welcome that forms as well as receives. The stranger is invited not into chaos, but into a way of life ordered toward peace. The guest is respected but also called to share responsibility for the household. This is not uniformity nor unchecked pluralism, but a unity strengthened by difference.

At Pentecost, the nations did not lose their languages; they found a common praise. The church’s life — diverse yet bound by love in Christ — offers a glimpse of what civic life might aspire to be: hospitality with confidence. Not the brittle confidence of superiority, nor the anxious guilt of liberalism, but the grounded generosity of a people who know that what they have has been given.

A wise immigration policy must always reckon with practical considerations, including labour, the cost of living, and housing. It is certainly not xenophobic or racist to question the current number of immigrants. However, when we receive others as we ourselves have been received by grace, immigration ceases to be a threat to who we are. It becomes the means by which we rediscover who, by God’s mercy, we might yet become — a community of strangers learning together the art of belonging.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c1293c3a146d1a050b4b67df6062143e?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2813&cropW=5000&xPos=0&yPos=262&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-10-21 05:56:29.511905

Essential services While not every federal agency has stopped responding to congressional staffers, multiple caseworkers described inquiries going unanswered this month.
And unlike some of his colleagues, Lawler’s message was that constituent services continue despite the shutdown.
Casework, he said, “too often doesn’t get enough attention — the work congressional offices do every day to help people, even when Washington grinds to a halt.”","For most of this year, caseworkers in Rep. Suhas Subramanyam’s office have struggled to get through to federal agencies, as mass layoffs rippled through the Trump administration.

His staff was starting to make inroads again with certain agencies, like the Internal Revenue Service, the Virginia Democrat said.

Then, the shutdown came.

“They have gone back to not being responsive. And when I say not responsive, I mean you can’t get a hold of a human being on the phone,” Subramanyam said. “You’re just getting answering machines saying that we’re in a shutdown.”

The current lapse in government funding has taken what’s already a tough job and raised the stakes, said Anne Meeker, a former congressional caseworker.

“This is probably one of the worst and most difficult shutdowns that most caseworkers working today will have seen,” said Meeker, now managing director at POPVOX Foundation.

Caseworkers are the unsung group of congressional aides who deal directly with constituents, trying to help them with problems ranging from immigration cases, to veterans benefits, to Social Security payments and more. They guide ordinary people through the maze of government bureaucracy — and to do so, they rely on their relationships with liaisons at federal agencies.

Now many of those agencies have stopped responding, effectively bringing some forms of constituent services to a screeching halt. As the government shutdown stretches into its fourth week, that interruption in service has spurred cross-party tension and left some constituents without a valuable lifeline.

“Because of the Schumer Shutdown, our caseworkers are not able to assist constituents with their cases because agency workers are furloughed,” Nebraska Republican Rep. Don Bacon said in a statement, blaming Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer for the funding stalemate that began Oct. 1. “We have constituents waiting for answers from the IRS, Veterans Affairs and Department of Labor, and they shouldn’t have to wait because Senate Democrats won’t open the government.”

Some of this is not new. When the government partially shuttered in 2018–19 for 35 days, caseworkers had to navigate a patchwork of contacts depending on which congressional liaisons were still at work.

But this time around, they are dealing with an executive branch already thinned out by an aggressive push earlier in the Trump administration, led in part by Elon Musk, to cut jobs and shrink the civil service.

And while the legislative branch was already funded during the previous partial shutdown, meaning congressional staff were still collecting paychecks, this time they are showing up to work without pay, like other essential workers across the government.

Meanwhile, they’re dealing with a climate of heightened fear in the wake of two high-profile political assassinations this year and rising threats against members of Congress and their staff.

According to one Senate Democratic aide, who worked through prior shutdowns in 2013 and 2018, many caseworkers are anxious about potentially being targeted by an angry constituent. In at least one instance during the shutdown, her office received a profanity-laced email from someone they were trying to help.

“It’s frustrating, it’s disheartening, it’s sad. People are definitely discouraged,” said the aide, who was granted anonymity because she is not authorized to speak to the press. “I think the people who answer the phones … are definitely feeling abused a bit.”

While caseworkers have traditionally operated above the political fray, the aide said that dynamic has started to change.

“I’ve just seen a really sharp withdrawal of Republicans participating in these casework chats that we have and the meetings that we have, and any kind of collaboration. They’ve just kind of disappeared,” the aide said.

Essential services

While not every federal agency has stopped responding to congressional staffers, multiple caseworkers described inquiries going unanswered this month. One auto-response email from the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Office of Congressional Relations states that until the government reopens, “staff are currently out of the office and unable to respond to emails, phone calls, or [perform] other work-related duties.”

Other messages are more political in nature.

“Because Senate Democrats decided to block a clean, routine government funding bill, OPM was forced to halt all non-shutdown-related work — including congressional constituent services — at the close of business on September 30, 2025,” reads one auto-reply from the legislative affairs division of the Office of Personnel Management. “We hope Senate Democrats come to their senses and pass a continuing resolution to end the government shutdown.”

At least at the moment, there seems little hope of the GOP-led continuing resolution passing. The bill continues to go down in the Senate, largely along party lines.

In the meantime, Rep. Joseph D. Morelle, D-N.Y., and other Democrats have urged the Trump administration to restore some staffing in the executive branch to allow casework to proceed.

“When these channels of communication are disrupted, the consequences are immediate and personal — delayed benefits, financial hardship, and increased frustration among the American people who depend on their government to function effectively,” Morelle and 22 other House Democrats wrote to President Donald Trump and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought earlier this month. The letter cites reports that the Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and IRS had ceased constituent casework operations.

“These are effectively essential services. Let’s say you have a visa or a passport problem. Those offices may be barebones, but they should continue to function,” Morelle said on Monday. “I think it’s the administration’s way of causing pain.”

Meanwhile, House Republicans have been mostly in their home districts since the start of the shutdown, a decision that Democrats say has to do with fear of a vote over releasing documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Speaker Mike Johnson, who has sought to place blame for the shutdown on Senate Democrats, said last week that members of the House GOP were home to help their constituents.

“They’re helping the American people navigate the mess that the Democrats have created,” Johnson said at an Oct. 16 press conference. “Staying back to work with our constituents was a decision that we made very thoughtfully and we made collectively as a group.”

New York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler held a press conference in his home district on Monday that featured a group of constituents that had been helped by his office. He touted more than 7,500 cases closed since he came to Congress in 2023. And unlike some of his colleagues, Lawler’s message was that constituent services continue despite the shutdown.

“If you’re struggling to get help from a federal agency, reach out. We’re here to serve you,” he said.

Bass and the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), said that Congress would open up “a broad investigation” into arrests of U.S. citizens by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, as well as another investigation into immigration raids overall. The announcement was made Monday at a news conference at L.A. City Hall.

“Donald Trump and [Department of Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem are terrorizing immigrants, working people, the people of Los Angeles and of our state every single day,” Garcia said. “They violate the law and they violate the Constitution.”

Garcia said that his House committee would investigate “every single brutal misconduct” that immigration authorities have committed in Los Angeles as well as across the country.

Simultaneously, the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will conduct an inquiry into reports of the detention of at least 170 U.S. citizens by immigration authorities, which was reported by ProPublica last week.

“Troublingly, the pattern of U.S. Citizen arrests coincides with an alarming increase in racial profiling — particularly of Latinos — which has been well documented in Los Angeles,” Garcia and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote in a letter to Noem. “In a pattern symptomatic of a disregard for civil rights by DHS, U.S. citizens have faced extended periods of detention.”

For months, agents had roamed the streets of Los Angeles toting guns and chasing down immigrants. The scenes that have played out on the streets — protesters being arrested, immigrants dragged out of their cars — have been repeated in Chicago and other cities with largely Democratic leadership. Federal authorities have arrested more than 7,100 undocumented immigrants in the Los Angeles area since June 6, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Bass said the arrests of American citizens means that no one in the country is safe.

“This can happen to anyone, to all of us, at any period of time,” she said.

Garcia said that the first hearing of the House committee will be held in Los Angeles and that Angelenos should attend and be heard on immigration enforcement issues.

The congressman did not give a date for the hearing, but said he hoped it would be soon.

In the letter that Garcia and Blumenthal sent to Noem on Monday, the legislators called on the Department of Homeland Security to report the total number of U.S. citizens who have been detained by immigration authorities, as well as how long each individual was detained. They also asked for information regarding the training that ICE and Customs and Border Protection agents receive on use of force, among other things.

The Department of Homeland Security denied targeting U.S. citizens for immigration enforcement, but said that even citizens will be arrested if they impede law enforcement from doing their jobs.

""Claims by the media, agitators, and sanctuary politicians like Mayor Bass and Rep. Garcia that ICE is targeting U.S. citizens, making unconstitutional arrests, and “trampling on civil liberties” are FALSE,"" said Assistant Secretary of DHS Tricia McLaughlin in a statement emailed to The Times.

The Monday letter — led by Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., and also signed by Reps. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., Eugene Vindman, D-Va., and Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, along with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C. — argues that DHS violated the Antideficiency Act when it reassigned those Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency staff to roles within Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Protective Service and Customs and Border Protection.

The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from spending or obligating funding without congressional approval during a government shutdown. Amid the ongoing lapse in federal funding, the moves “raise serious concerns” about the Trump administration’s motives, the lawmakers say in the missive, which was first viewed by Nextgov/FCW.

“It is difficult to understand how defending the nation’s cyber and physical infrastructure could be viewed as inconsistent with the president’s stated goal of protecting the homeland,” the letter says.

It also argues recent termination notices issued to staff in CISA’s Stakeholder Engagement and Infrastructure Divisions are “the very teams responsible for coordinating with public and private partners to identify, mitigate and prevent cyberattacks.”

The lawmakers urge Noem “to immediately reclassify DHS personnel transferred away from CISA back into cyber defense roles.”

The reassignments have been occurring over the course of several weeks now. Many, but not all, of the reassignments direct staff to ICE, CBP and FPS, two people familiar with the matter previously said.

The Trump administration has steered tens of billions of dollars toward DHS immigration and border security agencies as part of a renewed push to expand detention capacity, accelerate deportations and fortify barriers along the U.S. southern border. Several of those detainments have ensnared U.S. citizens and have raised major legal and ethical questions about ICE’s handling of immigration enforcement.

The Monday letter asks Noem about whether impact assessments were conducted before firings and reassignments, how the cuts square with CISA’s mandate to reduce cyber-infrastructure risks and what concrete mitigations exist to sustain cyberdefenses.

“Firing or reassigning CISA’s cybersecurity experts in the middle of a shutdown isn’t just wrong — it’s illegal and dangerous,” Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW in a statement. “These personnel protect our power grids, hospital networks and water systems from cyber attacks. Diverting them to serve a political agenda puts American lives at risk and violates the very laws meant to protect the public.”

At any given time, foreign adversaries and criminal hackers could be targeting U.S. networks, including federal agencies that oftentimes possess high value data like national security plans, financial data and internal government communications.

CISA directed agencies just last week to patch various services offered by application delivery provider F5 after hackers penetrated the company’s systems. The intrusion has been linked to Chinese state-aligned hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

In an interview last month, prior to the ongoing lapse in federal funding, Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW that the Antideficiency Act “is very clear that, in a shutdown, the federal government can only do essentially two categories of things: functions that are necessary to preserve life and property, or functions required by the Constitution, fulfilling a constitutional duty.”

Cybersecurity has been historically a bipartisan matter in Washington, but CISA, the nation’s core civilian cyberdefense agency, has become a recent subject of political scuffles due to its work combatting mis- and disinformation.

The agency has faced scrutiny from the Trump administration for some time. Top officials have aimed to “refocus” its mission amidst GOP accusations that the agency engaged in censorship of Americans’ free speech. Those claims stem from CISA’s previous collaboration with social media platforms to remove false information online concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, elections and other divisive subjects around 2020.

For some months now, there's been plenty of anticipation that ICE agents and National Guard troops would be deployed in San Francisco. And now the word appears to be - they're coming. This despite protests from Governor Gavin Newsom and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie.

At a Florida press conference, Noem doubled down on the National Guard presence in Chicago and Portland and indicated San Francisco is next, following comments from President Trump on Fox News Sunday.

""We're going to San Francisco and we'll make it great. It'll be great again. San Francisco is a great city. It won't be great if it keeps going like this,"" said Trump. ""We're gonna go to San Francisco. The difference is they want us in San Francisco.""

California Attorney General Rob Bonta responded to the threats, saying we're ready to be in court in hours, if not minutes, if the National Guard is deployed to San Francisco.

""San Francisco is not asking for the National Guard to come here, no matter what he says,"" said Bonta.

Mayor Lurie released a statement Monday weighing in on Trump's threats to send the National Guard to his city, saying that deploying troops wouldn't help with the city's ongoing efforts to combat drug dealing.

""I am deeply grateful to the members of our military for their service to our country, but the National Guard does not have the authority to arrest drug dealers--and sending them to San Francisco will do nothing to get fentanyl off the streets or make our city safer,"" he said.

The mayor didn't refer to Trump by name in the statement. Lurie instead focused on the crime trends in the city, saying the violent crime rate ""has fallen to levels not seen since the 1950s,"" and that tent encampments were at record lows.

""There is no question we have more work to do. I ran for mayor because I see the impact of fentanyl use on our streets--when I drop my son off at school, when I talk to our business and community leaders, when I walk through the city in between meetings,"" Lurie said.

San Francisco law enforcement has already partnered with state and federal officials to shut down open-air drug markets, the mayor said.

According to Lurie, the city would welcome stronger coordination with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to carry out targeted operations, arrest drug dealers, and disrupt drug markets and multinational cartels.

""Under my leadership, we will always protect the people and the values that make San Francisco the greatest city in the world,"" the mayor said. ""That means welcoming people in our city and standing up for every member of our community and for the longstanding policies that have kept our communities safe. As your mayor, that has been and always will be my north star.""

Lurie's statement on Monday comes a day before the San Francisco Board of Supervisors meeting, where District 9 Supervisor Jackie Fielder announced plans to make a motion to ask the mayor about city preparedness in the event that the National Guard was deployed to the city.

Last week, Salesforce founder Marc Benioff apologized for comments he made in which he welcomed the deployment of National Guard troops to San Francisco.

But not before San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins pushed back on Benioff's comments, vowing that if federal law enforcement were to be sent to San Francisco, she would not hesitate to hold them accountable if they broke the law.

AG Rayfield: “The law is clear as to what Marion County should do. There is simply nothing for the court to resolve here.”

Attorney General Dan Rayfield today asked a federal court to dismiss Marion County’s lawsuit regarding Oregon’s sanctuary laws because the law is already clear as to what Marion County must do: Like other public bodies and law enforcement agencies in Oregon, the county cannot release immigration information to federal officials in response to administrative subpoenas unless and until a court issues a judicial order, requiring them to do so. The law is clear on that point and, as a result, there is nothing for the federal district court to clarify in Marion County’s lawsuit.

“Oregon law is straightforward,” said Attorney General Rayfield. “The Ninth Circuit has already ruled that there is no conflict between our sanctuary law and federal law. Public bodies can’t use state resources to help enforce federal immigration law. That’s been the law for nearly four decades, and it is a law that has coexisted peacefully under seven presidential administrations. There’s nothing confusing about that.”

Under Oregon’s sanctuary law framework—first enacted in 1987 and reaffirmed by voters in 2021—state and local officials must decline to produce certain immigration information in response to an administrative subpoena from Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless ICE initiates an enforcement proceeding and obtains a judicial order enforcing that subpoena. That safeguard ensures a neutral judge has had an opportunity to first review and determine whether the subpoena meets legal requirements before state and local officials must comply.

Despite this clear process, when Marion County faced those exact circumstances a few months ago, it filed a lawsuit seeking “clarity,” instead of following well-established processes under state and federal law. The Attorney General’s motion to dismiss that lawsuit argues that no such clarification is necessary, because:

The law is clear on what Marion County must do—it cannot lawfully provide immigration information to ICE without a court order. Because the county will suffer no legal consequences from insisting that a court order issue before it complies with the subpoenas, it lacks standing to litigate the hypothetical “conflicts” between state and federal law identified in its complaint.

In any event, federal courts have already made clear that federal laws do not displace Oregon’s sanctuary laws. In other words, no conflict exists.

Federal courts have repeatedly held that counties, as political subdivisions, cannot sue states in federal court for constitutional challenges to state laws.

“Our system respects state sovereignty, federal authority, and public safety while keeping local resources focused on local priorities. There is simply nothing for the court to resolve here,” said Attorney General Rayfield.

By requiring issuance of a judicial order, Oregon’s sanctuary laws are similar to many other processes in which states and localities protect sensitive information through judicial oversight. Federal courts, including the Ninth Circuit, have repeatedly affirmed that states are not required to assist in federal immigration enforcement.

The motion, filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, asks the court to dismiss Marion County’s complaint in its entirety.",,N,,2025-10-20 22:17:21.593539

Many of Trump’s current 2nd term cabinet and appointees to head government departments, including Russ Vought, Stephen Miller, Tom Homan, Karoline Levitt, Brendan Carr, were also involved in creating Project 2025. Below is a look at how Trumps orders have followed Project 2025 since his election. The Trump/Vance Administration has completed 48% of Project 2025.

""Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene,"" the official said, adding that no federal agents were hurt during the incident.
""They're not indiscriminate,"" he told CBS News.
Charles said ICE is still primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes.
Some in the local community are seeking to help those who could be targeted by immigration agents, including Pastor Mark Knutson, who has put up signs saying ICE agents need permission to enter his church.","In footage shared widely on social media last week, federal immigration agents were seen breaking into Gloria Magaña's home Portland, Oregon, even though the person they were looking for does not live there.

The agents forced their way into the home without showing a warrant, Magaña told CBS News.

The raid occurred on Oct. 15. Magaña, a native of Mexico, said she got a call from her children, who told her the agents were shouting for someone named Israel, but nobody in their home goes by that name. She said she told her children to lock themselves inside a room.

With guns drawn, agents broke open the room's door. Magaña's daughter took a video of the heavily-armed agents telling them to put their hands up as her daughter, a three-month-old baby, cried. One of the agents asked if any of the men inside the room were named Israel.

Outside of the home, witnesses asked the federal officers for information.

""Stop watching TikTok. We don't have to identify ourselves to you,"" one agent was heard saying on video recorded by a witness.

While federal officials have since admitted they were looking for someone else, agents still detained Magaña's 20-year-old son and her partner, saying they were in the U.S. illegally. Magaña said neither has a criminal record. Federal records reviewed by CBS News also indicate the men do not have any criminal charges or convictions.

ICE's online detainee system indicated on Monday that Magaña's son, Napoleon Magaña, was being held at the agency's detention facility in Tacoma, Washington. Her partner, Arturo Garcia Cabrera, was transferred to the Adams County Correctional Center in Mississippi, the system showed.

A senior Homeland Security official told CBS News the federal agents who entered Magaña's home on Oct. 15 were looking for an individual with a criminal history who they say had evaded arrest and fled into the apartment complex. The target of the operation remains at large, the official said.

""Two other aliens from Mexico were found inside the apartment and taken into ICE custody at the scene,"" the official said, adding that no federal agents were hurt during the incident.

As millions took to the streets over the weekend for ""No Kings"" protests, federal agents in Portland deployed tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside and ICE facility, where for months there have been demonstrations denouncing the agency's tactics as heavy-handed and indiscriminate.

In an interview with CBS News in Portland, Marcos Charles, the head of ICE's deportation branch, Enforcement and Removal Operations, denied those charges.

""They're not indiscriminate,"" he told CBS News. ""We do our surveillance. If you're in the country illegally, we're gonna arrest you.""

Charles also downplayed concerns that ICE's tactics have become too aggressive.

""We use the force necessary to affect an arrest,"" he said. ""If people interpret that as being aggressive, so be it.""

Since President Trump took office again and launched a sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration, ICE agents have been given a broad mandate to detain and deport those in the U.S. illegally, with Biden-era limits on arrests of non-criminals reversed.

Charles said ICE is still primarily targeting immigrants in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes. But he said anyone in the U.S. illegally who is found by his agents will be arrested, even if they lack a criminal record and have been in the country for 40 years.

On Monday, an appeals court said the Trump administration could deploy National Guard troops to Portland to protect the ICE facility there while the legal battle over their deployment plays out.

Some in the local community are seeking to help those who could be targeted by immigration agents, including Pastor Mark Knutson, who has put up signs saying ICE agents need permission to enter his church.

""We're not gonna hide people. What we're gonna create is a space to be safe,"" explained Knutson, who is a reverend doctor at the Augustana Lutheran Church. ""And then we work the systems to help them get their amnesty or get the documents.""

""ICE cannot come in here … This could be a standoff if that happens,"" he added.

Knutson said he prays he never has to face that reality.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/10/20/1ba59d48-2ea5-4f61-a3ae-e1e4deaca7f5/thumbnail/1200x630/b39590238acfe866d21e87a0d2b55ce9/ap25293815472167.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 23:16:54.265734

“The experience reminded me that there is an extremely high unmet need for legal representation in immigration cases,” said 3L immigration clinic fellow Korzeb.

It has previously conducted similar ""Know Your Rights"" presentations at other facilities, including the Baker County Detention Center, the Monroe County Jail, and the Glades County Detention Center.","The effort is part of the school’s experiential offerings, training tomorrow’s lawyers with real-world skills in advocacy and litigation.

In response to a shifting immigration landscape, seven students from the University of Miami School of Law's Immigration Clinic held a ""Know Your Rights"" workshop for approximately 70 people detained at the Federal Detention Center in Miami. The student participants included Amy Mantilla, Kadia Mohammed, Sienna Rodriguez, Hannah Liu, Micah Zebersky, Maria Alonso, and Joe Korzeb.

The event marked the first time such a presentation has been offered at the facility. The students advised detainees of their rights, screened them for potential legal remedies, and gave them pro se materials to help them learn about immigration benefits. Following the session, the clinic offered to represent some individuals with upcoming court hearings.

Through the workshop, students acquired firsthand skills in immigration law advocacy—a unique opportunity available in Miami with the FDC, located thirty minutes from the law school, and near two immigration courts and two other immigration detention centers.

Uncovering systemic barriers

During the workshop, students observed the significant legal hurdles that unrepresented individuals face while in FDC custody. These challenges include difficulties gathering evidence, coordinating with witnesses, and filing applications with the Immigration Court.

“The experience reminded me that there is an extremely high unmet need for legal representation in immigration cases,” said 3L immigration clinic fellow Korzeb. “The system is overwhelmed to the point that people with meritorious claims simply are not able to get the representation they need.”

Alonso, another 3L fellow, was surprised by the backgrounds of the detainees. “I was struck by how many of the people I met were actually legal permanent residents—green card holders—who have lived in the U.S. for many years,” Alonso said. “It was heartbreaking to see so many lives turned upside down.”

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons began detaining immigrants at the FDC earlier this year after immigration enforcement increased in Florida.

A history of advocacy

Established in the fall of 2009, the Immigration Clinic allows students to advocate for immigrants in a variety of complex legal proceedings. Students in the clinic represent clients in immigration court and collaborate with immigrant rights organizations on projects aimed at legal reform and social justice. The clinic is an active part of the human rights advocacy community in South Florida and nationwide. It has previously conducted similar ""Know Your Rights"" presentations at other facilities, including the Baker County Detention Center, the Monroe County Jail, and the Glades County Detention Center.

“I’m very impressed with the enthusiasm of the students to hit the ground running so early in the semester,” said associate director and lecturer Andrea Jacoski. “I found their solidarity with directly impacted people to be moving.”

Currently, the county commissioners' contract with ICE allows the agency to hold detainees at the Cumberland County Jail in Portland.
Portland city council member Pious Ali said he believes continuing the contractual agreement between Cumberland County and the U.S.
Ali said Cumberland County shouldn't be allowing ICE to use county facilities while breaking the law.
It doesn't represent who we are as a city and as a county,"" Ali said.","PORTLAND, Maine — Cumberland County commissioners are set to vote on whether to amend its contract with U.S. Marshal Prison Operations to exclude Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

While the meeting was happening, a crowd of more than 100 people gathered speaking against ICE and demanding that commissioners vote to end their agreements with ICE.

Currently, the county commissioners' contract with ICE allows the agency to hold detainees at the Cumberland County Jail in Portland.

Portland city council member Pious Ali said he believes continuing the contractual agreement between Cumberland County and the U.S. Marshal Service does more harm than good.

Ali said ICE is detaining people illegally, often without warrants and with no due process. As a naturalized citizen, Ali said he knows the fear immigrant communities are feeling.

""We've seen ICE pick up, kidnap people from all around the country, and they're doing the same here,"" her said. ""I had coffee with a parent who about four of their friends have been taken. And the sad part of it is, there's absolutely nothing I can do.""

Ali said Cumberland County shouldn't be allowing ICE to use county facilities while breaking the law.

""Allowing our county facility to be used for that, I think, is unacceptable. It doesn't represent our values. It doesn't represent who we are as a city and as a county,"" Ali said.

Leaders from the Department of Homeland Security have consistently said that their tactics are making Americans safer and strengthening the border, citing a decrease in the number of immigrants trying to cross the southern border from Mexico into Texas as a win.

In a letter to Cumberland County commissioners, Congresswoman Chellie Pingree said, ""As elected officials, we have an obligation to ensure that any partnership between local and federal entities meets the highest standards of accountability and respect for due process.""

She added that both ICE and Customs and Border Patrol agents are causing ""undue terror"" with no regard for the rule of law.

Pingree noted that Cumberland County excluding ICE from its agreement with U.S. Marshals Service could lead to immigrants from Maine being sent to larger out of state facilities far away, increasing separation.

Despite those concerns, she said limiting detention space at local facilities may push DHS to return to alternatives to detention programs like letting people pursue legal pathways to citizenship.

Robert Garcia, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and Senator Richard Blumenthal, Ranking Member of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee Committee on Investigations, wrote to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanding information and records from the agency following widespread reports of wrongful detentions of U.S. citizens by agents at the Department of Homeland Security. Reports document citizens being held for extended periods, being denied access to counsel, and other civil rights violations.

Rep. Robert Garcia then joined Mayor Karen Bass and local immigration rights leaders at an event in Los Angeles to demand justice and accountability from the Trump Administration following reports of the unlawful detention of U.S. citizens and immigrants by federal agents. Last week, ProPublica documented(link is external) that 170 American citizens have been arrested by the Department of Homeland Security.

“American citizens are being dragged off the streets by masked men and thrown into detention cells without access to a lawyer or even a phone call,” said Ranking Member Robert Garcia. “No one, regardless of their background or appearance, should be living in fear of being thrown behind bars by their own government because of their race or what they look like. This is not the America we know and love. Every person in this country has rights, and DHS must stop trampling on our civil liberties. Their actions are unconstitutional, unacceptable, and completely un-American, and we will not stop fighting until this Administration is held accountable.”

In the letter to Secretary Kristi Noem, Ranking Member Robert Garcia and Senator Blumenthal wrote, “The impact of these arrests has not been evenly distributed across the country, and cities like Chicago, Portland, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles have been targeted heavily by ICE and CBP. Troublingly, the pattern of U.S. Citizen arrests coincides with an alarming increase in racial profiling—particularly of Latinos—which has been well documented in Los Angeles. Justice Kavanaugh justified this policy on the false grounds that ‘[i]f the officers learn the individual they stopped is a U. S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States, they promptly let the individual go.’ In a pattern symptomatic of a disregard for civil rights by DHS, U.S. citizens have faced extended periods of detention.”

Almost three in four transgender immigrants reported living near or under the federal poverty line; additionally 40% indicated that they were homeless.
She called these statistics on poverty for transgender immigrants “striking.” The survey also found that 41% of transgender Latina immigrants reported having less than a high school or GED level of education and 54% were unemployed.
For more than 15 years, her nonprofit has been offering services to transgender Latino immigrants in LA County.
“Trans immigrants are particularly vulnerable because they’re directly delegitimized by the federal government in many ways, and also the ability to obtain legitimizing documents is restricted,” she said.","As everyone in Los Angeles knows, housing is expensive. In one of the most pricey places to live in the world, almost one in 10 residents has experienced homelessness. The scarcity of affordable housing is even more challenging for marginalized communities.

Immigrants are more likely to face eviction and live in overcrowded conditions, and LGBTQ people have higher rates of poverty and homelessness than the general population.

A new study published this month by the UCLA Williams Institute and TransLatin@ Coalition put numbers to the intersection of these communities in Los Angeles County. In surveying 98 immigrants who identified as transgender or nonbinary in 2023 and 2024, the study’s authors found major poverty and homelessness challenges among transgender and nonbinary immigrants. Almost three in four transgender immigrants reported living near or under the federal poverty line; additionally 40% indicated that they were homeless.

“There’s just such a direct relationship between economic stress and homelessness,” said Elana Redfield, the primary researcher and director of the Williams Institute. She called these statistics on poverty for transgender immigrants “striking.”

The survey also found that 41% of transgender Latina immigrants reported having less than a high school or GED level of education and 54% were unemployed. In comparison only 8% of transgender people overall reported not graduating high school and 22% overall were unemployed. Redfield said immigration status and discrimination were the main barriers to education and employment opportunities.

Barriers to education and employment

“It’s important to recognize the different intersections that contribute to the quality of life of people,” said Bamby Salcedo, one of the study’s authors and the founder of TransLatin@ Coalition. For more than 15 years, her nonprofit has been offering services to transgender Latino immigrants in LA County. “Even though we are in a diverse county, there’s still a lot of discrimination and a lot of violence that we experience.”

It’s not just economic stress. The study noted that 40% of all immigrants stated that safety and fear of violence was a major concern.

Earlier this spring, a 61-year-old transgender business owner in the MacArthur Park neighborhood was repeatedly brutalized at her shop in a series of attacks by three men. Sabrina De la Pena told the Los Angeles Times in Spanish and English that the attacks were based on her trans identity. The Human Rights Campaign has called the national rise in fatal hate crimes against trangender women of color an “epidemic violence.”

Since the survey was conducted two years ago, Redfield said, “a lot has changed and likely gotten worse,” under the current federal administration’s hardline policies on immigration and executive orders erasing the existence of transgender people.

“Trans immigrants are particularly vulnerable because they’re directly delegitimized by the federal government in many ways, and also the ability to obtain legitimizing documents is restricted,” she said.

On a community-level, Salcedo is seeing this stress in the number of trans people reaching out for help. Every kind of service from free food and clothes to violence prevention has been inundated at their office.

“Since June, when all the craziness happened with the federal administration, our calls have increased 100%. We’re getting double the calls,” Salcedo said.

Many of the women who seek services from TransLatin@ are fleeing violence in their home countries, Salcedo said. A 2012 study from the TransLatin@ Coalition found that 99% of transgender women from Latin America were seeking better opportunities in the United States.

“A lot of people want support with legal services for their immigration cases,” Salcedo said. “About ten of our clients have been impacted by the [immigration] raids that we know of.”

Redfield said that the study is an essential part of addressing the needs of transgender immigrants across LA. The survey was conducted with funding from LA County Supervisors Hilda Solis, Holly Mitchell, Lindsey Horvath and Janice Hahn.

“The supervisors have definitely been a national model, over the past few years, in trying to shift resources to community leaders to figure out how to solve these problems,” Redfield said.

Last year, the Board of Supervisors announced a two-year, $7 million investment in the Trans, Gender-Expansive, and Intersex Wellness and Equity Initiative to address systemic inequities in trans communities.

“Research helps us understand what’s going to be most effective,” Redfield said.","https://cdn.lapublicpress.org/cdn-cgi/image/quality=80,format=auto,onerror=redirect,metadata=none/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Photo_by_Paolo_Riveros_BAMBY_SALCEDO_032-1.jpg",N,,2025-10-20 20:01:20.078333

Trump has claimed the right to deploy national guard troops to Portland for the purported purpose of protecting federal property and agents.
Trump tried to circumvent Immergut’s order by deploying federalized California national guard troops to Oregon.
Immergut, a Trump appointee, imposed a second order prohibiting the deployment of any national guard troops to Portland.
“No legal or factual justification supported the order to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard,” Graber wrote.","Oregon governor Tina Kotek, has called on a federal appeals court to review and overturn a decision made by a three-judge panel on Monday that would permit Donald Trump to deploy federalized national guard troops to the streets of Portland against the wishes of state and local officials.

Kotek said that she hopes the full ninth circuit court of appeals vacates the panel’s 2-1 decision, as the dissenting judge, Portland-based Susan Graber, urged her colleagues to do.

“I’m very troubled by the decision of the court,” Kotek told reporters. “I still urge the Trump administration to send all the national guard members home.”

The ninth circuit panel earlier on Monday decided to lift a lower court’s recent ruling that had prevented Trump from sending troops into the Democratic stronghold. Trump has claimed the right to deploy national guard troops to Portland for the purported purpose of protecting federal property and agents.

Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, also called on the full appeals court to follow judge Garber’s dissent and reverse the decision made by the pane.

“Oregon joins Judge Graber in urging the full ninth circuit to ‘act swiftly’ en banc ‘to vacate the majority’s order before the illegal deployment of troops under false pretenses can occur’,” Rayfield said. “And, like her, we ‘ask those who are watching this case unfold to retain faith in our judicial system for just a little while longer’.”

This ruling allows Trump to maintain control over the state’s national guard until litigation proceeds completely through court. The decision does not mean that troops will arrive to Portland right away, the Oregonian reported.

Graber, the dissenting judge, described the ruling to allow the deployment as having “no legal or factual justification”. An appointee of Bill Clinton, Graber said efforts to describe the city as a “war zone” were absurd, noting protesters wearing inflatable frog costumes.

The secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, issued a memorandum on 28 September stating that 200 members of Oregon’s national guard would be “called into Federal service effective immediately for a period of 60 days”. The memo came after Trump’s demand for a military deployment to Portland.

Kotek, said previously at a news conference that she had been notified by the Pentagon that the US president had seized control of the state’s reservists, claiming authority granted to him to suppress “rebellion” or lawlessness.

City and state officials filed suit shortly thereafter to block the deployment.

“When the president and I spoke yesterday,” Kotek said at the time, “I told him in very plain language that there is no insurrection, or threat to public safety that necessitates military intervention in Portland.”

Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, said that Trump’s deployment was unlawful. Portland had neither seen a foreign invasion nor sprawling anarchy – rather, there was one minor protest outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Portland.

“Let’s be clear, local law enforcement has this under control,” Kotek also said. “We have free speech demonstrations that are happening near one federal facility. Portland police is actively engaged in managing those with the federal folks at the facility, and when people cross the line, there’s unlawful activity, people are being held accountable.”

The judge presiding over this lawsuit, Karin Immergut, blocked Trump’s effort to deploy Oregon national guard troops and said his contentions about Portland’s atmosphere were “simply untethered to the facts”. Trump tried to circumvent Immergut’s order by deploying federalized California national guard troops to Oregon.

Immergut, a Trump appointee, imposed a second order prohibiting the deployment of any national guard troops to Portland.

The decision lifting Immergut’s order said that at this stage of litigation, “we conclude that it is likely that the President lawfully exercised his statutory authority … which authorizes the federalization of the National Guard when ‘the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.’”

The judges who decided against Immergut’s decision, Ryan Nelson and Bridget Bade, are Trump appointees.

In her dissent, Graber takes issue with Trump’s portrayal of Portland as a hotbed of civil conflict where roving residents impeded Ice’s operations. “No legal or factual justification supported the order to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard,” Graber wrote.

“Given Portland protesters’ well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority’s ruling, which accepts the government’s characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,” she also said. “But today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions.”

Oregon’s attorney general, Dan Rayfield, slammed the panel’s ruling and said that if it stands, Trump would have “unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets with almost no justification”.

“We are on a dangerous path in America,” Rayfield said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aacd850ab7b8b9c5b1b9ab864f5e4e20926a6872/1374_0_6882_5504/master/6882.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b364bc643542631fb0c451d7f6efeb1",N,,2025-10-20 19:21:00.640298

McLain,,,,,https://natlawreview.com/article/irs-now-permitted-share-tax-identification-data-ice-considerations-employers,"On April 7, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) enabling ICE to request and receive taxpayer identity information from the IRS for immigration related enforcement without needing to obtain a court order.

Nevertheless, the current Administration remains focused on immigration enforcement and is seeking to use all the tools in its toolkit to advance its goals.
However, in practice, ICE is likely to continue large-scale raids on employers as they remain a more resource-efficient method for ICE enforcement.","On April 7, 2025, the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) enabling ICE to request and receive taxpayer identity information from the IRS for immigration related enforcement without needing to obtain a court order. Since then, the MOU has been subject to multiple legal challenges, one of which is on appeal before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and oral argument occurred in early October 2025. Employers should be aware of the potential implications of this information-sharing arrangement. Without this MOU, ICE would have to rely on other channels to gather address information, such as the National Crime Information Center, DMV databases, or information sharing agreements with police departments.

For employers, this MOU signals a more directed approach to leveraging employees’ data in order to achieve more aggressive immigration enforcement, which may include criminal enforcement directed at employers.

The MOU establishes a framework for ICE to access a taxpayer’s last known address when investigating violations of designated criminal statutes. Notably, the MOU highlights persons under investigation for violations of 8 U.S.C. § 1253(a)(1), which criminalizes willfully remaining in the United States more than 90 days after a removal order becomes final. This MOU represents a shift from prior IRS practice and tests the boundaries of the Internal Revenue Code, which generally protects taxpayer data from easy access by other agencies.

How the MOU Changes Enforcement

Section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code contains broad confidentiality rules surrounding the disclosure of specific taxpayer and tax return information. However, the MOU relies on an exception that permits disclosure of certain taxpayer information to a requesting agency that is either preparing for a criminal proceeding or when an investigation may result in a proceeding.

This exception creates a formal channel for ICE to cross-check immigration enforcement targets against IRS records, allowing ICE to quickly identify a taxpayer’s home address for immigration enforcement efforts. The process for ICE obtaining these tax records from the IRS requires ICE to submit a written request to the IRS identifying the following information:

The targeted individual;

The relevant taxable periods;

The specific criminal statute under investigation by ICE (i.e. 8 U.S.C. § 1253(a)(1));

The date of the final order of removal and related case number;

A statement showing why the identification and address information is relevant to ICE’s pending criminal investigation; and

An attestation that the address information will only be used by officers/employees of ICE solely for reasons articulated in 8 U.S.C. § 6103(i)(2)(A) pertaining to the enforcement of 8 U.S.C. § 1253(a)(1).

The IRS then will review the requests for “completeness and validity” and transmit the requested information to ICE, if identifiable.

Importantly for employers, the MOU only permits release to ICE of identity information – not full tax returns, financial details, or employer information. Additionally, ICE can only use the information for the preparation for judicial and administrative proceedings, in the designated investigation that may lead to such proceedings, or in any subsequent criminal proceedings. ICE must also comply with IRS Publication 1075, which provides standards for safeguarding sensitive taxpayer information.

Legal Challenges and Criticism

Since its execution in April 2025, the MOU has faced multiple challenges in federal court and drawn sharp criticisms from both privacy advocates and members of Congress. As an example, in Centro de Trabajadores Unidos v. Bessent (No. 1:25-cv-00677, D.D.C.), advocacy groups sought a preliminary injunction to block implementation of the MOU. They argued that the MOU would in practice be used for civil deportations despite the stated focus on criminal investigations. The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, concluding that the MOU’s language limits disclosures to criminal matters and aligns with the plain text of § 6103(i)(2). On appeal to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, 93 members of Congress argued in an amicus brief that the MOU could erode taxpayer trust, deter voluntary compliance, and blur the lines between tax administration and immigration control. The amicus brief emphasizes that § 6103 was designed to shield taxpayer information from political or unrelated enforcement use – a safeguard the members of Congress state it established to protect against the very kind of cross-agency integration the MOU now formalizes. The DC Circuit held oral argument in the case on October 3, 2025 (No. 25-5181, D.C. Cir.), and a decision is still pending.

Potential Risks for Employers

While the MOU is focused on criminal immigration investigations, it remains to be seen how broadly ICE will interpret its authority to obtain tax information and to what extent this new discovery mechanism for immigration enforcement may impact employers. Nevertheless, the current Administration remains focused on immigration enforcement and is seeking to use all the tools in its toolkit to advance its goals. In this context, employers face heightened risks for criminal enforcement against their companies, in addition to workplace sweeps, audits, inspections and other administrative requests.

As we previously described, the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act allocates $170 billion to immigration enforcement, which includes over $75 billion allocated for ICE. This signals a significant expansion of ICE’s capacity extending beyond the scope of the MOU to include immigration audits, site visits, and notices of inspection.

The MOU theoretically allows for a more targeted enforcement approach by giving ICE access to specific home address information that does not extend to employer information. With this data, ICE could shift its focus from broad workplace raids to more precise neighborhood-level operations. This approach may offer employers some relief from large-scale disruptions. However, in practice, ICE is likely to continue large-scale raids on employers as they remain a more resource-efficient method for ICE enforcement.

As a result, employers will likely continue to deal with workforce reduction given ICE’s increased capacity and the opening of alternative avenues of enforcement like the MOU. Employers across all sectors should proactively review hiring, payroll, and compliance protocols, develop an internal enforcement response plan, and monitor the outcomes of pending legal challenges regarding the MOU.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-10/ice%20immigration%20customs%20enforcement%20dept%20homeland%20security%20website%20smaller.jpg.webp?itok=N4RLWhGx,N,,2025-10-20 19:21:13.187066

The Trump administration has steered tens of billions of dollars toward DHS immigration and border security agencies as part of a renewed push to expand detention capacity, accelerate deportations and fortify barriers along the U.S. southern border.
“Firing or reassigning CISA’s cybersecurity experts in the middle of a shutdown isn’t just wrong — it’s illegal and dangerous,” Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW in a statement.","A group of House Democrats is asking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to explain why the Department of Homeland Security reassigned many of its cybersecurity staff to roles focused on Trump-era immigration and deportation work, as well as how those shifts impact U.S. cyberdefenses.

The Monday letter — led by Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., and also signed by Reps. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., Eugene Vindman, D-Va., and Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, along with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C. — argues that DHS violated the Antideficiency Act when it reassigned those Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency staff to roles within Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Protective Service and Customs and Border Protection.

The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from spending or obligating funding without congressional approval during a government shutdown. Amid the ongoing lapse in federal funding, the moves “raise serious concerns” about the Trump administration’s motives, the lawmakers say in the missive, which was first viewed by Nextgov/FCW.

“It is difficult to understand how defending the nation’s cyber and physical infrastructure could be viewed as inconsistent with the president’s stated goal of protecting the homeland,” the letter says.

It also argues recent termination notices issued to staff in CISA’s Stakeholder Engagement and Infrastructure Divisions are “the very teams responsible for coordinating with public and private partners to identify, mitigate and prevent cyberattacks.”

The lawmakers urge Noem “to immediately reclassify DHS personnel transferred away from CISA back into cyber defense roles.”

The reassignments have been occurring over the course of several weeks now. Many, but not all, of the reassignments direct staff to ICE, CBP and FPS, two people familiar with the matter previously said.

The Trump administration has steered tens of billions of dollars toward DHS immigration and border security agencies as part of a renewed push to expand detention capacity, accelerate deportations and fortify barriers along the U.S. southern border. Several of those detainments have ensnared U.S. citizens and have raised major legal and ethical questions about ICE’s handling of immigration enforcement.

The Monday letter asks Noem about whether impact assessments were conducted before firings and reassignments, how the cuts square with CISA’s mandate to reduce cyber-infrastructure risks and what concrete mitigations exist to sustain cyberdefenses.

“Firing or reassigning CISA’s cybersecurity experts in the middle of a shutdown isn’t just wrong — it’s illegal and dangerous,” Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW in a statement. “These personnel protect our power grids, hospital networks and water systems from cyber attacks. Diverting them to serve a political agenda puts American lives at risk and violates the very laws meant to protect the public.”

At any given time, foreign adversaries and criminal hackers could be targeting U.S. networks, including federal agencies that oftentimes possess high value data like national security plans, financial data and internal government communications.

CISA directed agencies just last week to patch various services offered by application delivery provider F5 after hackers penetrated the company’s systems. The intrusion has been linked to Chinese state-aligned hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

In an interview last month, prior to the ongoing lapse in federal funding, Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW that the Antideficiency Act “is very clear that, in a shutdown, the federal government can only do essentially two categories of things: functions that are necessary to preserve life and property, or functions required by the Constitution, fulfilling a constitutional duty.”

Cybersecurity has been historically a bipartisan matter in Washington, but CISA, the nation’s core civilian cyberdefense agency, has become a recent subject of political scuffles due to its work combatting mis- and disinformation.

The agency has faced scrutiny from the Trump administration for some time. Top officials have aimed to “refocus” its mission amidst GOP accusations that the agency engaged in censorship of Americans’ free speech. Those claims stem from CISA’s previous collaboration with social media platforms to remove false information online concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, elections and other divisive subjects around 2020.

A US federal appeals court on Monday cleared the way for President Donald Trump to send National Guard troops to the Pacific Northwest state of Oregon, according to media reports.

The three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals 9th Circuit voted 2-1 to lift a lower court order that had blocked the president from sending troops on a mission, according to Trump, to protect federal immigration buildings and workers in Portland.

The ruling allows the mobilization and deployment of 200 members of the Oregon National Guard to Portland while the legal challenge of the deployment moves forward in court. In addition, the deployment of 300 guardsmen from California will also be allowed.

The decision to allow the deployment was handed down despite objections by city and state leaders, who argued that Trump is violating the US Constitution's Tenth Amendment, which limits federal oversight of local policing enforcement in each individual state.

Trump has ordered multiple National Guard deployments in Democratic-led cities across the country, including Los Angeles, Chicago, Illinois, and Washington, DC, citing crime or violence, which his critics call a pretext to establish his authority to deploy troops whenever he wants, especially ahead of next year’s pivotal midterm congressional elections.

Leaders in those cities and states have also filed lawsuits to block the deployment of guardsmen, citing an 1878 federal law called the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of US military forces for domestic law enforcement purposes.

Portland-based US District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term as president, ruled on Oct. 4 that Trump likely acted unlawfully when he ordered troops to Portland.

Immergut had blocked Trump from sending any National Guard troops to Portland at least until the end of October and has scheduled a trial for Oct. 29 to determine whether to impose a longer-term block.

The lawsuit accused Trump of exaggerating the severity of protests against Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities in Portland in order to justify illegally seizing control of state National Guard units.

On Sept. 27, Trump referred to Portland as a ""war-ravaged"" city and said: ""I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""

Police records provided by the state showed that protests in Portland were ""small and sedate,"" resulting in only 25 arrests in mid-June and no arrests since June 19.

Immergut is one of three district court judges who have ruled against Trump's use of the National Guard, and no district court judge has yet ruled for Trump in the National Guard cases.

The appeals courts, however, have been split over the issue so far, with the 9th Circuit previously backing Trump's use of troops in California and the 7th Circuit ruling that troops should stay out of Illinois until all the legal proceedings have played out.

Legal experts have said that the state of Oregon and the city of Portland could ask for an 11-judge panel of the 9th Circuit to review Monday's decision or appeal directly to the US Supreme Court.",https://cdnuploads.aa.com.tr/uploads/Contents/2025/10/21/thumbs_b_c_2306f54ebd77f6f5393ca76ee570044f.jpg?v=000745,N,,2025-10-20 18:17:24.406843

Robert Garcia, D-Long Beach, Monday called for a congressional investigation into what they described as the ""unlawful and unconstitutional'' detainment and alleged abuse of U.S. citizens and immigrants by federal agents without a judicial warrant or probable cause.

Bass once again criticized the federal government for its aggressive and widespread immigration tactics. Democratic leaders representing the greater Los Angeles Area have denounced federal immigration enforcement since operations began in June.

""I will always stand up to protect Los Angeles. Reports of Angelenos -- U.S. citizens -- being Tased, dragged and unlawfully detained should make us all concerned,'' Bass said. ``I'm calling for an immediate congressional

investigation into these egregious injustices, and I thank Congressman Garcia for his support. This is not just an assault on people of Los Angeles -- this is an assault on every person, in every city in this country.''

Garcia, a ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said American citizens are being dragged off the streets by masked men and thrown into detention cells without access to attorneys.

""No one, regardless of their background or appearance, should be living in fear of being thrown behind bars by their own government because of their race or what they look like,'' Garcia said.

""This is not the America we know and love. Every person in this country has rights, and DHS (Department of Homeland Security) must stop trampling on our civil liberties. Their actions are unconstitutional, unacceptable, and completely un-American, and we will not stop fighting until this administration is held accountable,'' Garcia added.

City Council members Eunisses Hernandez, Ysabel Jurado and Hugo Soto- Martinez joined Bass and Garcia for the news conference alongside a group of city workers and immigrant rights advocates.

""Angelenos are being beaten, terrorized and detained without due process,'' Hernandez said. ``We must fight to keep democracy alive and hold federal immigration enforcement accountable for every abuse.''

The Trump administration has steered tens of billions of dollars toward DHS immigration and border security agencies as part of a renewed push to expand detention capacity, accelerate deportations and fortify barriers along the U.S. southern border.
“Firing or reassigning CISA’s cybersecurity experts in the middle of a shutdown isn’t just wrong — it’s illegal and dangerous,” Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW in a statement.","A group of House Democrats is asking Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to explain why the Department of Homeland Security reassigned many of its cybersecurity staff to roles focused on Trump-era immigration and deportation work, as well as how those shifts impact U.S. cyberdefenses.

The Monday letter — led by Rep. James Walkinshaw, D-Va., and also signed by Reps. Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va., Eugene Vindman, D-Va., and Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, along with Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C. — argues that DHS violated the Antideficiency Act when it reassigned those Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency staff to roles within Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Protective Service and Customs and Border Protection.

The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from spending or obligating funding without congressional approval during a government shutdown. Amid the ongoing lapse in federal funding, the moves “raise serious concerns” about the Trump administration’s motives, the lawmakers say in the missive, which was first viewed by Nextgov/FCW.

“It is difficult to understand how defending the nation’s cyber and physical infrastructure could be viewed as inconsistent with the president’s stated goal of protecting the homeland,” the letter says.

It also argues recent termination notices issued to staff in CISA’s Stakeholder Engagement and Infrastructure Divisions are “the very teams responsible for coordinating with public and private partners to identify, mitigate and prevent cyberattacks.”

The lawmakers urge Noem “to immediately reclassify DHS personnel transferred away from CISA back into cyber defense roles.”

The reassignments have been occurring over the course of several weeks now. Many, but not all, of the reassignments direct staff to ICE, CBP and FPS, two people familiar with the matter previously said.

The Trump administration has steered tens of billions of dollars toward DHS immigration and border security agencies as part of a renewed push to expand detention capacity, accelerate deportations and fortify barriers along the U.S. southern border. Several of those detainments have ensnared U.S. citizens and have raised major legal and ethical questions about ICE’s handling of immigration enforcement.

The Monday letter asks Noem about whether impact assessments were conducted before firings and reassignments, how the cuts square with CISA’s mandate to reduce cyber-infrastructure risks and what concrete mitigations exist to sustain cyberdefenses.

“Firing or reassigning CISA’s cybersecurity experts in the middle of a shutdown isn’t just wrong — it’s illegal and dangerous,” Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW in a statement. “These personnel protect our power grids, hospital networks and water systems from cyber attacks. Diverting them to serve a political agenda puts American lives at risk and violates the very laws meant to protect the public.”

At any given time, foreign adversaries and criminal hackers could be targeting U.S. networks, including federal agencies that oftentimes possess high value data like national security plans, financial data and internal government communications.

CISA directed agencies just last week to patch various services offered by application delivery provider F5 after hackers penetrated the company’s systems. The intrusion has been linked to Chinese state-aligned hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

In an interview last month, prior to the ongoing lapse in federal funding, Walkinshaw told Nextgov/FCW that the Antideficiency Act “is very clear that, in a shutdown, the federal government can only do essentially two categories of things: functions that are necessary to preserve life and property, or functions required by the Constitution, fulfilling a constitutional duty.”

Cybersecurity has been historically a bipartisan matter in Washington, but CISA, the nation’s core civilian cyberdefense agency, has become a recent subject of political scuffles due to its work combatting mis- and disinformation.

The agency has faced scrutiny from the Trump administration for some time. Top officials have aimed to “refocus” its mission amidst GOP accusations that the agency engaged in censorship of Americans’ free speech. Those claims stem from CISA’s previous collaboration with social media platforms to remove false information online concerning the COVID-19 pandemic, elections and other divisive subjects around 2020.

Johnson's memo was sent to the council members who chair those committees.
But other members of the Dallas City Council say immigration enforcement should be left to the federal government, not the local police.
""We remain concerned with the practices being deployed by ICE agents through federal directives,"" the council members said in a joint statement.

The 287(g) program allows ICE to collaborate with state and local law enforcement in the arrest and deportation of immigrants.

Police Chief Daniel Comeaux told the Community Police Oversight Board last week that he turned down $25 million to let the department join the program.

Now Johnson says that money could ""provide significant financial benefits to the city"" and has requested a joint meeting between the city's Public Safety and Government Efficiency committees to discuss joining the program.

""As the elected body charged with setting City policy and overseeing its budget, the City Council should be briefed on all the relevant information that went into Chief Comeaux’s decision in a public meeting and with an opportunity for input from residents,"" Johnson said in a memo.

Johnson's memo was sent to the council members who chair those committees. Public Safety Chair Cara Mendelsohn did not respond to request for comment. Government Efficiency Chair Maxie Johnson said in an email that he would save his comments for the meeting.

But other members of the Dallas City Council say immigration enforcement should be left to the federal government, not the local police.

Council members Chad West, Adam Bazaldua, Jaime Resendez, and Paula Blackmon said in a joint statement that joining the program would ""undermine progress"" made in building trust between the police department and residents.

""We remain concerned with the practices being deployed by ICE agents through federal directives,"" the council members said in a joint statement. ""The 287(g) program would turn local law enforcement into an arm of federal immigration enforcement and could result in a betrayal of trust between the Dallas Police Department and the very communities they are sworn to protect.""

Mayor Pro Tem Jesse Moreno and Council Member Laura Cadena said in a separate joint statement that immigration enforcement is the responsibility of the federal government.

""Local law enforcement agencies, including ours, are committed to maintaining trust with the communities we serve — trust that is essential to effective policing and public safety for all residents,"" Moreno and Cadena said in the statement.

Both Moreno and Cadena encouraged residents to contact elected officials to share concerns, experiences, and perspectives to ensure community input remained at the center of the discussion.

Building trust

Comeaux told the Police Oversight Board that transparency and community engagement are among his priorities.

Board member Jenny King, who represents District 10, said last week that some residents are fearful and distrustful of the police.

Community engagement initiatives to educate business owners and residents on ways to stay safe and prevent crime are part of the work Comeaux wants Dallas police to do. That includes keeping neighborhood police officers, or NPOs, who engage with community members to handle causes of crime in their neighborhood.

But Police Oversight Board members say residents remain fearful because of social media posts showing local police departments working with ICE in other cities.

The shooting at a Dallas ICE facility last month — which left two detained people dead and one injured — sent additional fear through the local migrant community and raised concerns by advocates at a time when they are already fearful of being targeted due to anti-immigrant rhetoric.

Dallas police are required to cooperate with federal agencies, Comeaux said, but so far, they have not been asked to assist.

""We don't need that attention, we don't want to deal with that smoke,"" Comeaux said during the board meeting. ""So I don't understand why we're doing this when nothing has happened.""

Budget concerns

Police pay was one concern during this year's budget season, with Mendelsohn saying the pay was not competitive.

Several Dallas residents were also concerned the now-approved salary rate did not comply with Proposition U.

Prop U, which was voter-approved last year, requires the city to spend no less than 50% of new, annual revenue to fund the police and fire pension. It also mandates that the city increase the number of sworn police officers to a minimum of 4,000, which the department has not yet met.

The ICE 287(g) program fully reimburses participating agencies for the annual salary and benefits of each eligible officer in the program. This includes overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer's annual salary.

Mayor Johnson said DPD could use the funds toward hiring more officers with no impact on the budget.

""Dallas might be forfeiting significant direct financial benefits by declining ICE’s offer,"" Johnson said.

Immergut is one of three district court judges who have ruled against Trump's use of the National Guard, and no district court judge has yet ruled for Trump in the National Guard cases.","A divided U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday that Donald Trump can send National Guard troops into Portland, Ore., despite objections by the leaders of the city and state, giving the Republican president an important legal victory as he dispatches military forces to a growing number of Democratic-led locales.

A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Justice Department's request to put on hold a judge's order that had blocked the deployment while a legal challenge to Trump's action plays out. Portland-based U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, who Trump appointed during his first term as president, ruled on Oct. 4 that Trump likely acted unlawfully when he ordered troops to Portland.

One judge dissented while the other two ruled in Trump's favour.

Immergut had blocked Trump from sending any National Guard troops to Portland at least until the end of October, and she has scheduled a non-jury trial set to begin on Oct. 29 to determine whether to impose a longer-term block.

Democratic-led states seek to halt deployments

In an extraordinary use of the U.S. armed forces for domestic purposes, Trump has sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Memphis, and announced plans for deployments to Portland and Chicago.

Democratic-led states and cities have filed lawsuits seeking to halt the deployments, and courts have not yet reached a final decision on the legality of Trump's decisions to send the National Guard to U.S. cities.

City and state officials sued the administration in a bid to stop the Portland deployment, arguing that Trump's action violates several federal laws that govern the use of military forces as well as the state's rights under the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment.

The lawsuit accused Trump of exaggerating the severity of protests against his immigration policies to justify illegally seizing control of state National Guard units.

Trump on Sept. 27 ordered 200 National Guard troops to Portland, continuing his administration's unprecedented use of military personnel in U.S. cities to suppress protests and bolster domestic immigration enforcement. Trump called the city ""War ravaged"" and said, ""I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""

Police records provided by the state showed that protests in Portland were ""small and sedate,"" resulting in only 25 arrests in mid-June and no arrests in the three-and-a-half months since June 19.

A federal law called the Posse Comitatus Act generally restricts the use of the U.S. military for domestic law enforcement purposes. In ordering troops to California, Oregon and Illinois, Trump has relied on a law — Section 12406 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code — that allows a president to deploy state National Guard to repel an invasion, suppress a rebellion or allow the president to execute the law.

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces that answer to state governors except when called into federal service by the president.

The 9th Circuit panel that ruled in the Portland case consisted of two judges appointed by Trump in his first term as president and one appointed by Democratic former President Bill Clinton.

During arguments in the case on Oct. 9, the two Trump-appointed judges suggested that Immergut had focused too closely on protests in the city in September without fully considering more serious protests two months before the troop deployment. Circuit Judge Ryan Nelson said that courts should not engage in a ""day by day"" review of whether troops were needed at any given time.

Immergut issued decisions against the administration on Oct. 4 and Oct. 5, first ruling that Trump could not take over Oregon's National Guard and then ruling that he could not circumvent that decision by calling in National Guard troops from other states.

The judge said there was no evidence that recent protests in Portland rose to the level of a rebellion or seriously interfered with law enforcement, and she said Trump's description of the city as war-ravaged was ""simply untethered to the facts.""

More particularly, he uses them to enforce his immigration policies when other police departments are not willing to bend to his will. His ICE agents even attacked Chicago police officers with tear gas for trying to protect peaceful protesters. Indeed, this is how Trump stops crime — by attacking police officers. The Capitol police can surely attest to Trump’s crime fighting tactics after suffering from a Trump-aroused MAGA mob.

I had long predicted that Trump would first turn on immigrants before proceeding to attack all minorities. That moment has come, as 170 U.S. citizens have been arrested and detained by ICE. These U.S. citizens have been beaten, dragged, kicked, tased and incarcerated. ICE has dragged U.S. citizens out of their beds and held them outside in the rain. Three pregnant women have been manhandled by ICE, one of who had the door of her home blown off while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched.

The fact that these individuals were U.S. citizens did not protect them from being treated like immigrants, who are treated as less than human by ICE. Reportedly, 20 citizens have been detained for more than 24 hours without being allowed to call their family or a lawyer. In addition, 130 citizens, including elected officials, have been arrested by ICE for protesting against the agency or trying to inspect an ICE facility. Every congressperson has a right, as part of Congress’ oversight duties, to inspect federally owned or run facilities. ICE does not let this happen, so congresspersons have been arrested for trying to enter a federal-funded ICE facility in New Jersey.

Trump’s Supreme Court has exacerbated this problem by allowing ICE to use racial profiling in sweeps. Justice Brett Kavanaugh stated that U.S. citizens should not be concerned — you’ve got to love how a white man thinks. Of course he has no concern, because he is white. But God help you if you look or are Hispanic. How many U.S. citizens walk around with their passport? Most do not. So if you get caught up in an ICE sweep, then you should anticipate on being incarcerated.

In the era of Trump, I walk around with my passport card to provide evidence that I am a citizen. I will use this if an ICE officer gives me time to speak or cares whether I am a U.S. citizen.

The advertisements for ICE officers are attracting people who want to beat up immigrants. A lot of these ICE officers would not make it through a police background check, because they are not psychologically fit to be officers.

Ladies and gentlemen, Trump continues to follow the Adolf Hitler playbook, and now he has his ICE Police Department to serve as his Gestapo.

Organizers with the Lake-Geauga Fights Back Network are planning a protest for Monday evening outside of the Lake County Sheriff’s Office. The demonstration is in response to recent agreements signed with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for a limited partnership.

In mid-September, Sheriff Frank Leonbruno announced his office had signed two agreements to assist ICE with immigration enforcement.

Lake County Sheriff's Office to partner with ICE on immigration enforcement

RELATED: Lake County Sheriff's Office to partner with ICE on immigration enforcement

A section added to federal immigration law in 1996, known as 287(g), allows ICE to partner with local law enforcement agencies. The sheriff said his office received the signed agreements last week, and deputies will need to complete special training before they can officially participate in the program.

One agreement, known as the “Task Force Model” (TFM), allows deputies to enforce immigration laws during routine duties, such as traffic stops. If deputies encounter a person with an ICE detainer, they can take the person into custody and bring them to an ICE detention facility.

A second agreement, called the “Warrant Service Officer” (WSO) program, authorizes trained jail staff to serve and execute ICE warrants on current Lake County jail inmates. If a person set for release is found to be in the country illegally, the jail will hold the inmate for up to 48 hours until ICE agents retrieve the person.

Leonbruno said that the agreements will not change how the county jail operates, explaining the facility will not become an ICE detention center or house immigration detainees under a pay-for-stay model.

He also said the sheriff’s office will not initiate independent immigration violation investigations, nor will it participate in ICE raids unless specifically asked to help with high-risk violent offenders or cartel members.

The agreements have drawn criticism from some who believe they could erode trust with Lake County’s diverse population and encourage profiling.

“People are being asked consistently about their immigration status if they appear to be Hispanic, if they’re playing Spanish music. People have been asked to get out of their car, they’ve been asked to consent to searches in ways that wouldn’t have been expected before,” said Connor Marrott, an organizer with the Lake-Geauga Fights Back Network.

The sheriff has defended the agreements, saying they’re not politically motivated and simply codify the agency’s legal authority to uphold the law.

A court might order an individual law enforcement officer to compensate the victim of that officer’s illegal action.
A victim of illegal behavior by a federal law enforcement officer might sue the United States and seek compensation.
A law enforcement officer, or perhaps a senior law enforcement official, might be criminally prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has cut off the most effective ways of ensuring that federal law enforcement officers comply with the law.","By now, you’ve probably seen some of the videos of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as other federal law enforcement agencies, attacking immigrants and unarmed Americans protesting President Donald Trump’s immigration policies. In one, officers shoot a pastor in the head with a pepper ball. In another, an officer sprays pepper spray directly into the air vent of a protester dressed in an inflatable frog costume — in an apparent attempt to fill the suit with noxious gas.

This administration’s abuse of immigrants, protesters, and Trump’s perceived enemies appears to be systemic. An August report by Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) office identified 510 “credible reports” of human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities since Trump took office in January. ProPublica found that over 170 US citizens have been held by immigration officials, some of whom were beaten or worse.

Even high-ranking elected officials are victims. Last May, for example, federal law enforcement forcibly arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) after Baraka sought a tour of an immigration detention facility. After those charges fell apart, the Trump administration indicted US Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who attempted to shield Baraka from arrest. In a video cited by McIver’s attorneys, one of the officers claims that Baraka’s arrest was ordered by US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Worse, the Supreme Court — or, at least, its six Republicans — appears to be entirely on board with these tactics. In September, the Republican justices voted to block a lower court order that, among other things, forbade ICE from targeting suspected undocumented immigrants solely because of their race. That case is known as Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo.

The Republican justices rarely explain their decisions when they rule in Trump’s favor, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh did write a concurring opinion explaining why he voted the way he did. His assertion that someone targeted by ICE’s “apparent ethnicity” was “relevant” to law enforcement deciding whom to stop has received the most attention, as Kavanaugh seemed to blow off fears that federal law enforcement is targeting Latinos because of their race. But Kavanaugh also strongly implied that no one victimized by ICE may seek an injunction prohibiting ICE from engaging in illegal tactics in the future. (In the wake of this decision, many commentators are now referring to ICE’s tactics as “Kavanaugh stops.”)

So are there any legal avenues left to challenge abusive tactics by ICE, or by other law enforcement agencies controlled by Trump? The short answer is that a few narrow pathways still exist, but they are unlikely to provide a meaningful check on ICE’s behavior.

Broadly speaking, there are five ways that the law could constrain federal law enforcement:

A federal court might issue an injunction against a law enforcement agency, barring it from continuing to engage in a particular illegal practice. Kavanaugh’s opinion in Vasquez Perdomo, however, suggests that this Supreme Court will not allow such an injunction to stand.

A court might order an individual law enforcement officer to compensate the victim of that officer’s illegal action. The Republican justices, however, have largely cut off this avenue in two decisions handed down in the past five years.

A victim of illegal behavior by a federal law enforcement officer might sue the United States and seek compensation. The Supreme Court’s unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013) suggests that this avenue remains open — although it is unlikely that either Trump or any individual officer will change their behavior because they fear that the US Treasury may have to pay out some money at some future date.

A law enforcement officer, or perhaps a senior law enforcement official, might be criminally prosecuted. Such a prosecution would depend on whether an existing criminal law already prohibits the officer’s activity (or potentially, whether it prohibits an order to an officer given by a senior official). And it is unlikely that any such prosecutions will happen for as long as Trump controls the Justice Department.

Finally, until recently, Trump himself could potentially have been prosecuted if he gave an order that violates federal criminal law. But the Republican justices gave Trump sweeping immunity from prosecution in Trump v. United States (2024).

Let’s look at each of these options in a bit more detail.

“Kavanaugh stops,” and injunctions against law enforcement

It is quite difficult to obtain a court order prohibiting a law enforcement agency from committing an illegal action in the future, and it has been for more than four decades. The seminal case is City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983), which held that Adolph Lyons, a man who was allegedly placed in a chokehold by police officers without provocation, could not obtain a court order forbidding the Los Angeles Police Department from using these chokeholds in the future.

Lyons held that “past exposure to illegal conduct” does not permit someone to seek an injunction prohibiting similar conduct in the future. Instead, the Court concluded that “Lyons’ standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.”

To prevail, in other words, Lyons had to show that he personally was likely to be choked a second time, at some point in the future, by a Los Angeles police officer.

In Vasquez Perdomo, Kavanaugh claimed that the plaintiffs’ argument challenging ICE’s actions in that case “largely tracks the theory rejected in Lyons.” The plaintiffs in Vasquez Perdomo alleged that they were stopped by ICE for impermissible reasons, including because they are Latino. But Kavanaugh claimed that they have “no good basis to believe that law enforcement will unlawfully stop them in the future based on the prohibited factors.”

As a factual matter, Kavanaugh’s claim is dubious. A federal appeals court found that “at least one individual with lawful status was stopped twice by roving patrols in just 10 days.” So the fact that ICE targeted this one individual twice in such a short period suggests that they were likely to be targeted again unless a court intervenes. The Trump administration also repeatedly targeted certain businesses where they believed that undocumented people worked — one car wash was hit four times in nine days, according to Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent. So the workers in that car wash sure seemed to be likely to be targeted again in the future.

Ultimately, however, the real facts underlying a Supreme Court case matter a whole lot less than what a majority of the justices say about the facts of a case. Both the Court’s decision in Vasquez Perdomo, and Kavanaugh’s reliance on Lyons in his defense of that decision, suggest that this Court is unlikely to allow anyone who is illegally targeted by ICE to seek an injunction against that law enforcement agency — even if in reality, these very decisions give the Trump administration permission to target the same people over and over again.

The death of Bivens: Why ICE officers can no longer be sued for breaking the law

More than half a century ago, in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1971), the Supreme Court held that the victim of an unconstitutional action by a federal law enforcement officer could sue that officer and potentially collect money damages directly from them. Bivens explained that an officer who acts unlawfully “in the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.” And so it follows that there should be a meaningful remedy to discourage officers from abusing their power.

But this view of accountability has long been out of favor with a majority of the justices. And, in two recent cases, the Court’s Republican majority have come very close to overruling Bivens outright.

In Hernández v. Mesa (2020), the Republican justices ruled that a US Border Patrol agent who allegedly shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican boy in cold blood could not be sued, even if the boy’s parents could prove that the shooting was unjustified. And, in Egbert v. Boule (2022), the Republican justices immunized Border Patrol agents who allegedly used excessive force against an innkeeper from lawsuits.

Both decisions were exceedingly hostile to Bivens. In Egbert, for example, Justice Clarence Thomas’s majority opinion concluded that courts should reject Bivens suits if there is “any rational reason (even one)” to do so.

Given these decisions, it is safe to say that the current slate of justices will not allow an ICE officer to be sued by their victim, even if the officer clearly violated the law or the Constitution.

Suits against the United States: A weak, but still viable, remedy

The Federal Tort Claims Act frequently permits the United States to be sued if a federal law enforcement officer engages in “assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.” And the Supreme Court took a fairly expansive view of how this law applies to bad actions by law enforcement in its unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013), a case about a prisoner who sued corrections officers who allegedly threatened and sexually assaulted him.

So it is likely that even this Supreme Court would allow some victims of illegal activity by ICE, or similar agencies, to sue the federal government and seek compensation from the United States Treasury.

That said, it is doubtful that this remedy will do much to deter future lawless behavior by ICE. Neither an individual law enforcement officer, nor the senior Trump administration officials giving them orders, are likely to change their behavior because, maybe a year from now, a federal judge might order the US Treasury to pay money to someone who was victimized by ICE.

The whole point of Bivens was to impose consequences personally upon rogue officers, so that they will be deterred from breaking the law. A lawsuit requiring US taxpayers to compensate victims is unlikely to achieve the same goal.

Criminal prosecutions: Maybe in the next administration?

Finally, to the extent that any individual law enforcement officer violates a federal criminal statute, they might be prosecuted for doing so. That’s highly unlikely to happen, however, for as long as Trump rules the Justice Department. Any future prosecutions are likely to turn on who wins the 2028 election.

One person who will suffer no criminal consequences, however, no matter how many laws he breaks, is Donald Trump. The Republican justices’ decision in Trump v. United States (2024) held that Trump is immune from prosecution for his official acts as president. That decision even said that he is immune if he orders law enforcement to target someone “for an improper purpose.”

Moreover, even if some law enforcement officer — or maybe some Trump political appointee — is prosecuted for unlawful actions, there is always some risk that the same Republican justices who invented the concept of presidential immunity from prosecution will also decide to immunize officers who were carrying out Trump’s orders. Trump could also use his pardon power to protect them.

So if you hope that ICE officers, and other federal officials who have abused their powers, will someday be held to account for their actions, the news is not good. The Supreme Court has cut off the most effective ways of ensuring that federal law enforcement officers comply with the law.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZOwwaI8iueznh5j.fKKzHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vox_384/047f8ce87f7bc5a3a661fdd296bba27b,N,,2025-10-20 19:21:17.578336

The 36-page ruling lifted a temporary block on the deployment of Oregon and California National Guard soldiers by Judge Karin J. Immergut of the Federal District Court for the District of Oregon. It was not immediately clear whether the order, also allowed the president to use National Guard soldiers from Texas or other states, as he has suggested he might do.

The ruling came from two members of the three-judge panel, Judge Ryan D. Nelson and Judge Bridget S. Bade, both appointees of President Trump. Judge Susan P. Graber, a Clinton appointee, dissented.

The ruling opened the door to some federal troops being stationed at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in South Portland that has been the site of street protests since June.

A memo in September from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Guard troops could be stationed anywhere that protests “are occurring or likely to occur” and could accompany federal agents enacting Mr. Trump’s immigration agenda in the field.

The memo came a day after a social-media post by Mr. Trump stating that he would send “all necessary troops” “to protect war-ravaged Portland from “domestic terrorists.”

Such incendiary descriptions do not reflect the reality in Portland, Judge Immergut had written, and have been at odds with law enforcement agencies’ own assessments of protest activity. But that has not stopped the president and other officials from misrepresenting conditions in Portland and in other Democratic-led cities where he wants to send federal forces.

Much of the litigation prompted by his deployment efforts in Portland and in the Chicago area has turned on whether the Trump administration’s accounts of violence at anti-ICE protests are accurate, and whether there is a basis for invoking a federal law that allows the president to deploy the National Guard if “there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion,” or if the president is unable to execute U.S. law.

In a preliminary ruling, Judge Immergut, who was nominated to the bench by Mr. Trump, found that while there had been some “violent behavior,” including the construction of a “makeshift guillotine to intimidate federal officials,” most of it occurred before June 25, and none of it amounted to a rebellion.

The two Ninth Circuit judges who ruled on Monday disagreed with her conclusion.

However, their ruling is unlikely to be the final word in the dispute over the Portland deployment. The state of Oregon and city of Portland, which filed the lawsuit, could ask for an 11-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit to review the decision or appeal directly to the Supreme Court.

Mr. Trump has some additional options as well. If the courts wind up going against his deployment, he could invoke the Insurrection Act, which would give him the authority to circumvent the court order now blocking a similar deployment in Illinois. That, however, would almost certainly be the subject of another round of lawsuits.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/13/multimedia/00nat-guard-ninthcircuit-pvwl/00nat-guard-ninthcircuit-pvwl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 16:16:58.813231

Bass, alongside Garcia and a group of city workers and immigrant rights activists, said she's worried the continued immigration raids are no longer getting the attention they need.

They're asking the public to record ICE activity when they see it and upload the videos to a new master ICE tracker site that they plan to launch within the next few weeks.

Garcia, a ranking member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said American citizens are being dragged off the streets by masked men and thrown into detention cells without access to attorneys.

The Trump administration has maintained that federal immigration enforcement focuses on the removal of ""violent criminals"" and the ""worst of the worst."" Officials have also denied allegations that detainees are mistreated or held in substandard facilities while in custody.

As for the new investigation, Garcia says Democrats plan to hold a congressional field hearing in Los Angeles so people affected by the ICE sweeps can testify. No date for that hearing has been set yet.

Rather, discussion focussed on the question of whether the protesters have in recent weeks and months rendered the Trump administration unable to enforce federal law.","A federal appeals court on Monday afternoon overturned a lower court’s order that had blocked the Trump administration from deploying the military in Portland.

Two judges on the three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals determined that in federalizing Oregon National Guard members, President Donald Trump appeared to be in compliance with a U.S. law which allows such an action when “the President is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.”

Evaluating whether such conditions are met is “inherently subjective,” the majority wrote. But they argued that U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut had erred in failing to defer sufficiently to the president’s assessment of the situation on the ground in Portland.

“Rather than reviewing the President’s determination with great deference, the district court substituted its own determination of the relevant facts and circumstances,” the judges wrote, criticizing the lower court order they were overturning.

What immediate effect the order will have is unclear, but the court case is likely far from over, and the core legal questions remains contentious. The third member of the 9th circuit panel, Judge Susan P. Graber, dissented from her colleagues in strong terms.

“Given Portland protesters’ well-known penchant for wearing chicken suits, inflatable frog costumes, or nothing at all when expressing their disagreement with the methods employed by ICE, observers may be tempted to view the majority’s ruling, which accepts the government’s characterization of Portland as a war zone, as merely absurd,” she wrote in her dissent. “But today’s decision is not merely absurd. It erodes core constitutional principles, including sovereign States’ control over their States’ militias and the people’s First Amendment rights to assemble and to object to the government’s policies and actions.”

The majority’s order is the latest twist in a winding and high-stakes legal dispute over when the military can be deployed into U.S. cities—and what deference courts should give the president to make that judgement.

Trump and his backers say he needs the National Guard to maintain order in Portland amid persistent protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in the city.

Critics, like the Oregon governor and the Portland mayor, say the Trump administration is creating fantastical pretexts to bring in the guard to harass and bully Democrat-run jurisdictions.

Early this month, Immergut sided with those critics. She assessed the record of generally small protests outside the ICE facility, and seriously doubted it gave Trump legal justification for a military deployment.

On Monday though, the majority of the appeals court disagreed. The judges were moved by federal officials’ statements that they had to divert significant law enforcement resources to Portland amid the protests. And they argued the lower court had improperly focussed on the nature of the protests in the days and weeks leading up to Trump’s announcement that he would federalize the National Guard, discounting “the violent and disruptive events that occurred in June, July, and August.”

The lower court judge, the majority wrote, should have given more deference to the president’s judgements.

“The district court substituted its own assessment of the facts for the President’s assessment of the facts,” they wrote.

Versions of this fight have been boiling nationwide for months now. Despite local opposition, the Trump administration earlier this year sent troops to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Focus turned to Portland late last month, when Trump said he would deploy 200 Oregon National Guard members to restore order to a lost city, whose citizenry was allegedly besieged by by criminal elements and Antifa domestic terrorists.

Suing to block the move, Oregon and Portland officials said the president was acting on the basis of a ridiculous fiction. The law the Trump administration had invoked said he could take command of state national guard troops in circumstances of invasion or rebellion, or when federal laws cannot otherwise be executed. Oregon leaders argued that the small-scale protests that have ebbed and waned since June outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Facility in south Portland clearly met none of those conditions.

Immergut’s opinion in Oregon’s favor included a lengthy factual record of recent events outside the ICE facility. Protests in June indeed featured violent behavior, the judge found, but in recent months, demonstrations were generally peaceful and small, easily managed by law enforcement. Assessing various reports, she found that, despite the Trump administration’s claims of chaos in the weeks leading up to his move to sent troops to pacify Portland, in reality not much during that period had happened there at all.

The president, Immergut wrote, “is certainly entitled ‘a great level of deference,’ in his determination that he ‘is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States. But ‘a great level of deference’ is not equivalent to ignoring the facts on the ground.”

With this, she issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump-directed Oregon National Guard mission while litigation proceeded.

But the Trump administration had other plans.

One of these was to swiftly deploy National Guard troops from other states to Portland. Less than 24 hours after the first restraining order kicked in, the Oregon governor reported that federalized troops from the California National Guard had arrived in the state without her consent (or that of the California governor). Soon after came the news that the Texas National Guard was planning to come as well.

Immergut was displeased. The Trump administration, she said in an emergency hearing late Sunday, was operating in direct contravention of her earlier order. The judge then issued a wider restraining order, blocking troops from other states from coming to Oregon too.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration awaited its pending appeal with a higher court, where it argued Immergut had erred in her decision to block the deployment.

Soon after, the appeals court heard oral arguments over Zoom. An attorney for Oregon and the Trump administration each presented to a three judge-panel, who in turn peppered them with questions.

The hearing featured no mention of a notable wrinkle: the argument made by the City of Portland and others that physically aggressive federal agents were in many cases making the situation more, not less combustible—and that the arrival of military was likely to make things worse.

Rather, discussion focussed on the question of whether the protesters have in recent weeks and months rendered the Trump administration unable to enforce federal law.

Questions from the two Trump appointees in particular seemed to suggest they though the president had a solid case on this front, especially if they expanded their lens back to June, when the protests were so violent and disruptive that officials said they had to temporarily close the ICE facility entirely.

Then there was a headier question: Were courts in a position to question Trump’s military judgements at all?

A skeptical Judge Ryan D. Nelson told Oregon’s Assistant Attorney General Stacy Marie Chaffin that she seemed to want to focus on what’s going on with the protests outside—whether they rose to a certain level.

But this, the judge suggested, was perhaps the wrong lens. Whether protests are making it so the president can’t enforce federal law was a matter, the judge said, of “internal decision making.” He added that, “Whether there is a ton of protest or low protest—they can still have an impact on his ability to execute the laws.”",https://www.wweek.com/resizer/v2/IM7OFPDOVNG2JG75OKWUPO3ROQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=6d0bbc5f39573766f53b90ba514b68f2c22088a97a7952e7c626ef82aa4b1aef&width=1200&height=630,N,,2025-10-20 16:17:03.506193

Democratic-led states seek to halt deployments

The decision is the latest in disputes between Trump and local officials about deploying troops to quell protests against immigration enforcement. Three federal judges have ruled against Trump in California, Illinois and Oregon but appeals courts have split.

The 9th Circuit previously backed Trump’s use of troops in Los Angeles. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that troops should stay out of Chicago for now.

Trump on Sept. 27 ordered 200 National Guard troops to Portland, continuing his administration's unprecedented use of military personnel in U.S. cities to suppress protests and bolster domestic immigration enforcement. Trump called the city ""War ravaged"" and said, ""I am also authorizing Full Force, if necessary.""

The lawsuit from Oregon and Portland accused Trump of exaggerating the severity of protests against his immigration policies to justify illegally seizing control of state National Guard units. Police records provided by the state showed that protests in Portland were ""small and sedate,"" resulting in only 25 arrests in mid-June and no arrests months since June 19.

Immergut has scheduled a non-jury trial set to begin on Oct. 29 to determine whether to impose a longer-term block.

A federal law called the Posse Comitatus Act generally restricts the use of the U.S. military for domestic law enforcement purposes. In ordering troops to California, Oregon and Illinois, Trump has relied on a law that allows a president to deploy state National Guard to repel an invasion, suppress a rebellion or allow the president to execute the law.

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces that answer to state governors except when called into federal service by the president.

We go now to California, where immigrant rights/labor icon Dolores Huerta addressed the “No Kings” rally Saturday in Watsonville.

DOLORES HUERTA: People here that are right now being arrested, deported and terrorized, they are not immigrants. They are the Indigenous people of the continent. The real immigrants to the United States came from Europe, right?

AMY GOODMAN: That was Dolores Huerta. She is 95 years old. Amidst intensifying immigration raids, she’s joined with People for the American Way and the Dolores Huerta Foundation to release a short film that shows neighbors joining together in nonviolent civil disobedience to protect a dramatized immigrant elder from being zip-tied and disappeared by ICE. It’s a dramatization. At the end of the video, the ICE agents hear protesters outside, including Dolores Huerta, and stop their arrest. She released this right before the No Kings rally and is joining us from her home in California.

Welcome back to Democracy Now!, Dolores. Talk about what you told the crowd and how large that gathering was for Watsonville and the significance of Watsonville, the center of migrant worker organizing in California.

DOLORES HUERTA: Yes, we had a really great rally. We had a lot of farmworkers that were there. And, of course, people lined the streets with their signs. And it was just amazing. And as you know, here in California, we were some of the first people hit by the Border Patrol and ICE, and they arrested 90 people. And of those 90 people, only one person out of the 90 had any kind of a criminal record, which could be a traffic ticket, some kind of misdemeanor.

And we just have to say to everyone, this is not about going after immigrants. This is about going after people of color. This is ethnic cleansing. This is what — exactly what is happening now in the United States of America. And God knows that we have to put a stop to it. We have never seen such horrific, horrific attacks on our people.

AMY GOODMAN: Can you talk about ICE targeting day labor centers in Los Angeles, for example, the Van Nuys center being raided 14 times since June, the focus on labor, on workers who are out at work when they are taken?

DOLORES HUERTA: Yes, not only farmworkers, but we know our hospitality workers that work in our hotels, people who are laborers that work on construction sites. I mean, absolutely no one is safe. If you happen to be just anybody on the street that happens to be a person that looks Latino or Asian or Black, you are subjected to the kidnapping and all of these tortures. And as we know, people have already been killed. You know, this is the kind of horrific, horrific terrorism that the Latino and the people of color community are now living. And God knows that it has to stop. It has to stop.

And so, it’s so important, here in California, we’re working on Proposition 50, which will be voted on on November the 4th, and so that we can change the Congress, because we know that our Congress is the one that has allocated the funding. The millions of dollars that they’re giving to ICE and for the detention centers, this is all coming from our own government, not only the president, but the Congress right now. The current Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, is putting all of these horrible maneuvers in place right now to terrorize our community. And God knows it’s got to be stopped. And we know we have elections in 2026, and so we are now preparing the ground so that we can get more Democrats, more progressive people in the Congress, so that we could stop the madness that is happening to our community.

AMY GOODMAN: Dolores Huerta, you, Maxine Waters, other U.S. citizens have filed a petition with the Carrillo Law Firm to the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the Trump administration for potential human rights violations, denouncing these ICE raids as a form of ethnic cleansing. Can you talk about the significance of this petition?

DOLORES HUERTA: The petition itself is actually — and the law firm is representing several U.S. citizens that have been detained, arrested or attacked by ICE agents. And so, they are actually representing U.S. citizens and people that have the documented right to work here in United States of America, and yet they have been detained, and they have been attacked by the ICE agents. And we are hoping that we can get many more people here in the United States to also sign on to that petition.

And we are asking the United Nations to please send an envoy to the United States, as ridiculous as it sounds, but to think that we have to petition the United Nations to come in and investigate what is happening to people of color here in the United States of America, just like they did in Guatemala when all of the assassinations were taking place in Guatemala and the people that were being attacked. You know, we have a similar situation here in United States, and we need — we need help. And we’re not — we can’t get it from our own government. Maybe people in the United Nations can help and assist us.

AMY GOODMAN: There were many around the country who called for a general strike, you know, bringing together the issue of labor and immigrant rights. You are a leading labor/immigrant rights activist. In your final comment in these 30 seconds, do you endorse this?

DOLORES HUERTA: Absolutely, but we know it has to take a lot of good planning to make sure it’s effective. And we also want to say to people, you can go to aclu.org/know-your-rights/immigrants-rights to help you get more information, and also to nilc.org/resources. Everybody has rights. Everybody —

AMY GOODMAN: Dolores Huerta, we want to thank you so much for being with us, renowned civil rights activist, co-founder of the United Farm Workers and president of the Dolores Huerta Foundation. We spoke to her at her home in Bakersfield, California. She is 95 years old.

Charles E. Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump’s immigration policies had a major role in the reduction of immigration cases, including encouraging migrants to self-deport.
Congress over the past decade has provided funding for additional immigration judges and support staff to boost the overall capacity of the asylum and deportation system.
“We still have a massive backlog, so we still need quite a few immigration judges be able to get caught up completely on the backlog,” Lankford said.
“There have been proposals to try to dramatically increase the funding when it comes to immigration judges.
“So we need more immigration judges.”","The Trump administration’s tough-on-immigration policies are on pace to reduce the backlog of cases in the nation’s immigration courts, reversing a long-running trend that has raised concerns from lawmakers of both parties.

The number of pending cases in the asylum and deportation system reached an all-time high of 3.7 million cases at the end of fiscal 2024, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or TRAC, which compiles data on immigration enforcement.

But the number had dropped to 3.4 million, a decrease of about 8 percent, with one month remaining in fiscal 2025, the data shows, the first decline in the backlog since at least 2012. As of March, the average wait time for those in the backlog was 636 days, TRAC reported.

The decrease comes as President Trump Donald Trump has instituted restrictive policies on immigration that cut off entryways for migrants, effectively ending asylum applications and bringing the total number of apprehensions of illegal crossers to all-time lows, immigration experts said.

Andrew R. Arthur, a former immigration judge and fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for limiting immigration, identified “shutting off that valve at the border” as a main reason for the reduction in the backlog, pointing out 140,000 more immigration cases were completed than were filed in the first nine months of 2025.

But Arthur also attributed the decline to an influx of cases being decided against applicants in absentia because they didn’t show up in court. Nearly 219,000 cases in the first nine months of 2025 were decided without the applicant appearing in court, compared to 91,356 cases in 2019, Arthur said.

“I mean, if you don’t show up, it’s really easy to complete your case,” Arthur said.

Asylum applicants who have had their cases decided against them after they didn’t show in court, Arthur said, are subject to a fine and “if they come across you, or they go out and pick you up, you’re basically on your way out of the United States.”

Greg Chen, senior director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has an estimated 18,000 immigration attorneys affiliated with his network, also acknowledged attorneys have observed an increasing number of cases being decided in absentia.

Chen said that’s the result of applicants being afraid that if they come to court a judge will unfairly dismiss their case and leave them vulnerable to immediate deportation, pointing to reports that found officials with Immigration and Customs Enforcement were asking judges to dismiss the cases so they could detain those people immediately.

“I am concerned that people are afraid now to appear in court, even if they believe they have a valid case, because they do not think the courts are going to give them the fair due process that Americans expect out of our courts,” Chen said. “And the courts are making decisions to find them to be deportable, removal from the country, in absentia, without them being present.”

The number of pending immigration cases remains at a staggering high compared to fiscal years past. The number more than doubled during Trump’s first term, from 620,000 in fiscal 2017 to 1.3 million in fiscal 2020. Then the number nearly tripled during the Biden administration, to 3.7 million at the end of fiscal 2024, which was just ahead of the 2024 presidential election where immigration enforcement was a main topic.

Sen. Charles E. Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Trump’s immigration policies had a major role in the reduction of immigration cases, including encouraging migrants to self-deport.

“My common sense tells me it’s because we’ve had people willingly leave the country that were here illegally,” the Iowa Republican said.

Congress over the past decade has provided funding for additional immigration judges and support staff to boost the overall capacity of the asylum and deportation system. The number of immigration judges increased to around 700 in recent years.

Both Republicans and Democrats during that time proposed an increase in judges when they controlled the appropriations process, and as part of bipartisan proposals on border security.

The latest increase was in this year’s reconciliation package, which included $3.3 billion for the Justice Department, a portion of which would go to the Executive Office for Immigration Review to hire immigration judges and staff. The law also caps the number of immigration judges at 800.

Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, a Republican and member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the decrease in the backlog of immigration cases was “significant,” but that doesn’t change the need to add more immigration judges to the roster.

“We still have a massive backlog, so we still need quite a few immigration judges be able to get caught up completely on the backlog,” Lankford said. “That is very long.”

Lankford was among the senators who assembled and pressed for passage of a bipartisan border bill last Congress that included $440 million for more immigration judges.

Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat and also a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said the decline in immigration cases may be because “people feel under attack in many different ways,” but also said the remainder of cases demonstrates the need for more immigration judges.

“The huge backlog that we’ve had when it comes to immigration cases, just shows maybe it would take well over a decade to even just get through some of the backlog that we’ve already had,” Kim said. “There have been proposals to try to dramatically increase the funding when it comes to immigration judges. I would support an effort like that.”

Arthur said the decline in the immigration backlog does “absolutely not” indicate a change in the need for adding more immigration judges to the bench, saying he’s “confident” the cap on immigration judges at 800 will be taken out in the next congressional omnibus package.

“Because you still got a huge number of cases, and some of those cases are taking years to complete,” Arthur said. “So we need more immigration judges.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2238189274.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 15:57:07.579679

Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.","When the Supreme Court recently allowed immigration agents in the Los Angeles area to take race into consideration during sweeps, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that citizens shouldn’t be concerned.

“If the officers learn that the individual they stopped is a U.S. citizen or otherwise lawfully in the United States,” Kavanaugh wrote, “they promptly let the individual go.”

But that is far from the reality many citizens have experienced. Americans have been dragged, tackled, beaten, tased and shot by immigration agents. They’ve had their necks kneeled on. They’ve been held outside in the rain while in their underwear. At least three citizens were pregnant when agents detained them. One of those women had already had the door of her home blown off while Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem watched.

About two dozen Americans have said they were held for more than a day without being able to phone lawyers or loved ones.

Videos of U.S. citizens being mistreated by immigration agents have filled social media feeds, but there is little clarity on the overall picture. The government does not track how often immigration agents hold Americans.

So ProPublica created its own count.

We compiled and reviewed every case we could find of agents holding citizens against their will, whether during immigration raids or protests. While the tally is almost certainly incomplete, we found more than 170 such incidents during the first nine months of President Donald Trump’s second administration.

Among the citizens detained are nearly 20 children, including two with cancer. That includes four who were held for weeks with their undocumented mother and without access to the family’s attorney until a congresswoman intervened.

Immigration agents do have authority to detain Americans in limited circumstances. Agents can hold people whom they reasonably suspect are in the country illegally. We found more than 50 Americans who were held after agents questioned their citizenship. They were almost all Latino.

Immigration agents also can arrest citizens who allegedly interfered with or assaulted officers. We compiled cases of about 130 Americans, including a dozen elected officials, accused of assaulting or impeding officers.

These cases have often wilted under scrutiny. In nearly 50 instances that we have identified so far, charges have never been filed or the cases were dismissed. Our count found a handful of citizens have pleaded guilty, mostly to misdemeanors.

Among the detentions in which allegations have not stuck, masked agents pointed a gun at, pepper sprayed and punched a young man who had filmed them searching for his relative. In another, agents knocked over and then tackled a 79-year-old car wash owner, pressing their knees into his neck and back. His lawyer said he was held for 12 hours and wasn’t given medical attention despite having broken ribs in the incident and having recently had heart surgery. In a third case, agents grabbed and handcuffed a woman on her way to work who was caught up in a chaotic raid on street vendors. In a complaint filed against the government, she described being held for more than two days, without being allowed to contact the outside world for much of that time. (The Supreme Court has ruled that two days is generally the longest federal officials can hold Americans without charges.)

In response to questions from ProPublica, the Department of Homeland Security said agents do not racially profile or target Americans. “We don’t arrest US citizens for immigration enforcement,” wrote spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.

A top immigration official recently acknowledged agents do consider someone’s looks. “How do they look compared to, say, you?” Border Patrol chief Gregory Bovino said to a white reporter in Chicago.

The White House told ProPublica that anyone who assaults federal immigration agents would be prosecuted. “Interfering with law enforcement and assaulting law enforcement is a crime and anyone, regardless of immigration status, will be held accountable,” said the Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson. “Officers act heroically to enforce the law, arrest criminal illegal aliens, and protect American communities with the utmost professionalism.”

A spokesperson for Kavanaugh did not return an emailed request for comment.

Tallying the number of Americans detained by immigration agents is inherently messy and incomplete. The government has long ignored recommendations for it to track such cases, even as the U.S. has a history of detaining and even deporting citizens, including during the Obama administration and Trump’s first term.

We compiled cases by sifting through both English- and Spanish-language social media, lawsuits, court records and local media reports. We did not include arrests of protesters by local police or the National Guard. Nor did we count cases in which arrests were made at a later date after a judicial process. That included cases of some people charged with serious crimes, like throwing rocks or tossing a flare to start a fire.

Experts say that Americans appear to be getting picked up more now as a result of the government doing something that it hasn’t for decades: large-scale immigration sweeps across the country, often in communities that do not want them.

In earlier administrations, deportation agents used intelligence to target specific individuals, said Scott Shuchart, a top immigration official in the Biden, Obama and first Trump administrations. “The new idea is to use those resources unintelligently” — with officers targeting communities or workplaces where undocumented immigrants may be.

When federal officers roll through communities in the way the Supreme Court permitted, the constitutional rights of both citizens and noncitizens are inevitably violated, argued David Bier, the director of immigration studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. He recently analyzed how sweeps in Los Angeles have led to racial profiling. “If the government can grab someone because he’s a certain demographic group that’s correlated with some offense category, then they can do that in any context.”

Cody Wofsy, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, put it even more starkly. “Any one of us could be next.”

When Kavanaugh issued his opinion that immigration agents can consider race and other factors, the Supreme Court’s three liberal justices strongly dissented. They warned that citizens risked being “grabbed, thrown to the ground, and handcuffed simply because of their looks, their accents, and the fact they make a living by doing manual labor.”

Leonardo Garcia Venegas appears to have been just such a case. He was working at a construction site in coastal Alabama when he saw masked immigration agents from Homeland Security Investigations hop a fence and run by a “No trespassing” sign. Garcia Venegas recalled that they moved toward the Latino workers, ignoring the white and Black workers.

Garcia Venegas began filming after his undocumented brother asked agents for a warrant. In response, the footage shows, agents yanked his brother to the ground, shoving his face into wet concrete. Garcia Venegas kept filming until officers grabbed him too and knocked his phone to the ground.

Other co-workers filmed what happened next, as immigration agents twisted the 25-year-old’s arms. They repeatedly tried to take him to the ground while he yelled, “I’m a citizen!”

Officers pulled out his REAL ID, which Alabama only issues to those legally in the U.S. But the agents dismissed it as fake. Officers held Garcia Venegas handcuffed for more than an hour. His brother was later deported.

Garcia Venegas was so shaken that he took two weeks off of work. Soon after he returned, he was working alone inside a nearly built house listening to music on his headphones when he sensed someone watching him. A masked immigration agent was standing in the bedroom doorway.

This time, agents didn’t tackle him. But they again dismissed his REAL ID. And then they held him to check his citizenship. Garcia Venegas says agents also held two other workers who had legal status.

DHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about Garcia Venegas’ detentions, or to a federal lawsuit he filed last month. The agency has previously defended the agents’ conduct, saying he “physically got in between agents and the subject” during the first incident. The footage does not show that, and Garcia Venegas was never charged with obstruction or any other crime.

Garcia Venegas’ lawyers at the nonprofit Institute for Justice hope others may join his suit. After all, the reverberations of the immigration sweeps are being felt widely. Garcia Venegas said he knows of 15 more raids on nearby construction sites, and the industry along his portion of the Gulf Coast is struggling for lack of workers.

Kavanaugh’s assurances hold little weight for Garcia Venegas. He’s a U.S. citizen of Mexican descent, who speaks little English and works in construction. Even with his REAL ID and Social Security card in his wallet, Garcia Venegas worries that immigration agents will keep harassing him.

“If they decide they want to detain you,” he said. “You’re not going to get out of it.”

George Retes was among the citizens arrested despite immigration agents appearing to know his legal status. He also disappeared into the system for days without being able to contact anyone on the outside.

The only clue Retes’ family had at first was a brief call he managed to make on his Apple Watch with his hands handcuffed behind his back. He quickly told his wife that “ICE” had arrested him during a massive raid and protest on the marijuana farm where he worked as a security guard.

Still, Retes’ family couldn’t find him. They called every law enforcement agency they could think of. No one gave them any answers.

Eventually, they spotted a TikTok video showing Retes driving to work and slowly trying to back up as he’s caught between agents and protestors. Through the tear gas and dust, his family recognized Retes’ car and the veteran decal on his window. The full video shows a man — Retes — splayed on the ground surrounded by agents.

Retes’ family went to the farm, where local TV reporters were interviewing families who couldn’t find their loved ones.

“They broke his window, they pepper sprayed him, they grabbed him, threw him on the floor,” his sister told a reporter between sobs. “We don’t know what to do. We’re just asking to let my brother go. He didn’t do anything wrong. He’s a veteran, disabled citizen. It says it on his car.”

Retes was held for three days without being given an opportunity to make a call. His family only learned where he had been after his release. His leg had been cut from the broken glass, Retes told ProPublica, and lingering pepper spray burned his hands.He tried to soothe them by filling sandwich bags with water.

Retes recalled that agents knew he was a citizen. “They didn’t care.” He said one DHS official laughed at him, saying he shouldn’t have come to work that day. “They still sent me away to jail.” He added that cases like his show Kavanaugh was “wrong completely.”

DHS did not answer our questions about Retes. It did respond on X after Retes wrote an op-ed last month in the San Francisco Chronicle. An agency post asserted he was arrested for assault after he “became violent and refused to comply with law enforcement.” Yet Retes had been released without any charges. Indeed, he says he was never told why he was arrested.

The Department of Justice has encouraged agents to arrest anyone interfering with immigration operations, twiceordering law enforcement to prioritize cases of those suspected of obstructing, interfering with or assaulting immigration officials.

But the government’s claims in those cases have often not been borne out.

Daniel Montenegro was filming a raid at a Van Nuys, California, Home Depot with other day-laborer advocates this summer when, he told ProPublica, he was tackled by several officers who injured his back.

Bovino, the Border Patrol chief who oversaw the LA raids and has since taken similar operations to cities like Sacramento and Chicago, tweeted out the names and photos of Montenegro and three others, accusing them of using homemade tire spikes to disable vehicles.

“I had no idea where that story came from,” Montenegro told ProPublica. “I didn’t find out until we were released. People were like, ‘We saw you on Twitter and the news and you guys are terrorists, you were planning to slash tires.’ I never saw those spike tire-popper things.”

Officials have not charged Montenegro or the others with any crimes. (Bovino did not respond to a request for comment, while DHS defended him in a statement to ProPublica: “Chief Bovino’s success in getting the worst of the worst out of the country speaks for itself.”)

The government’s cases are sometimes so muddied that it’s unclear why agents actually arrested a citizen.

Andrea Velez was charged with assaulting an officer after she was accidentally dropped off for work during a raid on street vendors in downtown Los Angeles. She said in a federal complaint that officers repeatedly assumed she did not speak English. Federal officers later requested access to her phone in an attempt to prove she was colluding with another citizen arrested that day, who was charged with assault. She was one of the Americans held for more than two days.

DHS did not respond to our questions about Velez, but it has previously accused her of assaulting an officer. A federal judge has dismissed the charges.

Other citizens also said officers accused them of crimes and suddenly questioned their citizenship — including a man arrested after filming Border Patrol agents break a truck window, and a pregnant woman who tried to stop officers from taking her boyfriend.

The prospects for any significant reckoning over agents’ conduct, even against citizens, are dim. The paths for suing federal agents are even more limited than they are for local police.

Bass and the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach), announced that Congress will open up “a broad investigation” into arrests of U.S. citizens by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, as well as another investigation into immigration raids overall. The announcement was made Monday at a news conference at L.A. City Hall.

“Donald Trump and [Department of Homeland Security Secretary] Kristi Noem are terrorizing immigrants, working people, the people of Los Angeles and of our state every single day,” Garcia said. “They violate the law and they violate the constitution.”

Garcia said that his House committee would investigate “every single brutal misconduct” that immigration authorities have committed in Los Angeles as well as across the country.

Simultaneously, the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations will conduct an investigation into reports of the detention of at least 170 U.S. citizens by immigration authorities, which was reported by ProPublica last week.

“Troublingly, the pattern of U.S. Citizen arrests coincides with an alarming increase in racial profiling — particularly of Latinos — which has been well documented in Los Angeles,” Garcia and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) wrote in a letter to Noem. “In a pattern symptomatic of a disregard for civil rights by DHS, U.S. citizens have faced extended periods of detention.”

For months, agents have roamed the streets of Los Angeles toting guns and chasing down immigrants. The scenes that have played out on the streets — protesters being arrested, immigrants dragged out of their cars — have been repeated in Chicago and other cities with largely Democratic leadership.

Mayor Bass said the arrests of American citizens means that no one in the country is safe.

“This can happen to anyone, to all of us, at any period of time,” she said.

Garcia said that the first hearing of the House committee will be held in Los Angeles and that Angelenos should attend and be heard on immigration enforcement issues.

The congressman did not give a date for the hearing, but said he hoped it would be soon.

In the letter that Garcia and Blumenthal sent to Noem on Monday, the legislators called on the Department of Homeland Security to report the total number of U.S. citizens who have been detained by immigration authorities, as well as how long each individual was detained. They also asked for information regarding the training that CE and Customs and Border Protection agents receive on use of force, among other things.

The total spending by ICE in the small arms category between January 20 and October 18, 2024, was $9,715,843.
Spending by ICE on guns and other weapons this year not only dwarfs spending during the Biden administration but also during Trump’s first term.
Average ICE spending on small arms during Trump’s first four years was about $8.4 million.
More weapons, more violence The surge in spending on ICE weaponry has coincided with a wave of violent incidents by ICE officers.","U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has sharply increased its spending on weapons in 2025, according to an analysis of federal government contracting data by Popular Information. Records from the Federal Procurement Data System reveal that ICE has increased spending on “small arms, ordnance, and ordnance accessories manufacturing” by 700% compared to 2024 levels.

New spending in the small arms category from January 20, 2025, the day Trump was inaugurated, through October 18, totaled $71,515,762. Most of the spending was on guns and armor, but there have also been significant purchases of chemical weapons and “guided missile warheads and explosive components.”

On September 29, 2025, ICE made a $9,098,590 purchase from Geissele Automatics, which sells semi-automatic and automatic rifles. The total spending by ICE in the small arms category between January 20 and October 18, 2024, was $9,715,843.

Spending by ICE on guns and other weapons this year not only dwarfs spending during the Biden administration but also during Trump’s first term. In 2019, for example, ICE spent $5.7 million on small arms through October 18. Average ICE spending on small arms during Trump’s first four years was about $8.4 million.

The data likely understates new spending on weaponry deployed in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, since many other federal agencies beyond ICE have been involved. But it provides a window into how ICE and other agencies are bringing an unprecedented number of high-powered weapons into American cities.

More weapons, more violence

The surge in spending on ICE weaponry has coincided with a wave of violent incidents by ICE officers. Several dangerous situations have been captured on video.

Last month in Illinois, a pastor, Reverend David Black, was shot in the face with a pepper ball by an ICE officer. In another September incident, an ICE officer dropped his gun while violently making an arrest and then pointed it at bystanders.

An ICE officer also allegedly shot a pepper ball at the vehicle of a CBS News Chicago reporter in September. The reporter’s window was open, allowing chemical agents “to engulf the inside of her truck,” which “caused her to vomit.”

In August, US Marine Corps veteran Daryn Herzberg was hospitalized “after being tackled from behind by ICE agents while protesting outside a federal facility in Portland.”

At the time he was attacked, Herzberg was criticizing ICE officers “for firing down on unarmed protesters.” A video shows “an agent grabbing Herzberg by the hair and slamming his face into the ground multiple times while saying, ‘You’re not talking shit anymore are you?’”

In July, an aggressive ICE raid of a California cannabis farm left several workers injured and one dead. Jaime Alanís Garcia, who was not a target of the raid, climbed onto a greenhouse roof to escape the chaos and fell 30 feet to his death.

“What we’re seeing is a general escalation of violence and the use of excessive force by ICE officers,” Ed Yohnka of ACLU Illinois told NPR. Yohnka has filed a lawsuit on behalf of protesters, including Pastor Black, arguing that ICE’s tactics violate their constitutional rights.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!S0mI!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0597981-eec5-4bd2-8b7b-aa85d365bad2_1024x683.jpeg",N,,2025-10-20 18:17:16.441594

“Mahmoud Khalil should never have been targeted or detained by the U.S. government in the first place,” said Justin Mazzola, Deputy Director of Research at Amnesty International USA. “The Trump administration must respect the rights to freedom of expression and assembly and abandon its efforts to punish Mahmoud Khalil for protesting Israel’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza through its relentless pursuit to detain and deport him.

“Targeting and threatening peaceful protesters and their immigration status for speaking out on the human rights of Palestinians, or any other issue, is a clear violation of human rights. This policy is intended to send a chilling warning: that anyone exercising their rights will be subject to arbitrary arrest, detention, and deportation by this administration. The Trump administration must stop it’s targeting of students and activists to instill fear and silence dissent.”

Khalil’s case is not isolated. At least ten other international students or activists were similarly targeted for deportation by the government for their advocacy on Palestinian human rights. This includes Leqaa Kordia, a 32-year-old Palestinian woman, who was targeted for her participation in a 2024 protest outside Columbia University. She has been arbitrarily detained since March 13, 2025. Amnesty International is also calling for her release.

“The Trump administration must stop using threats, intimidation, detention, and other authoritarian practices as political weapons to silence dissent,” said Mazzola. “This cruel attack on human rights must stop and the Trump administration must stop targeting Mahmoud Khalil and end its efforts to deport him.”

Background:

On March 8, 2025, U.S. immigration authorities unlawfully arrested and arbitrarily detained Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident, Palestinian activist and student organizer who recently graduated from Columbia University. Mahmoud was targeted for his role in student protests at Columbia University.

After more than three months of being unjustly detained, on June 20, 2025, Mahmoud was released on bail, and has been reunited with his wife and newborn child as his immigration case proceeds. At that time, U.S. authorities informed him his permanent residency status was revoked and that he was being placed in deportation proceedings.

As Mahmoud’s legal challenges continue, a federal magistrate judge eased his travel restrictions within the U.S. on October 16, 2025, which will allow him to speak publicly on his case.

In the oral argument set for October 21, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals will hear arguments about whether the government can re-detain him as his case proceeds.

Amnesty International has also called on colleges and universities to take steps to ensure their students and faculty can exercise their right to protest in support of Palestinian rights and other issues and is supporting students working to pass a firewall for freedom resolution on their campuses.",https://www.amnestyusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Mahmoud-Khalil-e1756325153526.png,N,,2025-10-20 14:58:01.987340

His attorney filed an appeal in Boston on September 25th, arguing that the circumstances warranted having his immigration case reopened.
On that same day, immigration Judge Michelle Kahan granted his motion to reopen his case, rescinding his 2007 removal order.
Impact on Family In Guatemala, Mejia is living with a family member and says he has fallen into depression.
She told GBH News that the day Mejia called from Guatemala, his deportation came as “a shock”.","Attorneys for a Chelsea man who was just deported are calling his case a miscarriage of justice, saying he should not have been sent back to his native Guatemala while an immigration judge was actively considering his appeal.

Sara Nael, an attorney representing 35-year-old Sergio Ayala Mejia, said her client had a pending appeal to reopen his immigration case and that it was highly unusual for a deportation to proceed when a ruling on an appeal is imminent.

The Department of Homeland Security declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation in the case.

Speaking to GBH News from Guatemala, Mejia said he was first arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on September 17th. He was driving his sister to her job at Market Basket in Revere when they were pulled over by three black SUVs.

He said he was anxious after seeing news reports about aggressive ICE agents and that he complied with their commands.

“The guy said, ‘Sergio, I know who you are. So open the door. Open your windows and open doors. And you know what happens next if you don’t do that,’” he said. “I was in shock — I didn’t even hear what exactly they said but I’m sure they, I’m kind of sure like they said, like, if I have papers basically.”

At one point, an agent told him he had an order for removal for failing to appear at a court hearing years before, which he said didn’t initially make any sense to him.

Mejia was arrested and sent to a detention center in New York, and then on to another one in Louisiana. The conditions at both were inhumane, he said. His attorney filed an appeal in Boston on September 25th, arguing that the circumstances warranted having his immigration case reopened. But within days, as a judge was still considering his appeal, Mejia was deported to Guatemala, leaving behind a partner, an infant, a toddler and a daughter with autism.

Arrest and Deportation

Mejia crossed into the U.S. at the Mexican border in mid-2006 as an unaccompanied minor at the age of 16.

In a signed declaration to the court, Mejia said he was threatened in his home country by MS-13 gang members, who approached him three to four times a week when he was leaving school.

“I didn’t feel safe living in Guatemala, because when I told them I would not join them, they started to threaten and harass me,” he said in the declaration.

After crossing the border, he was detained and released into U.S. He moved in with an uncle in Lynn and provided that address to immigration officials. Without an attorney and not yet knowing English, Mejia attended two immigration hearings with his uncle in 2007. But that year, he was ordered removed in absentia when he didn’t show up to a third immigration court date that he now says he didn’t know about.

Attorneys argue in court documents that his failure to appear as a 17-year-old should be “imputed” on his uncle, who Mejia accuses of withholding immigration documents from him and abusing him.

The motion to re-open his case was filed on September 26th and cited “exceptional circumstances beyond his control” as a youth. His attorneys also asked for a stay of his removal from the U.S. and filed an asylum claim while he was detained.

Still, he was deported on October 1st, with little notice and no ability to call anyone. Mejia was led onto a plane he described as packed with people, including a family with children.

On that same day, immigration Judge Michelle Kahan granted his motion to reopen his case, rescinding his 2007 removal order. But by that point, Mejia was already on his way to Guatemala.

“The day he was removed from the United States was the day it was granted, which makes things even worse,” said Nael, his attorney. “Now this realization was like, they’re probably already on notice that it was granted and they still wrongfully removed him.”

Nael said she has never seen a client deported while a motion to reopen a case is still pending. She said he has no criminal record or interaction with police here or abroad.

“This is technically going against the client’s due process rights. They should have waited to see if the judge was going to grant or deny the motion to reopen instead of just removing him out of state without a decision,” she said.

U.S. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, whose district includes Chelsea, issued a statement calling for Mejia’s immediate return. She called the deportation “a brazen violation of his right to due process and another damning example of the Trump administration trampling on the constitutional rights of Massachusetts residents.”

Pressley indicated that the federal shutdown was complicating her ability to get more information about the case due to the closure of ICE’s congressional relations office.

Impact on Family

In Guatemala, Mejia is living with a family member and says he has fallen into depression. He had to take a bus to another town to borrow a phone with a signal to talk to GBH News.

“I don’t know what’s going to happen with my kids. I’m far away from them, like I miss them every day, every minute,” he said.

Mejia is worried about the strain on his wife, who must now take care of the children but also find a way to pay the bills.

“She’s doing really bad — worse and worse. I’m afraid that something can happen to her and the kids because I can hear her like … in depression, it’s the pressure,” he said.

His partner, who GBH News is not naming due to her own deportation fears, said “every day has been difficult — my oldest can’t be alone at home, and I’m dedicated to taking care of her. I think … what am I going to do with three children?”

Mejia has a 3-year-old, Liam, and an infant, Ailany, who was just over two weeks old when he was detained. He also has been the long-time parent to his partner’s 14-year-old daughter, Ashley, who was abandoned by her biological father as a baby. She was recently diagnosed with autism, according to medical records shared with GBH News.

“The kids keep asking ‘Why isn’t dad coming? When will be home?’” she said.

The partner told GBH News that the impact of Mejia’s deportation on the kids has been devastating. Liam won’t eat much, and Ashley is afraid to go to school, worried her mom will be gone when she returns.

Her educational records from Chelsea High School show that she requires speech therapy, motor skill training, and a “high level of adult support and supervision.”

Mejia’s aunt, Julia Ayala, has been driving down from Lynn to help care for the children, and bring food. She told GBH News that the day Mejia called from Guatemala, his deportation came as “a shock”.

“I started crying, because I knew he was out of the country, it’s hard to come back, and he has children,” Ayala said. “They depend on him for everything.”

Mejia was working full time as a painter to pay all of the family’s expenses. Julia tried speaking to their landlord to delay paying the rent with little luck, but family members chipped in for October rent.

Records shared with GBH News show that Mejia has paid taxes for at least the last ten years. A number of support letters, including from colleagues, friends and family called him a “role model,” an “honest man, trustworthy” and that he works “tirelessly to support his partner, toddler and newborn baby.”

A Mass General Hospital-Chelsea Healthcare Center doctor who cares for Ashley also wrote to the government saying he plays “an important role in her ongoing care and is essential to supporting her overall health.”",https://cdn.grove.wgbh.org/dims4/default/bc95f31/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1080x567+0+69/resize/1200x630!/quality/70/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-gbh.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F55%2Fec%2F78c95bb548f1b0bac8766652d04f%2Folder-kids-and-sergio.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:58:29.454451

Castro also suggests people think about selling their property or transferring their financial assets to someone they trust in Chicago.
“We will explain to them it’s going to be a difficult situation.” Many Mexican immigrants have built a life in the Chicago area despite their immigration status.
They tell her, after working hard for so many years in Chicago, “It’s OK to take a break.” Castro tells her that seeking emotional support is important.
The Mexican Consulate in Chicago did not respond to questions about the repatriation process.","Manuel Castro says his phone has been ringing nonstop with calls from people in the Chicago area who want to return to Mexico rather than risk being caught up in an aggressive immigration raid, sent to detention and deported.

“They are starting to see the violence where ICE agents are coming to [homes] without warrants, where they break your [car] windows, basically they are terrorizing [people],” says Castro, a coordinator with Coalicion de Migrantes Mexicanos, a grassroots organization that advocates for Mexican immigrants. “They are starting to say this is not OK. I’m done.”

But the decision to go back to Mexico after years — or in some cases, decades — in the United States isn’t as simple as packing up a suitcase and buying a plane ticket. It’s why Castro has been hosting free online workshops to help people understand and navigate the practical steps and emotional aspects of starting over.

Castro begins the workshop by telling participants to slow down and make sure they have a detailed plan. This includes thinking about everything from their finances to obtaining the right documents they’ll need to access basic services in Mexico. It also means getting familiar with Mexico’s cumbersome repatriation process.

“If you want to enroll your child in school, for example, you must prove that he or she is your child,” he tells the workshop participants. They’ll also need to fill out paperwork and obtain various ID cards if they want to be able to work, access health care, pay taxes or simply open a bank account.

He recommends parents with American-born children apply to get them dual citizenship. This makes it easier to navigate the Mexican public education system, he explains.

Castro also suggests people think about selling their property or transferring their financial assets to someone they trust in Chicago. People relying on savings when they return should create a budget, he adds.

“Talk with your family, talk with your friends, try to make an assessment of how much money you have,” Castro advises. He recalls some people telling him, “‘I don’t have anybody over there, and I have just a little bit of savings — $5,000 to $10,000.’”

He said that’s not a lot of money, especially if people don’t have a support network back home. “We will explain to them it’s going to be a difficult situation.”

Many Mexican immigrants have built a life in the Chicago area despite their immigration status. Chicago is home to 227,715 people who were born in Mexico, according to census data analyzed by WBEZ, although this is likely an undercount.

But this year, more Mexicans than any other nationality were deported from the Midwest under President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, a WBEZ analysis of data from the Deportation Data Project found.

That’s something participants in Castro’s workshop want to avoid.

“I’ve already shipped everything to Mexico,” a participant who identified herself as Luz said in Spanish during the session with 28 others. Luz says she lived and worked in the United States for decades but is now planning to leave in November. “I’ve sent blenders, computers, printers, TVs.”

But she still had many questions about what else she needed to do in preparation for returning to her native city of Veracruz.

And she is feeling the stress of this decision. She says her adult children are helping her prepare emotionally for the difficult transition.

“They tell me, ‘Mom, we are all grown up now, and it’s going to be different back there,’” she says.

They have reassured her that they will help support her. They tell her, after working hard for so many years in Chicago, “It’s OK to take a break.”

Castro tells her that seeking emotional support is important. He also urges Luz and others to get better informed about a new program established by the Mexican government in January this year called México te abraza, or “Mexico welcomes you.” It’s aimed at assisting deported and repatriated Mexicans during their reintegration, with a focus on access to basic services, economic stability and social inclusion.

But some Mexicans who’ve already made the decision to leave voluntarily say the process of getting any support from the Mexican government can be confusing and complicated.

Christian Vázquez says it’s been hard to find clear, accurate or consistent information about the repatriation process, either online or through the Mexican Consulate in Chicago.

Vázquez has lived in Chicago for 20 years. He and his wife have two children.

But he says the anti-immigrant rhetoric created a lot of anxiety, especially for his kids.

“They lived with the worry that at any moment something could happen to us due to immigration issues.”

Vázquez’s wife and kids are already back in Mexico. The couple made the decision to return before running the risk of being abruptly separated by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Vázquez is still in Chicago, closing that chapter before he, too, goes back to Mexico.

The Mexican Consulate in Chicago did not respond to questions about the repatriation process.

In the last few weeks, Castro has spoken with about 50 people. As devastating as it can be to uproot a life and leave a country that’s been home for years, he expects he’ll be hearing from even more people making this difficult decision.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9fca9cb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8192x4676+0+0/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F62%2F1a%2F6c9eebf94c33b39de8630c7a4a69%2F3d8a5346.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:58:17.701818

The ICE building outside Chicago has been the site of confrontations as protesters have come out to decry immigration arrests.","Trump administration officials are defending themselves in court as a federal judge demands explanations for their response to tense protests against immigration enforcement actions in Chicago.

Monday’s hearing began with a promise Customs and Border Protection is taking seriously the judge’s order for its agents to wear and use body-worn cameras: Every CBP agent on duty in Chicago – more than 200 – has a body camera and knows they are required to use it, Deputy Incident Commander Kyle Harvick said.

US District Judge Sara Ellis then calmly peppered Harvick with questions about how agents working on Operation Midway Blitz are trained and respond to protesters in and around Chicago, the latest target of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown. The hearing was called in response to news reports suggesting agents were violating her order to avoid less-lethal munitions and tear gas.

Ellis, an Obama appointee, initially had called for the interim head of Chicago’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office, Russell Hott, to appear Monday “to explain to me why I am seeing images of tear gas being deployed and reading reports that there were no warnings given before it was deployed out in the field.” After seeming to agree to her request, the Department of Homeland Security told Ellis on Friday that Hott had left the city to return to his permanent job as field operations director in Washington, DC.

The Trump administration instead offered Harvick and ICE Deputy Field Office Director Shawn Byers, and Ellis agreed – as long as the officials would disclose how the agencies are deploying riot control tactics against protesters and journalists.

“I’m looking at it from the outside,” Ellis said in court Monday.

The judge last week added mandatory body-worn cameras to her earlier restraining order, saying it appeared agents were not warning demonstrators before deploying tear gas and firing pepper balls on them.

“That’s the nice thing about body cameras is that they pick up events before the triggering event happens,” Ellis said then.

Operation Midway Blitz is Trump’s recent ICE deployment across Chicagoland, yielding more than 1,000 arrests of migrants across Illinois between September 8 and October 3, DHS said.

Harvick on Monday reiterated the White House’s denials of news coverage of tear gas used on protesters without warning in a recent demonstration in Chicago’s Albany Park neighborhood, although he acknowledged he had not seen it personally. A government attorney last week said the judge was relying on “one-sided and selectively edited media reports.”

Judge wants answers

Ellis early this month issued a sweeping order restricting agents’ crowd control tactics, use of force and actions against journalists documenting protests in Chicago. During last week’s hearing, she said she had concerns about her order being followed.

The judge indicated recent news reports had led her to believe the Trump administration may not have been following her instructions.

“I’m not happy,” Ellis said in a stern tone. “I’m really not happy.”

“At least from what I’m seeing, I’m having serious concerns that my order’s being followed,” she said from the bench.

The judge originally required all agents to wear cameras. But her order doesn’t require them if they’re undercover, not in uniform or exempt by Customs and Border Protection, ICE or DHS policy.

Federal officials claimed Harvick would be the most appropriate person to testify after DHS determined it was “mostly, if not entirely” Border Patrol personnel who were involved in recent tear gas incidents, CNN affiliate WTTW reported.

During a telephone hearing that day, the judge said she had no desire to “micromanage” who the government presents at Monday’s hearing but that she’s been “very clear” she wants to hear from someone who can fill her in on “what’s been going on over the last week,” the station reported.

“Whoever comes has to be able to answer these questions,” Ellis said, according to WTTW. “And if the government chooses … to bring someone in and that person’s answers to me are ‘I don’t know’ and ‘It’s not my responsibility’ … then we’ll come in Tuesday with a different person until I get the answers I want.”

Protests continue at Broadview

This weekend marked the first since a fence was ordered removed at the Broadview ICE facility, the center of anti-ICE protests in the Chicago area.

The ICE building outside Chicago has been the site of confrontations as protesters have come out to decry immigration arrests.

Over 100 protesters gathered outside the facility Friday morning, with Broadview police officers, Cook County sheriff’s deputies and Illinois State Police gathered to keep demonstrators in the area designated for them. The protest, though loud, has remained calm. As of 5 p.m. CT, 15 arrests had been made, the Cook County Sheriff’s Office said.

At least 15 people were arrested on Saturday in connection with another demonstration at the facility, the agency said.","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2241106678.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-10-20 14:58:25.888606

“Snatching people off the street is un-American,” said one marcher, referring to Trump’s ICE agents and their violent seizures of people—migrant or not, citizen or not.
To chants of “No More Kings!” he responded “President Trump, we don’t want you or any other king to rule us.
Trump’s ICE agents previously arrested Newark, N.J., Mayor Raz Baraka, Rep. Lamonica McIver, D-N.J. and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.
GOP President Trump all but openly backs Cuomo.","WASHINGTON—A record seven million people turned out nationwide October 18 in some 2,600 “No Kings Day” protests against would-be dictator, President Donald Trump, targeting his attacks on democracy, his attacks on immigrants and many of his domestic policies including the trashing of healthcare for millions.

In addition to the 7 million pouring into the streets of the nation’s cities and towns from coast to coast and in Alaska and Hawaii there were hundreds of thousands more marching in solidarity with them around the globe including in cities from Stockholm, Sweden to Sao Paolo Brazil.

Key causes included demands that Trump stop trampling on the U.S. Constitution, especially its First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech and his ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents’ violent and vicious kidnapping and disappearances of immigrants and others grabbed off the streets and at workplaces. Another major concern of the millions out on the streets was the impact of the Trump-GOP’s megadollar giveaway to billionaires and corporations, to be paid for by massive cuts in health care.

Across the country many thousands are already receiving notices of huge increases in their health care premiums due to refusal of the GOP to come out in support of continuing subsidies that keep down the costs for people.

Large contingents of unionists marched, notably in D.C., where the Government Employees, who have particular reason to do so, urged their 325,000 members nationwide to hit the streets. The union represents—or represented—more than a million federal workers until Trump unilaterally trashed their collective bargaining agreements. He has called federal workers, and AFGE by name, enemies, too.

The marches and rallies were peaceful and positive, giving the lie to GOP leaders who predicted it would be a turnout of people who “hate America.” There were no arrests even in cities where the turnout was well into the hundreds of thousands.

Only in Los Angeles was there a reported arrest of “nearly 100 agitators” according to the police who said those arrested were not at all part of the main demonstration of hundreds of thousands. The LAPD tweeted that the No Kings Day demonstrators “were peaceful people exercising their First Amendment right of free speech.”

The massive peaceful outpouring across the nation contrasted sharply with the violent attack on January 6, 2021 by Trump supporters who trashed the Capitol, tried to kill the Vice President and the House Majority Leader and attacked the police with five people eventually ending up dead.

New York City marshalled its police force for marches which drew, according to MSNBC, at least 400.000. There were no arrests at all.

Trump-supporting Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., activated the National Guard to cover protests in his state’s D.C. suburbs. They had nothing to do.

The more than 200,000 people who jammed D.C.’s Pennsylvania Avenue from curb to curb and from the White House to the Capitol turned that march into what the Associated Press labeled “a giant block party”—with bands, balloons, air horns and people costumed as Trump “toads” or as the Statue of Liberty.

In Chicago, which has been the site of some of the most vicious attacks by ICE, including landing on top of an apartment building on the South Side with Blackhawk attack helicopters and dragging residents out into the streets in the middle of the night, it seemed that the entire city was involved in the demonstration.

In Hyde Park, which is several miles south of the main rally location at Grant Park, at 8 a.m. in the morning the sidewalks were full of people headed to the Metra Station in the neighborhood in what looked like feeder marches to the main event. Chicagoans young and old, carried their homemade cardboard signs as they poured into the Metra stations already overflowing with people headed to the march.

Immigrants on the South Side from Honduras, Nigeria and the Philippines, living near the apartment building that was raided, went to the demonstration. One immigrant said “I haven’t felt better since Trump took over again, seeing now how many people are turning out to oppose what he is doing to us.”

Hundreds of police benignly looked on at the peaceful crowds in states and locations where National Guard troops were called in.. Some National Guards from “red states,” previously provided to the Nation’s Capital by Republican GOP governors, having nothing to do, gave differently abled people rides in golf-cart-like vehicles down a dedicated middle lane reserved for emergency vehicles and police patrols.

In contrast to the prior week, when Trump and other Republicans fumed at the coming rally-goers, calling them “communists” and “antifa” and saying they “hate America,” GOP lawmakers—also a target of many of the protesters—laid low. There are splits in MAGA now as vulnerable Republican legislators become increasingly fearful that their stance against healthcare may endanger their reelection prospects as will the GOP shutdown of the federal government. Millions of demonstrators, most of who are registered voters, does little to reduce the fear of vulnerable Republicans.

Trump himself retreated to his Mar-a-Lago Florida estate, where he hosted a million-dollar-a-plate corporate fundraiser. His staff sarcastically posted an artificial intelligence image on Trump’s social media channel of him wearing a cape and a crown.

The crown predominated among the crowds, the signs and the slogans, and was even spelled out by a human crowd declaring “No Kings” on Ocean Beach in San Francisco.

Like prior anti-Trump protests, some marchers linked Trump to his corporate backers or to the capitalist system he not only symbolizes but is busily enriching through sweetheart deals, rollbacks of regulations, the federal shutdown, intimidation of dissent and a $4.5 trillion 10-year tax cut for the 1%, paid for by the rest of us through losing medical care.

Keynote speaker Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ind-Vt., addressing the D.C. crowd, emphasized all those things.

“This is about a handful of the wealthiest people on earth, who by their insatiable greed have hijacked our economy and our political system. These are the same billionaires who funded his [Trump’s] campaign,” the senator said.

“Billionaires are the minority destroying America,” one member of the Baltimore Teachers Union/AFT told People’s World. Her union enthusiastically co-sponsored the march. Union President Randi Weingarten, a New York City civics teacher, was one of its prime advocates.

“There was ICE in our school in Highlandtown,” the Baltimore fourth-grade teacher continued. “Two masked men attempted to grab a couple of my kids. They [the kids] got away.” Added her companion, another fourth-grade teacher, but of the Washington, D.C., Teachers Union/AFT Local 6: “Teaching with ICE” in the city “is emotionally wrenching.

“The kids are coming with a lot of horror stories at home. They’ve lost their parents.”

“You have patients” in health care facilities, notably nursing homes, “who don’t have families and who get Medicaid” to pay for their care, a Service Employees 1199NE member named Reeba said in an interview. When they lose Medicaid, because of that tax cut for the rich, “What happens?” she asks.

“Who will take them in? They’re thinking about money,” she said of Trump and the Republicans, who jammed that Medicaid cut through on party-line votes in Congress. “We’re thinking about our patients.”

Individual marchers and a top Los Angeles union leader had their own takes on Trump and the carnage he’s caused, to the Constitution and the country, since he reoccupied the White House on January 20.

“America has no kings and working Americans will not stand by as a wannabe dictator wages war on our rights and our democracy,” David Green, president and executive director of L.A.’s Service Employees Local 721, told local media.

“Enough is enough. We will stop this authoritarianism in its tracks and work to revitalize and enhance our democracy, our rights, and our nation. We will not accept a regime that aims to put the interests of billionaires ahead of our families, workers and communities.”

“Where do we begin?” asked one D.C. marcher named Ken, who toted the Communications Workers’ banner during the D.C. march. “The whole immigration thing and the human rights umbrella. Just today, a man was abducted” by ICE “in front of his three kids.

“He had his green card on him,” showing he’s a permanent U.S. resident. “But he was thrown to the ground and was going to be sent to a San Francisco detention center.”

And Trump and his MAGA backers turn “the bathroom issue”—which bathrooms transgender people can use–into making them into traitors, Ken added. That’s led Pride At Work and the AFL-CIO, among many unions which endorsed the march, “to train people on what to do if they’re detained.”

Under Trump, “Families are told how to parent their children, doctors are forced to ignore their oaths, and the government is ripping apart families and hurting our people,” Jay Brown, a transgender person and deputy director of the Human Rights Campaign, told the D.C. crowd. Trump and the

Republicans are “cutting funding for HIV treatment, banning our books, and firing teachers who use a student’s nickname.”

Chants were common and often repeated: “No Trump, No KKK, No Fascist U.S.A” “This is what Democracy looks like” “Free DC No ICE” and so on. Many of the signs were individual and inventive in their criticism of Trump, his GOP henchmen and his government. One D.C. march, which came down from uptown to join the main march, was themed “Replace the regime.”

Celia, a 10th grader from Yorktown High School in suburban Arlington, Va., summed up all the damage Trump has done to the country in just nine months with her sign: “Nuclear waste is more stable than America under Trump,” it read.

Celia got the idea while doing her chemistry homework, where the students learned about the impact—and the longevity—of radioactive waste.

“It’s so unstable, and it’s just like Trump. We don’t know what’s going to happen next,” she said,

Signs and marchers drew pointed comparisons, especially when discussing ICE.

“Snatching people off the street is un-American,” said one marcher, referring to Trump’s ICE agents and their violent seizures of people—migrant or not, citizen or not. Her sign read: “Immigrants—we get the job done. No to ICE.”

“1776, 1865, 1945 No Kings, No Confederates, No Fascists,” read one sign, referring to the Declaration of Independence, the Union victory in the U.S. Civil War and the joint Soviet-U.S.-U.K. victory over Hitler’s Germany and militaristic Japan in World War II.

Jenny, a New Zealand native who’s been in the U.S., since she was 11 in 1971, captured the ethos of the crowds, prefacing it by telling People’s World she still holds a New Zealand passport.

“We were able to vote and have freedom of choice for our bodies,” she said, highlighting two of the issues that brought the crowds into the streets: Trump-GOP plans to restrict and outlaw abortion and to impose massive restrictions, in law, in intimidation and in practice, against voting rights.

“I have watched this country from the first Trump administration. It’s ugly. It’s a rollback to the 1950s.” Trump cares “only about skin color,” she added, referring to his ICE agents/thugs and their targeted arrests of brown-skinned people. “I’m glad I have an escape hatch” to return to her homeland.

“’I’ve been protesting for 20 years,” said D.C. resident, Maggie, one of many who carried a “Sic Semper Tyrannis” sign. That’s the Latin motto of the Virginia state seal, “Thus always to tyrants.”

“This government is overreaching and infringing on our rights, and I’m always going to stand up to faceless agents of the state,” Maggie said. Trump’s ICE agents wear masks to conceal their identities.

“Sic Semper Tyrannis” was also what pro-Confederate actor John Wilkes Booth shouted from the Ford’s Theater stage after murdering “the tyrant” President Abraham Lincoln 160 years ago. For the marchers, Trump is the tyrant.

Unlike past marches, this No Kings Day protest also drew significant political support, even from prior reluctant lawmakers, notably Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. He marched in the Big Apple—a turnaround from May when he drew sharp and justified criticism from the Democratic left wing for caving in to Trump on a key law to keep the government running.

This time, Schumer and other Senate Democrats are holding out, and the money’s run out. Their price is restoring all the health care cuts. “Essential workers” such as airport screeners, are toiling without pay. Others have been sent home.

Trump’s Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, a notorious union hater, has already fired 4,000 of that group without cause and in defiance of court orders. He schemes to fire thousands more, with Trump’s blessing, during and after the closure.

Sen. Sanders keynoted the addresses to the D.C. marchers and he was the sole prominent speaker to link Trump to income inequality, class divisions and forcing people to live paycheck to paycheck. “They’re the worst government in modern history,” Sanders told the D.C. crowd. To chants of “No More Kings!” he responded “President Trump, we don’t want you or any other king to rule us.

“It is dangerous to have more power in his hands and in the hands of his fellow oligarchs. We have a president who threatens to arrest mayors and governors” who speak against him, Sanders continued.

“And we have a president who wants no criticism of him and who undermines the 1st Amendment to the Constitution—the very foundation of our democracy.” That amendment includes freedom of speech and “the right of the people to peaceably assemble and address the government for redress of their grievances,” which the seven million marchers nationwide did.

Trump threatens to arrest Govs. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., and J.B. Pritzker, D-Ill., and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. All reiterated slams at Trump at marches in California and Chicago. Trump’s ICE agents previously arrested Newark, N.J., Mayor Raz Baraka, Rep. Lamonica McIver, D-N.J. and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif.

The Chicago protests were peaceful, too, even at the ICE detention center in suburban Broadview, scene of raucous but peaceful demonstrations in recent weeks, and ICE arrests there of protesters and even reporters—now stopped by a federal court injunction.

“History will judge us by where we choose to stand right now, today,” Pritzker declared to people gathered in Grant Park downtown. “Future generations will ask: ‘What did we do when fellow human beings face persecution? When our rights were being abridged? When our Constitution was under attack?’ They’ll want to know whether we stood up or we stayed silent. Resistance starts with refusing to normalize cruelty.

“An attack on free speech, on immigrants’ rights, on due process is an attack on everyone’s rights,” Pritzker said. “It means understanding that we’re either building a society based on human dignity or one based on domination.”

Gesturing to the large crowd he addressed in Atlanta, Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., told CNN: “In this moment, in which we are seeing a president and an administration arrogating to himself power that doesn’t belong to him, our message is very clear. This is not about the people in power, it’s about the power in the people.”

The senator said Trump tries to “weaponize despair,” but is “getting his answer today.”

Many progressive demonstrators in downtown D.C. didn’t let the Democrats off the hook either. They faulted the party for failing to oppose Trump’s tyranny early enough and strongly enough, singling out Schumer in particular for blame for caving in to an earlier Trump-GOP temporary money bill that kept the government going through midnight on September 30, when the partial shutdown began.

Some of those interviewed said the party needs new blood and tough leadership, calling for senior Dems—Sanders excepted—to step aside and let younger and tougher leaders take over.

Some mentioned specific races where the Democratic establishment pushes an older candidate, such as Maine Gov. Janet Mills, 77—who has stood up to Trump—over the younger progressive military veteran and oyster farmer Graham Platner. Both want to unseat “moderate” veteran GOP Sen. Susan Collins.

Scott, a D.C. resident, discussed that Maine race and Schumer’s refusal to endorse New York City Democratic Mayoral nominee Zohran Momdani, a 33-year-old Democratic Socialist running on an extremely progressive platform. Mamdani faces disgraced pro-corporate ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67. Cuomo lost the primary and now runs as an independent—backed by millions of dollars in campaign cash, including from Wall Street Republicans. GOP President Trump all but openly backs Cuomo.

“By and large, the Democratic Party is also bought by corporate interests, and they fail to stand up for the average working people,” Scott told NBC, referring to Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.

In response to operations employed by immigration enforcement, Los Angeles Unified School District (L.A.U.S.D.) has expanded their policies in order to maintain the safety of marginalized students.

The District’s efforts to revise protective policy occurred after multiple hostile interactions between ICE agents and L.A.U.S.D. students, according to L.A.U.S.D. superintendent Alberto Carvalho during a press conference at Edward R. Roybal Learning Center August 11.

Incidents Over the Summer

Early this August, a 15-year old L.A.U.S.D. student was held at gun-point and briefly detained by ICE before eventually being released. This encounter occurred in front of Arleta High School, prompting widespread alarm and panic among L.A.U.S.D. students and families.

Another incident occurred when Benjamin Guerrero-Cruz, an 18-year old senior at Reseda Charter High School, was arrested and detained by ICE agents while walking his dog. Although arrested in California, he was taken to Arizona without his family’s knowledge, and was planned to be later transported to Louisiana. According to the Los Angeles Times, he has been brought back to California, where he is still detained.

An anonymous Venice student expressed frustration at the rising climate of fear.

“Why should I feel afraid or have to be hyper-aware of my surroundings when I’m so young?” said the student.

According to principal Yavonka Hairston-Truitt, the decrease of schools being considered as sanctuary spaces is disappointing.

“There used to be a time when schools were safe havens…and it’s been really heartbreaking to see that transition,” she said.

“Schools should be exempt from this matter. I wish we weren’t even having to have a conversation because it wasn’t even a consideration in the first place.”

Most recently, the front lawn was closed off during lunch Tuesday due to the presence of immigration enforcement near the school.

“It has been verified that a car wash, within 1.2 miles from our school, had an ICE raid where three to five employees were removed from their work and the car wash was closed,” said Hairston-Truitt.

L.A.U.S.D. Responses

The rising urgency to protect students has prompted action from L.A.U.S.D.

During a press conference in early August, L.A.U.S.D. superintendent Alberto Carvalho informed families that they will not allow any federal officials to enter school grounds without a warrant.

Since then, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 49 which has turned this policy into a state-wide law.

To further protect students, many district bus lines have been rerouted. Additionally, new routes have been established to shield students from possible immigration enforcement activity within the city, and to reassure parents who worry about their children being out in public.

Spanish teacher Dr. Angela Fajardo, a co-magnet coordinator who oversees bus coordination, also explained that bus accessibility has increased for Venice students.

“Prior to this, the buses were mainly for students who were joining the World Language Magnet or STEMM,” she said. “Because of this change in policy, now the bus is available for all.” To request a bus with a route that best fits a student’s needs, call 1800-LA-BUSES.

In addition, L.A.U.S.D. is emphasizing the accessibility of their Virtual Academy, which is an online alternative to in-person schooling.

Superintendent Carvalho spoke about the increase of online enrollment at the start of the 2025-2026 school year.

“There’s nothing like face-to-face education,” he said, “but we understand that for some families facing a level of fear that is unacceptable for a child to experience, that virtual education may in fact be the preferred modality. We are here to support.”

L.A.U.S.D. has also launched “We Are One,” a campaign that “formalizes and amplifies the District’s efforts to cultivate welcoming learning environments for all students.”

This campaign includes hosting weekly workshops to inform students and their families about immigration rights, by covering important topics such as education, housing, and more.

These workshops, which began August 22, are alongside other online resources that the District has been providing to inform and support LAUSD families, such as the monthly parent and family webinars.

L.A.U.S.D. has also created the Family Preparedness Care Package, which provides resources such as information on legal rights for immigrant families and students to access.

Action at Venice High School

While the District has been further developing their policies and distributing resources, Venice High School has been taking its own initiative to protect students.

Multiple teachers at Venice have been volunteering in community safety patrols dedicated to keeping an eye out for immigration enforcement agents, as well as establishing a welcoming presence around school in order to facilitate a safe environment.

Fajardo commented on the patrols, saying, paraphrase here

“I am very proud of our teachers at Venice who have proactively taken on the patrolling really early. They’re probably here at seven, because I arrive at around 7:30 and they’re already here and patrolling.”

According to an anonymous teacher, these safety teams at Venice were initiated by teachers who attended workshops and trainings with Union Del Barrio—a non-governmental organization (NGO)—which has helped educate teachers on how to effectively protect their students. The teacher said these meetings have also been “very much focused on how to apply your rights to any given situation.”

The trainings have taught community members and teachers how to identify immigration enforcement vehicles, as well as the appropriate procedures when encountering immigration agents.

“Union Del Barrio gives resources to set up patrols and how to protect each other,” the teacher said. “Teachers and parents have come together to walk around school in the mornings to make sure there is safe passage for students and families.”

Union del Barrio hosts both in person and online meetings, which has allowed teachers from all states to join the training sessions.

“There’s teachers from all across the country that are attending these,” the anonymous teacher said.

Fajardo also acknowledged the responsibility that Venice has to the student population as a whole: “We have students not only that come to Venice, but we also have students from the Venice community that go to other schools.”

This model of community safety as well as rapid response networks have been established across the city, a direct effect of Union Del Barrio’s efforts to create a city-wide movement to protect Angelenos against immigration enforcement.

Furthermore, the school does not keep any records on a student’s legal status, which keeps students’ citizenship status confidential and prevents immigration enforcement from being able to obtain such information from the school.

“When a student enrolls here, we ask for certain information – proof of residency for example – but we don’t keep records on their citizenship status,” said Community Schools Coordinator Brian Bleser. “Even if ICE agents or immigration agents ask for that information, we don’t keep that type of information.

Hairston-Truitt also said that “Venice ensures that our staff, our families, and our students are aware of their rights.”

Anytime L.A.U.S.D.’s We Are One Campaign releases an update, “I send it back out to families… as soon as I am aware,” she said.

According to Hairston-Truitt, one of the best ways to keep students safe is to “train and help staff understand how to support their students in the classroom, because if everyone is prepared, it can increase the feelings of safety, especially when you feel like your teachers understand.”

“I’ll do everything to the fullest extent of my ability to support and maintain students’ and their family’s safety,” said Hairston-Truitt. “I am completely aware of the impact it has on multiple communities in LA.”

Student Walkouts and Experiences

Teachers and staff haven’t been the only ones to take action and respond to increasing immigration enforcement activity. In February, Venice students participated in the school walkouts against ICE.

Senior Marina Aguayo, a student organizer, said students were concerned about “the safety of immigrants in our country.”

As the Trump administration escalated the deportation process, mass immigration enforcement raids began and separated families, confirming Aguayo’s and other students’ anxieties.

“The walkout was about voicing students’ opinions on current political matters,” Aguayo said.

Aguayo expressed the need for clearer communication between the school and its students regarding immigration enforcement policies.

“I want to make sure they make it clear to students when they are safe and acknowledge when they aren’t safe.

“Although L.A.U.S.D.’s response could’ve been greater…The walkout was positive overall…L.A.U.S.D. did see it, and that was the point.”

Another student organizer, senior Gilbert Lopez said, “It helped start a chain of movement.”

“Student movements have the capability to create tangible change, but it isn’t something that will happen after the first try”, said Lopez. “It is something that should be carried on…To keep the movement alive for future students, collaboration with each other is necessary.”

A Historical Context for Current Events

Last year’s walkouts were not the first time L.A.U.S.D. has witnessed student-led protests. In the 1960s, Chicano students mobilized to fight against discrimination within schools.

These protests were known as the East L.A. Walkouts and paved the way for numerous changes within the school system to address systemic inequities. Along with numerous East LA students, the movement included Venice High School students, and this legacy of activism can still be seen through present-day student action.

“Students are the reason why we have these social justice movements,” Social studies teacher Isabel Cortes said. “When they see an injustice, when they’re fired up, when they create a collective to fight and organize, when they create solidarity movements with unions and with educators and with community members and with parents… that is what’s powerful.”

Cortes offers a hopeful outlook for our collective future.

“Resistance and the fight for liberation is still here, and it’s so beautiful- and the world is watching…There are changes happening and we need to keep fighting, because the struggle for liberation, the struggle for peaceful migration, the struggle for human rights; everything is intertwined,” she said.

“Migration is a human process,” said Cortes. “It’s part of who we are.”",https://veniceoarsman.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ICE-Photo-Oliver-Mars-Cornelius.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:01:50.892175

“One thing I hate is bullies,” said Brent, a regular at the weekly protests who was also in Monona for its No Kings protest over the weekend.

In Monona, a suburban city of around 9,000 residents just outside the capital city of Madison, around 400 people lined one of the busiest corners of the main street of the city. Protesters held signs in opposition to President Donald Trump, took part in cross-street chanting, and encouraged vehicles to honk their car horns in support — which dozens of cars did.

While some members of the administration and other allies of the president have tried to suggest these protests are unpatriotic, the residents here would largely disagree with that charge. Monona hosts the largest (and longest-running) annual Memorial Day parade in the entire state of Wisconsin, and its Fourth of July Festival regularly draws in crowds more than five times its population size every year.

The street corner where Saturday’s demonstration took place has also been the site of a protest against the Trump administration every Tuesday for most of his second term so far.

“One thing I hate is bullies,” said Brent, a regular at the weekly protests who was also in Monona for its No Kings protest over the weekend. “The Trump regime, they’re the worst of the worst.”

“I’m here to counteract that [bullying from Trump],” he added, “and try to bring joy to other people and get them involved.”

About a 30-minute drive south of Monona, in Stoughton, a crowd of around 500 protesters marched up and down both sides of its main street. Although the protest disrupted traffic, most who were held up by their march honked their car horns in support and gave thumbs-ups as they drove past.

Barbara, a participant in Stoughton’s No Kings protest, indicated that she felt Trump was “a big, big mistake for our country,” and that it was important “to stand up for what we believe in.”

Specifically, Barbara indicated she opposed Trump’s anti-immigration policies.

“I don’t like the idea that he’s sending ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] in and taking people without any warrant, they don’t get any trial or have lawyers or anything,” she said.

Craig and Laura, a married couple who had traveled to a No Kings protest in Delavan, also expressed frustration with the president’s refusal to abide by constitutional norms.

Around 1,500 participants took part in this small city’s No Kings protest. Located in Walworth County in the southeastern corner of the state, it is perhaps an unlikely spot for a demonstration against Trump — the county voted with 60.5 percent support for Trump in the 2024 presidential election (more than 10 points higher than the rate the president won across the state overall). Delavan is also the hometown of far right former Gov. Scott Walker.

Despite this, participants expressed outrage with the current administration’s actions, especially its refusal to follow checks and balances.

“The Constitution is not being abided by. He thinks he’s above it,” Laura said about Trump. “I just kind of see him as being a fake and a con.”

Craig also derided Trump’s “vision” for the country, saying that he believes deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller’s intended “direction” for the administration is “not best for this nation.”

But Craig also said it was “great” to see hundreds of people from a traditionally Republican area coming out to express opposition to the president.

“I guarantee you, there are people in this group that are Republicans that have said, ‘enough is enough,'” he added.

Laura also noticed that, since the first No Kings protest they had attended in June, participation seems to have gone up. “You can see the numbers increasing,” she said, with her husband nodding in agreement.

Later on Saturday, a much larger protest took place in Madison, the state’s capital and its second-largest city. Demonstrators held signs in support of LGBTQ rights, expressing solidarity with Palestinians in the face of Israel’s genocide, and affirming the right of immigrants to live in the U.S. and be afforded due process.

Speakers at the event condemned the Trump administration’s attacks on the media and free press, and encouraged attendees not to give in to the temptation of complacency.

John Nichols, executive editor of The Nation, called on news media to stand steadfast against Trump, and to continue reporting the truth rather than cower to the White House’s demands to be more “balanced.”

“Some media outlets have decided to go soft, and not tell the story of what’s happening in America,” Nichols said. “Brothers and sisters, there are others that will keep telling the story, because we know this: Donald Trump doesn’t want the full report of what is happening in America today, to the American people, because if it happened, the American people would know that tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people have gathered to say today, ‘No Crowns, No Kings!'”

Rowan Attala, co-host of a local radio program called Salamat, also spoke at the rally, decrying the administration’s attacks on free speech.

“We need to speak out loudest when our constitutional right to free speech is under threat. Especially when, after two years of constantly protesting and speaking up, we have what, quite honestly, may only be a lull in a genocide paid for with your tax dollars,” Attala said, referring to Israel’s genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.

Dane County Circuit Judge Everett Mitchell — who recognized that his presence at the rally may get him “in trouble on Monday” — said it was important for him to be there.

The current administration’s methods are overwhelming, Mitchell noted, stating that “the anxiety being built after every five-minute news cycle or tweet and breaking headline changing from one controversial and consequential issue to the next is leaving the most passionate advocate grasping for breath, with little or no time to organize.”

“I’m witnessing immigrant families living in the shadows of a nation built upon the DNA of the enslaved, the blood of the Indigenous, the sweat of the Asian community, the hands of the immigrants and the whip of injustice,” he continued.

Mitchell also warned against people sitting back or taking a break in this moment:

The temptation in this moment is to sit idle, staring at the television and scrolling on your phone, tapping at the screen, just hoping that if we keep our heads underwater long enough, the shadow will pass and normal will return to our shores. But let me be the bearer of bad news: Whatever normal was, is or could be, is not returning to us. We are not going back. The only way is for us to go forward.

At each of these protests, participants expressed a desire to build community and to organize, showcasing that those in attendance, whether at large or small No Kings gatherings, were ready to heed Mitchell’s advice to “go forward.”

There may be a reason for their cautious optimism. Studies have demonstrated that, even when a small portion of people participate in protests, they are often successful at bringing about positive social change. One examination of nonviolent social movements has found that, when at least 3.5 percent of the population takes part in protests, serious political change typically results.

The cities listed above not only reached that threshold but likely exceeded them. Monona, for example, has a population of around 8,616 people — with 400 people taking part, that is equal to around 4.6 percent. Stoughton, with a population of 13,134, saw around 3.8 percent participation with its 500 participants involved. And in Madison, which has around 285,000 residents, the 15,000 or so who took part in its second No Kings protest is equal to about 5.2 percent of its population.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/10/2025_1020-madison-no-kings.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 14:58:06.503604

Survivors may be triggered by recounting memories of traumatic events and are at risk of retraumatization. 1 Allowing patients to control how they communicate their narrative can help them engage with less anxiety.1 If retraumatization occurs, the provider should acknowledge this and attempt techniques (e.g., redirection or breathing exercises) to mitigate retraumatization.1

Accurate medicolegal documentation is important for helping survivors gain and maintain legal acknowledgement of their past1

Medical reports help to validate refugee claims.1,2 Any psychological or physical injuries should be investigated and documented appropriately. Accessing the Basis of Claim legal document (which factually outlines why an individual is claiming refugee protection) and narrative (the personal story behind the individual’s claim, which is more focused on lived experience and provides emotional context) can help the care provider gain a comprehensive history.

Different cultural norms and trauma contexts can influence a patient’s understanding of health and suffering1

Many refugees have experienced torture due to cultural, religious, or ethnic conflicts, and increasingly due to domestic violence and 2SLGBTQI+ discrimination. Therefore, narratives may be mitigated by experiences of shame, stigma, and fear of reprisal.1 Providers should avoid assuming that a patient’s place of reticence correlates with torture not having taken place. Cultural humility and sensitivity training is essential for those involved in this type of clinical work.

Survivors of torture require a primary care provider

Primary care providers can address many patient concerns and are a point of access to mental health resources and other specialists. Although survivors may experience mental health problems, including posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, or anxiety,3 routine screening is not advised, as this has not been shown to provide clear benefits and could be harmful.4 The role of a medical examiner documenting torture for legal purposes differs from that of a primary care provider, although overlap may occur. See Appendix 1 (available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/doi/10.1503/cmaj.250389/tab-related-content) for recommended resources.

Providers should know the date of a patient’s Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada hearing

The hearing is often scheduled virtually and will determine whether the refugee is permitted to stay in Canada.5 If practitioners believe the patient’s medical status may influence their hearing or affect their attendance, their lawyer must be informed.

Targeting Immigrant Communities with Detention and Deportation

We believe in a moral agenda that stands against systemic racism, labor exploitation, poverty, xenophobia, and any attempt to promote hate towards any members of the human family. The Trump-Republican agenda targets immigrants and their communities, ruthlessly and lawlessly detaining and deporting people of many immigration statuses, and militarizing and terrorizing communities at great cost to us all.

As of September 2025, there were more than 59,000 people in immigration detention in the United States, up more than 22,000 since last September — a nearly 60 percent increase. Immigration detention hit an all-time high in August 2025, with 61,226 people held in detention.

Another 181,210 individuals and families were under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) monitoring through means like location trackers on their ankles or wrists.

In September 2025, 71.5 percent of current immigration detainees had no criminal conviction. Many of those with convictions were for minor infractions like traffic violations.

The largest 17 immigrant detention facilities that hold more than 1,000 immigrants each are all privately operated and stand to profit from mass deportation. A CEO of one private detention company in August praised the “unprecedented growth opportunities” related to Trump-Republican mass deportations.

The Trump administration is detaining children and plans to open up two more family detention facilities by the end of the year.

The Trump administration has deported somewhere between 234,000 and 400,000 immigrants as of early October 2025, and claims that its campaigns of threats and harassment have led another 1.6 million people to self-deport.

Abusive Conditions and Violations of Civil and Human Rights

As of September 2025, 16 immigrants had died in ICE custody this year, including one killed by gunfire outside a detention facility. A second death from that incident brings the total to at least 17. In another incident, a single father of two was shot and killed by ICE during an attempted detention.

Inhumane and abusive conditions in detention facilities include overcrowding, lack of food, and denial of medical treatment — including for children.

In March and April, the Trump administration sent 280 immigrants to El Salvador’s infamous CECOT mega-prison without due process. As of August, 252 of those men had been released and deported to Venezuela, still without due process.

Amid the changing status of the notorious immigrant detention facility the administration has dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” hundreds of immigrants were moved to undisclosed locations and have been untraceable by family and legal representatives.

Due to racial profiling and a disregard for legal rights, U.S. citizens are also being wrongly detained.

Weaponizing the U.S. Military Against Immigrants and their Communities

The administration has deployed military troops, including the National Guard and the Marines, to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. to squash protest, back up heavy police presences, and aid in its mass deportation and detention agenda.

More than 2,000 National Guard troops were deployed to Washington, D.C. at an estimated cost of $1 million per day — more than four times the cost of operating enough public housing for all of the city’s unhoused population. The Trump-Republican surge of law enforcement into the city instead dismantled encampments and displaced unhoused people without providing any alternatives.

As of October 2025, courts have ruled that the deployment of troops to Los Angeles and the federalization of the National Guard to Portland, Oregon for these purposes are not legal.

Pentagon resources including bases and planes have been used to hold immigrant detainees, transport immigrants for deportation, and provide additional militarization of U.S. cities and the southern border.

Making Legal Immigration Harder

The Trump administration and the Trump-Republican budget bill have launched multiple attacks on legal immigration, from revoking the legal status of hundreds of thousands of current residents with Temporary Protected Status to attempting to end the legal refugee and asylum systems and instituting prohibitive fees on legal immigration applications.

Taking from the Poor to Fund Mass Deportation and the Military

The Trump-Republican budget bill that will take health care and food stamps from millions of Americans and provide more tax breaks for the wealthy also poured $170 billion in new funds into the mass deportation and detention system through September 2029.

That $42.5 billion per year in new funding for mass detentions, deportations, and border militarization is the funding equivalent of the 13th largest military in the world. That’s enough to keep Medicaid health insurance for 8.6 million people, or half of those expected to lose health insurance under the Trump-Republican budget.

Raising Inflation and Joblessness and Hurting Us All

Economists expect mass deportations to reduce overall employment by almost 7 percent. That’s because employers may replace immigrant workers with less labor-intensive technology, or not at all, and because immigrants’ purchasing power also generates jobs. The effects could be felt in service industries, agriculture, and manufacturing.

Mass deportations could result in spikes in inflation ranging from 1.3 percent to 9 percent, potentially higher than the rate of inflation from 2019-2021 under COVID.

Undocumented immigrants paid $96.7 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022, including for Social Security and Medicare, even though they are barred from accessing those programs. Extending legal work authority to undocumented immigrants would raise their tax contributions by $40.2 billion per year in federal, state and local taxes.

With shortages of essential healthcare personnel, one million immigrants work in essential healthcare jobs. One-third of them are undocumented, and many more hold threatened legal statuses.

Immigrants are our neighbors and strengthen our communities. Instead of inflicting policy violence on the most vulnerable, Congress should harness America’s abundant wealth to create a moral economy that works for all of us.

The official DHS account posted the video on Friday, which features an on-screen message that reads: “ICE We’re on the way. Word in the streets cartels put a $50k bounty on y’all.”

Noem herself claimed that drug cartels were placing bounties on agents’ heads in an interview with Fox and Friends earlier this month.

The department’s own comment in its post declared: “FAFO. If you threaten or lay hands on our law enforcement officers we will hunt you down and you will find out, really quick. We’ll see you cowards soon.”

However, social media users soon claimed to have tracked down the original version of the video and alleged it was first uploaded with an entirely different caption, in which the participants jokingly threaten Iran, not U.S. federal immigration agents.

California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell was reportedly one of the first to rebuke Secretary Noem over the post but has since deleted a tweet that read: “Kristi – DELETE THIS TWEET or answer for it in Congress. It’s FAKE. You’re the Queen of Photoshopping.”

Democratic congressional candidate Danny D Glover was among those to subsequently share a new TikTok video by the young man featured most prominently in the clip in which he explained that he had been notified about the controversy the DHS post had stirred up and said: “I saw the caption and I was like, ‘I didn’t do that!’”

He continued: “I’ve still got the video saved in my drafts on TikTok. Here’s the messed-up part: the federal government is involved with something that I didn’t do. What?”

A DHS spokesperson has since told The Independent in response: “This young man posted violent threats of murder against our law enforcement. He then deleted it when he was called out and attempted to deny all wrongdoing. We have the receipts, and the internet is forever.

“The willful ignorance and intentional blindness by leading Democrats to the massive increase in violent rhetoric against our agents due to their actions is both disgusting and disappointing. Violence against our agents and officers MUST STOP.”

The DHS has received regular criticism this year for its social media output under Noem’s leadership, which has often seen it mix memes with aggressive posturing against undocumented migrants.

It received a savage response from the creators of South Park after it attempted to repurpose a still from a recent episode satirising ICE, the Trump administration and Noem herself, while the pop star Jess Glynn said she felt “sick” when one of her songs was used in a video about mass deportations.

Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and the estates of Woody Guthrie and Tom Petty have similarly complained about their songs being used in DHS posts and the painter Morgan Weistling and the estate of another artist, Thomas Kincaid, have also complained about their work being appropriated.

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin has previously said of the DHS’s online messaging strategy: “The Department of Homeland Security is bypassing the mainstream media to give Americans the facts, debunk the lies, and unapologetically celebrate our homeland, heritage, and the rule of law.

MIGRANT INSIDER IS SPONSORED BY:

U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings found that ICE agents violated the terms of a consent decree by detaining people without proper warrants, following a surge in such arrests amid increased enforcement activity. According to the judge’s order, ICE agents must now wear body cameras and have them turned on. They also cannot arrest anyone complying with their appointment dates at immigration courthouses.

The latest order expands protections for immigrants, mandating rigorous reporting and retraining requirements for agents and creating court-backed avenues for legal consequences—including possible arrest—for those found violating the judge’s directive.

The ruling stems from heightened scrutiny over “collateral arrests” made in the Chicago area, which often occur during street stops or raids without pre-issued warrants. Under the new decree, ICE agents must document and justify every warrantless arrest; failure to comply could result in agents being named and referred for prosecution or contempt proceedings.

Several months ago, Noem issued a memo requiring all Department of Homeland Security personnel to get her personal approval on all spending in excess of $100,000. In theory, the secretary said she was positioning herself as a responsible steward of taxpayers’ money. In practice, Noem quickly made DHS agencies slower, less responsive and less efficient.

This has been especially problematic at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where critically important FEMA resources have been slow to reach disaster-struck areas because of Noem-imposed bureaucracy. Even congressional Republicans aligned with the Trump administration are sick of it.

There’s one area within DHS, however, where money appears to be flowing quite freely. The New York Times reported:

The Department of Homeland Security has purchased two Gulfstream private jets for Kristi Noem, the secretary, and other top department officials at a cost of $172 million, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times. The jets, which a department official said were needed for safety, are the latest expenditures on behalf of Ms. Noem to draw scrutiny from Democrats and other critics who have noted her lavish spending on living and other expenses during her time in public life.

Though the Times’ reporting hasn’t been independently verified by MSNBC, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson acknowledged the purchase to the Times.

The Coast Guard originally requested $50 million to buy a jet to replace the plane Noem is already using. Now, however, DHS is spending $172 million to purchase two jets.

Two key House Democrats, Reps. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, the ranking member on the House Appropriations Committee, and Lauren Underwood of Illinois, the ranking member overseeing its homeland security panel, apparently want to know where the money came from.

“In addition to raising serious questions about your ability to effectively lead an agency whose procurement strategies appear to vary on a whim, the procurement of new luxury jets for your use suggests that the [U.S. Coast Guard] has been directed to prioritize your own comfort above the [U.S. Coast Guard’s] operational needs, even during a government shutdown,” the lawmakers wrote. “We are deeply concerned about your judgment, leadership priorities, and responsibility as a steward of taxpayer dollars.”

Time will tell how and whether the secretary responds to the request for information from Capitol Hill, but as the burgeoning story unfolds, it’s the latest installment in a series of controversies surrounding Noem.

ProPublica reported last month, for example, that a community in Florida awaiting FEMA assistance found itself stuck in “bureaucratic purgatory,” right up until one of Noem’s wealthy supporters reached out to her, at which point the process dramatically improved.

A month earlier, The Washington Post reported that the secretary was living for free in a military home typically reserved for the Coast Guard’s top admiral. “Other Cabinet officials, including during both Trump administrations, have paid to use military housing that otherwise would be occupied by top generals and admirals,” the article added.","https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251020-kristi-noem-zz-65e2e1.jpg",N,,2025-10-20 12:58:05.093222

Callais, a case whose implications extend far beyond the borders of Louisiana. Though nominally focused on that state’s congressional map, the legal principles at stake could profoundly affect Mississippi and other states with sizable Black populations, particularly in how they structure electoral districts in the coming decades.

Mississippi’s political geography remains emblematic of the broader Southern struggle over race and representation. Of the state’s four congressional districts, only one—the Second, anchored in the Delta and represented by Democrat Bennie Thompson since 1993—possesses a Black voting-age majority, roughly 61 percent. Given that African Americans constitute about 38 percent of Mississippi’s population—the highest proportion of any state—the legal scaffolding that has long sustained such a district stands in question under the issues raised in Callais.

The path of the Callais case has been anything but conventional. Initially argued in March 2025, the Supreme Court later took the unusual step of ordering re-argument, expanding the scope of review to a question with sweeping constitutional ramifications: Does the deliberate creation of majority-minority districts to comply with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act violate the Equal Protection or Fifteenth Amendment?

This shift marked a pivotal moment. Louisiana, which once defended a map including two majority-Black districts—reflecting its 30 percent Black population—reversed course. The state now argues that any race-conscious districting is inherently unconstitutional, a position endorsed by the Trump administration. This stance contrasts sharply with the historical approach of previous administrations, which recognized the necessity of race-aware remedies to ensure equitable representation.

The case itself arose from Louisiana’s response to a federal court mandate requiring an additional district in which Black voters could elect candidates of their choice. When the legislature complied, producing a map that sent two Black Democrats and four white Republicans to Congress in 2024, a new set of plaintiffs challenged the result as unconstitutional racial gerrymandering—thus setting the stage for the current dispute.

At its core, Louisiana v. Callais forces the Court to reconcile three overlapping yet sometimes conflicting legal principles: the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment’s explicit prohibition on racial discrimination in voting, and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, Congress’s statutory instrument for enforcing those constitutional guarantees.

Since the 1986 decision in Thornburg v. Gingles, federal courts have relied on a tripartite test to determine whether redistricting practices violate Section 2. The criteria focus on whether minority populations are sufficiently large and cohesive to form a majority district, whether their political preferences are unified, and whether white bloc voting typically thwarts their candidates of choice. Federal courts have repeatedly found that Mississippi meets all three conditions, documenting a persistent pattern of racially polarized voting throughout the state.

The October arguments revealed a Supreme Court deeply divided. Several conservative justices questioned the legitimacy of race-conscious mapmaking. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who only two years earlier upheld Section 2’s vitality in an Alabama case, raised concerns about whether such remedies should remain indefinite. Chief Justice John Roberts, author of that very opinion, appeared more skeptical this time.

The Trump administration’s brief proposed a new evidentiary standard: plaintiffs must demonstrate that racial voting patterns are independent of partisan preference. In Mississippi—where Black voters overwhelmingly support Democrats and white voters favor Republicans—such a rule would render much of the state’s electoral geography immune from Section 2 scrutiny, redefining racial discrimination as partisan alignment.

In contrast, the court’s liberal bloc defended the established framework. Justice Sonia Sotomayor questioned Louisiana’s abrupt shift, while Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund warned that curtailing Section 2 would decimate minority representation, particularly in the Deep South, where nearly every Black member of Congress holds a seat created through Voting Rights Act enforcement.

The ramifications for Mississippi hinge on the breadth of the Court’s eventual ruling. A narrow opinion might leave the existing structure intact, but a sweeping reinterpretation could force a reexamination of all majority-minority districts. If Section 2’s constraints are weakened, Mississippi’s legislature could redraw the Second District—currently stretching over 300 miles—without regard to racial composition. Such redistricting could dilute Black voting strength and jeopardize the state’s lone Black-held congressional seat.

Mississippi’s ongoing litigation over state Supreme Court districts underscores the broader stakes. A federal court in August 2025 found that the current districts, virtually unchanged since 1987, unlawfully dilute Black voting power. Should the Supreme Court narrow Section 2’s scope, challenges to these and similar districts across local governments could falter.

Analysts estimate that up to 19 congressional districts nationwide could shift under a weakened Section 2 regime, with repercussions not only for racial representation but also for partisan balance.

The issues before the court resonate deeply within Mississippi’s long struggle for racial equality in politics. After the Civil War, Black Mississippians briefly held significant political power during Reconstruction, only to be systematically disenfranchised through violence, literacy tests, and poll taxes. Not until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did federal law restore genuine political participation for the state’s Black citizens.

Yet progress has remained contingent on judicial enforcement. From local school boards to Congress itself, litigation has been the engine sustaining Black representation against recurring attempts at dilution. Decisions such as Shelby County v. Holder (2013), which nullified the preclearance requirement for states like Mississippi, and subsequent rulings in 2021 and 2023 have incrementally reshaped the terrain. Now, Louisiana v. Callais may determine whether Section 2 endures as a viable safeguard or becomes a relic of a fading civil rights era.

A New York Times map captures with striking clarity the historical stakes of the current battle over Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. In its juxtaposition of two electoral landscapes—the present configuration and a speculative future absent federal protection—the map reveals both the persistence and fragility of Black political representation in the Deep South. The existing map reflects the cumulative impact of half a century of litigation and federal oversight: 24 Democratic seats, many anchored in majority-Black districts deliberately drawn to comply with Section 2. These enclaves, scattered across Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and neighboring states, stand as the legal and political inheritance of the civil rights era. The projected map, by contrast, imagines the consequences of a Supreme Court retreat from race-conscious districting. In this scenario, Republicans would gain a dozen additional seats, nine directly tied to the dismantling of Section 2 protections. The map of the South goes from red interlaced with blue to almost solid red.

The court’s ruling, expected by June 2026, will likely define redistricting policy for the remainder of the decade. Depending on its reasoning, Mississippi and its Southern counterparts may either retain, revise, or relinquish their obligation to consider race in crafting electoral districts. The outcome will influence not only who represents Mississippi in Congress but also the broader trajectory of American democracy’s relationship to race and representation.

In this moment, Mississippi once again stands at the intersection of constitutional interpretation and historical memory—a reminder that the struggle for political equality, though transformed in form, remains very much alive.

General Assembly signal a shift in U.S. refugee and asylum policy. USCRI examines what these changes mean for America’s humanitarian commitments.

Last month, on the margins of the U.N. General Assembly, officials from the U.S. State Department led a discussion on the global refugee and asylum system. The Administration’s emerging approach undermines decades of bipartisan commitment to protecting refugees and upholding international law. Reassessing refugee protection could be constructive, but any reforms must strengthen—not weaken—safeguards for those fleeing persecution.

The discussion was opened by Spencer Chretien, Senior Bureau Official of the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration, and hosted by Christopher Landau, Deputy Secretary of State. During the panel, Landau articulated principles intended to define the Administration’s new approach:

Sovereignty: “We get to decide who comes in and under what circumstances and for how long.”

First country of asylum policy: “There is no right to immigrate or to receive asylum or refugee status in the country of an individual’s choice.”

Extreme narrowing of asylum eligibility: “Economic privation is not a basis for asylum.”

Formalizing “temporary” asylum status: “Refugee status is temporary,” and this will prevent people “from abusing the system.”

Returns: “Every country … must agree to accept expeditiously the return of its nations.”

These principles mark a significant shift in how the United States interprets and applies longstanding refugee and asylum commitments. Earlier in the week, UNGA high-level representatives were told that migration is “destroying your country,” and that “countries are being ruined” by “uncontrolled migration.” For his part, Landau asserted that asylum and refugee protection are being used to bypass legal immigration pathways, acting as a “substitute” for immigration and fueling mass migration to the United States. Landau also stated, without presenting any supporting evidence, that there is wide abuse of the system.

Let’s be clear: Upholding refugee rights does not lead to uncontrolled migration. The right to seek asylum or refugee status is a fundamental human right. Protections for refugees and asylum seekers have been endorsed and expanded by international treaties and national laws for decades.

Consider the historical record of refugee and migrant protection:

Human mobility is constant and driven by war, persecution, climate impacts on livelihoods, or the pursuit of opportunity and safety. International cooperation on the protection and resettlement of refugees and displaced persons has occurred for centuries.

Intergovernmental organizations coordinating global responses to large-scale displacement such as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) and its predecessor the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), have existed for over 80 years.

The Refugee Convention, an international treaty protecting the rights of refugees and asylum seekers, has been in force since 1951. A protocol reaffirming and expanding those rights has been in force since 1967. Countries that haven’t signed or ratified these instruments are still bound by universal human rights norms, including the principle of non-refoulement, or returning someone to a country where their life is in danger.

The U.S. refugee program, established by the Refugee Act of 1980 and passed unanimously by Congress, has provided a framework for admitting and resettling refugees ever since. The program reflects a longstanding U.S. commitment to providing refuge to those fleeing persecution and danger.

Seeking Asylum is Not a Loophole

During the panel, Landau claimed that asylum is a loophole in U.S. immigration laws, asserting that “90-plus percent of people are found not to be eligible for asylum”. This is not true. While the latest U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) report shows that around 10 percent of affirmative asylum applications were granted between October to December 2024, a 10 percent grant rate does not mean that 90 percent of applications were fraudulent. Around 80 percent of asylum applications were administratively closed or dismissed before adjudication. Reasons for closure could include withdrawal of the application by the applicant, death of the applicant, change in immigration status, involuntary transfer to immigration court, failure to appear at scheduled interviews or hearings, or incomplete documentation. There are many reasons that cases are closed. What is clear is that Landau’s framing was misleading and did not seem to reference grant rates in defensive asylum cases, which has fluctuated between 25 and 49 percent during the past ten years.

Asylum grant rates are also strongly correlated with legal representation. However, having an attorney is not a right in immigration court, despite what’s at stake. Asylum seekers, if deported back to their country, may face years-long detention, torture, or even death. Retaining an attorney can be difficult because the process can take years, due to backlogs at USCIS and immigration courts. Children and infants are also not guaranteed an attorney, despite efforts to do so both in Congress and from non-governmental organizations. If not for governmental programs, which are at grave risk, many more children would be forced to file applications, prepare evidence, and argue for themselves in immigration court.

Some claims overlook that asylum outcomes are highly sensitive to political changes. The Executive Branch has significant discretion in implementing asylum policy and can issue guidance affecting eligibility and adjudication without formal rulemaking, though fundamental changes to the law or regulations still require proper procedural steps. For example, the Executive Branch recently imposed higher barriers for survivors of domestic violence to be granted asylum. Nationality, age, and gender can significantly impact asylum claims—a topic that has been the subject of extensive academic research. Additionally, the Executive Branch controls interviews, staffing, access to lawyers, and the cost of applying.

In short, the Government has significant control over who is granted asylum. Grant and denial rates should be viewed as an outcome of policy decisions, rather than a judgment about who is truly in need of asylum protection.

Finally, individuals seeking a loophole in the U.S. immigration system would not choose to exploit the arduous asylum process. Applying for asylum is a marathon process that re-traumatizes applicants, their families, and everyone involved in the process. People who apply for asylum are also forced to gamble for their future, since the final decision usually rests on a single asylum officer or immigration judge.

The United States has already started to implement policies that has resulted in decreased refugee admissions and significantly impaired access to asylum. The United States’s stance may embolden more countries to adopt restrictive refugee and asylum policies. This month, the European countries are clashing over new asylum policies due to many countries’ reluctance to welcome more refugees. Furthermore, the current Administration has already recruited nations to participate in its third-country deportation scheme, despite human rights concerns over refoulement.

On a global scale, the proposed reinvention of the refugee and asylum system is particularly harmful considering the present reality. At a time of unprecedented levels of displacement, countries should be working together to upscale solutions. Tearing down the system risks more instability and increased displacement—all at the cost of people who are fleeing death, torture, and harm.

Background

USCRI joined Refugee Council USA (RCUSA) in urging the Administration to uphold refugee protections, and separately joined over 260 faith-based, non-governmental, and other civil society organizations calling on UN Member States to uphold international refugee treaties. Also, 117 refugee-led organizations from 41 countries urged UN Member States to reaffirm commitments to refugee protections.

In a following speech, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi urged countries to recommit to multilateralism. While assuring countries that UNHCR appreciates challenges posed by population flows, Grandi clearly stated that the problem is not one of principles codified in the 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol: “In an environment where everything is highly politicized, putting the Refugee Convention and the principle of asylum on the table would be a catastrophic error. It would lead us down blind alleys and, ultimately, it would make the problem more difficult to address. Beware, please, the easy fix!”

WASHINGTON, D.C. — Public Citizen Litigation Group, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), and the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) today filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to challenge a rule that threatens the livelihoods of nearly 200,000 people. Under the rule, issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) on September 29, 2025, asylum seekers, refugees, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients who have work authorization are barred from holding commercial driver’s licenses based on their immigration status. These licenses are necessary for truck drivers, bus drivers, and delivery drivers, among others.

The lawsuit, titled Rivera Lujan v. FMSCA, was filed on behalf of Jorge Rivera Lujan, Aleksei Semenovskii, AFSCME, and the AFT, and will challenge both the substance of the rule and FMCSA’s failure to follow rulemaking procedures required by law.

“This unlawful rule seems intended to put people authorized to work in the United States out of work, solely because of the prejudices of the Trump administration,” said Wendy Liu, attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group. “We are asking the court to promptly invalidate the rule to prevent devastating consequences for our clients and the hundreds of thousands of people across the country who depend on commercial driver’s licenses for their livelihoods.”

Issued without the required notice and comment period, the rule states that it is effective immediately. When Rivera Lujan, a DACA recipient and truck driver of 11 years who owns his own trucking company, went to renew his license on September 30, he was told that he could not do so because of the new rule.

“Without a commercial driver’s license, I will lose my business and the income that allows me to provide for my family,” said Mr. Rivera Lujan, who has lived in the United States since he was 2 years old. “I have followed all the rules and complied with all requirements set by the government.”

Mr. Semenovskii, an asylum seeker from Russia who has been driving trucks for more than five years, said. “Driving a truck is how I support my family. I’ve endured tremendous hardship but have fought to rebuild my life through trucking. For me and so many others, this rule will be a tragedy, destroying years of sacrifice and honest work.”

“The administration’s new rule prevents immigrants who are lawfully present in the country and authorized to work from supporting themselves and their families,” said AFSCME President Lee Saunders. “It also disrupts essential services communities rely on. Drivers who take our children to school, deliver food and medicine, and clean trash off the streets must have these commercial driver’s licenses, and denying them inflicts unnecessary pain on everyone their lives touch.”",https://www.citizen.org/wp-content/uploads/public_citizen_shared_link.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 11:22:15.345188

On Friday, the judge reinforced her order for all federal agents in the Chicago area to wear body cameras, telling the Department of Homeland Security, ""This was not a suggestion. It wasn't a hint. It wasn't a topic of discussion or conversation. It was an order. So, I will enter it today and then I will expect it will be followed.""

The second-in-command for CBP told U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis that as of Monday, all CBP agents in Chicago for Operation Midway Blitz have been equipped with and trained on body cameras. He said there are currently 232 CBP agents in the area, but a couple dozen will be leaving Tuesday with a remaining 201 CBP agents working on Operation Midway Blitz. He confirmed all of them have cameras.

U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis wants answers on how immigration enforcement is being carried out and why body cameras still aren't being used.

At the center of the hearing are scenes like what we saw in the city's East Side neighborhood last week: federal agents in riot gear dispersing crowds with chemical agents in residential neighborhoods. Agents were also seen throwing tear gas out of a car window on a busy Logan Square street near an elementary school.

In both cases, not just civilians but also Chicago police officers were exposed to the chemical agents without proper protective gear.

Judge Ellis previously ordered agents to stop dispersing peaceful crowds and banned the use of tear gas on people who aren't a threat. Now she's pressing ICE and Border Patrol over their noncompliance on her body camera order.

Friday, she reprimanded the federal government for ignoring the order and DHS pushed back, calling reports of a camera mandate false.

Legal experts like Kent College of Law Professor Richard Kling say the judge's frustration is about accountability.

""She was not satisfied that ICE was following her order,"" he said. ""She wanted TV like the rest of us and apparently realized that ICE was going to do what ICE wanted to do.""

Representatives from ICE and Border Patrol will have to explain their use of force and why they've failed to implement body cameras in court.

Monday is also a key deadline in the case over the deployment of the National Guard in Illinois.

Demand for Accountability in the Mishandling of Emmanuel Gonzales Case

To: Mayor Whitmire

From: A constituent in Houston , TX

October 20

I am writing to express deep outrage and heartbreak over the handling of the case involving Emmanuel Gonzales, an autistic teenager who was reported to ICE instead of being issued an Amber Alert. This failure represents not only a gross miscarriage of justice but a devastating breach of community trust. Emmanuel should have been treated as a child in need of protection, not as an immigration case. Dallas has shown that refusing to cooperate with ICE by turning down $25 million in federal incentives can be a moral stance that prioritizes human rights. Houston, instead, chose to hand an autistic teenager over to federal custody, where he was reportedly operated on without his mother’s consent or presence. The decision by the officers involved to involve ICE instead of following proper Amber Alert protocol is indefensible. Those responsible must be held accountable. Anything less communicates to Houston’s Hispanic and immigrant communities that they cannot trust local law enforcement to protect their children. This loss of trust will not only harm community relationships but will increase fear, isolation, and ultimately, crime rates. Houston deserves leadership that stands with its people, not against them. We need a mayor who values integrity, compassion, and justice over political appeasement. Right now, this administration is failing that standard. I urge your office to 1 Publicly explain why Emmanuel was reported to ICE instead of being treated as a missing child. 2 Take disciplinary action against any officer or department responsible. 3 Implement safeguards to ensure that no other child is ever subjected to such mistreatment again. This tragedy is unacceptable.

“The Federal Trade Commission undoubtedly exercises executive power.","America First Legal (AFL), in partnership with Mitchell Law PLLC, has filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in Trump v. Slaughter, urging the Court to reaffirm that the President alone holds constitutional authority to remove executive officials.

For nearly ninety years, the Court’s 1935 decision in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States (Humphrey’s Executor) has stripped presidents of control over so-called “independent” agencies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—allowing unelected bureaucrats to wield executive power without accountability to the American people. The Constitution is clear: all executive power is vested in the President, and Congress has no authority to administer or execute the laws it enacts.

Humphrey’s Executor has stood as one of the most damaging precedents in American history. The decision allowed Congress to shield the FTC from presidential oversight by claiming it has “quasi-legislative” and “quasi-judicial” powers, whatever that means. The Constitution permits no such thing. The Framers vested all executive power in one branch—the Executive, and one person within that branch, the President—so that the law could be faithfully carried out and responsibility could be clearly fixed.

AFL’s brief explains that this case is not about expanding presidential power, but restoring constitutional order. The Supreme Court has not hesitated to correct its own constitutional errors—whether in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, Janus v. AFSCME, or Seila Law LLC v. CFPB—and it should do so again here. Overruling Humphrey’s Executor would reaffirm the separation of powers, end Congress’s unconstitutional interference in executive functions, and return accountability to the American people.

“The Federal Trade Commission undoubtedly exercises executive power. The President necessarily must be able to remove any official who does so, and it is time for the Supreme Court to finally overturn Humphrey’s Executor for good,” said Gene Hamilton, President of America First Legal.

America First Legal will continue to fight to restore the rule of law, the separation of powers, and the principles of accountability that define our republic.

The Nebraska Examiner sought comments about the megabill’s impact on SNAP from all five members of the Nebraska delegation.
About 20% of commodities comes from the USDA emergency food assistance program and the rest largely from donors and companies.
Currently, able-bodied adults are limited to three months of SNAP benefits every three years unless they work 20 hours a week or qualify for an exemption.
He said education and hope for meaningful careers was always the lure of the U.S. “Our big hope is education,” Mohsen said.","OMAHA — He said he worked 20 years for U.S. troops in his homeland of Afghanistan, in roles ranging from soldier to cook and interpreter, before his at-risk family was flown out of the country in 2021 as it fell again to the Taliban.

Now age 46 with 10 children, the Afghan refugee works full-time in a Nebraska production job and says $2,100 in monthly public grocery assistance has helped his family make ends meet. He and his wife expected to gain financial independence as their kids got educated and into careers.

But any sense of stability has crumbled, the man said, as his family faces the impact of President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law that Trump calls “big” and “beautiful” — and Nebraska’s implementation this week of related changes in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Mohsen, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of retaliation against family in the U.S. and abroad, is among an estimated 7,000 refugees, asylees and other Nebraska newcomers without permanent residency status who are poised to lose their SNAP benefits, according to Nebraska Appleseed, a statewide organization that advocates for low-income people and immigrants. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services put that number closer to 6,300.

Vets, homeless, foster care impact

Under the megabill approved July 4, the grocery benefits now will be limited to citizens and green card-carrying lawful permanent residents who also meet income guidelines. Also eligible are Cuban and Haitian newcomers and those in the U.S. as part of a compact of free association with Palau, Micronesia and the Marshall Islands.

Currently about 150,000 Nebraskans, nearly 8% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, formerly known as food stamps. People without a documented immigration status have never been eligible for SNAP.

According to Appleseed, another 10,000 or so SNAP recipients in Nebraska — including veterans, homeless and people recently aged out of foster care — are at risk of reduced SNAP benefits under changes and stricter work requirements in the new law. Appleseed estimates are based on 2023 data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Supporters of more stringent restrictions have argued that they will increase accountability, self-sufficiency and help cut government spending.

While the changes were expected to squeeze out some participants — accommodating a reported $186 billion cut in SNAP spending over the next decade — Nebraska’s release last week of details on how the bill impacts local populations has advocacy agencies scrambling to try and ensure no one goes hungry.

Based on guidance received recently from the feds, DHHS issued a statement Friday on the changes to be enforced starting Oct. 20, 10 days before the federal deadline for full implementation.

State officials said they’ve started contacting recipients to alert them, and also have assembled a list of frequently asked questions. Eligibility for each person or family is to be reevaluated when they recertify for the program, which happens every six months, or when household characteristics are updated. So cutoffs won’t all happen at once. Mohsen, for example, recently recertified and faces SNAP loss in April.

DHHS spokesman Jeff Powell noted that Nebraska is mandated to enforce the changes. Due to the federal shutdown, the state is waiting for additional guidance and said it will provide updates as more information is received. Under the new law — backed by all five members of Nebraska’s congressional delegation — states will be subject to financial penalties based on error rates.

In addition, Nebraska will have to provide an estimated $17 million more in the coming fiscal year to administer the program, said Eric Savaiano, Nebraska Appleseed’s economic justice program manager.

“Monumental” changes, as he called them, have spurred formation of a Nebraska coalition of emergency food providers and refugee advocacy agencies to discuss ways to respond and fill gaps.

Hit from different directions

Some advocates say it is particularly jarring to know the loss for newcomers, such as Afghans and Ukrainians, who fled war. Refugees and people granted asylum typically left their homelands seeking safety from persecution and violence and have been vetted by the U.S. government to be granted that relief.

In the case of Mohsen, he said he was lawfully admitted to the U.S. in 2021, moved to Nebraska in 2022, and has applied for asylum. He said he previously had applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, based on service work with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, and was rejected. While the government has authorized him to work while his asylum application is pending, he does not have permanent residency or citizenship status, which is now grounds for losing SNAP benefits.

“Twenty years I worked with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan. They promised they will help me,” Mohsen said. “We already had the hard life in Afghanistan — why make our life so hard here?”

He said hits are coming from other directions, too. Family members have been denied Medicaid benefits, he said. Bills from a few emergency room visits have piled up and haunt him as he has ignored them to pay others.

His three oldest children were denied federal financial aid to attend Nebraska’s public university system, and the reason given, the dad said, was “illegal” immigration status.

“We did not come here illegally,” he said. The three ended up enrolling at Metropolitan Community College.

Mohsen, interviewed this week after he finished parent-teacher conferences for his elementary-age kids, said his wife stays at home to care for their children. The youngest, 3 years old and a U.S. citizen, likely still could qualify for SNAP.

The Nebraska Examiner sought comments about the megabill’s impact on SNAP from all five members of the Nebraska delegation. U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Nebraska, responded. He said he negotiated to reduce Nebraska’s cost of implementing SNAP by half.

“I tried to get the best bill possible, while also increasing funding for our military by $150 billion, modernizing our air traffic control and preventing a 20% tax increase on all families,” he said.

Pantries scramble

Hannah Vlach of Omaha-based Restoring Dignity says advocates have been trying to prepare for the changes but still hold out hope the state will create a program to help cover lost food benefits.

DHHS’ Powell said all options would be considered.

But the shifts come as Nebraska lawmakers struggle already with a state government budget shortfall.

Vlach said it feels particularly “immoral” to pull assistance from a refugee who fought alongside the U.S. She said it hints at something darker.

“When we look back at history, every time a targeted group had food taken away, it marked the beginning of something horrific,” she said.

Toby Rees of Kountze Commons in downtown Omaha said her food pantry already is short of proteins supplied by the Food Bank for the Heartland and has tried to compensate by, for example, using donor funds and grants to buy groceries at a discount from cooperating stores.

“The need is going to increase,” she said, noting the new faces among about 400 people that visited the pantry Monday. Kountze does not ask for income or other verification, nor does it limit visits, she said. More immigrant and refugee families are seeking a new and “safe” place to get food, she said.

“It’s really scaring them,” she added.

Vlach said the coalition is preparing documents in 13 languages that provide information and pictures on available Omaha area pantries and places where people can seek food.

“Everybody’s resources are limited,” said Rees. “But we are banding together.”

Tim Williams of the Food Bank for the Heartland says his organization provides food to about 500 pantries and other partners in 93 counties across Nebraska and Iowa. About 20% of commodities comes from the USDA emergency food assistance program and the rest largely from donors and companies.

He called SNAP one of the most useful tools for families to access nutritious food. The food bank is worried about the added burden on pantries at a time of less federal emergency food assistance and greater demand.

“There is immense concern about how this will exacerbate the already really high food insecurity problem across the heartland,” said Williams.

Work requirements

Appleseed’s Savaiano fears that expanded work requirements under the new law will create more administrative paperwork that will “gum up” the process and lead to reduced SNAP benefits for populations beyond refugees and immigrants.

Currently, able-bodied adults are limited to three months of SNAP benefits every three years unless they work 20 hours a week or qualify for an exemption. The new law expands work requirements through age 64 (it was age 54 before), and excludes parents with children younger than 14 (it used to be 18).

DHHS said three groups no longer are exempted from work requirements: veterans, homeless individuals and those aging out of foster care. The state said those exemptions were temporary due to the Fiscal Responsibility Act and now are being removed. A new exception was added for Indians, Urban Indians, and others eligible for Indian Health Services.

Advocates are urging Nebraskans to lean on federal lawmakers to repeal SNAP changes or support alternative programs.

Confounding Mohsen, he said, is why his case seeking a more permanent status has moved so slowly through the immigration court system.

“I worked honestly for those 20 years,” he said of service to the U.S. military. “Sometimes it makes me crazy, it’s upsetting.”

Mohsen hopes to find other avenues to put healthy food on his family’s table, but he is bracing for the last resort. That would be for his older children to quit or delay schooling and help the family financially. He said education and hope for meaningful careers was always the lure of the U.S.

“Our big hope is education,” Mohsen said. “If they don’t get education, it’s not meaningful for us.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47648/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/img_8574-1024x6961760969119.jpg?h=3ac079aa&itok=gXxzrhqI,N,,2025-10-20 12:58:00.265100

Rebekah Wolf, staff attorney with the Immigration Justice Campaign and Policy Department of the American Immigration Council, which represents immigrants in detention, said health care in ICE detention centers has always had problems.
Jayapal partly attributes the reports of poor medical care to Trump tapping private prison companies to handle immigration detention centers while eroding government oversight.
These commissioned officers frequently work jobs that are difficult to fill with civilian health care providers — including at rural Indian Health Service clinics, prisons, and ICE detention facilities.
The report documents several instances of ICE health workers giving incorrect diagnoses, prescribing medication to people with contraindications, and delaying treatment during heart attacks, suicide attempts, and other emergencies.","The detention centers — which currently hold more than 60,000 people — are overcrowded and the use of hastily constructed facilities like tent cities makes it easier, public health officials said, for communicable diseases to spread and more difficult to manage chronic illnesses. At the same time, oversight of the centers has eroded, as layoffs hit the Homeland Security offices investigating allegations of abuse and neglect, and lawmakers attempting to visit facilities in their districts are turned away.

Frequent transfers of migrants between states have also disrupted medical treatments, and allowed prescriptions and other records to be lost in transit. Migrants have died in recent months of infections, Covid-19, injuries, uncontrolled diabetes, and suicide — according to government reports.

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to several questions about staffing plans, deaths in detention, and accusations of medical neglect. In a recent New York court filing responding to a lawsuit by the ACLU, the agency argued that it “provide[s] adequate food, clothing, shelter, and medical care to individuals in custody” and that “all medication, whether brought by the detainee or later, is received by [the ICE Health Service Corps] and administered according to proper medical procedures.”

Independent watchdog groups that track health care access for detained migrants dispute those claims, but say increasing the health care workforce could help prevent further deaths by reducing delays in the dispensing of medications and ensuring a more thorough intake process that gathers detainees’ medical histories to avoid future emergencies.

Yet Jonathan White, a retired commander in the U.S. Public Health Service Corps who oversaw the detention of undocumented, unaccompanied minors during the first Trump administration, said that without more fundamental policy changes, people will continue to get sick and die.

“The larger problem is that this is a system to abduct and detain people without meaningful due process,” he said. “That is inherently harmful and cannot be made humane or healthy or safe no matter how many people you throw at it.”

More detainees, less oversight

Earlier this year, the Department of Homeland Security tried to to eliminate its offices that investigate complaints of discrimination, neglect and mistreatment of detainees — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Immigration Detention Ombudsman — calling them “internal adversaries that slow down operations.” DHS accused the oversight staff of “adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining [the department’s] mission.”

After human rights groups sued, the offices were restored in May, but hundreds of their staff were laid off a few months later as part of a government-wide reduction in force, hobbling oversight efforts. An ongoing lawsuit seeks to bring the fired workers back.

Trump also fired the independent inspectors general that investigated claims regarding the conditions of detention centers.

Rebekah Wolf, staff attorney with the Immigration Justice Campaign and Policy Department of the American Immigration Council, which represents immigrants in detention, said health care in ICE detention centers has always had problems. But now, she said, there’s less transparency and accountability.

“I have a client right now who has untreated diabetes — they just stopped giving her medicine,” she said. “And so we’re like, ‘Hey, detention center, why’d you stop giving this medicine?’ And there’s just no response.”

The ACLU and Detention Watch Network, two advocacy groups that focus on conditions for migrants, report that medical neglect is the most common complaint they hear from clients in ICE custody. Immigrants at the Louisiana State Penitentiary and California City Detention Facility launched hunger strikes in September, in part to protest poor access to medical care and mental health care, including difficulty accessing diabetes medication and receiving treatment for injuries. In August, in response to a class-action lawsuit in New York City, a judge ordered ICE to allow migrants to keep prescription medications they had on them when they were detained or that family members brought to detention centers. And in early October, a detainee in Michigan with chronic myeloid leukemia sued the Trump administration, saying his chemotherapy was suspended for several weeks after being detained, risking serious complications.

Some Democratic lawmakers are introducing legislation to address the deaths in custody. Jayapal partly attributes the reports of poor medical care to Trump tapping private prison companies to handle immigration detention centers while eroding government oversight. She plans to introduce a bill to mandate that all ICE facilities are run by federal employees, arguing that would help curb self-dealing and profit seeking at the expense of detainees’ quality of care.

“Now, with the massive increases in money that are going out, the firing of all the inspector generals and the corruption within the system,” she said. “I mean, you’ve got Tom Homan accepting bags of cash,” she added, referring to allegations that Trump’s border czar took a $50,000 bribe from undercover FBI agents last year.

Homan has denied that he took a bribe from federal agents, and the Justice Department reportedly shut down the investigation into the incident. “I didn’t take $50,000 from anybody,” Homan said in a Wednesday night appearance on NewsNation’s “Cuomo” town hall.

Staffing up

The health care-related job openings include posts at some of the detention centers where deaths have been reported and where watchdog groups have alleged unsafe conditions and medical neglect, including the facility in Jena, Louisiana, where multiple foreign students have been detained, as well as centers in Eloy and Florence, Arizona.

Most of the people providing health services to ICE detainees are private contractors, but the new jobs are open only to current members of the U.S. Public Health Service Corps — one of the country’s eight uniformed services made up of roughly 6,000 public health and medical professionals. These commissioned officers frequently work jobs that are difficult to fill with civilian health care providers — including at rural Indian Health Service clinics, prisons, and ICE detention facilities.

If ICE doesn’t get enough applications for the jobs, said White, public health officers could be ordered to deploy there temporarily or permanently. But he said avoidable deaths are likely to continue even with a few dozen more medical personnel because the detainee population is swelling by the tens of thousands and is being held in worse conditions with less oversight. He voiced particular concern about an uptick in self-harm and suicide.

“Compared to the population that is traditionally seen in the immigration system, the level of trauma and psychological distress of those caught up in this new abduction machine will be much greater,” he said. “These people are proportionally much more likely to have the most severe psychological reaction to being removed, because they have many years in this country, roots in their communities, and U.S. national children who they’re being separated from.”

A 2024 report by the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, and American Oversight, based on thousands of pages of government documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, argued that more than 90 percent of deaths in ICE custody could have been prevented with better medical care. The report documents several instances of ICE health workers giving incorrect diagnoses, prescribing medication to people with contraindications, and delaying treatment during heart attacks, suicide attempts, and other emergencies. The report examined the deaths of 52 people in ICE custody from 2017-2021, covering Trump’s first term and the first year of Biden’s presidency.

“The lack of medical staffing is a consistent theme,” but far from the only issue, said Eunice Cho, a senior counsel for the ACLU who has worked on several lawsuits related to conditions in ICE detention. “Specialist care is denied. People are transferred from place to place before they’re able to actually get their care. People are not given medication.”

Human rights groups are also concerned that deaths may be undercounted. “There is no standardized way in which ICE reports on deaths. It is quite possible that people have died and no one knows,” said Anthony Enriquez, vice president of U.S. advocacy and litigation at Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, which is suing DHS alongside the Immigration Council and the ACLU, among other groups.

Enriquez said that families of migrants who died in detention have spoken out about a death before ICE has publicly accounted for it.

As ICE works to fill the new medical jobs, the agency’s surge in detentions is far outpacing its expansion of detention capacity. The administration aims to hold up to 100,000 people per day, and as the federal government increasingly houses migrants in tents and converted local jails heading into flu season, advocates and investigators are worried.

“My greatest fear is that we’re going to continue to see the number of people who unfortunately die as a result of being held in immigration detention grow,” Cho said.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F70%2F5b%2F2da27fdc4d2a961dd553b27ad479%2Fimmigration-detention-centers-84000.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 10:16:53.342404

Her arrest followed her participation in a 2024 protest against Israel’s actions in Gaza; charges from that protest were later dropped.

Leqaa was in the process of securing legal residency when she voluntarily met with immigration officials, only to be taken into custody and sent to a detention centre in Texas. While detained, her right to practise her religion has been violated.

We call for Leqaa’s immediate release and for her rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly to be fully respected.

Here’s what you can do:

Write to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security urging her office to:

Immediately release Leqaa to her family.

Family and immigration background

Leqaa Kordia is a 32-year-old Muslim Palestinian woman who came to the United States on a visitor visa to reunite with her mother after many years apart. She later obtained a student visa to study English, while her mother filed a family-based visa petition for her. Immigration authorities approved that petition in 2021.

Following incorrect advice, Leqaa ended her student visa, believing that the visa petition approval meant she already had legal status while waiting for her green card. This left her without lawful immigration status.

Grieving and speaking out

Leqaa has lost about 175 family members during Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. Motivated by grief and solidarity, she began attending protests in New Jersey and nearby areas in 2023.

On April 30, 2024, Leqaa joined a peaceful protest outside Columbia University in New York. Police ordered demonstrators to disperse and arrested Leqaa and several others. She was released the next day, and all charges were later dismissed.

Targeted under discriminatory orders

In January 2025, President Trump issued two Executive Orders calling for the arrest, detention, and deportation of non-citizens who showed support for Palestinian rights. Amnesty International condemned these orders as discriminatory and repressive.

Soon after, immigration authorities began identifying people they believed took part in pro-Palestinian protests, including Leqaa. They obtained her 2024 arrest record from the NYPD.

On March 6, 2025, immigration agents visited her mother’s home and questioned her in front of Leqaa over the phone. When Leqaa later met with officials at the Newark ICE Field Office with her lawyer, she was detained on the spot—even though ICE determined she posed no threat and had no criminal history.

That night, she was transferred to Prairieland Detention Facility in Texas, far from her lawyer and family. The facility has a record of serious human rights violations.

Ongoing detention and legal battles

Leqaa’s immigration case is now being handled in Texas. Since April 2025, two judges have ordered her release on a $20,000 bond, recognizing she should not remain in detention. However, ICE has blocked both orders by filing automatic and discretionary stays. She is now seeking release through federal court.

Violations of religious rights

While detained, Leqaa’s religious rights have been repeatedly violated. She has been served almost no halal meals, forcing her to eat food that doesn’t meet her dietary requirements and causing significant weight loss.

During Ramadan, staff refused to let her save food for when she could break her fast, forcing her either to go hungry or to break her fast early. She has not been provided with clothing suitable for prayer or a clean prayer space. Staff also ignore her requests to announce when male officers enter her dorm area while she is without her hijab.

Seeking safety and justice

Alongside her family-based petition for permanent residency, Leqaa has filed for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture. Before her detention, she lived in New Jersey and cared for two close family members with health issues and disabilities.

Nearly every immigrant we’ve talked to at immigration court said they feel it as well.","As the Trump administration continues its purge of immigration judges and enacts sweeping policy changes, two former Bay Area immigration judges are giving an inside look at the upheaval and explaining why they believe the public should be paying attention.

The judges sat down with NBC Bay Area’s Investigative Unit for a wide-ranging interview covering the termination of immigration judges, a wave of new policy memos concerning immigration court operations, and why they fear judicial independence is in jeopardy.

“Honestly, it’s not easy to speak out and it’s a little bit frightening,” said former Immigration Judge Kyra Lilien, who was abruptly fired in July from her post at the immigration court in Concord shortly before completing her two-year probationary period.

Lilien, who was appointed by the Biden administration in 2023, said more than a dozen other judges from her probationary class were fired the same day. The judge recalls being in the middle of a hearing when an email hit her inbox informing her that she was being terminated.

“It makes no sense to eliminate high performing expert judges in the name of efficiency,” said Lilien, noting her history of exemplary performance reviews. “It’s just ludicrous.”

Former Judge Elizabeth Young, who served as Assistant Chief Immigration Judge in San Francisco before being promoted to Regional Deputy Chief Immigration Judge last year, ultimately resigned shortly after President Trump took office for the second time.

Just 30 minutes following President Trump’s inauguration, Young says her bosses were fired and she was reassigned from her post supervising immigration judges in the court’s western region.

“I had no idea what to do,” Young said. “There was no precedent for this. It was shocking.”

After weeks of sitting at home without direction, Young said she decided to step down from the working group she had been moved to.

“All of us that were assigned to this working group quickly realized that it was just a way to kind of get us out of the agencies that we were in,” Young said.

While the mass firings of judges have sent shockwaves through immigration court, the judges said they believe the personnel moves are just one component of a larger plan: For the Trump administration, using the power of the executive branch, to reshape the country’s immigration system.

“This is one piece of a very complex web of policies, executive orders, and actions,” Young said. “It’s an end run around changing the law.”

The Trump administration has stated it’s merely enforcing existing immigration laws that were ignored by President Biden.

“Over the last 4 years, the prior administration invited, administered, and oversaw an unprecedented flood of illegal immigration into the United States,” an inauguration day executive order from President Trump stated. “Millions of illegal aliens crossed our borders or were permitted to fly directly into the United States on commercial flights and allowed to settle in American communities, in violation of longstanding Federal laws.”

Young and Lilien are just two of the 139 immigration judges who have been fired, resigned, or involuntarily transferred, according to the union that represents them. Thirteen of the fired judges served in either San Francisco or Concord.

“San Francisco is one of the areas that’s been disproportionately targeted for firings by this administration,” said Matt Biggs, president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE).

Biggs questioned the timing and scope of the firings, as immigration courts face massive backlogs and judges handle upwards of 700 cases each year.

To replenish the thinning ranks of immigration judges across the country, the Trump administration recently authorized up to 600 military attorneys to serve as temporary immigration judges.

“Their strategy here is to remove the current immigration judges, as many as they can, and replace them,” Biggs speculated..

Immigration judges serve under the Department of Justice’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is part of the executive branch. It means the Attorney General has the power to hire and fire them.

The judges say the administration is wielding that power to exert pressure on judges

“There’s a very strong idea that if you don’t follow the policy, you’ll lose your job,” Lilien said. “I think a lot of judges feel a lot of fear and pressure that’s unprecedented.”

Lilien said much of that pressure has come in the form of dozens of new EOIR policy memos, some of which have suggested how, and how fast, judges should rule on cases.

“The pressure to resolve cases quickly, the pressure to increase the number of cases you resolve, the pressure, frankly, to deny cases,” Lilien said. “There were so many pressures that came together that really pushed judges into a position where you felt you had to rule a certain way in order to preserve your job.”

Young said she never had to face those pressures directly, since she had already resigned, but has been closely following the influx of new policies, such as one that encouraged judges to throw out “insufficient” asylum applications without a hearing

“From the outside, I know that I would not want to be a judge right now because it would be very difficult to remain independent,” she said.

To alleviate the perceived pressure, Lilien said it’s worth considering removing immigration judges from Department of Justice control.

“There is no room for independent adjudication when we are hamstrung by the Attorney General,” Lilien said. “It’s just not possible with this structure.”

EOIR did not respond to NBC Bay Area’s request for comment, but a July EOIR policy memo on ""adjudicator impartiality and independence” reminded judges they are “inferior officers subject to both appointment and removal by the Attorney General.”

Acting EOIR director Circe Owen has also been critical of immigration judges for “not efficiently managing their dockets.”

Judges aren’t the only ones experiencing fear. Nearly every immigrant we’ve talked to at immigration court said they feel it as well.

Since May, ICE agents have had a heavy presence at the immigration courts in San Francisco and Concord and have arrested dozens of immigrants following seemingly routine hearings.

“The presence of ICE in the courthouse really exacerbated that [fear],” Lilien said. “There was just incredibly increased tension, and a couple of things happened as a result: A lot of people stopped coming to court, they missed their hearings, they lost their cases by not coming to court.”

Young said the agency’s enforcement operations within the hallways of immigration court are unprecedented.

“Historically, that had never been the practice,” Young said. “In fact, there was an emphasis on understanding that if ICE was able to come in whenever they want and arrest anyone, that would deter respondents from coming.”

An ICE spokesperson previously told NBC Bay Area that Secretary Noem is “reversing Biden’s catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets” and that undocumented immigrants in the country for less than two years were being put into expedited removal, which fast-tracks deportation proceedings.

As they watch the wave of firings continue, the Young and Lilien have been searching for a common thread that might explain which judges are being selected for termination.

“The trend seems to be that people who at any point in their lives ever represented a noncitizen,” Lilien said.

Lilien said she believes judges hired by the Biden administration, like herself, were also particularly vulnerable.

Then there are judges’ asylum approval rates, which many attorneys and immigrant rights advocates have suggested could be a factor in the firings.

Some of the judges fired in San Francisco had asylum grant rates north of 90%, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC) at Syracuse University. Lilien’s was about 77%, according to TRAC, though she says those numbers are outdated.

Both judges said comparing asylum grant rates between judges can be misleading, and the numbers have never been used to measure a judge’s performance.

“In my case, I think it did not have anything to do with my firing,” Lilien said. “I was part of a class of judges who were fired and many of them had very, very low grant rates.”

Asylum grant rates, they said, can dramatically vary between judges based on several factors, including the types of cases on a judge’s docket, the percentage of immigrants in their courtroom who have attorneys, and the geographic location of the court.

San Francisco, the judges said, has a higher rate of represented respondents, hence higher asylum grant rates. It’s also within the 9th Circuit, where established case law is generally more favorable to respondents who are seeking asylum, according to the judges.

“So generally speaking, you’ll see a higher level of grants within the 9th circuit,” Lilien said.

In an August policy memo, however, the Department of Justice stated that judges with “outlier” asylum grant rates could face scrutiny.

“Adjudicatory outliers or statistically improbable outcome metrics, particularly relative to EOIR’s overall adjudicator corps and after controlling for sample size and relevant docket characteristics, may be indicative of a systematic bias or failure to adhere to applicable law that warrants close examination and potential action,” the memo stated.

While the judges puzzle over the firings, and what potential recourse they might have, they agree the entire immigration system is in urgent need of an overhaul. The country’s economy is dependent on immigrants, they said, and it’s important for Congress to update outdated immigration laws in a way that makes sense in the 21st century.

“I think we need to have a much more comprehensive review,” Young said. “We need to have a viable way for people to come here and temporarily work if that’s what our economics requires. Maybe we need a better system for addressing asylum. All those things are absolutely true, but it’s not within the purview of the executive branch to make those changes.”.",https://media.nbcbayarea.com/2025/10/1019-judges.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=1200%2C675,N,,2025-10-20 12:03:22.703378

In Sarasota, she said a convicted murderer who was an illegal immigrant from Cuba was arrested.

Noem explained that he had a prior removal order in 2008 and is now off the streets. He was also convicted of kidnapping and carjacking.

An illegal immigrant from El Salvador was also arrested. Noem said he was convicted of sexual assault against a child in 1995. He was deported twice and came back.

An illegal immigrant from Mexico was arrested for driving drunk, who was deported once re-entered and was issued a final order of removal in 2016. He was previously arrested for burglary, possession of cocaine, larceny, DUIs, and lewd acts against a minor.

Noem said she is grateful for partnerships such as Alligator Alcatraz and Deportation Depot because it helped with detainment centers that allow Homeland Security to detain individuals until they can be removed.

""It’s more beneficial for the taxpayers, but it also provides the bedspace that we need until these individuals can be removed,"" she shared.

Self-deportation benefits

Noem explained that if people are in this country illegally, the United States will give them $1,000 and buy them a plane ticket to leave.

""Go home to your country and come the right way. If they wait until we detain them and have to remove them ourselves, they will never have the chance to come back to America,"" Noem explained.

However, if they have committed a crime in the United States, they will be prosecuted for those crimes.

Seattle’s Susana Reyes, just shy of finishing her two-year probationary period as an immigration judge, received a termination notice Sept. 19 amid the latest of several waves of firings across the country, according to the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, the umbrella union for a national immigration judges association.

The administration has fired more than 83 immigration judges since President Donald Trump took office, 24 of them in September, according to their union. Roughly 60 more have been forced out or left of their own accord. That leaves fewer than 600 immigration judges nationally to hear roughly 3.8 million pending cases.

Union President Matt Biggs said those quitting are fed up with pressure from the administration, as it carries out a mass deportation effort, to dismiss cases — allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to bypass judges and detain immigrants — or issue rulings unfavorable to immigrants.

The U.S. Department of Justice oversees immigration judges, who are not part of the independent judicial branch. An August Justice Department memo said “notwithstanding an oft-repeated myth to the contrary,” immigration judges can independently decide cases. Yet, the memo warned of “corrective action or discipline” if they do so at odds with the law or its interpretation by their boss: the U.S. attorney general.

The memo went on to say judges’ standards slipped under the Biden administration and the current one is “now forced to take numerous remedial actions.”

As Biggs sees it, the administration’s firing of judges runs counter to its aim of deporting as many people as quickly as possible. To do that, more judges are needed to work through the backlog. The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress in July calls for hiring up to 800 new ones. In addition, the administration is currently training military lawyers to serve as temporary immigration judges.

So getting rid of judges already serving strikes Biggs as “bizarre.” Termination notices, often effective immediately, have given no reasons.

“It does appear on its face that they are targeting judges that were hired during the Biden administration,” Biggs said.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to questions.

In the eyes of the Trump administration, Seattle’s Reyes may have had a couple of strikes against her. She was hired during the Biden administration. And, while many immigration judges previously served as ICE attorneys, she had worked as an immigration lawyer in Texas.

Her rulings were not, however, especially favorable to immigrants who appeared before her. She denied 71% of asylum applications in roughly her first year, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse. That’s about average for Seattle’s immigration court, somewhat higher than the Tacoma immigration court’s denial rate of 66% and significantly above the national average of 57.7%.

“She wasn’t granting a whole lot of cases,” said Seattle immigration lawyer Adam Boyd. He said appearing before her was a pleasant experience. “She treated us with respect. She seemed pretty fair.”

“She was actually listening to my clients,” added Mill Creek immigration attorney Shara Svendsen, who said some immigration judges have been known to yell at immigrants and their attorneys.

Reached by phone, Reyes declined to comment.

Now that she’s off the bench, lawyers are wondering what will happen to cases that were on the judge’s docket. “It doesn’t seem like there’s any plan,” Boyd said. “We’re left guessing.”

Seattle immigration lawyer Brian Wolf said he has not been informed what will happen to a case Reyes was in the middle of deciding. He had a hearing last month before Reyes and she reserved judgment. Wolf doesn’t know whether a new hearing will be held or another judge will issue a decision by reviewing the records.

Seattle’s immigration court, which has more than 50,000 pending cases, according to TRAC, has seven remaining judges.

Meanwhile, uncertainty hangs over Portland’s immigration court. Immigration lawyers have found scheduled hearings before two of the court’s three judges have recently been canceled, according to Jordan Cunnings, legal director for Innovation Law Lab, a nonprofit immigrant rights group. And a member of an immigration lawyers association who liaisons with the court informed colleagues that it will have one judge for the foreseeable future, Cunnings said.

The umbrella union representing judges said no firings have hit the Portland court, and three judges were still listed on its website as of this weekend. It’s possible the judges were reassigned elsewhere, are hearing cases in different cities remotely or have quit or retired.

The Portland court handles not only all of Oregon’s cases but also all of Idaho’s and Alaska’s.

While judges working remotely from other cities could conceivably stand in, Cunnings wondered what will happen if only one judge is left to handle a backlog of nearly 42,000 cases. She said some immigrants have been waiting as long as seven years for a hearing.

“For a case to be set out again is just really devastating for a lot of people,” she said.

Compounding the pain, she said, the July budget bill implemented a new $100 fee for each year that an asylum application is pending. A family of four that waits seven years would have to pay $2,800.

Military lawyers could help tackle the backlog in the Northwest’s immigration courts. Some immigrant advocates don’t see that as a solution, fearing members of the armed services would be more swayed by administration pressure and less schooled in immigration law, an enormously complicated specialty.

Portland immigration lawyer Rachel Game doesn’t see it that way exactly. “I think if they have enough training and they come in with an idea of being neutral arbitrators of the facts … it’s OK,” she said.

“Hardened [Tren de Aragua] gang members are back in Venezuela.
MS-13 gang members are being prosecuted in the U.S. and El Salvador.
A top judge in Washington, D.C. had ordered the Trump administration to turn planes around after learning in an emergency lawsuit that officials were flying the men to El Salvador.
But former Justice Department officials appear frustrated that the Trump administration would effectively be blowing up cases involving alleged gang members that law enforcement spent years investigating to try to win over as cooperators.","Secretary of State Marco Rubio reportedly agreed to abandon confidential informants who were protected by the U.S. government to seal a deal with El Salvador’s president, who agreed to indefinitely detain dozens of Venezuelan deportees in a brutal prison.

The arrangement, inked in the days leading up to Donald Trump’s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport alleged Venezuelan gang members, gave the administration access to the notorious Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, decried by human rights groups as a “tropical gulag” and concentration camp that has been central to a first wave of the president’s mass deportation agenda.

On a March 13 phone call, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele agreed to the deal, on the condition that MS-13 gang members Bukele wanted imprisoned in his jail were actually “informants” protected by the Department of Justice, according to The Washington Post.

Rather than dismissing the idea, Rubio agreed to speak with Attorney General Pam Bondi to abandon those protections, adding another layer to a secret agreement exposed in court documents and reporting in the wake of a months-long ordeal that ultimately led to a prisoner exchange and the release of 250 Venezuelans from CECOT to their home country this summer.

“Americans elected President Trump because they were tired of politicians making excuses,” State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement shared with The Independent.

“The Trump Administration’s results speak for themselves,” he said. “Hardened [Tren de Aragua] gang members are back in Venezuela. American hostages are home. MS-13 gang members are being prosecuted in the U.S. and El Salvador. And Americans are safer as a result of these incredible efforts.”

In his proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act in March, Trump stated that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of [Tren de Aragua], are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.”

But government officials later admitted that “many” of those men did not have criminal records, and many were in the country with legal permission and scheduled to appear in court on their asylum claims.

A top judge in Washington, D.C. had ordered the Trump administration to turn planes around after learning in an emergency lawsuit that officials were flying the men to El Salvador. The administration resisted, provoking an extraordinary legal battle in which Trump himself demanded the judge’s impeachment.

According to The Washington Post, the White House feared that exact scenario if Venezuelans weren’t deported quickly enough.

Trump repeatedly called Rubio about the deal while the secretary was on a multiday trip to Saudi Arabia and Canada earlier this year, the newspaper reported.

While Trump sought a foreign country to facilitate his mass deportation scheme, Bukele needed support from the Justice Department to legitimize his leadership against global criticism for his threats to civil liberties, The Post noted.

Bukele appears to have held up his end of the bargain, effectively acting as a brutal pass-through for Venezuelan deportees. But only one of the nine men Bukele demanded were sent to El Salvador.

It is unclear whether they can keep up with legal battles to prevent their deportation.

But former Justice Department officials appear frustrated that the Trump administration would effectively be blowing up cases involving alleged gang members that law enforcement spent years investigating to try to win over as cooperators.

“It would be very disheartening if I worked my butt off for a year to collect that evidence … to get him into custody, to bring him to justice, just for the Department of Justice or the State Department to turn around and say, ‘OK we’re going to drop all charges,’” Daniel Brunner, a former FBI agent who worked on a joint task force investigating MS-13.

“It would gut me as a case agent,” he told The Washington Post.

After they were flown from immigration detention centers in the middle of the night to CECOT, roughly 250 Venezuelan men were shackled and gang-walked into the brutal maximum-security prison, where their heads were shaved, and then stuffed into jail cells where they lived for more than five months.

They were not allowed to speak with families or lawyers. They never stepped foot outside.

For months, government attorneys and administration officials claimed that the United States did not have jurisdiction over deportees that were locked up in El Salvador. But court filings revealed that authorities in that country told the United Nations that the “legal responsibility for these people lie exclusively” with the U.S. government.

Despite the administration’s claims that those deportees were no longer the responsibility of the United States, officials appeared to be using them as a bargaining chip in a prisoner exchange.

On July 18, following trilateral negotiations with the U.S., Salvadoran and Venezuelan governments, more than 250 Venezuelans jailed inside the facility were returned to their home country, and several Americans were returned from Venezuela’s custody to the United States.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/10/19/20/19/GettyImages-2210245912.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-10-20 12:04:14.485896

In one, officers shoot a pastor in the head with a pepper ball. In another, an officer sprays pepper spray directly into the air vent of a protester dressed in an inflatable frog costume — in an apparent attempt to fill the suit with noxious gas.

This administration’s abuse of immigrants, protesters, and Trump’s perceived enemies appears to be systemic. An August report by Sen. Jon Ossoff’s (D-GA) office identified 510 “credible reports” of human rights abuses in immigration detention facilities since Trump took office in January. ProPublica found that over 170 US citizens have been held by immigration officials, some of whom were beaten or worse.

Even high-ranking elected officials are victims. Last May, for example, federal law enforcement forcibly arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka (D) after Baraka sought a tour of an immigration detention facility. After those charges fell apart, the Trump administration indicted US Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-NJ), who attempted to shield Baraka from arrest. In a video cited by McIver’s attorneys, one of the officers claims that Baraka’s arrest was ordered by US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.

Worse, the Supreme Court — or, at least, its six Republicans — appears to be entirely on board with these tactics. In September, the Republican justices voted to block a lower court order that, among other things, forbade ICE from targeting suspected undocumented immigrants solely because of their race. That case is known as Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo.

The Republican justices rarely explain their decisions when they rule in Trump’s favor, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh did write a concurring opinion explaining why he voted the way he did. His assertion that someone targeted by ICE’s “apparent ethnicity” was “relevant” to law enforcement deciding whom to stop has received the most attention, as Kavanaugh seemed to blow off fears that federal law enforcement is targeting Latinos because of their race. But Kavanaugh also strongly implied that no one victimized by ICE may seek an injunction prohibiting ICE from engaging in illegal tactics in the future. (In the wake of this decision, many commentators are now referring to ICE’s tactics as “Kavanaugh stops.”)

So are there any legal avenues left to challenge abusive tactics by ICE, or by other law enforcement agencies controlled by Trump? The short answer is that a few narrow pathways still exist, but they are unlikely to provide a meaningful check on ICE’s behavior.

Broadly speaking, there are five ways that the law could constrain federal law enforcement:

A federal court might issue an injunction against a law enforcement agency, barring it from continuing to engage in a particular illegal practice. Kavanaugh’s opinion in Vasquez Perdomo, however, suggests that this Supreme Court will not allow such an injunction to stand.

A court might order an individual law enforcement officer to compensate the victim of that officer’s illegal action. The Republican justices, however, have largely cut off this avenue in two decisions handed down in the past five years.

A victim of illegal behavior by a federal law enforcement officer might sue the United States and seek compensation. The Supreme Court’s unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013) suggests that this avenue remains open — although it is unlikely that either Trump or any individual officer will change their behavior because they fear that the US Treasury may have to pay out some money at some future date.

A law enforcement officer, or perhaps a senior law enforcement official, might be criminally prosecuted. Such a prosecution would depend on whether an existing criminal law already prohibits the officer’s activity (or potentially, whether it prohibits an order to an officer given by a senior official). And it is unlikely that any such prosecutions will happen for as long as Trump controls the Justice Department.

Finally, until recently, Trump himself could potentially have been prosecuted if he gave an order that violates federal criminal law. But the Republican justices gave Trump sweeping immunity from prosecution in Trump v. United States (2024).

Let’s look at each of these options in a bit more detail.

“Kavanaugh stops,” and injunctions against law enforcement

It is quite difficult to obtain a court order prohibiting a law enforcement agency from committing an illegal action in the future, and it has been for more than four decades. The seminal case is City of Los Angeles v. Lyons (1983), which held that Adolph Lyons, a man who was allegedly placed in a chokehold by police officers without provocation, could not obtain a court order forbidding the Los Angeles Police Department from using these chokeholds in the future.

Lyons held that “past exposure to illegal conduct” does not permit someone to seek an injunction prohibiting similar conduct in the future. Instead, the Court concluded that “Lyons’ standing to seek the injunction requested depended on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds by police officers.”

To prevail, in other words, Lyons had to show that he personally was likely to be choked a second time, at some point in the future, by a Los Angeles police officer.

In Vasquez Perdomo, Kavanaugh claimed that the plaintiffs’ argument challenging ICE’s actions in that case “largely tracks the theory rejected in Lyons.” The plaintiffs in Vasquez Perdomo alleged that they were stopped by ICE for impermissible reasons, including because they are Latino. But Kavanaugh claimed that they have “no good basis to believe that law enforcement will unlawfully stop them in the future based on the prohibited factors.”

As a factual matter, Kavanaugh’s claim is dubious. A federal appeals court found that “at least one individual with lawful status was stopped twice by roving patrols in just 10 days.” So the fact that ICE targeted this one individual twice in such a short period suggests that they were likely to be targeted again unless a court intervenes. The Trump administration also repeatedly targeted certain businesses where they believed that undocumented people worked — one car wash was hit four times in nine days, according to Justice Sonia Sotomayor’s dissent. So the workers in that car wash sure seemed to be likely to be targeted again in the future.

Ultimately, however, the real facts underlying a Supreme Court case matter a whole lot less than what a majority of the justices say about the facts of a case. Both the Court’s decision in Vasquez Perdomo, and Kavanaugh’s reliance on Lyons in his defense of that decision, suggest that this Court is unlikely to allow anyone who is illegally targeted by ICE to seek an injunction against that law enforcement agency — even if in reality, these very decisions give the Trump administration permission to target the same people over and over again.

The death of Bivens: Why ICE officers can no longer be sued for breaking the law

More than half a century ago, in Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1971), the Supreme Court held that the victim of an unconstitutional action by a federal law enforcement officer could sue that officer and potentially collect money damages directly from them. Bivens explained that an officer who acts unlawfully “in the name of the United States possesses a far greater capacity for harm than an individual trespasser exercising no authority other than his own.” And so it follows that there should be a meaningful remedy to discourage officers from abusing their power.

But this view of accountability has long been out of favor with a majority of the justices. And, in two recent cases, the Court’s Republican majority have come very close to overruling Bivens outright.

In Hernández v. Mesa (2020), the Republican justices ruled that a US Border Patrol agent who allegedly shot and killed a 15-year-old Mexican boy in cold blood could not be sued, even if the boy’s parents could prove that the shooting was unjustified. And, in Egbert v. Boule (2022), the Republican justices immunized Border Patrol agents who allegedly used excessive force against an innkeeper from lawsuits.

Both decisions were exceedingly hostile to Bivens. In Egbert, for example, Justice Clarence Thomas’s majority opinion concluded that courts should reject Bivens suits if there is “any rational reason (even one)” to do so.

Given these decisions, it is safe to say that the current slate of justices will not allow an ICE officer to be sued by their victim, even if the officer clearly violated the law or the Constitution.

Suits against the United States: A weak, but still viable, remedy

The Federal Tort Claims Act frequently permits the United States to be sued if a federal law enforcement officer engages in “assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresentation, deceit, or interference with contract rights.” And the Supreme Court took a fairly expansive view of how this law applies to bad actions by law enforcement in its unanimous decision in Millbrook v. United States (2013), a case about a prisoner who sued corrections officers who allegedly threatened and sexually assaulted him.

So it is likely that even this Supreme Court would allow some victims of illegal activity by ICE, or similar agencies, to sue the federal government and seek compensation from the United States Treasury.

That said, it is doubtful that this remedy will do much to deter future lawless behavior by ICE. Neither an individual law enforcement officer, nor the senior Trump administration officials giving them orders, are likely to change their behavior because, maybe a year from now, a federal judge might order the US Treasury to pay money to someone who was victimized by ICE.

The whole point of Bivens was to impose consequences personally upon rogue officers, so that they will be deterred from breaking the law. A lawsuit requiring US taxpayers to compensate victims is unlikely to achieve the same goal.

Criminal prosecutions: Maybe in the next administration?

Finally, to the extent that any individual law enforcement officer violates a federal criminal statute, they might be prosecuted for doing so. That’s highly unlikely to happen, however, for as long as Trump rules the Justice Department. Any future prosecutions are likely to turn on who wins the 2028 election.

One person who will suffer no criminal consequences, however, no matter how many laws he breaks, is Donald Trump. The Republican justices’ decision in Trump v. United States (2024) held that Trump is immune from prosecution for his official acts as president. That decision even said that he is immune if he orders law enforcement to target someone “for an improper purpose.”

Moreover, even if some law enforcement officer — or maybe some Trump political appointee — is prosecuted for unlawful actions, there is always some risk that the same Republican justices who invented the concept of presidential immunity from prosecution will also decide to immunize officers who were carrying out Trump’s orders. Trump could also use his pardon power to protect them.

So if you hope that ICE officers, and other federal officials who have abused their powers, will someday be held to account for their actions, the news is not good.

The hearing before Judge Sara L. Ellis of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois is shaping up as the latest in a series of confrontations between judges and officials over whether the government is flouting the courts’ authority.

As protests against the Trump administration’s deportation campaign have mounted in the Chicago area, Judge Ellis has ordered limits on how federal agents could use tear gas to disperse crowds.

Plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the administration say the tactics used by federal agents have violated their constitutional rights. Filings in the case document instances of federal agents using pepper balls, pepper spray and tear gas against protesters, journalists and members of the clergy with little or no warning.

Judge Ellis, who was named to the bench by President Barack Obama, found the plaintiffs’ case to be credible enough to issue a temporary order on Oct. 9, barring the use of tear gas and other munitions against protesters throughout the Chicago area “who are not posing an immediate threat.”

Since that order, though, federal agents have been captured on video using tear gas in Chicago neighborhoods, and Judge Ellis said she was “profoundly concerned” that the limits she had set were being violated.

On Friday, Judge Ellis ordered federal agents who have body cameras to turn them on while conducting immigration arrests and while interacting with protesters and other members of the public in the Chicago area. She imposed that requirement over objections from the government about the practicalities of using the cameras and about the extent of judge’s authority.

Judge Ellis has said she wants to question federal officials in court on Monday about their use of tear gas and about two tense incidents in which agents clashed with residents in Chicago.

One of those clashes occurred on Oct. 12 in the Albany Park neighborhood on the city’s Northwest Side, when agents stopped a resident and a crowd formed in reaction. Tear gas was used.

The other clash happened two days later on the South Side, when agents fired tear gas into a crowd that had gathered after a car crash involving federal agents.

Kyle C. Harvick of Customs and Border Protection is expected to appear before the judge on Monday. According to government filings, Mr. Harvick is deputy incident commander of the Trump administration’s Chicago-area deportation operation, which it calls Operation Midway Blitz. The operation began in early September.

In court last week, Judge Ellis sounded frustrated as she cited news reports suggesting that the limits she imposed on the use of tear gas were being disregarded. “I don’t live in a cave,” she said. “I’m seriously concerned that my orders aren’t being followed.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/10/20/multimedia/20NAT-CHICAGO-HEARING-hfpl/20NAT-CHICAGO-HEARING-hfpl-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:27:12.531694

The other, Afghanistan war veteran John Cerrone, was tackled by a group of Ice agents, another video shows.
Representative Maxine Dexter, a Democrat who represents Portland, said military veterans “are literally putting their lives on the line to protest”.","Some of the most decorated military veterans in Congress say they are outraged after a report in the Guardian revealed US military veterans have been arrested or injured amid protests over Donald Trump’s deportation campaign and his push to deploy the national guard to American cities.

“I went to war three times for this country to defend the right of Americans to say things I may not like,” said Representative Jason Crow, a Democrat from Colorado and former army ranger who was awarded the Bronze Star for his service in Iraq as a platoon leader with the 82nd airborne division. “Now is the time for every American to speak out.”

Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois who received a Purple Heart after her helicopter was shot down over Iraq, said: “No one – especially those who have already sacrificed so much for this country – should ever be assaulted, detained or thrown in solitary confinement for peacefully protesting government overreach”.

The Guardian has identified eight instances in which military veterans have been prosecuted or sought damages after being detained by federal agents. Two of those individuals were arrested in late September protesting outside a Chicago-area Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (Ice) facility.

One, 70-year-old air force veteran Dana Briggs, was charged with assault after a video of an incident showed Ice agents advancing on the elderly veteran and knocking him over. The other, Afghanistan war veteran John Cerrone, was tackled by a group of Ice agents, another video shows. Cerrone was detained, held for nine hours in solitary confinement and charged with disorderly conduct.

The justice department says Briggs committed assault when he “made physical contact with an agent’s arm while the agent attempted to extend the safety perimeter”. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokesperson said Cerrone had picked up a teargas canister fired by an Ice agent and thrown it back earlier in the day.

Duckworth countered that “the Trump administration’s meritless claims justifying the need for such excessive force simply aren’t supported by evidence, and even federal judges are recognizing they are not credible or ‘tethered to facts’”.

Illinois Democrat Richard Durbin, the ranking member of the Senate judiciary committee, said: “Any improper use of force by federal law enforcement against Americans, including service members and veterans, undermines our democracy and is a betrayal to our military families who sign up to risk life and limb to protect our nation.”

Republican lawmakers contacted by the Guardian declined to comment or did not respond to the Guardian’s inquiries.

In Portland, video shows an agent grabbing Afghanistan war veteran Daryn Herzberg by the hair and slamming his face into the ground multiple times while saying, “You’re not talking shit any more are you?” according to a Federal Tort Claims Act complaint filed by his attorney.

Herzberg, who has not been charged with a crime, was hospitalized and is seeking $150,000 in damages.

A DHS spokesperson said Herzberg, a former marine sergeant who was honorably discharged in 2012, “is well known for acts of violence outside the Ice facility” and had “used fake blood to falsify injuries”. His attorney denied the allegations.

Representative Maxine Dexter, a Democrat who represents Portland, said military veterans “are literally putting their lives on the line to protest”.

“We are seeing unjustifiable and excessive force at the Portland Ice facility,” said Dexter, a physician who practiced for eight years at the Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. She noted that on 4 October, an 84-year-old demonstrator sustained a concussion when she was rushed and knocked to the ground by federal agents during what the Oregonian newspaper described as a “peaceful protest.”

The woman’s husband, also 84 and a Vietnam war veteran, was also pushed to the ground, the Oregonian reported. According to the newspaper, he was leaning on his walker and wearing his Vietnam veterans cap when federal officers pushed him.

“Free speech and peaceful protest are fundamental rights in America,” said Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. “Few understand this better than the brave men and women who have given so much to defend these rights and freedoms for all of us. Trump’s goal is to incite violence to further his authoritarian grip and quash our fundamental rights. We must all continue to speak out against his un-American power grab and stand up for one another.”

Dexter said she hoped the Trump administration would “lower the temperature” so that the issues that currently divide Americans can be debated without violence.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a9329e4ba506ce92b646ca60615f84e366543bf/960_0_5602_4480/master/5602.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b6dc1ef8dde8c577e01fbd6f73563eca",N,,2025-10-20 08:01:20.020407

Immediately after her release, she began to experience sharp pains in her stomach, according to a claim she filed against the federal government. She gave birth a few days later.

Angie Rodriguez, an immigrant from Colombia, was taken into Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody following a routine check-in with immigration officials in July, and soon after found out she was pregnant. At the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center where she was held, Rodriguez could hardly bring herself to eat the small meals that the detention facility served because of how they looked and smelled, and her only other option was buying processed food like instant noodles and chips.

Rodriguez went on to miscarry while in custody, according to a lawsuit she filed against the federal government.

Antonia Aguilar Maldonano, a mother of two from El Salvador, was arrested by ICE on her way to work and detained at the Kandiyohi County Jail in Minnesota for almost a month. Her youngest child is 22 months old and still nursing; he has acid reflux and an allergy to other forms of milk. The jail was not equipped to house someone who was nursing, said Gloria Contreras Edin, her lawyer: It did not have a breast pump when Aguilar Maldonado arrived, forcing her to use her hands to massage milk out until the facility was able to buy a pump.

Lawyers successfully argued for her release on bond — $10,000, paid for by members of her church — while the government makes the case that she be deported.

A Biden-era policy restricts ICE from arresting or detaining immigrants who are pregnant, postpartum or nursing, except in extreme circumstances. While President Donald Trump has not formally rescinded the policy, it’s clear from lawsuits, news reports and advocates for immigrants who are detained that it’s not being followed.

Quantifying the exact number of pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants in custody has become impossible: This March, Congress let lapse a requirement that the administration report twice a year on how many of these immigrants are being held in immigration facilities. Since the fall of 2019,, Congress had required the Department of Homeland Security to publicly report the count every six months and include “detailed justification” for every single detained immigrant who was pregnant, postpartum or nursing.

ICE did not respond to The 19th’s request for this data.

While the agency said in a statement in August that pregnant immigrants are receiving sufficient care in custody, medical professionals say the conditions in these facilities can heighten the risk for complications. Limited food can impact nutrition at a vulnerable time; access to medical appointments is spotty and often not aligned with standards of care; and pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees also face the stress of arrest and separation from their families.

The impact of arrests and detention

In 2021, following public outcry against the first Trump administration’s immigration policies, the Biden administration directed ICE not to detain pregnant, postpartum or nursing people except in “exceptional circumstances” — they are a national security threat or pose immediate harm to themselves or other people. Those who are detained are supposed to be held in facilities suited to appropriate health care. ICE-employed medical professionals are supposed to provide weekly updates on those detainees to relevant agency directors. The ICE Health Service Corps is also supposed to keep consistent records of all pregnant, postpartum and nursing detainees, providing monthly updates to the organization’s leadership.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has not formally rescinded that policy, but administration officials argued in court that he had done so implicitly through a sweeping anti-immigration executive order that supercharged immigration enforcement. A federal judge refuted that argument, but on its website, ICE says the policy is “not reflective of current practice.”

“We’re seeing more pregnant women detained again after not seeing much of that, at least not in ICE detention,” said Amanda Heffernan, a longtime nurse-midwife and professor of midwifery at Seattle University.

Rebecca Cassler, an attorney at the American Immigration Lawyers Association, said her organization’s pro bono program has seen an increase in cases of detained pregnant, postpartum and nursing people. She says no one outside ICE really knows how many, but it’s enough to make her “very concerned.”

Though the federal government has not made public how many pregnant people have been detained, Democratic lawmakers have published multiple investigations documenting known cases.

One report, published this summer by the office of Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, identified 14 credible cases of pregnant women being mistreated in detention facilities. The report included a description of pregnant women sleeping on cell floors, one detainee being told to “just drink water” when needing medical support, and another miscarrying alone after days of bleeding.

ICE has disputed the report. ”Pregnant women receive regular prenatal visits, mental health services, nutritional support, and accommodations aligned with community standards of care. Detention of pregnant women is rare and has elevated oversight and review. No pregnant woman has been forced to sleep on the floor,” ICE said in a statement on its website.

A September 18 letter signed by 29 Democratic senators and addressed to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem directed federal officials to clarify just how many pregnant, postpartum and breastfeeding people are being detained, how many have been deported and what health care is being made available to them. DHS has not acknowledged receipt, said a spokesperson for Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat from Washington who organized the letter.

“We do not know how many pregnant women are in ICE custody, whether U.S. citizen babies have been born in ICE custody, and what provisions have been made for mothers’ and children’s health, safety, and wellbeing,” the senators wrote.

The Women’s Refugee Commission, an advocacy group, is seeking records from Homeland Security pertaining to pregnant, postpartum or nursing individuals who have been detained. It recently launched its own independent tracker, encouraging health providers, lawyers and family members to submit information about pregnant people who have been detained. The commission said it’s too early to provide an accurate count from its tracker.

Zain Lakhani, a lawyer and director of migrant rights and justice for the commission, said credible reports of pregnant people being detained suggest a frequency higher than ICE’s policy would suggest.

“It would be shocking that we would be able to have this level of detained pregnant people under the guidance,” she said. “We are seeing just this shocking number of detained postpartum and pregnant women.”

Workers helping integrate deported immigrants in Honduras told researchers from the Women’s Refugee Commission that nursing women who were deported had not received enough food and water to continue lactating.

“They arrive with hardly any milk — or milk that looks like water — and this affects the babies’ weight,” one worker said, according to a report published by the organization.

The impact of arrests and detention

By the time Aguilar Maldonado left the jail, her breast milk had started to dry up, Contreras Edin said. She is particularly worried about the impact of detention on her children, who were not with her and now follow her wherever she goes, including to the bathroom. Her boyfriend has been deported; she is asking a judge to let her leave voluntarily — a process that has fewer legal penalties than being deported — so she and her children can follow him.

“Her children were traumatized and her youngest was especially traumatized,” Contreras Edin said. “That bond was broken during detention and that left a permanent impression on her children.”

There is no way to ethically research how detention specifically may affect pregnancy outcomes, including whether it could increase the possibility of miscarriage, said Dr. Carolyn Sufrin, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Johns Hopkins University who studies the reproductive health of incarcerated women. But evidence does show that physical and psychological strain — the kind people can suffer while detained — threatens the health of a pregnancy and can mean greater risk of preterm birth.

“I’m very concerned because of the conditions we’ve already heard about that could be increasing the risks of adverse outcomes,” Sufrin said. “I’m very concerned about the outcomes for these moms as well as for the outcomes for their babies.”

ICE did not respond to a request for comment on the conditions or available accommodations for pregnant, postpartum or nursing immigrants.

Alvarado, who is seeking $1 million following her arrest, citing “the unconstitutional conduct, unlawful arrest, and the tortious conduct of Border Patrol and ICE agents,” said her daughter is healthy and growing. But she’s still dealing with the aftermath of her detention.

Footage of the arrest shows federal agents holding her hands behind her — despite guidance advising that officers generally not use physical restraints on pregnant people and that, if they do, they should keep a pregnant person’s hands in front.

Her husband has now been deported, and Alvarado has no income. She’s watching her savings dwindle and relying on her family to help care for her little girl. She said she was unsure if she’d have to pick up multiple jobs to make ends meet — and if so, who would be able to care for her infant. She remembers the terror she felt while in government custody.

“Every time I see a news or video, it does rewind in my head,” she said. “It does get me very emotional, seeing stuff like that.”

Victoria Petty, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area who is representing Rodriguez — the woman who suffered a miscarriage in detention — said that she first connected with her client’s husband in late August, about a month after his wife’s detention.

He had left Petty a voicemail and text explaining that his wife was pregnant in a detention center and that he was really worried about her. Days later, he called again. “He’s crying on the other line, and he’s like, ‘She had a miscarriage. I don’t know what to do. She’s in the hospital. Help,’” Petty recalled.

Rodriguez described in court records being “unignorably hungry” inside the Bakersfield, California, detention facility and lacking prenatal health care and education for weeks after her pregnancy was confirmed. Eventually, she began to see brown discharge and was taken to an off-site hospital where, days later, health care providers confirmed she had miscarried.

Petty moved quickly to file a lawsuit claiming unconstitutional detention. Court documents show that upon release from the hospital, Rodriguez was placed in medical isolation at the ICE detention center.

“It was very scary. She was in pain. So after this really traumatic experience, and her going to the hospital and confirming that they did not see the fetus on the ultrasound — after all of that, they brought her back to the detention center and put her in medical isolation,” Petty said, adding that her client was distraught.

Petty said it’s hard to determine whether detention conditions caused or contributed to Rodriguez’ miscarriage, a very wanted first pregnancy. But, she said, it’s important to consider the stress of being suddenly detained in a van — her client is from Colombia; kidnappings and murders have left lasting scars on the Latin American nation — along with the strain and lack of food options in detention.

“These are the conditions that she was in when she was pregnant. And we cannot rule out that having been under that level of stress and fear and having that little care contributed to her pregnancy loss,” Petty said.

Heffernan, who has worked with several immigrants who were detained while pregnant, said she has seen pregnant immigrants get a few small accommodations: being placed in a lower bunk instead of the top bunk for sleep or getting extra milk with their meals and sometimes an extra sandwich or snack before bedtime.

Medical care, she said, can be “very haphazard and spotty,” with prenatal appointments often not happening on schedule.

“You do see people getting a prenatal visit here and there, but not in a timely fashion, and not according to the standard of care for people that are outside,” Heffernan said. “For instance, in a couple of people that I’ve been in contact with recently, one had been in detention for several months and had had no prenatal care at all. Another had had one visit.”

Pregnant immigrants are also more vulnerable to more severe cases of COVID-19, flu and other illnesses, which spread quickly in crowded places like detention centers.

There is an extensive list of best practices for detained pregnant and postpartum people, Sufrin said, including but not limited to regular access to comprehensive physical and mental health care, nutrition, the ability to exercise and adequate housing.

But from a medical standpoint, she said, “The best practices would be not to detain them.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ICE_detention_pregnancy_top.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:33:30.804264

“Because we have seen how federal agents take no regard for what your immigration status is,” Jaimes said.
In the days since the incident, a boycott movement targeting Swap-O-Rama has spread online.
“This is not like when you boycott any other major corporation, when you boycott Swap-O-Rama, you’re boycotting a lot of Latino families that depend on this income,” she said.","CHICAGO (WGN) — Vendors at the Swap-O-Rama Flea Market on Ashland Avenue in the Back of the Yards neighborhood say they are struggling, and they’re asking both the public and management for help.

They’re not only calling for better protection but also urging community members to continue showing up to support them.

On top of already low sales, which many vendors attribute to the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers in Chicago, they are now facing a growing boycott from people who believe Swap-O-Rama could have done more to stop federal agents from entering the property.

But vendors warn that the boycott will only hurt working families.

“Don’t punish the vendors for something that’s not their fault. Instead, call for action from the management of Swap-O-Rama,” vendor Maritza Jaimes said.

Jaimes’ parents have been selling boots at the market for decades. She says they, along with many others, are now feeling the impact of fear as low attendance, empty aisles and closed stands are becoming more common.

“Because we have seen how federal agents take no regard for what your immigration status is,” Jaimes said. “You’re just getting racially profiled based on the way you look, so I think people are scared, regardless of their immigration status, to come and open their stand or even to shop here.”

According to Alderwoman Julia Ramirez, it was around 10 a.m. Thursday when more than 20 federal agents arrived at Swap-O-Rama and detained at least 15 people.

In a statement she said, “Yesterday, Saturday, there were very few vendors and customers. It was chilling to see the vacancy. These forms of escalation are instilling fear throughout our city and it’s time for businesses and elected officials alike to work together to create safe spaces on private property.”

One vendor, who asked not to be identified out of fear of losing his stand, shared how serious the situation has become for those who rely on the market as their livelihood.

“It’s a difficult situation for us because we depend on this, on the sales. Some people don’t have a job; this is their life. I understand the community is mad, so are we,” he said.

In the days since the incident, a boycott movement targeting Swap-O-Rama has spread online. Jaimes hopes people think twice.

“This is not like when you boycott any other major corporation, when you boycott Swap-O-Rama, you’re boycotting a lot of Latino families that depend on this income,” she said. “At the end of the day, the vendors still have to pay the rent to management.”

In a statement, Swap-O-Rama responded:

For generations, Swap-O-Rama has been where families build their future and culture thrives. What happened on Oct. 16 caused real pain to individuals and families, to vendors, to customers and to all of us who believe in what this place represents.

Despite the statement, vendors say they haven’t seen any concrete changes.

“Some of those actions that we want to see from Swap-O-Rama is declaring that this is a private space because we know the law is on our side. It is a private space, that’s not even disputable,” Jaimes said.

Jaimes says her parents’ stand has not only supported their family but also helped send her and her siblings to college. Now, vendors are simply asking for protection so they can continue working and providing for their families.",https://wgntv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/snapshot-2025-10-19T173811.915.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-10-20 08:01:42.895099

The large ICE facility that has drawn protests in Illinois, for example, isn’t in Chicago, but rather the suburban village of Broadview.
So the Portland City Council, eager to fill vacant real estate spaces, unanimously backed a compromise.
Portland leaders are trying to take advantage of how unique the situation is.
“Tacoma is an actual detention center,” said Angelita Morillo, a Portland City councilor, “so they can actually disappear people there.”","With President Trump and Portland, Ore., locked in a fierce battle over immigration policies, the city’s leaders face increasing pressure from their progressive constituents to become more creative in the fight.

So Portland leaders are trying the strategy they know best: land use.

Oregon has one of the most complex sets of zoning and land use laws in the nation. Supporters of the policies say they encourage neighborhoods to be walkable and filled with independent businesses while also preserving vast open spaces and farmland. Critics say the rules have stymied housing construction and kept home prices high.

But in the city’s fight against the Trump administration, those land-use rules may prove to be a not-so-secret weapon, in large part because the Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Portland may be uniquely vulnerable to the codes.

“This is so Oregon of us, so Portland of us,” said Elana Pirtle-Guiney, president of the Portland City Council, “to distill a huge federal policy issue that is also a moral issue that is also about the fundamental question of who we are as a country into a land-use problem.”

The General Services Administration, which manages real estate for the federal government, typically leases space for ICE from other government agencies or private prisons in industrial areas that are away from residential centers or popular commuter routes. The large ICE facility that has drawn protests in Illinois, for example, isn’t in Chicago, but rather the suburban village of Broadview.

Yet when federal officials looked to move Oregon’s ICE “subfield office” from a historic post office near downtown Portland 14 years ago, they chose to lease privately owned property just three miles away in the South Waterfront, a showcase for the state’s history of innovative urban design.

That has kept ICE under the intense scrutiny of both protesters and city planners. In mid-September, city leaders issued the owner of the ICE facility, the developer Stuart Lindquist, a land-use violation notice, telling him ICE had breached the terms of their original agreement for the property.

ICE became contentious in the area long before Mr. Trump began his mass deportation campaign. In 2011, when the agency began negotiating to rent and expand a former Bank of America office building on the edge of the waterfront district, residents and business owners worried about what a federal building might look like, the presence of armed officers and “the possibility of demonstrations and/or protest activities,” according to notes from a hearing officer who ruled on the proposal. a .

But neighbors’ biggest concern was that ICE might release dangerous criminals in the neighborhood late at night after buses stopped running. So the Portland City Council, eager to fill vacant real estate spaces, unanimously backed a compromise. ICE was allowed to add 101 parking spots and a 5,198-square foot detention center on one condition: People could not be detained for more than 12 hours or overnight.

That covenant has become ICE’s biggest potential vulnerability. According to the land-use notice issued to ICE’s landlord last month, observers outside the facility who track who enters and leaves noted 25 instances over a 10-month period in which ICE detained people for too long.

“What I appreciate about this approach is that it isn’t a political conversation,” said Natalie Lerner, a board member with the Portland Immigrant Rights Coalition. “This is about data.”

Representatives of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.

The property owner, who has filed paperwork contesting some of the city’s evidence, faces monthly fines that start at about $1,000 if he does not fix the problem. The federal government rents the building for more than $2.4 million annually.

The more serious conversation will come later this month, when city regulators are scheduled to begin reconsidering ICE’s conditional-use permit for the building. Eventually, the matter could end up in front of the full City Council, whose members have been outspoken in their opposition to the president’s plan to send the National Guard to Portland. For now, they said they must choose their words carefully about the ICE building’s future because they may have to rule on it.

Protesters are not so reticent. On Oct. 12,Holly Brown, an organizer, put the demands on city hall succinctly at an anti-ICE rally. “You can’t just sit there doing nothing. You must act to get ICE out of Portland.” She then led the crowd of 100 or so people in a chant of “revoke the permit.”

Leaders in other cities facing ICE protests and potential federal military force are also looking for ways to use the tools of local government to assert their authority. In Broadview, Ill., town leaders successfully convinced a court to force ICE to remove a fence around the immigration processing facility because it was erected without a permit.

But the Broadview facility and most of the buildings in which immigration officers detain people are owned by either the federal government, a private prison company or another government entity, according to records from the General Services Administration, and are thus harder to regulate through permitting and taxes.

Portland leaders are trying to take advantage of how unique the situation is. When the Homeland Security secretary, Kristi Noem, visited the city earlier this month, she demanded that officers with the Portland Police Bureau close off a one-block radius around the building and limit how close protesters can go. Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson, said that was both against city values and simply not feasible in a quasi-residential neighborhood with few routes in or out.

Mr. Wilson said Corey Lewandowski, an adviser to Ms. Noem, suggested during their meeting that the city might consider buying the property or taking over ICE’s lease. The mayor rejected that idea.

“I would love for this facility to be somewhere else, because South Waterfront is about the worst place you could put it,” Mr. Wilson said. “But this is something the federal government has to figure out. We just want them to comply with our laws.”

It is not clear if Portland leaders actually have the power to fully revoke the permit or simply make detaining people much harder, if not impossible. Some immigration advocates wonder whether that’s even a good idea. If ICE cannot hold detainees in Portland, the next option is to send them two and a half hours away to the Northwest Immigration Detention Center in Tacoma, a 1,575-bed campus that can be hard for lawyers to access and even harder for detainees to leave.

The state of the Justice Department Reuveni is not alone in identifying a troubling pattern of behavior at the Department of Justice.
""The one entity, or person, or institution that gets hurt the most is the Justice Department,"" Goodman said.
He said he'd never advised a Justice Department attorney to violate a court order.","Erez Reuveni, a fired Department of Justice lawyer who's now blowing the whistle, says he witnessed a disregard of due process and for the rule of law at the DOJ.

Reuveni previously won commendations for his work and was so effective defending President Trump's first-term immigration policy that he was promoted quickly in Mr. Trump's second term. But he says he was put on leave and then fired after refusing to sign a brief in the mistaken deportation case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Reuveni's whistleblower disclosure helped highlight a growing concern in many courts across the country that the Justice Department is allegedly abusing the limits of the law.

""I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. And my view of that oath is that I need to speak up and draw attention to what has happened to the department, what is happening to the rule of law,"" Reuveni said. ""I would not be faithfully abiding by my oath if I stayed silent right now.""

From devoted DOJ lawyer to shock over orders

Reuveni says he knew he wanted to be involved in public service before he started law school. He started at the Department of Justice in 2010 and was there for 15 years defending the policies of several presidents, regardless of political party. Reuveni specialized in immigration law and, during Mr. Trump's first term, he defended the controversial ban on travelers from predominantly Muslim countries, among many other cases.

""I defended everything they put on my plate. That was my job,"" he said.

Shortly after Mr. Trump's return to office, Reuveni was selected to be the acting deputy director of the Department of Justice's immigration section, overseeing about a hundred attorneys and every case that arose in the federal district courts.

On March 14, the same day he found out about his promotion, Reuveni and others were called to a meeting with Emil Bove, number three at the Justice Department. Bove was also once Mr. Trump's criminal defense attorney.

According to Reuveni, they were told the president would be invoking the Alien Enemies Act, a law not invoked since World War II, to allow rapid expulsion of citizens of enemy nations during a time of war. Without a declared war, the administration used it for a mass deportation of more than 100 Venezuelans the government said were terrorists.

The Venezuelans were to be denied the right to be heard by a judge and Reuveni said Bove expected a challenge.

""Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what,"" Reuveni said. ""Then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, 'f*** you.'""

Reuveni says he was shocked.

""I felt like a bomb had gone off,"" he said. ""Here is the number three official using expletives to tell career attorneys that we might just have to consider disregarding federal court orders.""

""A real gut punch""

The next day, a Saturday, lawyers for some of the prisoners sued. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia called a hearing and asked government lawyer Drew Ensign whether the planes were leaving that weekend.

Ensign told Boasberg he didn't know whether the planes were leaving that weekend, even though Reuveni says he was at the same meeting where they were told the planes would be taking off over the weekend, no matter what. Reuveni said that moment in court was ""stunning.""

""It is the highest, most egregious violation of a lawyer's code of ethics to mislead a court with intent,"" he said.

Ensign's intent is unknown. It was during the hearing that planes took off.

The judge issued an order and, immediately, Reuveni emailed the agencies involved, writing ""...the judge specifically ordered us to not remove anyone … and to return anyone in the air.""

But that didn't happen. Instead, more than five hours after that order, the deported prisoners arrived at a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

""And then it really hit me. It's like, we really did tell the court, screw you. We really did just tell the courts, we don't care about your order. You can't tell us what to do,"" Reuveni said. ""That was just a real gut punch.""

While the Department of Justice can disagree with and appeal orders, it is required to obey all court orders when they're in effect, according to Peter Keisler, who ran the department as acting attorney general for a time in 2007 for then-President George W. Bush.

Keisler said that detainees must be given the chance to contest the charges, even if those being deported are terrorists or gang members. He emphasized that there are lawful means to get terrorists out of the country.

""We have a saying in this country. It's deeply embedded in who we are. Everybody deserves their day in court,"" Keiseler said. ""And all of us want to know that if the government acts against us, we will at least have the opportunity to go to a neutral decision-maker, present evidence and legal argument, and make sure that the government stays within its legal bounds.""

What happened in the Abrego Garcia case

When more facts were known about the weekend flights, it turned out a Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had been deported by mistake.

While people deported in error are normally returned, Reuveni said that in a phone call from a superior, he was ordered to argue that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member and a terrorist to prevent his return.

""I respond up the chain of command, no way. That is not correct. That is not factually correct. It is not legally correct. That is, that is a lie. And I cannot sign my name to that brief,"" Reuveni said.

Reuveni said what was important was not whether or not Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13 or a terrorist, but whether or not he received due process.

""What's to stop them if they decide they don't like you anymore, to say you're a criminal, you're a member of MS-13, you're a terrorist,"" Reuveni said. ""What's to stop them from sending in some DOJ attorney at the direction of DOJ leadership to delay, to filibuster, and if necessary, to lie? And now that's you gone and your liberties changed.""

Reuveni was fired after refusing to sign a brief that called Abrego Garcia a terrorist. In June, he filed a whistleblower complaint with the help of attorneys from the Government Accountability Project.

The state of the Justice Department

Reuveni is not alone in identifying a troubling pattern of behavior at the Department of Justice. Ryan Goodman, a New York University law professor who heads a nonpartisan law journal, ""Just Security,"" said his team has analyzed hundreds of suits filed against the Trump administration. He published his team's study online.

""We found over 35 cases in which the judges have specifically said, what the government is providing me is false information. It might be intentionally false information, including false sworn declarations time and again,"" Goodman said.

In court records compiled by Goodman, Democratic and Republican appointed judges are critical of the Trump Justice Department's work. One judge described it as ""...highly misleading..."" Another judge warned that ""trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks.""

""The one entity, or person, or institution that gets hurt the most is the Justice Department,"" Goodman said.

60 Minutes requested interviews with Attorney General Pam Bondi, her former deputy Emil Bove, and Drew Ensign, the attorney who said he didn't know when the planes were taking off, according to the court transcript. All declined 60 Minutes' requests.

Bove, who was nominated for a judgeship, was asked in June about Reuveni's claims during a confirmation hearing. He said he'd never advised a Justice Department attorney to violate a court order. Bove said, in part, that Reuveni was in no position to tell his superiors what to do.

""There's a suggestion that a line attorney, not even the head of the Office of Immigration Litigation, was in a position or considered himself to be, to bind the department's leadership and other cabinet officials,"" Bove said.

Bove was confirmed for the judgeship. And in a statement to 60 Minutes he wrote, ""...Mr. Reuveni's claims are a mix of falsehoods and wild distortions of reality …""

While wary of compromising this independence, he said the ABS was prepared to step in when statements being made in the public arena using agency data was “flat-out contradicted by the statistical evidence”.

The ABS took the relatively unusual step on 22 August of issuing a press statement publicly contradicting rightwing claims which misused overseas arrivals figures in order to make “inaccurate conclusions” to support inflated claims of mass migration. The figures count people coming in and out of the country, but not necessarily staying.

Gruen rejected those claims, saying the decision to release a clarifying media statement was made by ABS experts within the division responsible for issuing the data.

The Supreme Court of India recently ruled that Criminal Courts cannot review or recall their judgments except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors, while setting aside a Delhi High Court order that had reopened perjury proceedings in a corporate dispute.

A Bench of Chief Justice B. R. Gavai and Justice Augustine George Masih set aside the High Court order that had recalled its earlier decision dismissing a petition for initiating perjury proceedings in a long-running dispute.

“The Criminal Courts, as envisaged under the Cr. P. C, are barred from altering or reviewing their own judgments except for the exceptions which are explicitly provided by the statute, namely, correction of a clerical or an arithmetical error that might have been committed or the said power is provided under any other law for the time being in force. As the courts become functus officio the very moment a judgment or an order is signed, the bar of Section 362 Cr. P. C becomes applicable, this, despite the powers provided under Section 482 Cr. P. C which, this veil cannot allow the courts to step beyond or circumvent an explicit bar,” the Supreme Court observed.

Background Facts

The Bakshi and Khosla Groups entered into a December 2005 agreement to develop a resort at Kasauli through Montreaux Resorts Private Limited. A March 2006 agreement gave Vikram Bakshi a 51% stake and placed Vinod Surha and Wadia Prakash on the board.

Dispute Over Shareholding

Sonia Khosla claimed her shareholding was reduced from 49% to 36%.

She filed a company petition before the Company Law Board in 2007 alleging oppression and mismanagement.

She alleged that AGM minutes filed by the Bakshi Group were forged and sought prosecution for perjury under Section 340 Cr. P. C, first before the Company Law Board and later the High Court.

Supreme Court’s 2014 Direction

In 2014, the Supreme Court directed that both the company petition and the perjury application be decided by the Company Law Board (now National Company Law Tribunal) and restrained the High Court from proceeding further.

High Court Proceedings and Recall

In 2019, R. P. Khosla filed another application in the High Court alleging that the Bakshi Group had filed a false counter-affidavit in related contempt proceedings.

The High Court dismissed it in August 2020, citing the 2014 Supreme Court order.

The Khosla Group then sought recall, arguing that the Company Petition had been withdrawn in February 2020 but the fact was not placed before the court earlier.

The High Court accepted this and recalled its judgment on May 5, 2021, prompting the present appeal.

Arguments Presented

The Khosla Group defended the High Court’s order, arguing that it had exercised procedural review to correct a factual mistake and had not conducted a substantive review of the case.

Legal Provisions and Judicial Interpretation

The law relating to the power of a Criminal Court to review or alter its own judgment or order is governed by Section 362 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P. C), which is equivalent to Section 403 of the Bhartiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.

Text of Section 362 Cr. P. C

“362. Court not to alter Judgment.–– Save as otherwise provided by this Code or by any other Law, for the time being in force, no Court, when it has signed its Judgment or final Order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error.”

Comparison with the Code of Civil Procedure

The analogous provision of this Section 362 is found in Section 152 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. However, this section permits corrections of only clerical or arithmetical mistakes or errors arising from accidental slips or omissions. The scope is very much restricted and cannot go beyond the correction of accidental slips or omissions.

Judicial Interpretation by the Supreme Court

The comparison of the power of review of a Civil Court vis-à-vis the power of a Criminal Court to review or recall its own judgment or order arising out of criminal proceedings has been clarified by numerous decisions of the Supreme Court of India. These judgments have consistently held that Criminal Courts become functus officio upon pronouncement of the judgment and are barred from review except to correct clerical or arithmetical mistakes.

Conclusion

Thus, the law on the issue can be summarized as follows:

The Criminal Justice Delivery System does not empower the court to add or delete any words after pronouncement of the judgment.

Only clerical or arithmetical errors can be corrected under Section 362 Cr. P. C.

A clerical or arithmetical error is an error occasioned by an accidental slip, apparent on the face of the record, and not dependent on argument or disputation.

An arithmetical error is a mistake in calculation, and a clerical error is a mistake in writing or typing.

Legal Position

Case: Sankatha Singh Vs. State of U.P. (1962 AIR 1208)

In “Sankatha Singh Vs. State of U.P.” (1962 AIR 1208), when a Criminal Appeal came for hearing before the Trial Court, the Trial Court dismissed the appeal, noticing that the appellants had been absent and their counsel had not appeared to argue the appeal. The Court also observed that it had perused the Judgment of the Magistrate and seen the record, finding no ground for interference.

An application was filed before the Appellate Court for restoration of the Appeal which was allowed by the Learned Sessions Judge. However, when the Appeal was again listed for hearing, the Learned Judge took the view that the Appellate Court had no power to review or restore an Appeal which had been disposed of. The Appeal was dismissed. The Criminal Revision was filed in the High Court, which too was dismissed.

The Supreme Court in the above case considered Section 369 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 (now Section 362 of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973). The Hon’ble Supreme Court held that Section 369 of the Code prohibited the Courts from reviewing or altering its Judgment.

“It has been urged for the appellants that Shri Tej Pal Singh could order the rehearing of the appeal in the exercise of the inherent powers… Inherent powers cannot be exercised to do what the Code specifically prohibits the court from doing… when Section 369 of the Code definitely prohibited the court’s reviewing or altering its judgment, he had no jurisdiction to consider the point raised and to set aside the order dismissing the appeal and order its rehearing.”

Case: Smt. Sooraj Devi Vs. Pyare Lal & Anr. (AIR 1981 SC 736)

In “Smt. Sooraj Devi Vs. Pyare Lal & Anr.” (AIR 1981 SC 736), Section 362 Cr. P. C. came under consideration. The Hon’ble Supreme Court laid down:

“The appellant points out that he invoked the inherent power of the High Court saved by Section 482… It is true that the prohibition in Section 362 against the court altering or reviewing its Judgment is subject to what is ‘otherwise provided by this Court or by any other law for the time being in force’… The inherent power of the Court is not contemplated by the saving provision contained in Section 362 and, therefore, the attempt to invoke that power can be of no avail.”

Law Settled on Criminal Court’s Power to Recall or Review Judgment

A Criminal Court has no power to recall or review its own Judgment.

The only permissible action is to correct or rectify clerical errors under Section 403 BNSS (Section 362 CrPC).

Case: Simrikhia Vs. Dolley Mukherjee & Chhabi Mukherjee & Anr. (1990) 2 SCC 4379

In this case, the Court referred to earlier judgments and reiterated that the inherent power of the High Court cannot override the bar of review under Section 362 CrPC.

“The inherent jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be invoked to override bar of review u/s 362… The Court is not empowered to review its own decision under the purported exercise of inherent power.”

Case: State of Kerala Vs. M. M. Manikantan Nair (2001) 4 SCC 752

A Three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court held that Cr. P. C. does not authorize the High Court to review its Judgment or Order passed in appellate, revisional, or original jurisdiction. Section 362 Cr. P. C. explicitly prohibits such review except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors.

Case: Hari Singh Mann Vs. Harbhajan Singh Bajwa & Ors. (2001) 1 SCC 169

The Supreme Court reiterated that once a matter is finally disposed of, the court becomes functus officio and cannot entertain fresh prayer for the same relief.

Case: State Vs. K.V. Rajendran & Ors. (2008) 8 SCC 673

The Supreme Court again discussed Sections 362 and 482 CrPC, observing:

“No court which has signed its judgment and final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the same except to correct clerical or arithmetical error save as otherwise provided by the court.”

Case: Sanjeev Kapoor Vs. Chandana Kapoor & Ors. (2020) 13 SCC 172

It was reiterated that Section 362 Cr. P. C. imposes an embargo on a Criminal Court to alter or review its own Judgment. Review or alteration is permissible only if:

Explicitly provided by the Cr. P. C. itself, or

By any other law in force.

Case: Grindlays Bank Ltd. Vs. Central Government Industrial Tribunal & Ors. (1980 Supp SCC 420)

The Supreme Court differentiated between:

Type of Review Description Procedural Review Inherent or implied in a court to set aside a palpably erroneous order passed under misapprehension. Substantive Review Correction of an error of law apparent on the face of the record; not permitted unless provided by statute.

Case: Budhia Swain & Ors. Vs. Gopinath Deb & Ors. (1999) 4 SCC 396

The Supreme Court clarified grounds on which a Criminal Court may recall or review its Judgment:

Proceedings suffer from an inherent lack of jurisdiction.

Fraud has been played upon the Court to obtain the order.

Mistake of the Court causing prejudice to a party.

Non-service to a necessary party or death of a party whose estate was not represented.

These exceptions apply only if such grounds were not available during the original action.

Case: Ganesh Patel Vs. Umakant Rajoria (2022 SCC OnLine SC 2050)

The Hon’ble Supreme Court held that an application for recall seeking a procedural review (not substantive review) is permissible. The High Court was justified in recalling an earlier order passed in absence of the Respondent based on false information.

Summary of Jurisprudence Under Section 362 Cr. P. C.

Criminal Courts are barred from altering or reviewing their own Judgments except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors.

Courts become functus officio once a Judgment or Order is signed.

Section 482 Cr. P. C. cannot be used to circumvent the explicit bar under Section 362.

Only procedural reviews are permitted in rare circumstances; substantive reviews are barred.

The bar under Section 362 Cr. P. C. is to be applied stricto sensu (strictly and literally).

Supreme Court Findings

The Supreme Court, while setting aside the High Court’s May 5, 2021 Order and restoring its August 13, 2020 judgment dismissing the petition for initiating perjury proceedings, held that proceedings under Section 340 Cr. P. C are criminal in nature and governed exclusively by the Cr. P. C. It found that a review application under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 was not maintainable in such matters.

“Considering that the proceedings initiated under section 340 of Cr. P. C are of criminal nature and governed by the provisions of Cr. P. C which is a self-contained Code, and includes entire procedure within itself to deal with the proceedings initiated under its provisions, there is no scope for application of provisions of any other procedural law until specifically provided under such law”, the Court held.

Nature of Criminal Proceedings

The Supreme Court reiterated that Criminal Courts become functus officio once a judgment is signed and can only correct clerical or arithmetical errors or act in rare situations such as fraud, lack of jurisdiction, or denial of hearing. From various precedents, the Court outlined the following exceptional circumstances wherein a criminal court is empowered to alter or review its own judgment or a final order under Section 362 Cr. P. C:

Exceptional Circumstances Permitting Review under Section 362 Cr. P. C

Such power is expressly conferred upon the Court by Cr. P. C or any other law for the time being in force; or

The Court passing such a judgment or order lacked inherent jurisdiction to do so; or

A fraud or collusion is being played on the Court to obtain such judgment or order; or

A mistake on the part of the Court caused prejudice to a party; or

Facts relating to non-serving of necessary parties or death leading to estate being non-represented, not brought to the notice of the Court while passing such judgment or order.

None of these exceptions, the Court said, applied to the present case.

Case-Specific Findings

The Court also noted that the Khosla Group had withdrawn the Company Petition months before the High Court’s August 2020 judgment but stated that it was still pending. Since this fact was available at the time of the original hearing, it could not later be used to justify recall.

“Such an act to undermine the finality of the judicial proceedings cannot be permitted especially in such situations of deliberate omissions or misrepresentation on the part of the parties before the court and thereafter attempting to defend themselves and obtaining the verboten order dated 05.05.2021, substantially reviewing and recalling the Judgment dated 13.08.2020, under the garb of ‘procedural review’ which is impermissible”, the Court observed.

Conclusion

The legislative scheme as delineated by Section 369 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, as well as by Section 362 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, is one and the same. Section 362 of the Cr. P. C. clearly provides that no Court, when it has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case, shall alter or review the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error.

This is, however, subject to any other provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being in force. Thus, Section 362 of Cr. P. C. places an embargo prohibiting the Court from altering or reviewing its judgment or final order, and this embargo is relaxed only in two conditions:

Condition Description 1. When provided under the Code The review of a judgment or final order is expressly provided for within the Code of Criminal Procedure itself. 2. When provided by other law The review of a judgment or final order is authorized under any other law for the time being in force.

The embargo placed on Criminal Courts to alter or review their judgments serves a specific purpose and objective. The judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, as noted above, summarize the law to the effect that the Criminal Justice Delivery System does not clothe Criminal Courts with the power to alter or review a judgment or final order disposing of a case, except to correct clerical or arithmetical errors.

After a judgment is delivered or a final order disposing of the case is passed, the Court becomes functus officio. Any mistake or glaring omission is left to be corrected only by the appropriate forum in accordance with law.

An apostolic constitution like this is one of the most authoritative ways the Roman Catholic Church teaches, all the more because Gaudium et Spes was the fruit of an ecumenical council.","Pope Leo XIV told United States Catholic bishops Oct. 8 that ""the church cannot be silent"" in the face of the Trump administration's brutal mass deportation efforts. The day before, Leo published the first document of his pontificate, Dilexi Te, in which he insisted the Catholic Church must assist ""the least among us,"" explicitly including vulnerable migrants because ""the Church has always recognized in migrants a living presence of the Lord.""

The church was not silent Oct. 11 near Chicago, as roughly 1,000 Roman Catholics processed in prayer, traveling a little more than a mile from a nearby Catholic parish to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Broadview, Illinois. They had hoped to send eight people into the facility to distribute Holy Communion. I spoke with several people who were there.

The procession was organized by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership, which is rooted in Roman Catholic faith and community organizing — both native flowers that bloom naturally in Chicago. Michael Okinczyc-Cruz, CSPL's executive director, explained to me that CSPL discussed potential responses once the Trump administration announced Operation Midway Blitz, the federal government’s Chicago-area immigration crackdown last month. He said, ""We discerned that we can bring Communion.""

One such example was holding a Mass on Sept. 13 outside the Naval Station Great Lakes in North Chicago, a military base serving as a staging spot for ICE agents, modeled after similar moments of resistance in Poland and El Salvador. Another was the Oct. 11 eucharistic procession.

Bringing Communion in these ways is spiritually powerful among Roman Catholics, and it gives an extraordinary public witness. Roman Catholics believe that Jesus Christ really is present in the bread and the wine offered in the Eucharist. The implications are complex. DePaul University professor William Cavanaugh argued in a 1998 book that the Eucharist is a specific response to violence against human beings — the humanity of the suffering person is restored and affirmed by bringing the suffering of Jesus close in a way that is present.

There is another sense in which Jesus becomes present for Catholics. Scripture tells us that believers together are the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12-27). When Catholics assemble for Mass, or when 1,000 Catholics march in prayer led by the Jesus present in the Eucharist, they bring the suffering of Jesus in bread and their bodies to the suffering of ICE detention.

A group organized by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership distributes Communion near the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Illinois, Oct. 11, 2025. (Photo used with permission of the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership)

Sr. Christin Tomy, who was part of the procession, said: ""To pair what is happening with the centrality of our eucharistic identity was very powerful. It felt very much like 'Become what you receive.' "" And, she said, it came from ""a deep respect for our call to be a eucharistic people.""

Once the procession reached the detention facility, Fr. Larry Dowling, a retired Chicago priest, told me, ""there was no one, zero Homeland Security standing outside."" Only Illinois State Police greeted the procession. Department of Homeland Security officials would not speak directly with the procession or its leaders, and messages would need to be relayed through state police, he said.

As messages were sent back and forth to see whether procession representatives might be allowed into the facility to distribute Communion, Okinczyc-Cruz said, the procession began spontaneously to sing ""Pan de Vida,"" which goes, ""We are the dwelling of God, fragile and wounded and weak. We are the body of Christ, called to be the compassion of God.""

Finally, a response came from ICE: an ""unequivocal no, with no reason or justification,"" Okinczyc-Cruz told me. ""They denied our invitation to bring Christ into the detention center.""

Still, Sister Christin, Father Larry and others distributed Communion to the procession. Fr. Dan Hartnett offered a prayer of spiritual communion for those inside the detention center. And, as peacefully as they came, the procession departed. They did not do all they went to Broadview to do, but accomplished a lot.

'They denied our invitation to bring Christ into the detention center.'

Spiritually, the reality of the church was present in a powerful way. God and God's people came to bear witness and show care for the vulnerable, suffering people in detention who were separated from their lives, their loved ones and even from their rights as believers. Among believers, this is important.

But something more practical and political was learned, too, as Dowling drew an additional conclusion about ICE's refusal to let clergy inside: ""They are afraid of people of faith,"" he said.

A few months ago, I wrote about how ICE was not honoring its own rules about granting detainees access to chaplains, pastoral care and religious services. Since then, and since Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski shined light on the problem, people I know in an ICE facility have gotten access consistently to a priest. Pressure from religious groups works, but there will need to be more of it.

This means the church must continue to show up. As another person who was there Oct. 11 told me, ""Saturday was life-giving. I wish we could do it daily until they let them in to share the Eucharist.""

Gaudium et Spes, the Second Vatican Council's Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, names ""arbitrary imprisonment"" and ""deportation"" alongside ""murder, genocide, abortion [and] euthanasia"" as ""infamies"" that ""poison human society"" and ""are supreme dishonor to the Creator."" An apostolic constitution like this is one of the most authoritative ways the Roman Catholic Church teaches, all the more because Gaudium et Spes was the fruit of an ecumenical council. The bishops of the world affirmed the text together with Pope John XXIII. This is not something Catholics can take lightly.

Still, some do. It is such a problem that Leo wonders in Dilexi ""why many people continue to think that they can safely disregard the poor"" and vulnerable like migrants. Scripture and church teaching are so consistent that, seeming nearly to be shaking his head, Leo tells us perhaps some people need to ""go back and re-read"" them.

Often, the problem is a partisan commitment. We place our political party ahead of giving consistent witness to our faith. Sometimes we hear arguments about the right of the nation to secure its borders, as though migrants seeking safety or a better life are like a military invasion. Instead, we should know that ""God intended the earth with everything contained in it for the use of all human beings and peoples,"" as quoted in Gaudium et Spes. God did not draw borders.

Some would urge us not to accompany the poor and the vulnerable because it could be dangerous. We do take risks when we oppose a regime that dehumanizes people created and loved by God. Our personal safety cannot always be guaranteed, even when Catholic leaders are doing the accompanying.

Yet the church must not be silent. Sometimes, it will not be safe. Sometimes we are called to take up our cross and follow (Matthew 16:24).

We outnumber the fascists, we outnumber the Nazis, we outnumber the white supremacists, we outnumber the oppressors.
Trump on Sunday called the nationwide protest a “joke,” “small and ineffective.” He also alleged that the protest was paid for by ""[George] Soros and other radical-left lunatics.""

“What does it mean to be a revolutionary? To be a revolutionary means that you wake up in the morning and you realize that something needs to change,” Anthony Bryson of SoCal Uprising said during the demonstration. “You realize that the Trump regime is a representation of the rise of fascism in America.”

A post shared by Long Beach Watchdog (@lbwatchdog)

Bryson and other protesters denounced immigration raids, capitalism, genocides around the world, including Palestine, Congo and Sudan, and moves by President Donald Trump and his administration to consolidate power through stacking courts, gerrymandering and skirting the checks and balances established by the U.S. Constitution.

“What does it mean to say no kings? It means no fucking kings,” Bryson said. “When the administration comes up and they stack everything against us, remember that we have the strength, we have the power. We outnumber the fascists, we outnumber the Nazis, we outnumber the white supremacists, we outnumber the oppressors. United through our struggle we can bring real change”

Organizers estimate that more than 7 million people gathered to protest at more than 2,700 demonstrations in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., which would make it the third largest protest in American history behind the George Floyd protests of 2020 and Earth Day 1970.

Saturday’s nationwide turnout surpassed June’s No Kings event by about 2 million people, according to estimates.

Trump on Sunday called the nationwide protest a “joke,” “small and ineffective.” He also alleged that the protest was paid for by ""[George] Soros and other radical-left lunatics.""

“I’m not a king,” Trump told reporters. ""I work my ass off to make our country great, that’s all it is. I’m not a king at all.”

Chris Kluwe, a former NFL punter and activist who found himself tossed into the political spotlight after being arrested earlier this year for protesting a MAGA plaque during a Huntington Beach City Council meeting, addressed the crowd.

“I know we feel fear. I know we feel disappointment at how our elected officials have not stood up for us. And I know for me personally, and I think for a lot of you as well, you feel anger,” Kluwe said. “It's not a violent anger. It's not what the right wing says. We're not violent terrorists. We're not paid protesters. We are here because we are angry at what is going on with our country, and it is okay for us to acknowledge that anger.”

Kluwe then invited the crowd to scream with him as a therapeutic and nonviolent way to alleviate stress and anger over Trump administration actions. But he asked protesters to hold onto that spark of anger as they continue to push back.

Kluwe, who was fired from his coaching job at Edison High School after his arrest, is now running for a seat in the California State Assembly for District 72.

Gray Wolf, 80, a member of the Yoeme tribe and an elder with the American Indian Movement, said he has been protesting since he was 15 years old, including Standing Rock and Oak Flat.

“I can see where we're heading. In 20 years or less, this will no longer be a white majority. It will be a white minority,” Gray Wolf told the Watchdog. “The white majority right now is trying to hang on to power as long as they can. It's obvious that Trumpo the Clown wants an all white nation, and it's not going to happen. People like us are just not going to let it happen.”

Wayne Theis, 64, a Marine Corps veteran and Long Beach resident, said it’s important for people to “stand up to the tyranny of Donald Trump.”

“Vets should know better than anybody. When we took that oath before we went to boot camp, that oath said that we were here to defend the Constitution, not to one man or any party,” Theis told the Watchdog Saturday. “I remember that every day, but it's not being followed. And the people that are in Congress are as responsible as [Trump] is because they're allowing him to do this with no pushback whatsoever.”",https://lbwatchdog.com/content/images/size/w1200/2025/10/NO-KINGS-2.0_3362.jpg,N,,2025-10-20 07:27:50.004437

On Saturday night, the San Jose Sharks hosted their ninth annual “Los Tiburones” game against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The night was meant to celebrate the Bay Area’s Hispanic culture — “tiburones” is Spanish for “sharks” — and while there were quite a few events that did just that, an unfortunate error made the night take an entirely different context.

During the first intermission, the San Jose Sharks showed fan messages on their scoreboard, as they do for every game. During that time, a message slipped through which would be seen in bad taste under any circumstances, but took on an even darker context on “Los Tiburones” night.

ICE stands for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a federal law enforcement agency that has been especially controversial over the last year for their overzealous enforcement of immigration laws, especially in the Hispanic community.

After the message was publicized on social media, the San Jose Sharks issued the following statement:

The protesters oppose the Italian government led by Giorgia Meloni and the European Union’s funding and training of the Libyan Coast Guard to intercept illegal immigrants attempting to cross to Europe.

The 2017 agreement has faced growing criticism after several investigations revealed that EU-funded detention centers in Libya are run by individuals described as “human traffickers.” The deal is set to be renewed next month.

During the protest, dozens of illegal immigrants from Sub-Saharan African countries shared their experiences in Libya, and participants observed a minute of silence to honor those who died trying to cross the sea.

But in his first television interview, Erez Reuveni told us, he's paid a price: speaking up cost him his dream.
Most lawyers at the Justice Department stay for years, even decades, defending the policies of one president after another.
Erez Reuveni: Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what.
Ryan Goodman: The one entity, or person, or institution that gets hurt the most is the Justice Department.","Erez Reuveni was on his way up. He was an attorney in the Department of Justice who was so effective defending President Trump's first-term immigration policy, that he was promoted right away in Trump's second term. But Reuveni's 15-year Justice Department career ended suddenly after, he says, he witnessed government lawyers lying in court and evading orders of a judge. These last few months have been a time of upheaval in the Justice Department. Now, Reuveni's claims are raising concern in courtrooms across the country. The administration has called Reuveni a leaker seeking five minutes of fame. But in his first television interview, Erez Reuveni told us, he's paid a price: speaking up cost him his dream.

Erez Reuveni: Even before I went to law school, I understood what I wanted to do as a lawyer was to be involved in public service. And everyone understood at the time. You do it at the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C. There's no better place as a young attorney to just do the sorts of cases where you're standing up in court as a first-chair attorney on behalf of the United States, doing things that law firm partners don't do.

Scott Pelley: And that meant what to you?

Erez Reuveni: That meant I was there on behalf of the American people, on behalf of the millions of citizens of this country to make sure that justice was done.

Erez Reuveni started in 2010 as a so-called ""career"" attorney. Most lawyers at the Justice Department stay for years, even decades, defending the policies of one president after another. Reuveni specialized in immigration law. And in the first Trump term he defended the controversial ban on travelers from Muslim countries, among many other cases.

Erez Reuveni: I was promoted. I received three awards for defense of fairly high-profile litigation. I defended everything they put on my plate. That was my job.

Scott Pelley: And at the beginning of the second Trump administration, you were promoted again.

Erez Reuveni: That's right. Very soon into the administration, I was selected to be the acting deputy director of the immigration section, overseeing about a hundred attorneys and every case that arose in the federal District Courts.

But it was the very day of that promotion, Friday, March 14th, that he, and others, were called to a fateful meeting with Emil Bove, President Trump's newly appointed number three at the Justice Department, who was once Trump's criminal defense attorney.

Erez Reuveni: And we were told at this meeting that over the weekend, the president of the United States would be signing a proclamation invoking something called the Alien Enemies Act. This is a wartime law from 1798 invoked three times in the nation's history, during the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II.

The Alien Enemies Act allows rapid expulsion from the U.S. of the citizens of enemy nations during a war. But without a declared war, Trump used it against more than 100 Venezuelans that the government said were terrorists. They were to be denied their right to be heard by a judge. Reuveni says above expected a challenge.

Erez Reuveni: Bove emphasized, those planes need to take off, no matter what. And then after a pause, he also told all in attendance, and if some court should issue an order preventing that, we may have to consider telling that court, 'f*** you.'

Scott Pelley: And when you heard that, you thought what?

Erez Reuveni: I felt like a bomb had gone off. Here is the number three official using expletives to tell career attorneys that we may just have to consider disregarding federal court orders.

The next day, Saturday, lawyers for the prisoners sued. Judge James Boasberg called a hearing and asked government lawyer, Drew Ensign, whether the planes were leaving that weekend.

Erez Reuveni: And Ensign says to Boasberg, I don't know. Now Ensign was at the same meeting that I was at the day before, where we were told in no uncertain terms that planes were taking off over the weekend, that those planes needed to take off no matter what. And he says, I don't know.

Reuveni says that moment in court was ""stunning.""

Erez Reuveni: It is the highest, most egregious violation of a lawyer's code of ethics to mislead a court with intent.

We don't know Ensign's intent. It was during the hearing that the planes took off. The judge issued an order and immediately, Reuveni emailed the agencies involved. ""...the judge specifically ordered us to not remove anyone… and to return anyone in the air."" But that didn't happen. Instead, more than five hours after Boasberg's order, the detainees, and other prisoners arrived at a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.

Erez Reuveni: And then it really hit me. It's like, we really did tell the court, screw you. We really did just tell the courts, we don't care about your order. You can't tell us what to do. That was just a real gut punch.

Peter Keisler: The Department of Justice has the responsibility to obey all court orders. It can disagree with the order. It can appeal it. It can ask the judge to reconsider. But while the order is in effect, it's the obligation of the department to see to it that the government complies.

Peter Keisler should know. He ran the Justice Department as acting attorney general in 2007 for George W. Bush. He worked in Ronald Reagan's White House. And today, he's part of a law firm representing federal workers fired by the administration.

Scott Pelley: But some people watching this interview are thinking, if these people have been labeled by the administration as terrorists, as gang members, then we should get them out of the country as quickly as possible.

Peter Keisler: And there are lawful means to get people who are terrorists out of the country.

'Lawful means' that, Kiesler says, must include giving the detainees a chance, in court, to contest the charges.

Peter Keisler: Look, we have a saying in this country. It's deeply embedded in who we are. Everybody deserves their day in court. And all of us want to know that if the government acts against us, we will at least have the opportunity to go to a neutral decision-maker, present evidence and legal argument, and make sure that the government stays within its legal bounds.

Scott Pelley: But does the day in court apply to immigrants?

Peter Keisler: Absolutely. Nobody can be spirited out of the country without some opportunity to contest the factual and legal basis for that.

And it turned out, when the full facts were known, this Salvadoran man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, had been deported by mistake. Normally people deported in error are returned. But instead, Reuveni says that in a phone call from a superior he was ordered to argue against Abrego Garcia's return by telling a judge that Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 gang member and a terrorist.

Erez Reuveni: And I respond up the-- so up the chain of command, no way. That is not correct. That is not factually correct. It is not legally correct. That is-- that is a lie. And I-- cannot sign my name to that brief.

Scott Pelley: You're not saying Abrego Garcia is a choir boy. You're just saying that no one had managed to prove that he was a terrorist.

Erez Reuveni: Here's the really important thing here. Whether Mr. Abrego Garcia is or isn't a member of MS-13 or a terrorist or anything else is beside the point. What matters here is that they did everything they did to him in violation of his due process rights. What's to stop them if they decide they don't like you anymore, to say you're a criminal, you're a member of MS-13, you're a terrorist, what's to stop them from sending in some DOJ attorney at the direction of DOJ leadership to delay, to filibuster, and if necessary, to lie? And now that's you gone and your liberties changed.

After refusing to sign the brief that called Abrego Garcia a terrorist, Reuveni was fired. In June, he teamed up with lawyers from the Government Accountability Project to file a whistleblower disclosure. Making his story public helped expose a growing concern in many courts across the country that too often now the Justice Department is abusing the limits of the law.

Ryan Goodman: So the judges are saying some incredible things.

Ryan Goodman is a law professor at New York University who heads a non-partisan law journal. His team has analyzed hundreds of suits filed against the administration. And he didn't imagine what judges were saying to the Trump Justice Department.

Ryan Goodman: We found over 35 cases in which the judges have specifically said, what the government is providing me is false information. It might be intentionally false information, including false sworn declarations time and again.

In court records compiled by Goodman, Democratic and Republican appointed judges are critical of the Trump Justice Department's work. ""...Highly misleading..."" said one judge. ""...A serious violation of the court's order…"" wrote another. And a third warned, ""trust that had been earned over generations has been lost in weeks.""

Scott Pelley: This isn't the way things normally proceed?

Ryan Goodman: It's not. In fact, I would say for some of the cases that we're looking at, maybe that would happen once every ten years.

Scott Pelley: Who gets hurt by this?

Ryan Goodman: The one entity, or person, or institution that gets hurt the most is the Justice Department.

We requested interviews with the head of the department, Attorney General Pam Bondi, her former deputy, Emil Bove and Drew Ensign, the attorney who said he didn't know when the planes were taking off, according to the court transcript. All declined the interview request. Bove was nominated for a judgeship and, in June, he was asked about Reuveni's claims.

Emil Bove: I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order.

Bove said, in part, that Reuveni was in no position to tell his superiors what to do.

Emil Bove: There's a suggestion that a line attorney, not even the head of the Office of Immigration Litigation, was in a position or considered himself to be to bind the department's leadership and other cabinet officials.

Bove was also asked if he had dismissed the courts with an expletive.

Sen. Adam Schiff: Well, did you suggest telling the courts 'f*** you' in any manner?

Emil Bove: I don't recall.

Bove was confirmed for the judgeship. And in a statement to 60 Minutes he wrote, in part, ""...Mr. Reuveni's claims are a mix of falsehoods and wild distortions of reality…""

Kilmar Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. He's now charged with transporting illegal immigrants. And he's pled not guilty. A judge criticized the Justice Department's ""...poor attempts..."" to connect him to MS-13. And he was not charged with terrorism.

About those prisoners sent to El Salvador, they were released to their home country, Venezuela. And in April, the Supreme Court agreed, unanimously, that they had been entitled to their day in court.

Scott Pelley: This interview is the first time that your face has been seen in such a public way, and I wonder if that concerns you.

Erez Reuveni: It does. At the same time, I think about what we're losing in this moment. I think about why I went to the Department of Justice, to do justice. And I took an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. And my view of that oath is that I need to speak up and draw attention to what has happened to the department, what is happening to the rule of law. I would not be faithfully abiding by my oath if I stayed silent right now.

Image left: Refugee issues covered by ECM over the years includes persecution of Iraqi Christians, Kurdish immigrations fleeing ISIS, a migrant crisis at the Mexican border, asylum seekers fleeing violence in Africa, efforts to help African women refugees, Afghan refugees starting new lives in East County--many after helping the U.S. military, Ukrainians in Santee after Russia's invasion of their homeland, and cultural celebrations of Asian immigrants in our region.

October 19, 2025 (San Diego, CA) – San Diego has admitted more refugees from around the world in the years just prior to the current Trump administration, welcoming people from Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and Europe. Our region has been enriched by these newcomers in many ways, such as the array of international restuarants and cultural attractions in the San Diego region.

But President Donald Trump, after already slashing aid to refugees, now proposes to sharply restrict admissions and prioritize admitting predominantly white, English-speaking Europeans who claim persecution due to opposing mass migration or support of “populist” political parties such as far-right neo-Nazi groups in Europe.

The New York Times reports that Trump aims to slash refugee admissions from 125,000 to just 7,500 this fiscal year---at a time when the world has 42.7 million documented refugees seeking safe havens.

After already announcing priority for White South Afrikaans (the racist former ruling class) despite no evidence of persecution, Trump now wants to prioritize Europeans with views that align with religious or racist extremist groups, according to Human Rights Watch, including a German “anti-immigrant party whose leaders have traffickedin antisemitism and Holocaust denial.”How many people claiming persecution due to opposing mass immigration are currently huddled in refugee camps? “There aren’t any,” Human Rights Watch reports. Yet refugee status is supposed to be defined as people who have fled their homelands due to credible fears of persecution—such as Sudanese refugees in Chad, Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh,and Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

The latter are now being deported from Pakistan back to Afghanistan due to Trump yanking protected status from Afghans promised safe haven in the U.S. and now fear for their lives under Taliban rules.

Shan VanDiver, director of AfghanEvac, told the UK’s Independent, “When the U.S. signals that some identities are more deserving of safety than others,it diminishes our standing...It tells Afghan allies, persecuted minorities and families still waiting in danger that their sacrifices and their lives matterless. We see this firsthand: thousands of Afghans believed American when we said, 1Stand with us and we’ll stand with you.’ To now prioritize Europeans over them is not just inequitable—it is an unconscionable betrayal.”

The new actions come after the administration already slashed financial aid and healthcare for refugees. Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law restricts the eligibility of refugees for Medicaid, Medicare, children’s health insurance and even emergency food aid.

Moreover, Secretary of State Marco Rubio shifted over a quarter of a billion dollars out of the department’s Migration and Refugee Assistance Fund into paying immigrants to self-deport.

Naomi Steinberg, vice president of U.S. policy for Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, the world’s oldest refugee resettlement agency, says Trump’s proposed to radically overall of the refugee system in the U.S. would “deliberately leave vulnerable people in danger all around the world, rendering it unrecognizable.”",,N,,2025-10-20 07:29:27.702968
