One person is dead and two others have been hospitalized with gunshot wounds after a shooting at an US Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Dallas on Wednesday morning, Dallas police said on X. A suspect also is dead, police said.

“The preliminary investigation determined that a suspect opened fire at a government building from an adjacent building,” Dallas police said. “Two people were transported to the hospital with gunshot wounds. One victim died at the scene. The suspect is deceased.”

At least two detainees were shot in the incident, according to two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the incident. A suspect is dead from a self-inflicted gun shot wound, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on X.

“Details are still emerging but we can confirm there were multiple injuries and fatalities,” Noem’s post read. The motive in the shooting is unknown, she said.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said on CNN earlier Wednesday three people were shot, all of whom were taken to a hospital. He did not specify who the three people were.

“Preliminary information is a possible sniper,” Lyons said.

ICE employees, civilians, and immigrant detainees are generally among those at the facility.

No ICE officers were injured in Wednesday’s attack, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Deputy Director Madison Sheahan told Fox News on Wednesday morning.

Wednesday’s shooting marked at least the third instance of an ICE or Customs and Border Protection facility being targeted by gunfire in Texas this year.

On July 4, a group of assailants targeted the Prairieland Detention Center, near Fort Worth, in what authorities described as a coordinated attack that left a local police officer shot in the neck. The officer survived, and more than a dozen people have been charged for their alleged roles in the attack.

Days later, a 27-year-old man with a rifle and tactical gear was killed by police after he opened fire on a Border Patrol facility in McAllen. Two officers and a Border Patrol employee were injured, and dozens of rounds were exchanged between the shooter and law enforcement.

And in August, law enforcement arrested a man who authorities said claimed to have a bomb in his backpack at the same Dallas ICE facility that was targeted in Wednesday’s shooting, the Department of Homeland Security said.

Bomb threat at ICE facility in August

The backstory:

An individual was arrested in late August for threatening ICE officers with what the individual claimed to be a ""detonator"" on his wrist in Dallas, Texas.

On Monday, August 25, 2025, the Federal Protective Service reported a bomb threat against an ICE facility in Dallas. The facility houses ICE’s Dallas Field Office as well as Enforcement and Removal Operations.

A male identified as 36-year-old Bratton Dean Wilkinson, arrived at the reporting entrance of the Dallas Field Office and claimed to have a bomb in his backpack at approximately 6:37 p.m.

Wilkinson showed the security officer what he claimed to be a ""detonator"" on his wrist, which issued a shelter-in-place for the facility. The officer called 911 and local police responded with a bomb squad.

Wilkinson was taken into custody by local law enforcement and charged with making terroristic threats.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/good-day-clean-wednesday-2025_09_24-kdfweme001_03__00.21.53.54-e1758716922856.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-24 09:57:11.622201

Last month shots were fired at ICE offices in San Antonio, Texas, in what investigators described as a ""targeted attack"" against federal employees.

No injuries were reported in that incident, which ICE blamed on ""political rhetoric"" and ""misinformation"" about the Trump administration's detention policies.

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Climate change is the “greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and “stupid people” created the scientific consensus on global warming, President Trump told the U.N. General Assembly yesterday. In a meandering speech, Trump also told the attendees of the summit that their countries “are going to hell,” accused the United Nations of “funding an assault on Western countries and their borders,” and questioned the global body’s purpose. Following his speech, Trump told the U.N. Secretary-General, António Guterres, that the United States is “behind the United Nations 100%.”Somini Sengupta and Lisa Friedman report for the New York Times; Franco Ordoñez reports for NPR; UN News reports.

Trump yesterday suggested he plans to meet with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva next week, stating that the two leaders had “excellent chemistry” when they briefly met during the ongoing U.N. summit. The Brazilian presidency has since confirmed the two leaders may meet. Ana Ionova reports for the New York Times; Reuters reports.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said that South Africa is in talks with a U.S. trade representative, seeking to reduce tariffs levied by Trump on the African country. In remarks delivered at the U.N. General Assembly earlier in the day, Ramaphosa said that “trade is now being used as a weapon against a number of countries.” Doyinsola Oladipo reports for Reuters.

The U.S. military’s attacks on drug trafficking vessels are “only for television” and will not stop the world’s drug trade, Colombian President Gustavo Petro had told the Washington Post. The Trump administration should be targeting powerful Mexican and European drug cartels to effectively counter narcotics trafficking, Petro added. Samantha Schmidt reports.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES

In a shift in rhetoric, Trump posted yesterday on social media that Kyiv can “win all of Ukraine back in its original form,” elaborating that “Putin and Russia are in BIG economic trouble, and this is the time for Ukraine to act.” Earlier on, Trump confirmed in a press conference alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that NATO countries should shoot down Russian aircraft that enter their airspace. Ruth Comerford and Anthony Zurcher report for BBC News; Eli Stokols reports for POLITICO.

Zelenskyy said yesterday evening that he was surprised by Trump’s social media post but supported the “big shift” in Trump’s position. Zelenskyy said he believed that he and Trump will have a “better relation than before” and suggested that “the fact that Putin was lying to President Trump so many times also made a difference between us.” Pranav Baskar reports for the New York Times.

A Kremlin spokesperson responded today to Trump’s remarks by stating that Russia’s economy is stable and that the Russian army is advancing in Ukraine. The spokesperson said in an interview that “of course, President Trump heard Zelenskyy’s version of events. And […] this is the reason for the assessment we heard.” Anastasia Lyrchikova and Gleb Stolyarov report for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Gaza City’s al-Shifa hospital, one of the last functioning hospitals in the city, is overwhelmed with casualties from Israeli strikes, according to healthcare workers. A medic told BBC News that the hospital staff are operating on severely wounded patients in filthy conditions and with “minimal to hardly no anaesthesia.” Separately, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said that Israeli gunfire also rendered a key oxygen station at the Al-Quds Hospital unusable, and that Israeli military vehicles are preventing anyone inside the hospital from leaving. Jon Donnison and Rushdi Abualouf report; Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman, Khader Al Zaanoun, Tareq Al Hilou, Oren Liebermann, and Tim Lister report for CNN.

Israeli tanks have moved into multiple neighbourhoods in Gaza City in the past day, according to geolocated images. Journalists working for CNN report heavy shelling and drone presence, explosions, and the sounds of gunfire in the city. Abeer Salman, Ibrahim Dahman, Khader Al Zaanoun, Tareq Al Hilou, Oren Liebermann, and Tim Lister report.

Starting today, Israel will indefinitely close the only crossing between the occupied West Bank and Jordan “at the direction of the political leadership,” a spokesperson for the Israeli authority overseeing the crossing said. Reuters report.

A group protesting Israel’s siege of Gaza by sailing to the territory on a flotilla carrying humanitarian aid early today said that it was attacked by drones, had its communications jammed, and that explosions were heard from some boats. The group suggested Israel could be behind the attack. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the incident. Ephrat Livni reports for the New York Times.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.N. Secretary General António Guterres said yesterday in his opening speech at the U.N. General Assembly that “the principles of the United Nations that you have established are under siege” as “we have entered an age of reckless disruption and relentless human suffering.” Guterres addressed the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, and Sudan, while adding that “the scale of death and destruction [in Gaza] are beyond any other conflict in my years as secretary general.” Farnaz Fassihi reports for the New York Times.

U.N. Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory reported yesterday that the Israeli government has shown clear intent to establish permanent control over Gaza and to annex the entire West Bank. The Israeli mission in Geneva dismissed the report’s findings, stating “Hamas has genocidal intent towards Israel, the report has everything backwards.” Olivia Le Poidevin reports for Reuters.

The U.S. Special Envoy for Syria, Tom Barrack, said yesterday that Syria and Israel are close to agreeing a “de-escalation” deal, wherein Israel will cease attacks on Syria and Syria will agree not to move machinery near the Israeli border. Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa yesterday expressed concern that Israel might be stalling talks, saying “we are scared of Israel. We are worried about Israel. It’s not the other way around.” Humeyra Pamuk reports for Reuters.

On 5 October, Syrian electoral colleges selected by regional committees will elect two-thirds of the 210-member People’s Assembly, in the first election since the overthrow of the Assad government earlier this year. The remaining third of the Assembly will be selected by al-Sharaa. Tom Perry, Suleiman al-Khalidi, Timour Azhari, Firas Makdesi, and Orhan Qereman report for Reuters.

Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced yesterday that China will no longer seek new special treatment for developing countries in World Trade Organization negotiations. Qiang presented the decision as coming from “a responsible major developing country,” signalling that Beijing will continue to claim status as a developing nation. The Wall Street Journal reports.

U.S. TECH DEVELOPMENTS

OpenAI announced yesterday that it will work with Oracle and SoftBank to open five new data centers in the United States as part of the Stargate Project. The announcement makes up 80% of the $500 billion that the companies pledged to spend on AI building facilities under a plan they unveiled in January at the White House. Cade Metz reports for the New York Times; Megan Morrone reports for Axios.

Chinese tech company Alibaba announced today that it is integrating Nvidia’s AI tools for so-called physical AI into its Cloud Intelligence software platform. Alibaba’s announcement came after its CEO Eddie Wu revealed plans to increase Alibaba’s investment in AI infrastructure in excess of the $50 billion pledged in February. Luz Ding reports for Bloomberg; Tracy Qu and Sherry Qin report for the Wall Street Journal.

Alphabet’s subsidiary, YouTube, said yesterday that it will allow accounts previously banned for spreading Covid-19 and election-related misinformation to apply for reinstatement, overriding its previous policy of treating the violations as permanent. Alphabet’s lawyer Daniel Donovan wrote to the House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) yesterday, stating that the Biden administration had sought to influence the actions of platforms like YouTube and that “it is unacceptable and wrong when any government […] attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content.” Zach Vallese reports for CNBC.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

The Secret Service yesterday announced that it had seized and dismantled a cache of sophisticated equipment that was capable of shutting down the cellular network in the New York region. Officials said the network included more than 100,000 SIM cards and 300 servers and could be used for encrypted communication or to interfere with emergency response services. That there was no specific information that it posed a threat to the ongoing U.N. General Assembly, the officials said, adding that initial analysis of the data on some of the SIM cards identified ties to at least one foreign nation, as well as to criminals known to U.S. law enforcement. Eileen Sullivan reports for the New York Times.

A Florida jury yesterday found Ryan Routh guilty of attempting to assassinate Trump, assaulting a Secret Service agent, and three federal gun charges in connection with an incident on a golf course last year. Routh tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen after the verdict was handed down, and was restrained by court bailiffs. He is set to be sentenced in December. Juliette Arcodia, Carmen Gonzalez, and Corky Siemaszko report for NBC News.

Former FBI agent Peter Strzok yesterday lost a long-running lawsuit in which he alleged the first Trump administration violated his First Amendment rights by dismissing him over text messages critical of Trump. In her ruling, the judge overseeing the case said that the evidence in the case had failed to prove his constitutional rights were violated. The judge stressed that she was not ruling on whether Strzok’s firing “was the appropriate sanction” for his conduct. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

FBI agents found documents marked as classified while executing a search warrant at former national security adviser John Bolton’s office last month, according to a court filing released yesterday. The filing suggests the documents included materials that referenced weapons of mass destruction, the U.S. mission to the U.N., and records related to the federal government’s strategic communications. Josh Gerstein and Kyle Cheney report for POLITICO.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has disbanded the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a long-standing committee that provided recommendations concerning women serving in the military. A Pentagon spokesperson said Hegseth decided to terminate the advisory panel as it “focused on advancing a divisive feminist agenda that hurts combat readiness.” Idrees Ali and Phil Stewart report for Reuters.

Attorney General Pam Bondi’s Chief of Staff, Chad Mizelle, is set to leave the Department of Justice, Axios reports. He currently oversees the DOJ’s Civil Division and Civil Rights Division. Mizelle said that he would continue “exposing the left-wing groups responsible for violence” across the United States and supporting the Trump administration’s work. Mike Allen reports.

The General Services Administration is seeking to rehire hundreds of federal employees responsible for managing government workspaces who were fired during Elon Musk’s downsizing effort earlier this year, according to an internal memo obtained by AP News. Joshua Goodman and Ryan J. Foley report.

The Trump administration has launched an internal investigation into FEMA employees who signed a letter to Congress warning that FEMA’s present leadership threatens effective emergency management and endangers the public. According to internal emails seen by CNN, FEMA has ordered the employees to sign non-disclosure agreements and schedule interviews with investigators as part of the probe. The disaster relief agency has placed several of the staffers who signed the letter on paid administrative leave in August. Gabe Cohen reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Government officials in Eswatini and Jamaica said this week that a Jamaican citizen who was deported from the United States to a prison in Eswatini, a country to which he has no ties, has now been repatriated to Jamaica. Orville Etoria’s deportation to a prison in Eswatini generated alarm among rights groups, who argued that he had been unlawfully detained as he faced no criminal charges. John Eligon reports for the New York Times.

14 immigration judges were fired last Friday, adding to over 80 judges already let go by the Trump administration this year, sources told NPR. “The dismissal of more immigration judges is an illogical and costly setback for the nation’s immigration courts,” Matt Biggs, the president of a union that represents immigration judges, said. Ximeno Bustillo reports.

Trump was inaccurate about a wide variety of subjects. They included inflation in the US, climate policies both in the US and abroad, immigration, his role in settling international conflicts, and his standing in opinion polls. Here is a fact check of some of his remarks.

Trump’s accomplishments and popularity

Trump and wars: The president claimed, “I ended seven wars, and in all cases, they were raging, with countless thousands of people being killed. This includes Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the Congo and Rwanda — a vicious, violent war that was — Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.”

But Egypt and Ethiopia were not actually at war during Trump’s time in the White House. They have a long-running and unresolved dispute about a major Ethiopian dam project on a tributary of the Nile River, but this is not a war, so Trump couldn’t have ended one there. Similarly, while Trump has previously claimed to have prevented the eruption of a new war between Serbia and Kosovo — providing few details about what he was talking about — those countries weren’t in an actual war either during Trump’s current term or during his first term, when they signed an economic normalization agreement brokered by Trump’s administration in 2020.

In addition, Trump hasn’t actually ended the conflict involving the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. The peace agreement brokered by the Trump administration and signed by the DRC and Rwanda in June did not involve the rebel coalition, allegedly backed by Rwanda, that has seized territory in the eastern DRC, and CNN reported from the ground this week: “The scores of militia groups that have fought for three decades in one of the most protracted and complex conflicts in the world are still engaging in deadly fighting, and US President Donald Trump’s claimed peace deal for the nation feels like a distant dream.”

Trump’s importance and success in addressing the other four conflicts he mentioned can be debated. Notably, while Pakistan has heaped praise upon Trump for playing a critical role in brokering its May ceasefire with India, India has rejected the claim that he did so and said it resolved the conflict directly with Pakistan.

Trump’s poll numbers: The president claimed, “I was very proud to see this morning I have the highest poll numbers I’ve ever had. Part of it is because of what we’ve done on the border. I guess the other part is what we’ve done on the economy.” It’s theoretically possible Trump saw some private polling that gave him dramatically better numbers than public polling has produced, but his standing in public polling is nowhere near his highest ever — in fact, it’s down substantially from the beginning of this year.

A New York Times polling average put Trump’s approval rating at about 43% as of Tuesday (with 54% disapproval), down from 52% approval in the first week of his second term in January (with 43% disapproval).

Similarly, a polling average produced by data journalist G. Elliott Morris put Trump’s approval rating at about 42% as of Tuesday (with about 54% disapproval), down from about 51% approval in the first days of his second term (with about 39% disapproval). And a polling average produced by data journalist Nate Silver put Trump’s approval rating at about 44% as of Tuesday (with about 53% disapproval), down from about 52% approval in the first days of the term (with about 40% disapproval).

CNN’s Poll of Polls average had Trump at 41% approval as of Tuesday (with 57% disapproval), down from 48% approval in our first average of this term in early February (with 49% disapproval). And Trump’s average ratings for his handling of immigration and the economy have both fallen from positive territory to negative territory since the beginning of the term, the averages from Morris and Silver show.

Inflation and the economy

Inflation: Trump baselessly claimed that “inflation has been defeated” under his leadership. This is vaguer than his frequent false claim that there is now “no inflation,” but there’s no basis even for the vaguer version. Inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index, has been worsening since May after hitting a four-year low in April. It was about 2.9% in August, up from about 2.7% in July; the August figure was nearly identical to the 3% rate in January, the last partial month of the Biden administration Trump said left him an “economic calamity.”

Grocery prices: Trump also claimed that under his leadership, “grocery prices are down.” False. Average grocery prices have increased during Trump’s presidency, though the prices of some individual items have fallen; Consumer Price Index figures show that average grocery prices were about 1% higher in August than they were in January, when Trump returned to the White House. And while we should be careful not to read too much into any single month of data, the increase in grocery prices from July to August was about 0.6%, which was the highest month-to-month jump since late 2022.

Electricity bills: Trump said electricity in Europe is much more expensive than in China or the US, which is generally correct. But then he added, “And our bills are coming way down.” In fact, US electricity prices are spiking, rising more than twice as fast as overall prices; Consumer Price Index figures show they were about 6.2% higher in August than they were a year prior and about 4.9% higher in August than they were in January.

Foreign investment: Trump, talking about “new investment into the United States,” claimed, “In just eight months since I took office, we have secured commitments and money already paid for $17 trillion.” This figure is unproved at best. Just a day ago, Trump’s own White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, used a much lower figure, saying Trump “has secured nearly $9 trillion in US investment.” She did say “we expect that number to be upwards of $15 trillion very soon,” but Trump didn’t explain how an additional $8 trillion supposedly materialized in a day — and even Leavitt’s $9 trillion figure should be treated with skepticism, since it is heavily based on vague semi-commitments from foreign countries that may never materialize.

Environment and energy

Global warming and climate change: Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” and he also referred to “the global warming hoax.” He didn’t precisely explain what he was calling the con job or hoax, but global warming is a demonstrated fact. Trump also baselessly suggested that scientists now use the phrase “climate change” instead of “global warming” so that they can’t be accused of getting things wrong if the world ends up cooling; in reality, climate scientists use both phrases, often saying “global warming” when referring to the long-term trend of increasing global temperature and “climate change” when referring to the numerous effects the world is experiencing because of that trend.

NASA says on its website: “‘Climate change’ encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet. These include rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times.”

For example, a 2023 report from the UN’s climate change panel, titled “Climate Change 2023: Synthesis Report,” said this: “Human activities, principally through emissions of greenhouse gases, have unequivocally caused global warming, with global surface temperature reaching 1.1°C above 1850-1900 in 2011-2020.” In a section titled “Future Climate Change,” the report also said this: “Continued greenhouse gas emissions will lead to increasing global warming, with the best estimate of reaching 1.5°C in the near term in considered scenarios and modelled pathways. Every increment of global warming will intensify multiple and concurrent hazards (high confidence).”

China and wind power: Trump repeated his false claim that although China is the leading manufacturer of wind turbines, “they have very few wind farms” themselves. He added, “So why is it that they build them and they send them all over the world, but they barely use them? You know, they use coal, they use gas, they use almost anything, but they don’t like wind. But they sure as hell like selling the windmills.” In reality, China is the world leader in the generation of wind power and has massive wind farms onshore and offshore; it continues to install additional wind capacity much faster than the US.

Coal and renewables: Trump referred to coal as “clean, beautiful coal,” as he usually does, but coal is just not clean; its use as a power source creates polluting emissions that harm humans and the environment, even with technological improvements that can reduce the emissions levels. Trump also wrongly said renewable energy sources “don’t work,” saying that “they’re not strong enough to fire up the plants that you need to make your country great” and that “the wind doesn’t blow.” But energy generated by wind is still a useful power source when the wind isn’t blowing, just as solar energy is still a useful power source when the sun isn’t shining — since the energy can be stored in industrial batteries or using other methods, allowing it to be deployed as part of a power mix along with energy from traditional fossil fuels.

The Paris climate accord: Trump repeated some false claims about the Paris climate accord from which he has withdrawn the US during each of his presidencies.

At one point, he wrongly said the US was “supposed to pay like $1 trillion” under the accord. It wasn’t. The US has never spent or committed anywhere close to $1 trillion in connection to the accord; Biden pledged upon taking office to pay $11.4 billion per year toward international climate financing, but Congress appropriated less than even that.

Trump also said, “China didn’t have to pay until 2030.” This was confusing, but it appeared to be a reference to his previous false claim that the accord gave China more time than the US to hit its targets for reducing carbon emissions. In reality, the accord came into effect for all participating countries at the same time, November 2016, but allowed each country to set its own voluntary targets for reducing carbon emissions. China picked 2030 as the year it planned to meet its primary targets while the US picked 2025, but this was simply a choice of each country.

Immigration

Biden and migrants: Touting his efforts to secure the southern border, Trump said, “Just a year ago, millions and millions of people were pouring in, 25 million all together over the four years of the incompetent Biden administration.” The “25 million” figure is fictional; even Trump’s previous “21 million” figure was a wild exaggeration. Through December 2024, the last full month under the Biden administration, the federal government had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during that administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in the so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2.2 million, there’s no way the total was even close to what Trump has said.

Biden and migrant children: Trump repeated his misleading claim that “the previous administration also lost nearly 300,000 children,” then quickly said it was “more than 300,000 children.” He continued to say that many of these children “have been raped, exploited and abused and sold,” while others are dead.

He appeared to be referring to a 2024 report from the Homeland Security Department’s Office of Inspector General, which said Immigration and Customs Enforcement reported more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear as scheduled for immigration court hearings after being released or transferred out of custody between fiscal years 2019 and 2023. The report also said that 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children during this period were not given notices to appear in court.

There are two key things to note here. First, the period covered by the report includes two years and four months under the first Trump administration. Second, while the report said immigration authorities have “no assurances” these children “are safe from trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor,” it did not definitively assert that any of them were being exploited or had been killed.

Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told CNN last summer: “Long story short, no, there are not 320,000 kids missing. 32,000 kids missed court. That doesn’t mean they’re missing, it means they missed court (either because their sponsor didn’t bring them or they are teenagers who didn’t want to show up). The remaining 291,000 cases mentioned by the OIG are cases where ICE hasn’t filed the paperwork to start their immigration court cases.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-09-23t150419z-431107609-rc2rxgafv1i8-rtrmadp-3-un-assembly-trump.JPG?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-24 09:56:52.404126

Transnational repression in the UK

Seventh Report of Session 2024–25 HC 681 / HL Paper 160

[…]

4 INTERPOL and visa applications

The International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL)

64. INTERPOL's Notice [126] and Diffusion [127] mechanisms are vital tools for global safety. [128] Yet, despite INTERPOL's constitutional prohibition on politically motivated Notices, these mechanisms are being systematically exploited by authoritarian states as TNR tools. [129] Red Notices [130] are routinely used to pursue political opponents, human rights defenders, and journalists beyond national borders. [131] We heard Red Notices likened to ""the sniper rifle of autocrats… long-distance, targeted, and highly effective"". [132] States also often coordinate their efforts, with multiple countries supporting each other's abusive requests. [133] Currently there is no requirement or mechanism for INTERPOL or the Home Office to alert people at risk of politically motivated reprisals by foreign governments of a Red Notice being issued against them. [134]

65. Politically motivated Red Notices have a profound and far-reaching impact on the individuals targeted. [135] Such Notices may severely restrict a person's ability to travel, access financial services or maintain legal residency abroad. Rhys Davies, Barrister, Temple Garden Chambers, told us that a Red Notice:

Can ruin your life… You will be in constant fear that, if you were to go on holiday to Spain, an overzealous passport control officer might think they have an international super-criminal… and will detain you. There is no aspect of your life that this will not touch upon. [136]

There is often no way for an individual to know whether they are subject to a Red Notice. Individuals are often required to make direct enquiries to INTERPOL to determine whether they are subject to a Red Notice, a process that can take several months. This lack of transparency can leave individuals uncertain as to whether they can travel safely without risking detention. [137]

66. The Committee received evidence on the conduct of individual member states alleged to have engaged in systematic misuse of INTERPOL mechanisms. We were told that misuse of INTERPOL Notices was widespread, but that China, Russia, and Turkey were the most prolific abusers of INTERPOL's Notice system. [138] China was said to employ a distinct strategy, using INTERPOL Notices to locate individuals and then applying coercive pressure, through threats to family members, to compel their return. The Committee also heard that Turkey had begun to misuse Interpol's Stolen and Lost Travel Documents database by falsely reporting documents as stolen, thereby facilitating the return of targeted individuals.

67. In recent years, INTERPOL has undertaken a number of measures to strengthen the integrity of its systems. Despite confidence by the organisation that these measures work, [139] attempted Red Notice abuse continues. In 2016, a dedicated Notices & Diffusions Task Force (NDTF) was created within INTERPOL's General Secretariat, with responsibility for conducting a robust quality and legal compliance review for all incoming Notices and Diffusions prior to their publication. The Government has also seconded two individuals to the NDTF. [140] A Home Office official told us that this is ""an effective way of helping to ensure that Interpol's processes and safeguards are properly adhered to"". [141] However, we were told that despite the creation of the NDTF very few Red Notices (around 6%) are refused in the first instance. [142]

68. INTERPOL has also set up a Commission for the Control of Interpol's Files (CCF), an independent body which is responsible for deciding on a request for deletion and/or correction of data related to an INTERPOL Notice. However, the CCF has been ""experiencing delays in meeting its deadlines due to increases in [its workload]"". In addition to managing this increase, the CCF faces the task of clearing its backlog of cases. [143] We were told that this means it can take ""years"" for politically motivated Red Notices to be removed, [144] during which time these individuals face severe restrictions on travel and are at risk of detention. [145]

69. The Home Office and the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) often work closely together on lobbying and diplomatic engagement. However, we were unable to establish in any detail how coordination is conducted on INTERPOL related issues and no details were given on how individuals who have been subject to a politically motivated Red Notice might be supported by the Government. Whilst there may be many legitimate reasons why some individuals should not be informed of the existence of Red Notices against them, we were told that there may be some circumstances where the Government should consider making exceptions to the rule of non-disclosure. Rhys Davies told us:

There must be a way to devise appropriate checks and balances—such as enabling a judge to scrutinise which Red Notices are extant against British nationals and say whether those could be disclosed. [146]

70. International human rights lawyers Ben Keith and Rhys Davies told us that the UK could help prevent abuse of INTERPOL mechanisms by engaging more proactively with INTERPOL and advocating for reform. [147] While the UK has previously demonstrated its diplomatic influence and lobbying ability, working alongside its 'Five Eyes' partners [148] to block the election of controversial candidates to the role of INTERPOL President, witnesses expressed concern that the UK's role in shaping INTERPOL's strategic direction remains limited. [149] Rhys Davies told us that when it comes to international leadership on INTERPOL, often ""the ship is being steered by others', with the UK's role in shaping INTERPOL's strategic direction appearing limited. [150]

71. CONCLUSION

We are deeply concerned by the misuse of INTERPOL Red Notices by certain member states. Refusal by the INTERPOL secretariat to acknowledge that there is a problem and to take remedial action poses a significant threat to the rights and freedoms of individuals targeted by authoritarian regimes and sends a message that this behaviour is acceptable.

72. RECOMMENDATION

We recommend the Government works with 'Five Eyes' and other partners to track and expose malicious, vexatious, and politically motivated use of Red Notices by member states. In doing so, the Government should advocate for greater transparency and accountability within INTERPOL's procedures and advocate for the use of corrective measures and suspensions for systematic abusers of INTERPOL mechanisms.

73. CONCLUSION

Currently there is no requirement for INTERPOL to alert people at risk of politically motivated reprisals by foreign governments of a Notice being issued against them. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in cases where individuals face credible risk of TNR, effectively restricting their ability to travel freely. Whilst there may be many legitimate reasons why some individuals should not be informed of the existence of Red Notices against them, we see a need for greater support for those whose lives are impacted by attempts to use this system maliciously.

74. RECOMMENDATION

While the option exists for individuals to request access to or removal of their data via INTERPOL's independent oversight body, the Commission for the Control of INTERPOL's Files, this process is often significantly delayed and may not offer timely protection to those at immediate risk. The Government should undertake a review of existing procedures to consider whether it is possible to introduce a formal mechanism by which the Home Office or the National Crime Agency (NCA) may alert individuals of the existence of a Red Notice or Diffusion where there is a strong basis to believe it has been politically motivated.

75. RECOMMENDATION

In addition, the Government should take proactive steps to protect individuals facing an extradition risk due to a politically motivated Red Notice. A voluntary mechanism should be introduced to allow targeted British Nationals to notify the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) of planned travel to high-risk countries. This would give UK missions advance notice and allow them to prepare for early intervention if needed.

Impact on visa applications

76. INTERPOL Red Notices can have a significant impact on immigration and asylum applications. The presence of a politically motivated Red Notice may lead to an automatic presumption of criminality, resulting in the refusal of applications for asylum or citizenship. The Government told the Committee that:

There are clear procedures in place to ensure that INTERPOL notices do not unfairly influence immigration decisions. Where an asylum claim is refused and the Notice comes from the applicant's country of origin, the case may be referred to the National Crime Agency (NCA) or extradition authorities. [151]

77. However, witnesses argued that there was a need for enhanced training for Home Office officials on the use and implications of politically motivated INTERPOL Red Notices in asylum and immigration cases. Ben Keith, Barrister at 5 St Andrew's Hill, said that:

If somebody applies for a visa to come to the United Kingdom with a Red Notice against them, you might assume they were a criminal. It might be from Russia; it might be from another state. They might have been a former politician. There is a significant lack of education [in the Civil Service] about trying to analyse whether a Red Notice is in fact genuine. [152]

Country Policy and Information Notes, used in assessing asylum claims, do not contain specific information on threats related to TNR. [153] We heard that once a Red Notice was in place, it required significant funding, expertise and time to properly to challenge it in relation to an immigration or asylum decision.

78. CONCLUSION

The presence of a politically motivated INTERPOL Red Notice can have serious implications for individuals seeking asylum or applying for visas, often resulting in automatic refusal without due consideration of the underlying political context.

79. RECOMMENDATION

The Home Office should ensure that all relevant immigration staff are adequately trained and informed about the potential misuse of Red Notices. In addition, the Country Policy and Information Notes used in assessing asylum claims should be revised to explicitly address the threat of transnational repression. The Government should update the Committee within six months, outlining what specific steps it has taken to improve training for Home Office staff around politically motivated Red Notices.

The video from last Tuesday shows the little girl seated outside an open vehicle, drinking from a water bottle while surrounded by law enforcement.
The video shows agents trying to get Hip Mejía to come outside the house to show them identification.
However, two days later, ICE returned to their home and took Hip Mejía into custody, his wife said.
The family's experience is part of an attempt by ICE to deliver on US President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations.","A video of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents with a 5-year-old autistic girl outside her family home in Leominster, Massachusetts generated alarm after it was published Monday by NBCUniversal's Spanish-language Telemundo Nueva Inglaterra.

While Telemundo first reported that the family accused Immigration and Customs Enforcement of holding the girl in an effort to pressure her father, 22-year-old Edward Hip Mejía, to surrender to ICE, and the agency initially did not respond to a request for comment, the outlet updated the article on Tuesday, including with a comment from a government spokesperson.

The video from last Tuesday shows the little girl seated outside an open vehicle, drinking from a water bottle while surrounded by law enforcement. A man can be heard shouting ""Don't touch her!"" and a woman identified as the girl's mother tells one agent that the others took her daughter, who is 5 years old and on the autism spectrum. She also says, ""Give me my daughter back.""

The mother, who did not want her name shared, told Telemundo that her husband called her while driving with their daughter because he thought they were being followed. Her husband ""managed to run back into the parking lot of my house,"" she said, and her daughter was left with the agents. The video shows agents trying to get Hip Mejía to come outside the house to show them identification.

According to NBC Boston, ""Leominster police arrived at the scene, recovered the child, and returned her to the family.""

The couple has two children who were born in the United States. Neither parent was taken into custody that day. However, two days later, ICE returned to their home and took Hip Mejía into custody, his wife said. He is now being held at a detention center in Plymouth.

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at the US Department of Homeland Security, responded to NBC News' English version of the initial reporting, calling it ""a disgusting smear."" She claimed that Hip Mejia ""ignored law enforcement emergency lights to pull over and drove back to his house,"" and then ""abandoned his 5-year-old daughter in the car.""

The family's experience is part of an attempt by ICE to deliver on US President Donald Trump's promise of mass deportations.

The initial reporting and footage sparked swift outrage, with critics across the United States and beyond condemning agents' treatment of the family as ""fascism,"" ""truly evil,"" and ""a fucking abomination.""

Joanna Kuebler, chief of programs at the advocacy group America's Voice, said in a Tuesday statement that ""this visceral event is just another frightening example of a broader and deeply disturbing pattern by this administration.""

""The combination of cruelty and impunity in pursuit of a mass deportation crusade is dangerous for America and all of our safety,"" Kuebler added. ""Smashing car windows, ripping families apart, and traumatizing children threatens the public safety of American communities and the stability of our nation.”

“Your countries are going to hell.” In his remarks, Mr. Trump lectured the United Nations and other countries about how they were failing, and aired a list of grievances.
Soon after his speech, Mr. Trump made news in another forum.
“‘No more cows — we don’t want cows anymore.’ I guess they want to kill all the cows,” Mr. Trump said.
But at the same time, Mr. Trump has inserted America into peace negotiations in conflicts across the globe, including the war in Gaza.","He accused environmentalists of wanting to “kill all the cows.” He personally insulted the Muslim mayor of London. He bashed allies and foes across the globe. He questioned whether the United Nations should even exist.

“What is the purpose of the United Nations?” President Trump asked a gathering of the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, in a meandering, 56-minute speech that extended nearly four times as long as his allotted time limit.

“I’m really good at this stuff,” Mr. Trump said. “Your countries are going to hell.”

In his remarks, Mr. Trump lectured the United Nations and other countries about how they were failing, and aired a list of grievances. Those included but were not limited to: a malfunctioning escalator at the U.N.; his not winning a renovation contract at the United Nations during his time as a real estate developer; windmills; other countries’ immigration policies, which he claimed were leading them to ruin; and the way Brazil is being run.

Soon after his speech, Mr. Trump made news in another forum. In a social media post, he made a stunning pivot on Ukraine, saying the country, with the support of Europe, was “in a position to fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form.”

His declaration, a welcome development to European allies, was made shortly after a meeting in New York with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine.

But what appeared to be a major foreign policy shift in the afternoon came only after a lengthy morning lecture by the American president.

The White House had billed Mr. Trump’s address to the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly as a chance for the president to lay out his vision for how America should wield its power abroad.

But Mr. Trump’s day did not start well. An escalator he was riding on broke as he entered the building, and his teleprompter malfunctioned early in his speech. (The White House accused U.N. staff of potentially attempting to sabotage him.) While he appeared to be reading from prepared remarks, he often broke into ad-libs.

There was some policy discussed. He announced a new effort to enforce the biological weapons convention that would use “A.I. verification,” and said he wanted “a cessation of the development of nuclear weapons.”

Mr. Trump also issued a new warning: that the U.S. military would continue to play the role of judge, jury and executioner in killing suspected drug smugglers operating in international waters. “We will blow you out of existence,” he warned anyone moving drugs out of Venezuela.

But he spent nearly a quarter of his speaking time attacking efforts to address climate change.

Mr. Trump undermined the scientific consensus on climate change, saying it was “made by stupid people.” He celebrated the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and “clean, beautiful coal.” He talked about American energy exports and added that “the United States has been taken advantage by much of the world, but not anymore.”

And Mr. Trump called climate change the “greatest con job” ever perpetrated on the world and claimed environmentalists are out to eliminate America’s cows.

“‘No more cows — we don’t want cows anymore.’ I guess they want to kill all the cows,” Mr. Trump said.

He briefly turned to the topic of religion, falsely claiming that Muslim leaders in the West are planning to institute Shariah law, while proclaiming Christianity to be the “most persecuted religion on the planet.”

According to the White House, Mr. Trump had always planned to target “globalist institutions” in his speech. Since taking office, he has made drastic changes to America’s approach to foreign policy.

He has largely eschewed the use of nonmilitary “soft power,” severely cutting foreign aid and dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development. He has declined to pay for more aid to help Ukraine fight off Russia’s invasion or try to put any limits on Israel’s broadened military campaign in Gaza. And he has told strongmen leaders of other countries that the United States would no longer sit in judgment of them.

Several close U.S. allies issued what amounted to a reprimand this week of his go-it-alone vision, joining most of the U.N. body in recognizing Palestine as a state and risking the ire of the president, who has adamantly opposed such a move.

The president, for his part, has made it clear he wants little to do with much of the U.N. mandate. He has withdrawn the United States from the U.N.’s Human Rights Council, and ordered a review of America’s role in the organization. The Trump administration clawed back $1 billion in funding for the U.N. and informed Congress of its intent to cut another $1 billion, adding to a funding shortfall at the United Nations.

But at the same time, Mr. Trump has inserted America into peace negotiations in conflicts across the globe, including the war in Gaza. The president has also shown a willingness to use a quick show of force, as he did when he ordered airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Mr. Trump, who is in open pursuit of a Nobel Peace Prize, trumpeted his role in bringing about several peace agreements or cease-fires during his speech, including a deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Then he argued he was doing, as a side job, what the U.N. should. “Sadly, in all cases, the United Nations did not even try to help in any of them,” he said, adding that “all I got from the United Nations was an escalator on the way up that stopped right in the middle.”

He claimed that all the United Nations does is write “strongly worded letters” and speak in “empty words.”

“It’s sad I had to do these things instead of the United Nations doing them,” he said.

Still, the reaction to Mr. Trump’s bashing of the U.N. and other countries was muted. Long gone were the days when he was openly laughed at in the chamber. His speech was greeted with polite applause. Afterward, world leaders clamored to meet with him one-on-one, a format in which the American president is known to be less bellicose and more accommodating.

In addition to meeting with Mr. Zelensky, Mr. Trump also met with President Javier Milei of Argentina and Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. He then attended a joint meeting with the leaders of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/23/multimedia/23dc-trump-lvjb/23dc-trump-lvjb-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 06:56:57.181695

""Every 15 seconds, per line, I've got a dishwasher coming off the line,"" Bill Good, the vice president in charge of the plant, told CBS News.

But back in May, nearly 150 workers, mostly Cuban immigrants, were laid off after the Trump administration abruptly changed their legal immigration status.

The Biden-era parole program, known as CHNV, temporarily protected roughly 532,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Haitians and Venezuelans from the risk of deportation. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem moved to terminate the program back in March. After a lower court temporarily halted the end of the program, the Supreme Court in May allowed the administration to move forward with its plan to terminate the program while the rest of the legal battle plays out.

The Department of Homeland Security in June began delivering notices via email informing recipients living in the U.S. under the CHNV program that their permission to remain in the U.S. had been rescinded. Those who have not secured another lawful immigration status, such as Temporary Protected Status, were told to leave the country.

""We're still short people. We're still training people every day on jobs,"" said Nathaniel Schultz, who works at the GE Appliances plant in Louisville.

Jaelin Carpenter, another worker there, told CBS News, ""They put us on overtime from that point on to the beginning of the year.""

""It's more pressure on everybody,"" Schultz added.

Asked if they felt those immigrants were taking jobs from Americans, Carpenter, Schutlz and another worker, Oliver Smith, all said no.

""They applied like anybody else,"" said Smith.

And Carpenter said they won't be easy to replace.

Schultz added, ""These people were one of the vertebrae in the backbone that is American manufacturing.""

About 200 immigrant employees still work the lines at the plant, according to GE Appliances. Many of them are worried they, too, are one more policy change away from not being considered legal anymore.

Those remaining immigrant workers now live in fear their Temporary Protected Status could be revoked, with some already set to expire in the coming months.

""It's just very hard to predict,"" Good said.

Juan said he was looking for work when agents raided a Home Depot parking lot. He says while his green card was expired, he stressed he had a supporting document in his backpack. ""They just throw me and start hitting me,"" he said.

Human rights groups have stressed the raids are violating constitutional rights and relying on racial profiling. While a federal judge ordered the so-called roving patrols to stop as litigation proceeds, the US Supreme Court sided with the Trump administration, allowing them to continue. Now, the Carrillo Law Firm - joined by Waters and US citizens - has filed a petition to the United Nations Human Rights Council.

""They can appoint human rights violations experts to investigate. They can also send individuals into the countries to investigate to see whether there is abuses of human rights within that country,"" said attorney Michael Carrillo, adding that is what they are calling for.

The group is also calling on the public to show support by signing an online petition.

""I'm 95 years old. I lived through 'Operation Wetback' when they were deporting people at that time, but I never saw any kind of abuse like we're seeing today,"" said Huerta.

Meantime, Lopez Alvarado's husband, the family's financial provider was deported. She set up a GoFundMe account for support.

President Trump castigated the United Nations as a feckless institution in a speech to the world body on Tuesday, praising the turn America has taken under his leadership while warning Europe will be ruined if it doesn't turn away from a ""double-tailed monster"" of ill-conceived migration and green energy policies.

The UN recently denounced the US government, saying its decision to impose sanctions on the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories threatens the human rights system.

At the same time, voters remain wary of the Democrats on key issues.

Fully 55% of registered voters disapprove of Trump’s overall job performance with 46% saying that they strongly disapprove. Sixty percent of female voters disapprove of Trump’s job performance while Independent voters (67% disapprove) render an even harsher judgement. Trump receives his highest scores among his base of white non-college voters (60% approve, 40% disapprove).

On Trump’s signature issue of immigration, 55% disapprove including just under two-thirds of Independents (64%). Once again, Trump’s base of non-college white voters back him on immigration (62% approve).

Trump does even more poorly on his handling of the economy (40% approve, 59% disapprove) than he does overall. A decisive 70% of Independent voters disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy.

Voters are clearly telling the Democrats it is not enough to be just the anti-Trump. Democrats need to tell voters in no uncertain terms how they would make their lives better.

Even on the issue of crime which the Trump administration has focused on in the last several weeks does not generate any good news for the president. A 54% majority disapprove of his job performance on crime while 44% approve. Trump’s job performance on crime does resonate with voters ages 50 to 64 (54% approve, 45% disapprove).

Trump’s job performance numbers clearly indicate that he has been playing to his base among non-college white voters and ignoring the rest of the electorate. For a candidate who ran on the economy, his economic job performance numbers must be worrying. The logical thing for Trump to do would be to pivot from his focus on crime and immigration and focus on the cost of living. While this is the politically smart thing to do, Trump seems unlikely to take this path. Instead, he will continue to focus on his base. This is a real gamble because it is unlikely that there will be enough non-college white voters to enable the GOP to keep the House in Republican hands.

Fifty-three percent of respondents say that in 2026 they would vote to support Democrats to oppose Trump while 42% say they would vote for the GOP to support Trump’s agenda. Fully 59% of Independents say they would vote Democratic for Congress to oppose Trump’s agenda.

All this so far, is exceptionally good news for the Democrats. However, Democrats still have far to go with voters on key issues. On the question of which political party can best handle the economy, 32% prefer the Democrats, 39% the Republicans, and 28% say neither. A 47% plurality of Independents say neither party while 25% say the Democrats and 26% the Republicans.

On the issue of immigration, Republicans have a clear advantage as 42% of voters prefer the GOP while 29% support the Democrats and 28% say neither. Independent voters offer a very mixed picture on the question of which party can handle immigration (20% Democrats, 30% Republicans, and 48% neither).

Thirteen months from the 2026 midterms, Democrats have many things to feel good about in these polling numbers. However, they also face a challenge. Voters do not trust them on immigration and the economy. The Democrats may be able to triumph next year without winning the majority of voters on immigration. It is likely that they will not be able to win without winning voters on both the economy and immigration.

Job No. 1 for the Democrats for the 2026 midterms is to produce an economic message. Given Trump’s poor economic job performance numbers, this would seem an easy task. However, it was something that they failed to do in 2024, and I would argue that it cost them the White House. Voters are clearly telling the Democrats it is not enough to be just the anti-Trump. Democrats need to tell voters in no uncertain terms how they would make their lives better. If the Democratic Party fails here, they will hand GOP control of Congress for at least two more years.

Read the Bill Here(link is external)

NEW YORK, NY – Congressman Dan Goldman’s (NY-10) No Secret Police Act today reached 100 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, a major show of support from Democrats in Congress for legislation to rein in the Trump administration’s use of masked, anonymous federal agents engaged in border security and civil immigration enforcement. Goldman introduced the bill with Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) in June.

“As Donald Trump continues to send masked, unaccountable ICE agents into our city, I’m proud that the Democratic caucus is united in support for this critical legislation that would put an end to the Trump administration’s use of masked agents to terrorize immigrant communities,” Congressman Dan Goldman said. “While Republicans bend the knee to this administration as it establishes a militarized ICE police force, Democrats are standing firm in opposition to these authoritarian tactics.”

The No Secret Police Act would amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require law enforcement officers and agents of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to clearly display identification and insignia when detaining or arresting individuals. Specifically, the bill would:

Prohibit DHS officers from wearing face coverings or any item that conceals their face during detentions or arrests.

Require that DHS officers identify the specific component they work for (such as ICE or CBP).

Mandate that officers wear or display official insignia or uniforms clearly visible to others.

The bill also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to invest in research and development to ensure visibility of DHS insignia and uniforms under a wide range of conditions, from different locations and times of day to weather circumstances.

Goldman has led the charge against Trump’s escalation of authoritarian immigration enforcement tactics, standing with immigrant communities across New York and the nation who are demanding accountability, transparency, and the basic democratic principle that law enforcement must not operate in secret.

In July, Congressman Goldman and 11 other Members of Congress filed a lawsuit against the Trump Administration last month over its continued refusal to allow members of Congress to access ICE detention facilities, including the 26 Federal Plaza, which is also located in the Congressman’s district.

In August, Congressman Goldman and Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) led over 50 of their colleagues in demanding an immediate investigation into alarming reports that U.S. citizens are being wrongfully detained and deported by federal immigration agents under the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement policies. In a letter sent to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) internal oversight offices, the lawmakers raised urgent concerns about a growing pattern of civil rights violations against U.S. citizens during immigration sweeps.

However, the court did not consider this requirement inconsistent with s. 12.1 of the Evidence Act in general or s. 12.1(5) in particular.
First, the court pointed out that the petitioners ultimately did not assail the validity of s. 5(7) of DEER.
Second, the court saw no explicit conflict between s. 12.1(5) of the Evidence Act and s.5(8)(a) of DEER.
Third, the court noted that proportionality was a primary goal of s. 12.1 and part of a broad purpose to reduce motor vehicle litigation costs.","The woman also claimed that she suffered a concussion, chronic pain, vision problems, cognitive issues, tinnitus, difficulties sleeping, headaches, anxiety, and other psychological symptoms.

The TLABC, a non-profit society of legal professionals, primarily consisted of litigators acting for individuals in BC civil and criminal proceedings.

Both petitioners challenged the validity of s. 5 of the DEER, as amended by Order in Council 628/2023 (B.C. Reg. 241/2023). The provision limited the disbursements a vehicular injury plaintiff could recover to six percent of the total assessed damages.

The petitioners accepted that the amendments in Order in Council 628/2023 tackled the lack of judicial discretion to establish exceptions to this cap, which was the primary concern raised in Le v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 2022 BCSC 1146, and British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Le, 2023 BCCA 200.

However, the petitioners argued that the amendments led to new concerns. They alleged that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER:

amounted to an unauthorized or unreasonable exercise of the lieutenant governor in council’s (LGIC) authority under s. 12.1(9) of BC’s Evidence Act, 1996

lacked force and effect under s. 52 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms because it unjustifiably breached plaintiffs’ s. 15 Charter rights

Provision upheld

The Supreme Court of British Columbia dismissed the petition upon finding that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER fell within the LGIC’s regulation-making power, aligned with the proportionality goals of s. 12.1 of the Evidence Act, and did not infringe plaintiffs’ s. 15 Charter rights.

The court noted that the parties had resolved the action seeking to recover damages for injuries allegedly arising from the motor vehicle accident after the present petition’s hearing.

The court rejected the petitioners’ argument that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER disproportionately prejudiced plaintiffs by requiring them to make an application before incurring a disbursement and forced them to prematurely disclose their case to the defendant, thus diminishing litigation or solicitor-client privilege.

The court said the petitioners exaggerated their concerns about disclosing privileged information. The court determined that DEER did not compel plaintiffs to open their litigation files to an extent that seriously eroded litigation or solicitor-client privilege.

The court explained that s. 5(6) of DEER simply offered plaintiffs the option to apply to exclude disbursements from the six-percent cap and required them to meet the conditions and criteria in ss. 5(8) and (9) of DEER if they chose to file such an application.

The court added that the case law interpreting ss. 5(8) and (9) of DEER did not support the petitioners’ claims that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER jeopardized litigation or solicitor-client privilege and instead showed the court’s liberal application of the evidentiary requirements and avoidance of interpretations compelling the plaintiffs to open their files or divulge privileged information.

Next, the court ruled that s. 5(8)(a) of DEER did not infringe s. 15 of the Charter. The court said DEER’s pertinent provisions applied equally to all plaintiffs, whether disabled or not, and drew no distinction between those with physical or mental disabilities and those without disabilities.

The court saw no disproportionate impact under part one of the test in Fraser v. Canada (Attorney General), 2020 SCC 28. The court listed five points to support this conclusion.

First, the court said the majority in British Columbia (Attorney General) v. Le, 2023 BCCA 200, pointed out that the six-percent limit would be proportionate in most cases.

Second, the court acknowledged that plaintiffs with more severe injuries were more likely to incur disbursements exceeding the six-percent cap. However, the court found no evidence that disabled persons were more likely to exceed the limit.

Third, the court saw no evidence of adverse impacts on persons who needed accessibility services.

Fourth, the court noted that plaintiffs could ask the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia if they could exclude disbursements if they were likely to go over the six-percent limit.

Fifth, the court said requiring plaintiffs to file a s. 5(6) application would not onerously burden them and would generally entitle them to the application costs if they succeeded.

Lastly, the court accepted that s. 5(7) of DEER required a plaintiff seeking to tender the evidence of over three experts and exclude disbursements from the six-percent cap to file the applications together before incurring the disbursement.

However, the court did not consider this requirement inconsistent with s. 12.1 of the Evidence Act in general or s. 12.1(5) in particular. The court went over three points to support this finding.

First, the court pointed out that the petitioners ultimately did not assail the validity of s. 5(7) of DEER.

Second, the court saw no explicit conflict between s. 12.1(5) of the Evidence Act and s.5(8)(a) of DEER.

Third, the court noted that proportionality was a primary goal of s. 12.1 and part of a broad purpose to reduce motor vehicle litigation costs.

Ismael Ayala-Uribe, 39 was pronounced dead Sunday at the Victor Valley Global Medical Center, according to an ICE statement.

Ayala-Uribe is now the 14th detainee to die in immigration detention since January, when federal immigration officials began to carry out President Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

News of his death comes on the day that two Democratic senators from Georgia sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Todd Lyons, the acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, raising concerns about the rise in the number of deaths in ICE custody, in particular two that occurred at the Stewart Detention Center in Georgia. NPR was the first to report on the letter.

In July, Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga) released the findings of a probe into alleged human rights violations that have occurred at immigration detention centers, including dozens of reports of physical and sexual abuse, and mistreatment of pregnant women and children. DHS rejected the senator’s allegations in a statement.

In California, the Adelanto Detention Center, one of the largest in the state, has long been the focus of complaints from detainees, attorneys and state and federal inspectors about inadequate medical care, overly restrictive segregation and lax mental health services.

In June, critics — including some staff who work inside — told The Times that conditions inside the detention center were unsafe and unsanitary. The facility, they said, was unprepared to handle the large waves of detainees pouring into the center.

That month, U.S. Rep Judy Chu (D-Monterey Park), toured the detention center with four other Democratic members of Congress from California amid concern over the increasing number of detainees and deteriorating conditions inside.

The facility’s manager “has to clearly improve its treatment of these detainees,” Chu said at a news conference after inspecting the facility.

Some of the detainees told lawmakers they were held inside Adelanto for 10 days without a change of clothes, underwear or towels, Chu said. Others said they had been denied access to a telephone to speak to loved ones and lawyers, even after repeatedly filling out forms.

A spokesperson for DHS could not immediately be reached for comment on Sunday’s death. But the agency said in its statement about Ayala-Uribe that immigration agencies such as ICE and Customs and Border Protection are committed to ensuring the safety of people who are in their custody.

“Comprehensive medical care is provided from the moment individuals arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay,” the agency’s statement read. “All people in ICE custody receive medical, dental and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. At no time during detention is a detained illegal alien denied emergent care.”

According to the agency statement, Ayala-Uribe, a Mexican national, was being held at a processing center in Adelanto where he had been seen by an on-call medical provider, who prescribed medication to him, although immigration officials did not say why.

But three days later, Ayala-Uribe was sent to the Victor Valley Global Medical Center to further evaluate an “abscess on his buttock” and was scheduled to undergo surgery for it, the statement said.

“Ayala was also hypertensive and displayed abnormal tachycardia,” immigration officials wrote in the statement. “At 1:48 a.m. the [medical center] declared Ayala unresponsive and initiated lifesaving measures. He was declared deceased at 2:32 a.m. by medical staff.”

According to ICE, Ayala-Uribe entered the United States at an unknown date and location. He applied for, and received, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals protection in 2012. He was sentenced to three years probation after he was convicted of driving while under the influence in 2015, the agency said.

In 2016, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services denied his application to renew his DACA status. He was convicted of his second DUI in June 2019 and sentenced to 120 days in jail, plus five years of probation, according to ICE.

Ayala-Uribe was arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection on Aug. 17 and transferred to Adelanto on Aug. 22.

Immigration officials said the cause of death is still under investigation. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Bill of 2018 requires that ICE make public reports regarding any in-custody deaths within 90 days.

ICE officials said they make official notifications to Congress, nongovernmental organization stakeholders and the media about a detainee’s death and post a news release with relevant details on its website within two business days per the agency’s policy.

Introduction

On September 19, 2025, President Donald Trump signed a Presidential Proclamation that significantly restructures the H-1B visa program, one of the most widely used pathways for high-skilled foreign professionals to work in the United States. While the H-1B program has long been a lifeline for industries facing talent shortages, the Proclamation introduces a new $100,000 application fee that will make it cost-prohibitive for many employers to utilize it, reshaping the landscape of U.S. immigration and labor markets. This explainer unpacks the key provisions of the Proclamation and what these changes mean for employers, foreign workers, and the broader economy.

Key Provisions of the Presidential Proclamation

The new Presidential Proclamation introduces the most restrictive measures on the H-1B program in decades:

Significant New Fee: Employers sponsoring H-1B workers must now pay a $100,000 “visa integrity fee” per application. This represents an unprecedented escalation in costs. After the Proclamation was published, employers expressed confusion over its scope, questioning whether the $100,000 fee applied retroactively to existing H-1B workers and whether the fee had to be paid annually. In the days following its publication, administration officials clarified that the fee applies only to new petitions filed after the effective date. They also clarified that it was a one-time fee, not an annual fee.

Exemptions Based on National Interest: The Proclamation allows DHS to grant case-by-case or industry-wide exemptions to the $100,000 fee if employing H-1B workers is deemed in the U.S. national interest. However, the criteria for these exemptions remain unclear.

Increased Compliance Burdens: Employers face heightened reporting requirements, audits, and penalties for violations. Parallel to the Proclamation, the Department of Labor (DOL) announced Project Firewall, a new enforcement initiative targeting employers who rely heavily on the H-1B visa program.

The administration frames these changes as necessary to “protect American workers” and ensure that companies prioritize domestic hiring. Critics argue that the measures will undermine U.S. competitiveness and innovation.

What Industries Benefit from H-1B Visas?

The technology sector is by far the largest beneficiary of the H-1B program. This sector relies on a steady influx of international talent to sustain research, product development, and global competitiveness.

Beyond Silicon Valley, H-1Bs are vital in:

Healthcare: Hospitals and clinics employ foreign doctors, nurses, and medical researchers to address staffing shortages.

Higher Education and Research: Universities sponsor professors and researchers whose expertise strengthens the U.S. academic system.

Finance and Business Services: Banks, consulting firms, and accounting companies hire specialized workers to handle complex global operations.

Engineering and Manufacturing: From aerospace to automotive industries, H-1Bs fill roles where U.S. talent is scarce.

In short, the visa program supports industries at the core of the U.S. economy while bridging persistent labor gaps.

Old vs. New Application Costs

Before the Proclamation, the cost of applying for an H-1B visa included several mandatory fees:

Applicant registration for the H-1B lottery: $215

Filing Fee (Form I-129): $460

American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act (ACWIA) Fee: $750 or $1,500, depending on company size

Fraud Prevention and Detection Fee: $500

Public Law 114-113 Fee (for H-1B dependent employers only): $4,000

Premium Processing (optional): $2,805

Altogether, most employers spent between $5,000 and $10,000 per H-1B worker.

Under the Proclamation, employers must now pay an additional $100,000 visa integrity fee per petition. This brings the total cost to well over $105,000 per worker, pricing out many small and medium-sized businesses and significantly burdening even large corporations that hire hundreds of H-1B workers annually.

Likelihood of Litigation

The new Proclamation on H-1B visas is almost certain to face legal challenges. Immigration lawyers, business associations, and affected industries have already signaled that the policy is vulnerable in court, and litigation is expected to begin almost immediately.

Several aspects of the Proclamation are likely to be tested in court:

Statutory Authority: The White House relies on sections 212(f) and 215(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) to justify the $100,000 supplemental fee and related entry restrictions. Critics contend Congress never authorized such high fees or broad restrictions, arguing the Proclamation exceeds presidential powers under the INA.

Administrative Procedure Act (APA): The Proclamation may be challenged for bypassing required notice-and-comment rulemaking. Additionally, the vague criteria for exemptions and the undefined concept of “essential” workers risk arbitrary enforcement, heightening the chances of an APA violation.

Complications for Employers and Workers

The new policy introduces wide-ranging challenges for employers and foreign-born workers who rely on the H-1B program.

For Employers

Cost Barriers: The fee increase will create financial, compliance, and workforce challenges for companies of all sizes, universities, and hospitals that cannot afford to pay $100,000 per application.

Hiring Delays: Stricter labor market tests and compliance checks will slow down hiring processes.

Reduced Global Competitiveness: Companies may relocate operations abroad to access the talent they can no longer bring to the U.S. affordably.

For Foreign Workers

Fewer opportunities for workers: The steep costs make employers less willing to sponsor H-1Bs, narrowing opportunities for talented workers.

Limited availability of H-1B visas for entry-level positions: Parallel to the Proclamation, the administration published a notice of proposed rulemaking that would lower the chances for international students and entry-level workers to be selected in the H-1B lottery.

Legal and personal strain: Heightened scrutiny and procedural delays increase uncertainty for workers and their families.

The Department of Labor’s “Project Firewall”

In addition to the Proclamation, on September 19, 2025, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) announced Project Firewall, a new enforcement initiative targeting employers who utilize the H-1B visa program. According to the agency, the program aims to “protect the rights, wages, and opportunities of U.S. workers,” while strengthening oversight of H-1B hiring practices and cracking down on abuse. The initiative is a parallel development to the Proclamation, signaling that the administration intends to increase both the cost of obtaining H-1B visas and the regulatory scrutiny of companies that use them.

Conclusion

The Proclamation on H-1B visas represents one of the most consequential changes to U.S. immigration policy in decades. By drastically raising costs and imposing new restrictions, the policy threatens to limit the flow of high-skilled talent that has long powered U.S. innovation, scientific discovery, and business growth. While the administration argues that these measures protect American workers, critics warn that they could instead drive investment and talent abroad, undercutting the nation’s competitiveness. For employers, the new Proclamation means higher costs, longer delays, and difficult strategic decisions about whether to utilize the H-1B program and/or relocate jobs overseas. For foreign workers, it means fewer opportunities and greater uncertainty. And for the U.S. economy, it raises pressing questions about whether protectionism can coexist with the nation’s tradition of welcoming global talent to fuel progress.",https://forumtogether.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/facebook-tag-image.png,N,,2025-09-24 02:57:32.918339

The U.S. promised to help those Afghans come to America, but many are now caught up in President Trump's immigration crackdown.
Mohammad Rahimi worked as an attorney with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and later served in the Afghan government.
Meanwhile, Rahimi said arrests of Afghan refugees at routine immigration appointments — one at immigration court in San Diego — have Afghans across the country afraid and feeling targeted.
""It's reprehensible that we're failing our Afghan allies now,"" said California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters, one of the bill's co-sponsors.","More than 200,000 Afghans previously eligible to apply for asylum in the United States now find themselves without options or answers from the U.S. government, community advocates said.

On President Trump's first day back in office in January, he ordered a halt to all refugee travel. That included Afghans and their families screened and approved by the State Department to relocate to the United States.

""They're just being abandoned,"" said Jessica Bradley Rushing, who worked as a deputy director in the Department's office of the Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts, or CARE.

When the U.S. fought a 20 year war in Afghanistan, thousands of those Afghans fought alongside them. They served as interpreters, engineers, and in other roles - and many now face the threat of retribution from the Taliban.

The U.S. promised to help those Afghans come to America, but many are now caught up in President Trump's immigration crackdown. Thousands are still housed at U.S.-run sites in third-party countries, such as one in Doha, Qatar.

""I know people, literally personally, whose cases were right at the finish line on Jan. 20,"" Bradley Rushing said. ""And now their families are stuck in Afghanistan, and they don't know when or if they'll ever be reunited.""

The January suspension of refugee resettlement was followed by a travel and VISA ban that included Afghanistan and the end of Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. In July, the State Department closed the CARE office. And the White House plans to end Operation Enduring Welcome - the Biden Administration's Afghan resettlement initiative - Sept. 30.

Mohammad Rahimi worked as an attorney with the U.S. Army in Afghanistan and later served in the Afghan government. He immigrated to the U.S. more than a decade ago and is now a U.S. citizen. Living in El Cajon, California, he serves as executive director of nonprofit Afghan Family Services.

He said many of the more than 100,000 Afghans who made it to the U.S. since August 2021 came alone, hoping to bring their spouses, siblings, parents or children later.

""Unfortunately, with this travel ban ... this president killed that hope,"" Rahimi said. ""So now, the majority of these Afghans who came to the United States but left part of their families in Afghanistan — they are hopeless, they are voiceless, and they're unsupported.""

A State Department spokesperson said the functions of the CARE office were assigned to another office, part of a reorganization to make the department ""more efficient and more focused on an America First foreign policy.""

A senior Trump Administration official said Special Immigrant Visas for Afghans are still being processed with hundreds of decisions per week.

""President Trump has a humanitarian heart, and the Trump Administration remains committed to protecting those who supported our mission, while ensuring rigorous security standards,"" the official said in an email. ""These measures make certain that refuge is provided only to those credibly at risk while maintaining broader U.S. national security priorities.""

Shawn VanDiver is president and co-founder of #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that helps Afghans with relocation. During the Biden Administration, he worked with the State Department to craft Operation Enduring Welcome.

""Enduring Welcome is, by miles and miles, the safest, most secure legal immigration program in our country's history,"" VanDiver said. ""We wanted to build this thing to stand the test of time and stand any sort of security scrutiny. And we did.""

VanDiver said the current administration sees Afghanistan as a ""political problem.""

""They want to wipe their hands of it,"" VanDiver said in an interview.

With roughly a quarter-million Afghans somewhere in the relocation pipeline, VanDiver said his organization will continue to press Congress to pass legislation to restart relocation.

Meanwhile, Rahimi said arrests of Afghan refugees at routine immigration appointments — one at immigration court in San Diego — have Afghans across the country afraid and feeling targeted.

""They are asking me ... how can they go to their appointments, finish the appointment and leave the courthouse safely without being detained?"" Rahimi said. ""We have no answer.""

In San Diego this summer, more than a dozen U.S. military veterans showed began a volunteer effort, showing up in court to support an Afghan at his immigration hearings.

Marine Corps veteran Jonathan Liu served with Afghans as a fire support officer during the war. He said the courthouse effort was a continuation of that service.

""These were people who fought for us — they put their lives on the line,"" he said. ""We shouldn't be turning our backs on them.""

Several major veterans groups are supporting bi-partisan legislation in Congress that would provide a path to permanent residency for many Afghans already in the U.S. It also would expand and extend the opportunities for more Afghans to come here.

The Enduring Welcome Act builds upon several policy goals previously brought before the House under the Afghan Adjustment Act. Together, the bills would provide a legal pathway for former U.S. allies in Afghanistan to relocate to the U.S. and offer those already in the country a legal path toward residency.

""It's reprehensible that we're failing our Afghan allies now,"" said California Democrat Rep. Scott Peters, one of the bill's co-sponsors.

""I ended seven wars and in all cases they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed,"" said Trump.
Lowenstein said Trump must realize the ""sheer force of his personality"" will not bring about an end to those conflicts.","In a fiery speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump attacked some of the key principles of the world body, and urged Western countries to adopt MAGA-style policies on migration and climate change.

Trump used the stage of the UN General Assembly to deliver a nearly hour-long address that was short on substance about ending the world's two biggest ongoing wars — in Ukraine and Gaza — but long on critique of two of his favourite targets: immigration and green energy.

The U.S. president slammed what he called the ""globalist migration agenda"" and criticized efforts to tackle what he called ""the global warming hoax."" Near the end of his speech, he called the global push against climate change ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world"" — a remark that drew gasps from some in the audience.

European leaders ""must take control strongly and immediately of the unmitigated immigration disaster and the fake energy catastrophe before it's too late,"" he said.

""You're destroying your heritage,"" Trump added in arguably the most strongly worded part of his speech. ""Your countries are going to hell.""

Given UN-backed treaties on climate change and the rights of refugees, it would mean a profound shift in the global order if other nations heeded Trump's calls.

The White House had promised a UN speech that would take aim at global institutions. But some observers believe his words struck at the heart of what the UN is supposed to do — namely, make life better for people of all nations.

Dave Harden, founder of Georgetown Strategy Group and a senior adviser on Middle East peace in the Obama administration, told CBC News the speech ""signals the closing of the era of the United States as being a beacon of hope"" to the international community.

'A torrent of falsehood on migration'

While some observers expected Trump to slam UN bureaucracy and spending in his speech, his sharpest critique of the international body focused on immigration.

""The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and not finance them,"" Trump said, blaming the UN for fuelling what he called ""the No. 1 political issue of our time: the crisis of uncontrolled migration.""

The president claimed the UN ""provided food, shelter, transportation and debit cards to illegal aliens"" to gain access to the U.S. via its southern border.

""In the United States, we reject the idea that mass numbers of people from foreign lands can be permitted to travel halfway around the world, trample our borders, violate our sovereignty, cause unmitigated crime and deplete our social safety net,"" said Trump.

Jeremy Konyndyk, president of Refugees International, an advocacy group that doesn't rely on UN or U.S. government funding, called Trump's speech ""a torrent of falsehood on migration"" in a comment posted to X.

Hugh Dugan, who served on the National Security Council in Trump's first term, doesn't think the speech called for ""tearing apart the multilateral order.""

""In fact, he did reiterate that the UN has potential,"" Dugan told CBC. ""I think he went mild on the UN by just sticking with the use of U.S. funds to bring immigrants across our border illegally ... he could have been even harsher about how our dues are being used.""

U.S. withdrawal from UN agencies

While Trump pulled some financial support from the UN and its agencies over the course of his first term as president, he has done so far more quickly in his second.

On the day of his inauguration in January, for example, Trump announced plans to withdraw the U.S. from the World Health Organization and pull out of the UN-backed Paris Agreement on climate change.

Two weeks later, Trump signed a sweeping executive order to end U.S. involvement in the UN Human Rights Council and launch a full-fledged review of U.S. funding and participation in all UN bodies and other international organizations. Meanwhile, his administration moved quickly to obliterate the U.S. Agency for International Development, wiping billions of dollars in funding from aid projects worldwide, jeopardizing such programs as HIV/AIDS prevention in Africa.

At Trump's urging, Congress proposed in August to withhold more than $1.4 billion US in funding for UN dues and peacekeeping operations.

The UN is now planning a 15 per cent cut to its core budget, its biggest in decades, including eliminating more than 2,600 posts, roughly one out of every five UN jobs worldwide, as part of a broader reform called UN80.

Tom Weiss, a retired professor emeritus at the City University of New York who has written extensively about the UN, says Trump's funding cuts have already made it harder for the UN to deliver humanitarian assistance

""This administration is very good at destroying things. It's not very good at building anything, so I suspect the downward slide of the [UN] is only going to be accelerated,"" Weiss told CBC News.

'Almost no progress' on Gaza, Ukraine

Trump's decision to focus on migration and green energy while only giving the Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts passing mention drew plenty of attention from political observers.

During the speech, the U.S. president reiterated his claim that he has ended several wars — including a diplomatic conflict over water resources that isn't actually a war (Egypt-Ethiopia); a long-running dispute between Kosovo and Serbia in which no peace deal has been signed; and a Rwanda-backed rebel uprising in eastern Congo that hasn't actually stopped.

""I ended seven wars and in all cases they were raging with countless thousands of people being killed,"" said Trump. ""No president or prime minister, and for that matter, no other country, has ever done anything close to that.""

Notably, he said the UN ""did not even try to help"" end the conflicts.

""I was a little bit surprised that he would brag quite so overtly about ending seven wars when the two main wars that he vowed to end — obviously in Gaza and in Ukraine — he's made almost no progress,"" Frank Lowenstein, a former U.S. special envoy for Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, told CBC News Network.

“Gregory Bovino, an official originally diverted from his responsibilities at the border to lead controversial operations in Southern California, announced a second operation in Illinois—'Operation at Large’—on social media.
In addition to Casten and Durbin, the letter was signed by all Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation, including U.S.","Downers Grove, Illinois – U.S. Congressman Sean Casten, Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), and all Democratic members of the Illinois delegation sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem demanding answers about the extreme immigration enforcement operations in Illinois under “Operation Midway Blitz” and “Operation at Large.” In the letter, the lawmakers reprimanded DHS, the Department of Justice (DOJ), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials for violating due process as they continue to advance President Trump’s mass deportation scheme by targeting immigrants with no criminal convictions.

Citing lack of congressional oversight, indiscriminate arrests of immigrants, and the escalation of tensions during protests at Broadview ICE processing facility (Broadview), the lawmakers called for an immediate end to both Operation Midway Blitz and Operation at Large.

“While this operation [Operation Midway Blitz] supposedly targets ‘criminal illegal aliens,’ our constituents report that DHS officials are arresting individuals in their neighborhoods, at bus stops, and near schools. These enforcement operations do not reduce crime or make our communities safer. As we have seen throughout the implementation of President Trump’s mass deportation scheme, DHS is not focusing on the ‘worst of the worst’ as claimed, but has instead mostly arrested hardworking immigrants with no criminal convictions,” the lawmakers began their letter. “DHS and the Department of Justice (DOJ) have skirted or outright violated due process and other constitutional requirements intended to protect individuals in the United States from arbitrary arrests, detention, and deportation.”

“We urge you to end your dangerous operations in Illinois and provide our residents with transparency into these operations, including how they have siphoned resources from other federal law enforcement agencies that combat public safety threats in our communities,” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers condemned the secrecy surrounding Operation Midway Blitz, noting that Members of Congress have repeatedly requested access to detention facilities, including Broadview, and been denied by DHS without justification.

“Operation Midway Blitz has been shrouded in secrecy, with little notice to state and local officials as to the nature of the operation, the types of people targeted, where DHS is detaining people, and which agencies are required to detail officers to conduct immigration enforcement. DHS officials have avoided meeting with Members of Congress and have not responded to repeated congressional inquiries about recent enforcement activities. Furthermore, DHS has denied Members of Congress the opportunity to conduct lawful oversight at facilities where noncitizens are being held. DHS has also used military-style tactics and equipment to break down doors in suburban homes, with little transparency into the basis for such raids,” the lawmakers continued their letter.

The lawmakers underscored that the tactics DHS used in Southern California, headed by Gregory Bovino, will not be tolerated in Illinois, especially as DHS faces several lawsuits for its treatment of protesters in California. In Illinois, DHS and ICE masked agents have reportedly escalated tensions at Broadview by indiscriminately deploying tear gas and chemical agents on protestors. Reports have detailed a dangerous lack of communication between local law enforcement and ICE agents that led to injuries and further distrust between federal agencies, local law enforcement, and community members.

“Gregory Bovino, an official originally diverted from his responsibilities at the border to lead controversial operations in Southern California, announced a second operation in Illinois—'Operation at Large’—on social media. This operation will reportedly include indiscriminate raids, including at Home Depots and car washes. Mr. Bovino’s reckless and dangerous tactics in California should not be extended to Illinois, as they are already the subject of multiple lawsuits alleging abuses against citizens and noncitizens alike,” the lawmakers wrote. “Masked officers have arrested and detained U.S. citizens and lawful noncitizens without making attempts to verify—or even ignoring attempts to establish—U.S. citizenship or lawful presence.”

“These tactics are already being utilized by your agents in Illinois. While DHS has yet to provide Congress with current information on arrests in Illinois, your officials are estimating in the media that between 400 and 550 arrests have already occurred. Last Friday, ICE reportedly escalated tensions by indiscriminately using tear gas and chemical agents on peaceful protestors,” the lawmakers continued their letter.

“A spokesperson for the Broadview Police Department (BPD) said that BPD and ICE had an agreement that ICE would inform BPD before the agency used any chemical arms, but ICE did not provide such advance notification. As a result of your officials’ dangerous and reckless tactics, an officer was reportedly exposed to mace and tear gas used by ICE. While your spokesperson claims that ICE officials called local law enforcement multiple times for assistance, BPD says that the agency ‘did not receive ‘multiple calls for assistance’ from the leadership of the ICE detention facility in Broadview. That is false,’” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers exposed the Trump Administration’s failure to uphold due process as ICE agents carry out arbitrary arrests and detentions. Further, the Trump Administration has eliminated a longstanding requirement that ICE officers provide a written justification before targeting individuals for immigration arrests.

“We are already seeing improper arrests of U.S. citizens in Illinois, and are deeply disturbed by these indiscriminate arrests coupled with renewed efforts to gut due process and indefinitely detain people who have spent decades in the United States without committing any crime. While some attempts to fulfill President Trump’s mass deportation scheme have been struck down in courts, these efforts have nonetheless resulted in unlawful arrests, detentions, and, in some cases, deportations before courts can intervene,” the lawmakers wrote.

The lawmakers concluded their letter by denouncing the fear and division created by these operations and demanding transparency surrounding immigration enforcement activity in Chicago. Requesting a response by October 7, the lawmakers submitted questions about reports that DHS has brought in social media influencers to promote immigration raids; reports about the use of military weaponry, including drones, during raids; and about the training that federal officials have received on responding to and de-escalating protests.

“Your extreme immigration enforcement operations in Illinois have already devastated families and torn at the social fabric of our communities,” the lawmakers concluded their letter.

In addition to Casten and Durbin, the letter was signed by all Democratic members of the Illinois congressional delegation, including U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Jonathan Jackson (D-IL-01), Robin Kelly (D-IL-02), Delia Ramirez (D-IL-03), Jesús G. “Chuy” García (D-IL-04), Mike Quigley (D-IL-05), Danny Davis (D-IL-07), Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL-08), Jan Schakowsky (D-IL-09), Brad Schneider (D-IL-10), Bill Foster (D-IL-11), Nikki Budzinski (D-IL-13), Lauren Underwood (D-IL-14), and Eric Sorensen (D-IL-17).

The Vorbe family is not only economically powerful, but politically as well.","SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Federal immigration agents have arrested Dimitri Vorbe, one of Haiti’s most powerful businessmen and the latest elite figure from the troubled Caribbean country to be detained on U.S. soil.

Vorbe was in custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday, according to online records. He was being held at Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami.

It wasn’t immediately clear why Vorbe was arrested or if he faces any charges. A search for court records in Florida on Tuesday showed no formal charges. An ICE spokesperson did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

His arrest comes two months after ICE agents in Florida arrested Réginald Boulos, a businessman, doctor and former Haitian presidential hopeful. Authorities have accused Boulos of supporting violent gangs in Haiti that the U.S. government has deemed terrorist groups.

“With the arrests of Boulos and Vorbe, you are seeing a strata of Haitian society touched in their places of exile,” said Michael Deibert, author of “Notes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti,” and “Haiti Will Not Perish: A Recent History.”

“A message is being sent to the upper echelon of Haiti’s political and economic elite that they’re not untouchable anymore,” he said.

A wealthy scion

Vorbe and his family own Société Générale d’Énergie S.A, a private power company that was one of the biggest suppliers of electricity to Haiti’s state-owned company.

The Vorbe family also was known for securing major government construction projects for the building of roads and other infrastructure under former President René Préval.

“They were getting lots of money from the state,” said Jake Johnston, international research director at the Washington-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. “Both Boulos and Dimitri Vorbe were the two members of the elite, the oligarchs that Jovenel went after.”

In 2020, the administration of slain former President Jovenel Moïse seized Vorbe’s power company following accusations of corruption.

“There is not much love lost in Haiti either for Dimitri Vorbe or Réginald Boulos, or many of the elite families,” Johnston said of the arrests. “Many people will cheer it in a country with a broken judicial system as it’s some sliver of accountability, (but) we don’t know what any of this is for. … How does this all fit together into a strategy that actually benefits Haiti?”

A US crackdown

Vorbe was taken into custody a day after the U.S. government designated two former Haitian public officials who were close to the Vorbe family for involvement in “significant corruption” while in office.

The designation against Arnel Belizaire, a former member of Haiti’s Chamber of Deputies, and Antonio Cheramy, a former senator, means that they and their immediate family are “generally ineligible” to enter the U.S.

“The U.S. government will remain relentless in pursuing those supporting terrorist gangs through indictments, arrests, sanctions, arms seizures and other immigration restrictions,” Christopher Landau, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of State, said Monday.

The Vorbe family is not only economically powerful, but politically as well.

ICE has come under increased scrutiny for deploying agents in plain clothes and wearing face coverings during operations, a measure officials say is essential to protect both agents and their families from threats. Under the new legislation, California becomes the first state to prohibit enforcement agents from covering their faces, with limited exceptions for undercover operations and medical masks.

What To Know

Newsom signed a series of legislative bills aimed at curbing ICE's ability to conduct raids in sensitive locations such as schools and churches.

Under state law, schools must notify families when immigration officers are present on campus. Student records and classrooms are protected from access by ICE without a judicial warrant or court order, per the new legislation. Similarly, emergency rooms and other nonpublic areas of hospitals are off-limits to immigration enforcement without court authorization, and information collected by health care providers is treated as protected medical data.

The laws also require that law enforcement and immigration officers be clearly identifiable by name or badge number, with exceptions limited to situations where identification is not possible. The use of masks by officers is restricted to cases where it is absolutely necessary.

Additionally, impersonating a federal agent is explicitly defined as a criminal offense, under the bill.

Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli told CBS News in an interview on September 22 that California has no jurisdiction to regulate the federal government. His remarks came in response to the recently signed law, which is set to take effect next year. Essayli's statement reflects the federal government's position that state law cannot override federal operations, and he indicated that federal agents in California would not be bound by the state mask restrictions.

DHS has repeatedly claimed that ICE officers have faced a surge in assaults, including attacks using vehicles, as well as online doxing campaigns targeting officers and their families. However, the agency has refused to release a detailed breakdown of the alleged assaults.

Despite the new restrictions, DHS has said that ICE will continue its immigration enforcement operations in California.

The confrontation highlights growing tensions between federal law enforcement agencies and California's state leadership over President Donald Trump's hardline immigration agenda.

Newsom has repeatedly squared off and gone toe to toe with the Trump administration, particularly over immigration raids and the federal deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of U.S. Marines to quell immigration protests in Los Angeles in June, despite objections from state leaders.

What People Are Saying

Newsom said on Saturday: ""It's like a dystopian sci-fi movie—unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. This is a disgrace. This is an outrage, what we've allowed to happen in this country.""

Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin: ""He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom's unconstitutional ban.""

Acting U.S. Attorney Bill Eassayli told CBS News: ""The law has no force or effect on federal agencies. The State of California has no jurisdiction to regulate anything that we do in the federal government and I've instructed our agents to disregard it.""

Jason P. Houser, former chief of staff, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and former CBP counterterrorism official, said in a press release: ""Ensuring that officers are clearly identified, while providing sensible exceptions, helps protect both the public and law enforcement personnel. These are common-sense necessities that safeguard all law enforcement agencies as they keep us safe and protect our communities.

Alvaro Mejia Ayala, now 22, was arrested and charged with strangulation Sept. 17, the day he’s accused of choking his baby sister, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

Leesburg police are not releasing the child’s identity at the request of the family.

Officers responded to Hancock Place NE in Leesburg around 10 a.m. on Sept. 17 for a call involving an infant in medical distress. Despite extensive efforts from first responders and medical professionals to save her life, the child died just after midnight on Tuesday.

Ayala left the scene before officers arrived, according to Leesburg Police Chief Thea Pirnat, but was found several hours later and will face additional charges, including murder. He is currently being held at the county’s detention center.

“The entire process may take several months and this is considered a very active investigation,” Pirnat said during a news conference Tuesday. “Let me be clear, this was not an accident. A child was murdered in a deliberate act. The Leesburg Police Department and our criminal justice partners are fully committed to ensuring that the person responsible is held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”

Police did not release additional details about the circumstances of the child’s death.

“We will continue to provide information when it is legally and ethically appropriate to do so, but we will not be prematurely releasing details that could compromise the integrity of this investigation or derail the pursuit of justice,” Pirnat said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has also issued an immigration detainer for Ayala, according to Pirnat, which requests the jail to hold him for 48 hours longer than the time he’d be released so ICE can take him into federal custody.

In a news release, the Department of Homeland Security said Ayala entered the U.S. with his family in 2016 from El Salvador and that his immigration case was dismissed in October 2024.

“The death of a child is an unbearable loss, and this one has deeply affected the involved family, our community and every first responder that was called to help,” Pirnat said.

Ayala is expected in court in November.

The class action lawsuit filed this week could affect immigrants who have been detained under similar circumstances in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island.","The ACLU of Maine has joined a class action lawsuit alleging that federal immigration officials are violating the constitutional rights of many individuals caught up in the nationwide crackdown on non-citizens.

The lawsuit focuses on whether non-citizens who are detained far from the border are entitled to bond hearings before an immigration judge. That was the practice for nearly 30 years, according to the national ACLU and their state affiliates in Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire.

But the class action lawsuit filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts accuses the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security of illegally reversing that precedent by denying detainees the ability to seek release on bond while their immigration cases play out. The groups contend that the agencies are ""systemically misclassifying people arrested inside the United States"" by treating them the same as individuals who are stopped at the border or at ports of entry — a group who can be held without bond hearings under current law.

""This statute has never been applied to people arrested in the interior of the United States and placed in removal proceedings, and this practice blatantly goes against its plain language,” Max Brooks, an immigration attorney for ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. “However, CBP and ICE have begun indefinitely jailing people who are undergoing civil immigration proceedings that can take months or years. This is a clear violation of the due process rights of immigrants as outlined by federal law.""

The lawsuit is just the latest legal challenge of the Trump administration's detention and mass deportation campaign against non-citizens, including many who have been living and working in the U.S. for years and who have no criminal records. Multiple other lawsuits have been filed across the country against the current practice of holding immigrants in detention facilities while their cases work through the immigration courts.

Earlier this month, the Board of Immigration Appeals within the DOJ issued a decision allowing immigration judges to deny detainees access to a bond hearing even if they were stopped far from the border. In its decision, the board noted that judges cannot hold bond hearings for non-citizens who are detained after presenting themselves at the border or at a port of entry.

The board added that interpreting the Immigration and Nationality Act otherwise ""would require reading the (law) to conclude that Congress intended that aliens unlawfully entering the United States without inspection, particularly those who successfully evaded apprehension for more than 2 years, be rewarded with the opportunity for a bond hearing before an Immigration Judge, whereas aliens who present themselves to officers at a port of entry are ineligible for a bond hearing.

Last week, a federal judge in Maine ruled that Customs and Border Patrol agents likely violated a man's due process rights by denying him a bond hearing after he was arrested near Waterville. The judge then prohibited the federal government from transferring the man to a distant detention facility.

The class action lawsuit filed this week could affect immigrants who have been detained under similar circumstances in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island. In addition to the ACLU and state affiliates, the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinic and two law firms, Foley Haug and Araujo and Fisher, have joined the lawsuit.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/17dc130/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6000x3150+0+425/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F99%2Fd4bcf24c40ee8cb5a384bc767fe9%2Fimg-2424.JPG,N,,2025-09-23 19:58:22.778748

said that the Democrats are holding government funding “hostage” to their demands for vast amounts of healthcare funding.","President Trump has abruptly canceled this week’s planned meeting with congressional Democratic leaders, refusing to negotiate over their demands to shore up healthcare funds as part of a deal to prevent a potential federal government shutdown.

In a lengthy Tuesday social media post, Trump rejected the sit-down the White House had agreed to the day before. It would have been the first time the Republican president met with the Democratic Party’s leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, since his return to the White House.

“I have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive,” Trump wrote in the post.

The president complained the Democrats “are threatening to shut down the Government of the United States” unless the Republicans agree to more funding on healthcare for various groups of people he has criticized. Trump did not close the door on a future sit-down with the Democratic leaders, but he warned of a “long and brutal slog” ahead unless Democrats dropped their demands to salvage healthcare funds.

The stalemate over a funding deal — or even talks between the White House and Congress to strike a compromise — has quickly intensified the risk of federal closures, starting as soon as next week, ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline for the start of the government’s new fiscal year.

The Democratic leaders swiftly accused the Republican president of throwing a tantrum and running away from the situation.

“Trump Always Chickens Out,” Jeffries posted on X.

In a post on X directed at Trump, Schumer said Democrats will sit down and discuss healthcare “when you’re finished ranting.”

Schumer said Trump “is running away from the negotiating table before he even gets there” and would “rather throw a tantrum than do his job.”

Trump has been unafraid of shutting down the government and, during his first term, was president during the nation’s longest federal closure, during the 2018-19 holiday season, when he was pushing Congress to provide funds for his long-promised U.S.-Mexico border wall.

The president insisted over the weekend that essential services, including those for veterans, would remain open.

Thursday’s scheduled meeting would have potentially set up a showdown at the White House, reminiscent of the 2018 funding fight when Trump led an explosive public session with Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).

Schumer and Jeffries had been demanding a meeting with Trump to work out a compromise over the healthcare funds, and earlier Tuesday had welcomed plans for this week’s meeting.

But the Republican president has been reluctant to enter talks and instructed GOP leaders on Capitol Hill not to negotiate with the Democrats.

The office of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said that the Democrats are holding government funding “hostage” to their demands for vast amounts of healthcare funding.

Republicans, who have the majority in both the House and the Senate, have been trying to avoid a shutdown. Johnson had led the passage late last week of a temporary funding measure, which would have kept government offices running into November while talks get underway.

That’s the typical way to buy time during funding fights, but the measure failed in the Senate. Democrats refused to support the stopgap bill because it did not include their priorities of healthcare funds. A Democratic proposal, with the healthcare money restored, was defeated by Senate Republicans.

The Democratic proposal would extend enhanced health insurance subsidies set to expire at the end of the year, plus reverse Medicaid cuts that were included in Republicans’ big tax breaks and spending cuts bill enacted earlier this year.

Republicans have said the Democrats’ demands to reverse the Medicaid changes are a nonstarter, but they have also said there is time to address the health insurance subsidy issue in the months ahead.

Congress was sent home amid the logjam, and the House called off next week’s session. But Jeffries, in a letter to colleagues, summoned House Democrats back to work on Monday evening, when senators are also expected to resume their session — days before the funding deadline.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/0e30cb1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5486x2880+0+388/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F95%2Fbe%2Feaf2230e44fe9748a6caabd70d8b%2Fd67c463ecca84fc3a6ec45874cd6f963.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 19:57:51.119617

For Councilor Kanal, the fight underscores the need to codify Portland’s sanctuary city status and bring transparency to ICE operations in the city.","As the Trump administration forges ahead with its attacks on sanctuary cities and states, the City of Portland, Oregon is at the center of a growing battle over its last remaining immigration detention site: a 5,194-square-foot holding facility inside ICE’s Portland field office.

A community coalition, armed with more than 17,800 petition signatures, has for months pushed the city to revoke the conditional land use permit that allows ICE to operate the state’s only ICE facility, located at 4310 SW Macadam Avenue.

Last week, the city issued a land use violation notice against ICE over prolonged or overnight detentions that violated the conditions of the land use approval. “U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement made clear detention limitation commitments to our community, and we believe they broke those policies more than two dozen times,” Portland Mayor Keith Wilson said in a statement.

In July, Fox12 revealed that ICE repeatedly detained people for more than 24 hours, despite the permit stipulating that detainees cannot be held overnight or for more than 12 hours. Federal data showed that ICE had violated its permit at least 25 times, the city says.

In response to Next City’s request for comment, the ICE field office pointed to Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin’s written statement: “Mayor Wilson’s claims of substandard conditions at ICE facilities are categorically FALSE.” McLaughlin also stated, “ICE has taken action to ensure that detainees are not held for more than 12 hours, including by increasing staffing and other resources provided by the One Big Beautiful Bill.”

Advocates have long called for the permit, issued in 2011, to be pulled. In addition to alleged permit violations, they’ve cited public safety concerns for nearby residents — including children at the Cottonwood School next door, which moved in August over ICE’s use of chemical sprays against protestors, among other concerns.

But the new data changed the calculus for local lawmakers. “If we allow ICE to continue to operate when they have violated their permits, that means anything becomes permissible moving forward,” city councilor Angelita Morillo said in a July council meeting.

The permit fight and what comes next

With advocates calling on the city to shut down the Southwest Portland ICE facility for months, city administrators submitted a memo to the mayor over the summer outlining processes for any potential code violations, including noise violations and nuisance complaints.

On July 21, following the publication of data obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request by UCLA researchers, Portland Permitting and Development received a formal complaint alleging that ICE was violating the 12-hour detention limit. To proceed with such a complaint, the city would have to gain access to both the building and ICE records.

The violation notice prompts a process to determine whether the facility’s operation complies with the conditions of its land use permit. ICE has 30 days to correct the alleged violation; otherwise, the city can issue a fine or schedule a hearing to reconsider the approval. Following the results of the hearing, any member of the public would be able to request an appeal with Portland’s city council.

That lengthy process frustrates some on the city council. Councilor Sameer Kanal tells Next City he’d like to see the city pursue other strategies to curb ICE’s local presence, such as banning chemical munitions routinely used against protesters. “They are collective punishment,” he says. “And we could prohibit that.”

Still, for immigration advocates this latest development is a small victory. Susan Anglada Bartley, an original petitioner of revoking the land use permit, tells Next City that “the combination of direct action…the petition, the coalition around the petition, and the amazing work of frontliners…are all components of why the city had to finally admit that the facility is operating in violation of the permit.”

Closing sanctuary loopholes

There’s precedent for this kind of grassroots pressure in Oregon. In 2020, NORCOR, a regional jail in the City of The Dalles, ended its contract with ICE and stopped detaining individuals on civil immigration charges in the face of community opposition and lawsuits alleging violations of the state’s sanctuary law.

On the heels of that decision, Oregon updated its sanctuary state status and passed the Sanctuary Promise Act, banning private immigration detention facilities within the state.

What is a sanctuary policy?

A sanctuary city or state is defined by its commitment to limit or refuse to share information with federal immigration officers regarding its constituents or citizens. It’s a broad term with little legal or universal determination, meaning it can cover a broad array of policies implemented by states, cities, jurisdictions, buildings and other entities to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Read more.

This distinction is important, experts explain. The Portland ICE facility’s building is owned by 4310 Building LLC, a shell company for developer Stuart Lindquist, incorporated by his attorneys at Kell, Alterman & Runstein. (Lindquist made headlines in 2018 after admitting to striking an anti-ICE protester with his car, telling media afterward that he was willing to fight protesters: “I’d be glad to take them on one at a time, bring ‘em on.”) Attorneys representing Lindquist did not respond to Next City’s inquiries.

For use of his building, ICE pays 4310 Building LLC roughly $2.45 million a year on a lease set to expire in 2033. Because ICE operates the site — rather than a private contractor — the facility has avoided running afoul of Oregon’s sanctuary law.

The controversial arrangement has left advocates questioning what it means for Oregon to be a sanctuary state if private individuals are allowed to profit from the surveillance, apprehension and detention of individuals undergoing a civil process.

“Oregon is a sanctuary state by name only,” Susan Anglada Bartley wrote in a message to Next City, “We’ve called out our city and state governments for complicity with ICE for many years. In order to approach being a sanctuary, complicity with ICE & GEO-Group must end!”

Local officials are working on strategies to reduce ICE’s power. Councilor Morillo’s office, for example, is currently developing policies to prevent private security forces from being used to detain immigrants; to reduce federal officials’ ability to use surveillance technology despite Portland’s strict rules on facial recognition and other surveillance technology; and to financially disincentivize landlords from leasing property to ICE or its contractors, due to the increased security and environmental cleanup costs that their operations incur on the city.

Despite local efforts in sanctuary cities and states, ICE’s operations are rapidly expanding nationally. A recent Washington Post investigation found that federal officials are looking to hire more than 10,000 new immigration officers and procure 300 new ICE offices across the country “as fast as possible.”

ICE has made about three times as many arrests between May and July as it did during the same period last year, per government figures obtained by the Deportation Data Project, though about half of detainees have no criminal record and are not facing criminal charges.

The consequences of closure

Meanwhile, some immigration advocates are conflicted about closing ICE’s Southwest Portland field office. The ACLU of Oregon has argued that its removal could make it harder for Oregon-based immigrants to access attorneys while detailed or to be released in the state.

That could lead to detainees being transported to ICE contractor GEO Group’s notorious detention center in Tacoma, Washington. The 1,575-bed facility has been the subject of multiple controversies — including the GEO Group paying a maximum of $1 a day to the detained migrants it had cleaning these facilities.

“If people are being held but can’t say where they are, or they’re being sent straight to Tacoma, that time [for lawyers] to respond and to get people out of detention is just gone,” Natalie Lerner, a board member at Portland Immigrants Rights Coalition, told Street Roots.

But immigration lawyers say release is rare regardless of where a person is detained.

Shizuko Hashimoto, a partner at Immigrant Law Group LLC, says that in her 10 years of experience, once a person is detained on civil immigration charges it is next to impossible to get them out, especially lately.

“I don’t think anybody has been successful at advocating for somebody who [ICE] detained actually being released,” says Shizuko Hashimoto, a partner at Immigrant Law Group LLC.

She describes a common practice under the Trump administration where attorneys from the Department of Homeland Security submit a motion to dismiss the deportation proceedings, only for individuals to find ICE waiting outside the courtroom to deport them through the administration’s expedited removal process.

Legal scholars stress how unusual the U.S. approach is. “There is no similar circumstance where we put people in a carceral space for a civil violation,” says Juliet Stumpf, chair of Lewis and Clark Law School and an expert on immigration law.

For Councilor Kanal, the fight underscores the need to codify Portland’s sanctuary city status and bring transparency to ICE operations in the city. Still, he recognizes the limitations of what local governments can do under Trump’s administration.

“We as Portlanders can’t solve ICE alone,” he says.

""The family is in disbelief that this is happening to my husband,"" Amanda Dorsett told Newsweek.

Newsweek has contacted the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for comment.

President Donald Trump has ordered his administration to conduct what it calls the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history.

In addition to people living in the country without legal status, immigrants with valid documentation, including green cards and visas, have been detained.

Newsweek has revealed dozens of cases involving green card holders and applicants who were swept up in the ICE raids. Critics say the administration's hard-line stance is aggressive and have accused the agency of racial profiling, ignoring due process rights, and of human rights abuses.

Salas Mota entered the United States in March 2013, his wife said. His application for permanent residency was filed in October 2024, and he has since been issued a Social Security number and work permit, Dorsett said. She added that her partner was waiting for his green card approval when he was detained.

The couple, who have lived together since 2019, are raising two U.S.-born children, ages 6 and 4. Dorsett described the children as distraught by their father's detention and said his absence has created emotional and financial hardship.

LAST YEAR Donald Trump was running for president on the promise to launch the “largest deportation of criminals in American history”, part of a broader pledge to expel millions of illegal immigrants. Eight months into his presidency immigration arrests have indeed surged, so much so that the administration is scrambling to build new detention centres to hold the newly nabbed. But as our charts show, a growing share of those detained are not convicted criminals—a trend that threatens to erode public support for Mr Trump’s crackdown.

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: — actual voters.","AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González.

We end today’s show in Chicago, where Juan is. As at least 10 people were arrested in protests outside an ICE facility Friday, with federal immigration agents firing pepper balls and using tear gas on the crowd, Democratic congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh was thrown to the ground by ICE agents. People had rallied outside the facility to protest the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz,” which has led to the arrest of nearly 550 people in a sweeping crackdown on immigrants in the city.

We are going to Chicago, where we’re joined by Kat Abughazaleh, who is a progressive congressional candidate in Illinois’s 9th District, which includes Chicago.

Kat, welcome to Democracy Now! Describe what happened to you. We’re going to show the video.

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: Yeah, so, this is actually the third time that ICE has thrown me to the ground. I have been at this facility for the last three weeks every Friday morning, and I’ll be back this Friday. I encourage anyone in Illinois to join me, 7 to 9 a.m. at 1930 Beach Street, B-E-A-C-H. This was, as I said, the third time that ICE has done this to me. It was probably the most violent occasion of throwing me to the ground. But, essentially, a car was about to run over a fellow protester, and so I went to check on that person. And that was all the justification an officer needed to pick me up and throw me to the ground despite being half his size.

And what I really want to stress here is that is what these officers are willing to do when there is press and cameras around. The reason we are protesting at this facility is because they are committing human rights abuses within the Broadview processing facility. It is a processing facility, so people are not supposed to be kept there for more than 12 hours at a time, but they are being kept for days or weeks, without beds, without hot meals, with hygienic products. And if they are willing to do that to a congressional candidate on camera in front of press, imagine what they are willing to do to their detainees behind boarded-up windows.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Kat, you say you found two badges there. What did it say on the badges?

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: So, I have no idea, the people who have accosted me. I have no idea who they are. I have no idea who these men are. They have had masks and sunglasses and hats, sometimes when the sun is still down. We have seen two badge numbers the entire three weeks that we have been here — four weeks, if we include a vigil earlier in the summer — and they were just numbers. There was no name, and there was no identifying law enforcement agency. I have no idea if these men are actually affiliated with ICE. For all I know, this could just be random men who said, “I’m going to put on a mask and a costume I got from Spirit Halloween to make me feel like I’m in the Army, and go and rough up some protesters today.” We have no idea who these people are.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And in terms of what you know about the conditions in the Broadview facility, could you talk about that?

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: Yes, this Broadview facility is horrific. We’ve gotten reporting about dozens of people being kept in one cell. And these are our neighbors. These are pregnant women and grandmothers sleeping on concrete floors. I have not been inside the facility. Elected officials that have tried to inspect it have not been allowed inside. But I can attest that two weeks ago, when I saw prisoners being marched into a van, they were in the same clothes they were detained in, and we have no idea how long they’ve been in there, and they were in the same clothes they were detained in. The conditions at this facility are horrendous. They are committing crimes against humanity. And it is so important to remember that all of the treatment that we went through as protesters doesn’t hold a candle to what these detainees are dealing with. I mean, ICE agents shot and killed a man two Fridays ago in the Chicago area. They are able to act with impunity. They are able to hurt whoever they want. Last Friday was the first time they had taken protesters inside the facility.

And while the video of me being thrown to the ground has gone kind of viral, I want to talk about a few other things that happened that day, because they haven’t been covered as much. We had to play tug of war with a man’s body to keep him from being abducted inside the facility. Right before we were tear-gassed, ICE was carrying a van with a protester that had been detained inside of the van. We stood arm in arm. All this is happening on Broadview public property, on public streets. They tried to ram the van through us. A man fell in front of the van, and the van was going to drive over his head, and I helped him up before that happened. But they were totally willing to do that. They shot a man in the face with a pepper ball bullet. They tear-gassed us as they were trying to drive a car through a crowd. And then, after that, they threw a tear gas canister at the press area, very intentionally, after protesters were already dispersing, because, you know, we were coughing and trying to get tear gas out of our eyes.

AMY GOODMAN: Kat Abughazaleh, you are running for Congress, a congressional candidate in Illinois’s 9th District, which includes Chicago. The election is in November of ’26, the ultimate election. Why are you running for Congress?

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: I’m a researcher and journalist who covers the far right. I have spent my career deradicalizing and educating people on far-right narratives and misinformation. I have spent my career, just as my colleagues have, trying to get Democrats to put up a resistance to the far right, to understand that the old playbook is gone and that it’s not coming back. And I don’t feel like our leaders are doing that. And so I got sick of waiting around, and I decided to run the type of campaign I think we should.

And that is with unapologetic progressivism, anti-fascism and using our resources to materially improve people’s lives right now. So, we do voter outreach, but our campaign office also doubles as a mutual aid hub. We don’t ask for $500 a plate at an event. For our kickoff event, for instance, we asked people to bring a box of pads or tampons for Chicago’s Period Collective. We are about mobilizing people on the ground right now and making politics as accessible as possible, while also not compromising on basic human rights.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you’re running for the seat to replace Jan Schakowsky, who’s retiring. There are several other candidates running in that field right now. Why do you think that voters would be best choosing you as the candidate?

KAT ABUGHAZALEH: You know, Illinois does a lot of things right, and that’s the reason they aren’t dealing with, until very recently, people like Stephen Miller and Elon Musk on a daily basis. I have been. I am the only candidate in my race with a track record of fighting and winning against the far right.

I am the most effective communicator in my race. And I am the only candidate in my race to have the majority of her money come from small-dollar donations. We’ve raised over a million dollars, and our average donation is just 32 bucks. We have over 7,000 volunteers, and that’s not because I’m some force. It’s because people want progressive policies. They want commonsense policies. They want a center that recenters —

The proposed policy changes could reignite the debate over the use of foreign labor by U.S. employers.

The move comes as President Donald Trump has taken aim at H-1B visas, a program used widely by Big Tech and outsourcing companies to hire foreign workers, announcing Friday that companies would be required to pay a $100,000 fee with new applications submitted after Sept. 21.

The administration on Tuesday targeted H-1B visa allocation, proposing a “weighted selection process” for when annual demand for the visas tops the 85,000 limit set by Congress, which it says has happened every year for more than a decade.

The new process would replace the current lottery system that determines who gets to apply for those limited visa spots in favor of putting more weight on higher skilled and higher paid foreign workers, according to a proposed rule set to be published in the Federal Register on Wednesday.

Under the current lottery rules, offers to apply for an H-1B visa are assigned at random.

The Trump administration’s proposal would assign prospective employees to four different wage bands, with workers in the highest wage category being entered into the selection pool four times and those in the lowest wage category being entered into the selection pool once.

The Department of Homeland Security stated in the proposal that the weighted system would better serve the visa program’s original intent and ""incentivize employers to offer higher wages or higher skilled positions to H-1B workers and disincentivize the existing widespread use of the H-1B program to fill lower paid or lower skilled positions.”

It said the proposed selection process would still maintain opportunities for employers to hire H-1B workers at “all wage levels.”

'A strong signal'

The H-1B visa program allows U.S. employers to temporarily hire skilled foreign workers in “specialty occupations” across health care, tech and finance industries, and other STEM-related fields.

The two new proposed policies together send “a strong signal of the direction that the administration wants to go,” said Xiao Wang, CEO of Boundless Immigration, a company that offers services to people navigating the immigration process in the U.S.

If adopted, the policies would benefit companies seeking to keep foreigners with specialized skills who studied at American universities in the U.S., as well as ensuring H-1B visas “disproportionately go to people who are deemed higher skilled, represented by higher wages and higher salary,” he said.

Trump stated Friday that changes were needed in the visa system, saying it was designed to bring in temporary workers with “additive, high-skilled functions, but it has been deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.”

For the last H-1B lottery round, which closed its registration in March, about 339,000 people applied. Of those, 120,141 applications were selected for the lottery, according to USCIS data.

The proposal faces a 30-day public comment period before it is considered by the administration for a final rule, a process that could take months.

If the changes are adopted, companies seeking to hire lower-wage workers from India and China for computer-related jobs appear likely to be among the most affected. For more than a decade, about 60% of H-1B workers approved every year have held computer-related jobs, according to Pew Research.

Start-ups and smaller companies who cannot afford to pay their workers in the higher pay categories compared to major tech companies would also be impacted, Wang said.

Deedy Das, a partner at Menlo Ventures venture capital group, said in a social media post that the latest proposal would hurt many tech companies.

“Overall, it’s really bad for startups, early employees, helps IT consulting shops and can be easily gamed,“ Das wrote.

Trump’s announcement of a new $100,000 fee on H-1B visas touched off a frenzy among current visa holders, the companies that employ them and countries around the world as they worked to understand the edict.

Eventually, the White House clarified that it would be a one-time fee and apply only to new visa applicants.

Trump said companies would have to pay the fee for new H-1B visa applications submitted after Sept. 21. That's a steep rise from current fees, which are usually $2,000 to about $5,000.

Both the fee and Tuesday's proposal are likely to face challenges in court.

A growing chorus on both the left and the right say an over-reliance on the visa by U.S. firms has put U.S.-born workers at a disadvantage. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has called the H-1B visa program a “scam,” while the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute has claimed that some of the companies most reliant on H-1B visas, such as Amazon and Facebook’s parent, Meta, have also had sizable layoffs, though it did not cite evidence that the use of the visa and the layoffs are related.

In the first half of 2025, Amazon received approval for more than 12,000 H-1B visas, while Meta received more than 5,000.

In general, U.S. states can't regulate the federal government but can force federal agents to follow local laws as long as it does not undermine their work.","The Department of Homeland Security has said it will refuse to comply with a new California law that bans ICE agents from hiding their faces during immigration raids.

On Saturday California Governor Gavin Newsom gave his assent to a bill forbidding local or federal law enforcement agents to wear ski masks, neck gaiters, or other face coverings while on official business.

Wearing masks is rare in the history of American law enforcement, but has become routine under the Trump administration as agents reportedly racing to fulfill stringent arrest quotas round up thousands of immigrants without criminal records.

""It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie — unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing,"" Newsom said as he signed the bill. ""This is a disgrace. This is an outrage, what we’ve allowed to happen in this country.""

But on Monday DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said her forces would defy the ban, calling it ""a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and P.R. stunt.""

“Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement,"" said McLaughlin in a statement.

""At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000 percent increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signs unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections...

""To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom’s unconstitutional ban.""

DHS spokespeople have repeatedly claimed that masks are necessary to protect its agents, giving ever-increasing figures for the rise in assaults from 300 percent in April to 500 percent in June to 1,000 percent today.

But officials have repeatedly refused to release the underlying data, give further details, or clarify what counts as an assault, leading many journalists to question such numbers.

ICE arrests have also doubled or tripled in many states, meaning incidents stemming from arrests would naturally also increase. What little data DHS has released show that the overall number of incidents was quite low, with 79 assaults in the first half of 2025 compared to 10 the previous year.

In response to questions from The Independent, a DHS spokesperson once again declined to give details, saying all immigration agents are clearly marked as law enforcement while on duty.

In an interview with Fox News, Bill Essayli, the Acting U.S. Attorney for Central California, accused Democrats of whipping up a violent fervor against ICE agents simply doing their jobs.

""The left continues to fuel this insanity, [this] hysteria, that the federal government is somehow an illegitimate force and it's okay to oppose ICE.

""So what they do is lay the gasoline and the matches out and they get people spun up and they hope that someone does what they want 'em to do, which is burn the place down because they don't get their way.

""We're not putting up with it, and if you try that here, you'll end up in handcuffs.""

Critics say that routine mask-wearing insulates ICE agents against the consequences of breaking rules or abusing detainees, as well as making it easier for criminals to impersonate law enforcement.

Whether California's ban is constitutional remains unclear. In general, U.S. states can't regulate the federal government but can force federal agents to follow local laws as long as it does not undermine their work.

The U.S. president claimed that scientific predictions made by U.N. bodies were wrong and blasted wind farms and other renewable energy projects.
The U.S. president mentioned that the two leaders briefly spoke as they passed each other on the path to the main speaker podium.","Since returning to the Oval Office, Trump has scaled back U.S. support of the U.N. This includes withdrawing the U.S. from the U.N. Human Rights Council again and pulling funding for some of the body’s key programs, such as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), an agency that provides aid to Palestinian refugees.

Most recently, the Trump administration announced the U.S. wouldn’t participate in a U.N. review of the country’s human rights record.

Early into his nearly hourlong remarks on Tuesday, Trump said the global body is “not even coming close to living up” to its potential.

“All they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter up,” the president said. “It’s empty words, and empty words don’t solve war. The only thing that solves war, and wars, is action.”

Trump’s wandering speech had no shortage of false claims and contradictions. He touted peace while telling drug cartels he would blow them “out of existence.” He questioned the purpose of the U.N.’s existence, but later in the morning told the U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres that the U.S. “is behind the United Nations 100%.”

“I may disagree with it sometimes, but I am so behind it because the potential for peace at this institution is great,” he said.

Here’s are some highlights from Trump’s U.N. speech:

1. A teleprompter malfunction from the start

Watch the clip in the player above.

While opening his speech, Trump told the room that the teleprompter wasn’t working, saying that whoever was operating it was “in big trouble.” He later mocked the U.N. for having a “bad escalator.”

2. Trump claimed he has “ended seven wars,” while the U.N. offered empty words

Watch the clip in the player above.

Trump, who is campaigning for a Nobel Peace Prize, boasted how he — and not the U.N. — has been a key player in settling global conflicts. But Trump’s repeated claims of being a peacemaker are complicated. Some of the conflicts he has cited in the past have not been wars or have yet to end.

3. Trump pushes back on countries who recognized a Palestinian state

Watch the clip in the player above.

This week alone, Britain, Canada, Australia, Portugal and France all formally recognized a Palestinian state, despite opposition from the U.S. and Israel. Trump said this upswell of support for Palestine would “encourage continued conflict” and would be a “reward” for Hamas, which carried out the Oct. 7 attack almost two years ago that set off the war in Gaza.

4. Trump urges Europe to “step it up” against Russia

Watch the clip in the player above.

Trump said if Russia does not end its invasion of Ukraine, he is prepared to impose “a strong round of powerful tariffs.” He then told European nations to “step it up” and stop importing Russian oil.

5. Trump tells countries they’re “going to hell” over migration

Watch the clip in the player above.

Trump scolded representatives for their countries’ immigration policies, while upholding his mass deportation agenda in the U.S. as the best way to address the “crisis of uncontrolled migration.” This led the president to say, “I’m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell.”

6. Trump described climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world”

Watch the clip in the player above.

The U.S. president claimed that scientific predictions made by U.N. bodies were wrong and blasted wind farms and other renewable energy projects. He instead encouraged countries to buy fossil fuels from the U.S.

7. As tensions between Brazil and U.S. mount, their leaders give contrasting speeches

As is tradition, Brazil led off the first day of speeches.

Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, or Lula as he’s better known, warned that multilateralism, or international cooperation, “is at a new crossroads.”

“Throughout the world, anti-democratic forces are trying to subjugate institutions and stifle freedoms. They worship violence, praise ignorance, act as physical and digital militias, and restrict the press,” Lula said, through an interpreter, in his nearly 19-minute speech.

Trump, who delivered his speech right after Lula, levied a 50% tariff on many Brazilian goods largely as a penalty for the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a Trump ally who was earlier this month found guilty of a coup plot.

Though Trump criticized Brazil in his remarks, he did at one point strike a softer tone.

Watch the clip in the player above.

The U.S. president mentioned that the two leaders briefly spoke as they passed each other on the path to the main speaker podium.

“I saw him, he saw me, and we embraced,” Trump said. “But he seemed like a very nice man, actually. He liked me, I liked him,” Trump said, prompting chatter and a smattering of applause from global leaders in the room.

“We actually agreed that we would meet next week,” Trump said, though he didn’t provide details on this possible meet-up.

The U.S. president quickly returned to his criticism of Lula’s country, saying, “Brazil is doing poorly.”

In an interview Monday, Lula told PBS News Hour co-anchor Amna Nawaz that people ask him whether he likes Trump.

Watch the segment in the player above.

“It’s not an issue of whether I like him or not,” he said.

“What matters is that he’s the head of state of the United States, and I’m the head of state in Brazil. And as two heads of state, we have to respect each other, because we were elected democratically by the people of our countries, and we need to give support to these people and to govern them the best way possible,” he added.

The U.S. immigration system is replete with measures that violently strip immigrants of their reproductive freedom.","A 28-year-old woman, who was set to give birth in a matter of days, was detained by immigration authorities in California this summer amid the current presidential administration’s crackdown on immigrants, asylum seekers, and U.S. citizens. Her story is part of a disturbing rise in pregnant people suddenly being approached by border patrol officers or plain-clothed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents. As ICE raids have devastated more families in recent months, immigrant and reproductive rights advocates have raised concerns about the impact of the raids on the reproductive health of those arrested, detained, and forcibly separated from their families.

The harms inflicted on immigrants, especially the medical neglect and abuse of pregnant people, are not only an immigration justice crisis, they’re a reproductive justice crisis as well. Reproductive justice — a movement and framework created by Black women and other women of color — is defined as the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy, have children or not have children, and parent children in safe and sustainable communities. The simultaneous withdrawal of abortion access and this country’s long-standing history of injustice against Black and Brown people has created near-dystopian conditions for immigrant communities, where access to both reproductive care and freedom from deportation are increasingly under attack.

Witnessing the Crisis From the Front Lines

In the past six months, Fund Texas Choice, a statewide abortion practical support organization that fills in gaps to accessing essential health care, has seen up close how immigrant justice and reproductive justice go hand in hand. We have supported more than 600 clients — purchasing plane tickets, arranging rides, and making sure folks have enough money to buy food while they travel an average of 1,400 miles to their appointments. Year after year, Texans continue seeking our help in high numbers, and we’ve seen an increase in support requests. We often hear from our clients that they have to decide between buying a plane ticket to access reproductive health care or paying their rent.

Amid the immigration crackdown nationally and in Texas, our clients are facing more barriers than ever before. To leave the Rio Grande Valley and head north, travelers are required to cross a border checkpoint, sometimes more than one. This is also the largest border checkpoint region in the U.S.

Latine people in Texas are living under one of the most restrictive abortion regimes in the country. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, Latine people represent the largest group of people of color impacted by current abortion bans. Texas is home to more than 2.9 million Latine people of childbearing age, and of this number, 1.9 million are economically insecure. The average cost to travel out of state for abortion care can range anywhere from $500 to $1,000, which does not even include the cost of the procedure.

There are factors to consider that logistically put abortion care beyond reach for millions of people — things like child care, transportation, not having access to paid time off, and living in rural areas, to name a few.

For Latine communities, the compounded impact of anti-immigration laws, surveillance, and the threat of deportation, detention, or forced family separation often makes traveling for abortion care impossible.

Criminalization and Cultural Bias in the Shadow of the “Muslim Ban”

As workers for an abortion practical support fund, as well as members of these immigrant communities, we’ve witnessed the acceleration of abortion surveillance and criminalization up close. We’ve had family members, neighbors, and friends face insurmountable obstacles that stand in the way of their reproductive autonomy.

When seeking abortion care, Muslims not only face the abortion access crisis affecting all Texans but also often face increased risks of surveillance and religious-based discrimination. Since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, 17 states have total abortion bans or restricted access to the first six weeks of pregnancy, rendering abortion inaccessible for at least 824,000 Muslims across the U.S. Between racial profiling and anti-Muslim bias, many Muslims are afraid of interstate travel, especially those with complex immigration statuses. Muslim women face disparities in reproductive health care compared to other groups, especially visibly Muslim women who wear the hijab.

Latine Muslims, who represent 9 percent of the U.S. Muslim population, are on the front lines of navigating an increasingly hostile political landscape. Black Muslim immigrants in the U.S. face heightened state-sanctioned police violence and anti-Black racism, conditions that contribute to some of the worst childbirth outcomes in the country. Texas alone has one of the highest maternal mortality rates, and both Black and Latine mothers are disproportionately affected. Many overlapping obstacles underscore how immigration justice is inseparable from reproductive justice, including Muslim communities that tackle racial, religious, and immigration-based marginalization.

The post-Roe legal landscape has opened the door for law enforcement to exploit virtually any form of data — license plates, phone records, geolocation data — to pursue individuals across state lines. When seeking abortion care, immigrant communities are more likely to have a target on their back.

What Does This All Mean?

HB 7, which was signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott earlier this month, is the fourth anti-abortion measure to exist in Texas. This law seeks to cut off access to medication abortion from inside and outside of Texas, and create a chilling effect beyond Texas borders, which is why it’s more important than ever to tap into organizations who’ve been championing abortion rights in the state for over a decade. Supporting your local abortion fund is one of the most direct ways to ensure that the people most harmed by the anti-abortion and anti-immigrant landscape in the South still have options for care.

Bodily autonomy is threatened in clinics, at the borders, at the hands of oppressive laws, and at every checkpoint. As abortion practical support organizers, we understand the strain of layered oppressive systems that work to weaken options for immigrants and other marginalized people. The U.S. immigration system is replete with measures that violently strip immigrants of their reproductive freedom. These conversations must be had in tandem.

How do the new National Defense Areas relate to immigration violations that the government might bring against noncitizens?","In April, the Trump administration began declaring parts of the U.S.-Mexico border region as “National Defense Areas” (NDAs), as if they were restricted-access military bases.

These NDA declarations aim to give the Department of Defense (DOD) new enforcement powers along the border. For immigrant communities, the stakes are especially high: crossing into an NDA now means risking federal trespassing charges in addition to immigration charges. U.S. citizens, too, may face prosecution if they enter poorly marked areas while traveling, hiking, hunting, or working near the border.

The creation of NDAs is part of a broader pattern in President Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant strategy and his efforts to push toward an unprecedented deployment of military power throughout the country. Communities are effectively cut off from access to public lands, while states are forced to grapple with heightened enforcement and diminished transparency.

Below we break down what the new “National Defense Areas” are, how they impact our rights, and how they harm our communities.

Where are the new “National Defense Areas”?

Earlier this year, President Trump issued a memorandum transferring control of certain federal public lands along the southern border to the DOD. The secretary of defense can now designate these lands as NDAs, and has already done so in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.

When describing the new areas, federal officials have typically sought to minimize their size by focusing on the inclusion of a narrow, 60-foot border buffer zone, known as the “Roosevelt Reservation,” which runs parallel to some sections of the U.S.-Mexico land border. However, in some areas the NDAs extend much farther north, encompassing highways, desert lands, and areas used by local communities.

For example the New Mexico NDA alone encompasses over 400 square miles, according to an analysis by Source New Mexico. The Texas NDA stretches for 63 miles, from El Paso to Fort Hancock. Other NDAs include those in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley and in Yuma County, Arizona. Each of them are characterized as military “installations” extending from — and often very far beyond — a specific military base.

The NDAs do not include land managed or owned by federally recognized tribes. Nor do they include non-federal land, such as state parks. However, if a person visits a state park or lives on tribal or privately owned land, and they accidentally cross into an NDA, they risk being stopped, questioned, searched, and wrongly accused of intentionally entering into the restricted area.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and its Border Patrol agents already surveil the region and have long-standing powers to question and arrest people who enter into the United States unlawfully. Inside NDAs, the government also asserts authority for U.S. troops to question, search and temporarily detain alleged trespassers. This risks blurring the line between civilian law enforcement and military authority.

What are the legal risks of entering a National Defense Area without permission?

Under federal law, entering one of these areas without permission can result in criminal charges for trespassing on military property, including:

18 U.S.C. § 1382 – entering military property without authorization. Punishable by up to six months in prison and a $5,000 fine

50 U.S.C. § 797 – willfully violating a security regulation for military property. Punishable by up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.

In recent months, people apprehended inside NDAs have already been charged under these laws.

How do the new National Defense Areas relate to immigration violations that the government might bring against noncitizens?

This depends on your citizenship status.

If you are a U.S. citizen:

You cannot be charged with unlawful entry (or re-entry) to the United States under 8 U.S.C. 1325 or 1326, but you can still face federal trespass charges;

You risk facing trespass charges if you cross into an NDA, for example when pulling off a highway, or hiking or hunting in desert lands.

If you are not a U.S. citizen:

You face the same potential trespass charges, plus potential immigration charges, such as:

8 U.S.C. § 1325 – unlawful entry.

8 U.S.C. § 1326 – unlawful re-entry after deportation.

That means if a non-citizen is arrested within an NDA and is suspected of unauthorized entry into the U.S., they face the risk of three separate charges – unauthorized entry into a military property, willful violation of a security regulation, and unlawful entry or reentry.

If you are charged under 18 U.S.C. § 1382 or 50 U.S.C. § 797 for entering a National Defense Area, you have the right to a lawyer and the opportunity to challenge the charges in court. You are entitled to make the government prove its case against you. Anyone facing these charges should speak with an attorney as soon as possible for legal advice.

Are the NDAs clearly marked in order to prevent people from accidentally crossing into them?

No.

The government says it has posted warning signs, but the signs are small, only in English and Spanish, and few and far between. According to court filings, the signs are placed inside the NDAs, set back from the U.S.-Mexico border line, which means that people entering the NDA from Mexico have already crossed into the restricted area before having any opportunity to read the signs. The signs reportedly face south, which means that people entering the NDA from the north are unlikely to see any signs before crossing into the NDA.

A spokesperson for New Mexico Senator Martin Heinrich noted that the NDAs have “huge implications for anyone unwittingly driving along Highway 9 who might pull over to stretch their legs and unwittingly trespass on a military base.”

If you are near the southern border, exercise caution and try to avoid accidentally crossing into an NDA. Consulting visual maps may be helpful, but DOD has not published maps of each NDA and the available maps are insufficiently detailed to offer specific demarcations for people in the general vicinity.

Can I take photos or make a video of an NDA or an interaction with an official within an NDA?

Yes, but with caution.

Taking photographs and videos of places, people, and objects that are plainly visible in public spaces is a constitutional right—and that includes the exterior of federal buildings, and police, troops, and other government officials carrying out their duties.

However, under 18 USC § 795, Congress has made it a crime to photograph, sketch, map or draw “certain vital military or naval installations or equipment,” punishable by a fine or imprisonment of up to a year, or both. The DOD has posted signs near NDAs, citing this crime, implying that this law applies to these new areas.

The ACLU’s position is that when you are lawfully in a public space — including a public space adjacent to but outside the boundaries of a NDA or military installation — you have the right to photograph and take video of anything that is in plain view.",https://assets.aclu.org/live/uploads/2025/09/nda-southern-border-social.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 15:58:09.903841

Let there be no more Alcatrazes.","Forty-one years ago, I joined the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Department, located in the Tampa Bay area of Florida. As a first-generation college student from a working-class family, I needed money to pay for my undergraduate studies, so I worked in the jail, which today has over 1000 personnel and an average daily population of 3000 inmates in its minimum, medium, and maximum facilities.

For four difficult years I worked in maximum security. While I sometimes dodged—not always successfully—fists, cups of urine, and excrement, I heard some of the foulest insults and swear words also thrown in my direction. I encountered not only hostility but also hopelessness. Some inmates were friendly and kind to me, though. And I was educated through this experience as much as I was by my classes at college, although the latter provided a much-needed respite as well as a source of hope for my future.

On the basis of that real-life education, as well as my education in Catholic theology, I reject the current administration’s plans to incarcerate migrants and refugees in brutal facilities modelled after the notorious maximum-security prison Alcatraz.

Earlier this year, President Donald J. Trump announced on Truth Social, “I am directing the Bureau of Prisons, together with the Department of Justice, FBI, and Homeland Security, to reopen a substantially enlarged and rebuilt ALCATRAZ, to house America’s most ruthless and violent offenders.” The prison, closed in 1963 by then-U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, has been a popular museum administered by the National Park Service since 1972.

Although reopening the penitentiary seems unlikely, since it is small and doing so would be expensive, other “Alcatrazes” are popping up or planned. In addition to “Alligator Alcatraz,” which a federal appeals court has allowed to resume operations after a lower court ordered a halt to it, Florida governor Ron DeSantis has announced plans to open a similar center, called “Deportation Depot,” near Jacksonville, Florida. Plus, additional facilities to hold immigrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers, often wearing masks, are in the works in South Carolina and other states.

One of the things I learned first-hand when I worked in the jail was how entrenched racism is in the U.S. criminal justice system—in the disproportionate number of persons of color among the incarcerated, as well as in the racist attitudes and actions of some (not all) of my fellow officers. I remember feeling uncomfortable during roll call one night when an officer proudly showed us a thank-you note and flag he received from the government of South Africa for his support of its policy (at the time) of apartheid.

At the same time, though, one of my lieutenants gave me The Gulag Archipelago by Soviet and Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, because he knew I was studying political science, with particular attention to authoritarian regimes and totalitarianism. Occasionally an inmate would compare the jail to a gulag or concentration camp, and I would recoil at the very suggestion. The jail was not even close to resembling a Nazi concentration camp or a Soviet-era gulag, and I couldn’t imagine anything like the internment camps of Japanese Americans happening in the United States again.

Yet here we are. Alligator Alcatraz and these other detention and deportation facilities are neither a jail, where arrested persons who are innocent until proven guilty await trial, nor a prison, where convicted persons are sent after their trial. They are more like a concentration or internment camp where persons are detained due to their nationality or ethnicity—and, regardless of whether they have criminal convictions or, if they do (and not all do), whether these are serious (attempted murder) or minor (traffic violations). Alligator Alcatraz’s tents and cages, especially when exposed to severe weather, must be punishingly brutal for these detainees, unlike for inmates in a temperature-controlled jail or prison.

As for those who are working in these new facilities, I worry about their training and qualifications. The staff at Alligator Alcatraz includes about 70 Florida National Guard troops and private security guards rather than professionally trained correctional officers—although Dynamic Integrated Security Inc., a Coral Springs-based private security firm, advertised for both security and correctional officer positions.

Unlike soldiers and security guards, however, correctional officers in Florida receive 420 hours of academy training (up from the 320 I received in 1984). This includes not only defence techniques, physical fitness, and firearms training, but also training in first aid, communications, and responding to other emergencies such as fires and suicide attempts. I relied on such training, including responding to fires and suicide attempts, numerous times when I was a correctional officer.

Moreover, that training included a unit on professional ethics. Although my coworkers and I did not always live up to them, we were expected to adhere to a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct for correctional officers, including respect for an inmate’s right not to be discriminated against for their skin pigmentation, physical appearance, gender or sexual orientation, along with their rights to receive basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, decent living conditions, health care, and pastoral care.

From an ethical standpoint, and moreover from a Catholic moral perspective, the theological basis for Catholic teaching on both detention and deportation is our belief in the fundamental dignity of the human person, who is created in God’s image and likeness (Gen 1:26). This is foundational for Catholics on the sanctity of all human life.

Dignitas Infinita, issued last year by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, begins: “Every human person possesses an infinite dignity, inalienably grounded in his or her very being, which prevails in and beyond every circumstance, state, or situation the person may ever encounter.” Additionally, this “principle, which is fully recognizable even by reason alone, underlies the primacy of the human person and the protection of human rights.” Non-Catholics, too, should be able to recognize and respect human dignity and human rights. Here Dignitas Infinita mentions the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, issued by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948, following the atrocities of the Holocaust. Human rights, based on human dignity, neither start nor stop at national borders.

Accompanying the respect for the inherent dignity of the unborn and of terminally ill persons, Catholics are expected to recognize that of migrants and incarcerated persons. In Caritas in Veritate (Charity in Truth), Pope Benedict XVI wrote that “every migrant is a human person who, as such, possesses fundamental, inalienable rights that must be respected by everyone and in every circumstance.” This moral stance does not call for a policy of open borders, but it does circumscribe policies regarding vetting of migrants and their admission into a nation. It would also reject outright rejection or deportation of migrants.

Similarly, in Evangelium Vitae (On the Inviolability of Human Life), Pope John Paul II claimed, “Not even a murderer loses his personal dignity, and God himself pledges to guarantee this.” On top of this, Pope Francis held that life imprisonment was contrary to human dignity. Although the magisterial viewpoint of these two popes does not mean setting free all who are convicted of committing crimes, including violent ones, it does rule out cruel and dehumanizing punishment and treatment.

To be sure, magisterial teaching—from Gaudium et Spes (Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World) to John Paul II’s Veritatis Splendor (On the Church’s Moral Teaching) to Dignitas Infinita– consistently holds that “whatever insults human dignity, such as subhuman living conditions, arbitrary imprisonment, deportation,” along with “others of their like are infamies indeed.” The words “subhuman” and “arbitrary” are significant, and I would add “indiscriminate” before “deportation” because, after proper vetting and due process, some persons with a record of violence should perhaps be given due process and a fair trial, or maybe extradited to their country of origin for such procedural justice.

These authoritative documents claim these grave moral evils not only “poison human society, but they do more harm to those who practice them than those who suffer from the injury.” Although I am not sure whether the moral injury for the guards is more harm than the actual physical and mental harms for the detainees, I am concerned, not only as a theologian but also as a former corrections officer, about the harmful effects for them both. Let there be no more Alcatrazes.

Why It Matters

Democrats are hoping to retake control of the House and Senate in 2026, as the party in the White House historically loses seats during the midterms—and polls have Democrats leading the generic ballot.

But the Supreme Court is considering several cases that could change the legal playbook on a number of areas of election law for the midterms and beyond.

What To Know

There are three cases the Supreme Court is set to rule on, including Louisiana v. Callais, in which a group of white voters sued Louisiana over its current congressional map, which has two majority-Black districts. They argue the map constitutes a racial gerrymander that dilutes the power of white voters.

If a majority of justices on the nation's highest court agree with them, the state's map could return to a similar configuration it had before 2024, when the state had only one majority-Black district around New Orleans and Baton Rouge.

However, some voting rights activists are concerned that the court could issue a broader ruling that would overturn Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racial gerrymandering. If the court were to overturn that section more broadly, other Republican-led states could also redraw their congressional lines to erase majority-Black districts that reliably vote for Democrats.

Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia University, told Newsweek that if the decision in this case comes early—and the court overturns Section 2—that could give states enough time to redraw their maps. If they don't give a ruling by the spring, however, it would likely be too late to change redistricting plans for the midterms.

""The case could be narrowly focused on just districts in Louisiana or have broader significance in terms of the meaning and enforceability of the Voting Rights Act,"" he said. ""At the very least, there is a serious chance it would lead to undoing of the current plan in Louisiana. Beyond that, depending on what court says, it could lead to more challenges to current districting plans in other states.""

Former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek that the Supreme Court has been ""steadily chipping away"" at the Voting Rights Act, and that the outcome of the ruling could ""dramatically change the congressional map for the midterms.""

Typically, the Supreme Court has ruled that ""anything goes"" when it comes to gerrymandering, as long as race is not the predominant reason, Rahmani said, noting that the mid-decade redistricting that is taking place in states like Texas and California is not the norm.

""Typically, we'd see this type of gerrymandering after the Census,"" he said. ""Now it's just—the midterms—it's something that historically we haven't seen these types of issues unless it's post-Census. But now it's happening seemingly all the time.""

Another key case that could change the outcome of the midterms is National Republican Senatorial Committee v. Federal Election Commission. The case deals with campaign finance and whether limits on coordinated party expenditures violate the First Amendment.

The case was brought by Vice President JD Vance when he was a senator. They asked the court to revisit a previous ruling on the case as it has ""tightened the free speech restrictions on campaign finance regulation.""

Rahmani said the court could continue chipping away at its laws regarding campaign finance, and that this could have an effect on the midterm. The court has generally upheld that ""money is speech when it comes to elections.""

Briffault said he believes that while the court is likely to overturn those restrictions, its impact is unclear as parties have found ways to circumvent restrictions as part of the status quo.

The third case, Bost v. Illinois State Board of Elections, deals with a lawsuit filed by Representative Mike Bost, an Illinois Republican, over mail-in voting. His case was tossed by a lower-court judge, who ruled that he did not have standing as a candidate. But the court agreed to pick up the case and decide whether that is true.

The justices won't be ruling on his lawsuit itself—just whether or not candidates have standing to file lawsuits to these election laws. If the court sides with him, it will make it easier for candidates to file challenges, Briffault said.

""If the plaintiffs win, it means there may be more challenges to election laws because it will liberalize the rules of standing and make it easier for candidates and parties to bring challenges,"" he said.

What People Are Saying

Richard Briffault told Newsweek: ""Most academics are really focused on the Louisiana case. It has a wide range of possible outcomes in terms of its impact on the Voting Rights Act.""

Cecillia Wang, national legal director for the ACLU, in a statement in June: ""Before this case ever began, we had already won a hard-fought legal battle, proving that the legislature's initial map, like Louisiana's maps for generations before, illegally diluted Black voters' political power. Thanks to the Supreme Court's order from May 2024, which put the district court's injunction on hold, the fair and legal map the Louisiana Legislature enacted in response to our litigation remains in place while the case continues. We will be back next term to once again defend the new map and the representation Black voters deserve.""

The National Republican Senatorial Committee, in its petition to the U.S. Supreme Court: ""Before a political party speaks in support of its candidate, it would naturally seek to get the candidate's input. And for nearly the first 200 years of our Nation's history, a party was free to do so. Yet today, Congress has built a wall of separation between party and candidate, forcing party committees to figure out how to get their candidates elected without hearing from them. That is the campaign 'equivalent of prohibiting communication between a coach and quarterback late in a tied game.'""

What Happens Next

Political candidates are likely to spend the next 13 1/2 months campaigning and making their cases to voters about their positions on key issues in hopes of winning in the midterms.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2727578/supreme-court-could-have-major-impact.png,N,,2025-09-23 16:59:35.966059

The agency posted a request for proposals for ""as-is, fully finished and furnished office space"" across more than a dozen cities. The department was only accepting offers during ""a special open period"" from Sept. 11 to Sept. 17.

NPR and the Washington Post, which first reported the story Thursday, Sept. 18, cited unnamed sources and records which suggested the space was needed to house U.S. Immigration and Customs Administration (ICE) officials. GSA is asking for space for 70 desks, private offices, a conference room and a server room.

The listing does not include any language about using office spaces as detention facilities, but one Iowa City activist group is raising concerns that the space could be used as a holding facility for immigrants facing deportation. Escucha Mi Voz, an immigration rights group that has been vocal about the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts, are calling these spaces ""ICE black sites"" — a ""secret jail"" disguised as a ""processing facility.""

""Iowa needs housing, health care, and schools, not cages and deportations,"" organization member Maria Ayala said in a news release. ""We call on all Iowans to stand up and resist.”

Asked to respond to activists' concerns, a spokesperson with ICE maintained that ""administrative offices are different from detention facilities.""

“ICE continues to execute the President’s mandate to remove criminal illegal aliens from the U.S.,"" the spokesperson said in an email. ""While we cannot confirm individual pre-decisional conversations, we can confirm that ICE is exploring all options to meet its current and future operational requirements.”

Along with Des Moines, the GSA is looking at space in other Midwest cities — Milwaukee; St. Louis; Grand Rapids, Michigan; and Columbus, Ohio. It's also looking for office spaces in southern U.S. states.

Office spaces can range from 11,500 to 18,500 square feet. They should also offer ""adequate sound privacy for confidential discussions,"" the notice said.

Offices would typically be open from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.

In a statement, a GSA spokesperson said: “GSA is committed to working with all of our partner agencies to meet their workspace needs. GSA remains focused on supporting this administration’s goal of optimizing the federal footprint, and providing the best workplaces for our federal agencies to meet their mission.” The GSA did not respond to a question whether the listing was for ICE or National Guard members to carry out immigration enforcement. In August, Gov. Kim Reynolds deployed 20 Iowa National Guard soldiers to offer ""administrative and logistical support"" to ICE, beginning Sept. 8.

GSA's recent efforts come just months after the department, like many federal agencies, was reeling from a wave of firings and lost several employees. The firings, which began in February, were led by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and part of the Trump administration's plans to reduce its government workforce.

The ICE budget rose by $75 billion over four years after President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law on July 4. Those funds came from the $170 billion allocated to the Department of Homeland Security for immigration and border enforcement.

ICE is using some of that money to hire 10,000 recruits, increasing staff levels to about 30,000 as the administration seeks to fulfill a goal to deport 1 million immigrants every year.

The South Sudanese authorities’ statements underscore the lack of transparency and due process protections surrounding these transfers, Human Rights Watch said.
In Uganda, the Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed in a statement that a temporary bilateral cooperation agreement has been reached with the United States.
Ghanaian president John Mahama confirmed that his government has agreed to accept third-party nationals who were being removed from the United States.
“As the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights special rapporteur on refugees has said, these agreements cannot override governments’ human rights obligations,” Ngari said.","The United States’ recent expulsions of third-country nationals to Eswatini, Ghana, Rwanda, and South Sudan have exposed several hundred people to a risk of arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and refoulement, Human Rights Watch said today.

The opaque deals that facilitate these transfers, at least some of which include US financial assistance, are part of a US policy approach that violates international human rights law and is designed to instrumentalize human suffering as a deterrent to migration.

“These agreements make African governments partners in the Trump administration’s horrifying violations of immigrants’ human rights,” said Allan Ngari, Africa advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “The African governments implementing these deals risk violating international law, including the prohibitions against refoulement and arbitrary detention.”

In August 2025, a Rwandan government spokesperson, Yolande Makolo, reportedly said that the country had agreed to accept up to 250 deportees, a much larger number than has been reported for Eswatini or South Sudan, under an agreement, which Human Rights Watch has seen, that includes roughly $7.5 million in US financial support.

Rwanda’s past role in similar arrangements with Israel, its now-abandoned negotiations for a comparable deal with the United Kingdom, and its own well-documented record of repression raise serious doubts about whether it will provide effective protection for the affected people.

Human Rights Watch has viewed the written agreement between the United States and Eswatini, under which the US will provide $5.1 million to “build [Eswatini’s] border and migration management capacity” and Eswatini will accept up to 160 deportees from the US. So far, Eswatini has received at least five people from Cuba, Jamaica, Laos, Vietnam, and Yemen and is reportedly holding them in the Matsapha Correctional Complex under harsh conditions. An Eswatini official told Human Rights Watch that the country is preparing to receive another 150 people. Lawyers and civil society groups have challenged the legality of detaining these people.

South Sudan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation confirmed on September 4 that it was holding seven foreign nationals deported from the United States in July, while an eighth person, a South Sudanese national, was released to his family. A government spokesperson said that their status is still under consideration. On September 6, the authorities formally announced the repatriation of one Mexican national to Mexico but did not clarify where the remaining six men are being held and under what conditions, nor did it explain the legal basis for holding them.

The South Sudanese authorities’ statements underscore the lack of transparency and due process protections surrounding these transfers, Human Rights Watch said.

In Uganda, the Foreign Affairs Ministry confirmed in a statement that a temporary bilateral cooperation agreement has been reached with the United States. Under its terms, Uganda will receive third-country deportees from the United States, but “individual[s] with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted” and preference will be given to individuals of African origin.

Ghanaian president John Mahama confirmed that his government has agreed to accept third-party nationals who were being removed from the United States. This agreement is limited to West African nationals. So far, five citizens of Nigeria and The Gambia have been expelled to Ghana under the agreement. Prior to their expulsion, US immigration judges had granted all of them fear-based immigration relief, either withholding their removal under the US Immigration and Naturality Act or deferring their removal under the Convention against Torture.

One of the five, a bisexual man from The Gambia, said in a sworn declaration filed in US federal court that Ghanaian authorities had returned him to his country of origin after their expulsion by the United States. This case underscores the danger that expulsion agreements will lead to the return of people to countries where US courts had determined they face a serious risk of persecution or torture.

Given the abusive US immigration policies that underpin them, Human Rights Watch urges African governments to refuse to enter into agreements to accept third-country deportees from the United States and to terminate those that are already in effect. In the interim, countries that are party to such agreements should disclose their terms, allow access to independent monitors, refrain from detaining any deportees absent a clear legal basis, and ensure that no deportee is returned to their home country if there is credible evidence that they would face the risk of persecution, enforced disappearance, torture, or other serious harm.

“As the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights special rapporteur on refugees has said, these agreements cannot override governments’ human rights obligations,” Ngari said. “The African Union should reiterate that deportations that do not afford people an opportunity to seek protection from persecution or torture are unlawful, abusive and unacceptable.”

In essence, the scheme provides a mechanism to remove foreign nationals who have been convicted of offences in the UK and who have made a human rights claim against their removal in the UK, by deporting them to their home country before they have exhausted their appeal rights. It is stated that these individuals will be able attend any appeal hearings in the UK remotely via video link.

To what extent does this scheme really reflect and uphold the human rights of these individuals? In 2017, the Supreme Court effectively halted this policy (first introduced in 2014) after it was challenged on human rights grounds, citing that appeals from abroad did not comply with human rights standard.

Former Conservative Justice Secretary Alex Chalk KC expressed concern over this policy and urged Parliament to scrutinise it extremely carefully. His grounds for concern echoed respected legal experts in the field, namely:

The risk of return: the ‘Deport Now, Appeal Later’ scheme is potentially at odds with the assurances of the fundamental principle of non-refoulment, which imposes a duty on states not to return individuals to a country where they risk facing torture or degrading treatment. Furthermore, if the appeal is heard only after they have been returned, there is no guarantee that their Article 6 right to fair trial will be upheld in the respective countries.

The rights of British Children: this scheme can be criticised for its failure to consider the Article 8 right to private and family life and uphold the duty imposed on the Secretary of State under s55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009. In essence, there are concerns that the impact of this scheme does not pay adequate attention or respect to the child’s right to private and family life, nor to their wellbeing when their parents are deported.

The voice of the victim: the ‘Deport Now, Appeal Later’ scheme also raises concerns about what justice would look like. Would victims receive the finality of justice when foreign nationals are tried in their home countries, rather than in the UK?

It remains to be seen how this scheme can operate within the confines of the UK’s obligations under the ECHR and Human Rights Act, particularly in light of recent government statements confirming that the UK has no intention of leaving the ECHR.

While the theme for this year's UN General Assembly is ""Better Together,"" Trump's remarks on the first of several days of speeches from heads of state arguably undermined the theme, as he encouraged ""all countries to take their own stand in defence of their citizens as well.""

Trump defended the efforts of his administration to secure its southern border and warned of the ""death of Western Europe"" from migration. He also took aim at UN programs that support the world's refugees.

""The UN is supposed to stop invasions, not finance them,"" said Trump, using a term for mass movements of people that activists have criticized for being dehumanizing.

Elsewhere, Trump dismissed climate change as the "" greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.""

""In closing, I just want to repeat that immigration and the high cost of so-called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet,"" he said.

In between, Trump held court on a number of topics, many familiar to regular watchers of his Oval Office comments, and took issue with countries like Canada that have recognized a Palestinian state, saying the ""rewards would be too great for Hamas terrorists, for their atrocities.""

With global support for a Palestinian state growing, Israel's devastating war in Gaza is expected to take centre stage at the annual gathering of leaders.

The myriad conflicts and issues confronting the world, including climate change, will also be in the spotlight, as nearly a week of speeches is launched at the UN General Assembly.

""As we meet, civilians are targeted and international law trampled in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and beyond,"" Secretary General António Guterres said at a commemoration on the UN's 80th anniversary on Monday. ""Poverty and hunger are on the rise — the planet burns, with fires, floods and record heat raging through climate chaos.""

The UN is seeing its principles ""under assault as never before,"" said Guterres.

Brazil led off the speeches Tuesday in a decades-long tradition dating to when it was the only nation that volunteered to speak first.

In addition to Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Trump, the assembly on Tuesday will hear from Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Jordan's King Abdullah II, French President Emmanuel Macron, South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

Almost all UN member nations have signed up to take their turn during the assembly's six-day-long speechfest. Foreign Affairs Minister Anita Anand will deliver Canada's statement on Sept. 29.

Grave warning to drug smugglers

Trump returned to the assembly rostrum five years after he last addressed the gathering by video, due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. He delivered an in-person address in 2018.

He returned in a position of strength, upending U.S. foreign policy in just eight months into his second presidential term. Trump has slashed foreign aid, affecting several UN-led endeavours, and has moved to end American participation in the World Health Organization and UN Human Rights Council.

He's imposed tariffs on friend and foe alike and has approved military strikes, with murky legal authority, on alleged drug-smuggling boats in the Caribbean and on Iranian nuclear facilities.

""To every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America, please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,"" he said. Nearly three weeks after the first boat strike, Trump's Democratic rivals in Congress have pleaded with his administration for details on the military-led operations.

In his speech, Trump repeated the spurious claim that he's ""ended seven wars"" this year. While he didn't elaborate, Trump in recent weeks has taken credit for administration's efforts to end conflicts between Israel and Iran, India and Pakistan, Egypt and Sudan, Rwanda and the Democratic Congo, Armenia and Azerbaijan, Serbia and Kosovo, and Cambodia and Thailand.

But Trump has struggled to deliver on his 2024 campaign promises to quickly end the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with more than a month now passed after a summit in Alaska with Russian President Vladimir Putin.

While Trump admitted he hoped ending the Russia-Ukraine war ""would be easier,"" he had little in the way of criticism for Putin, focusing instead on purchases of Russian energy by India, China and several European nations.

""Europe has to step it up. They can't be doing what they're doing,"" he said. ""They're buying oil and gas from Russia while they're fighting Russia.""

The EU has stressed its members are phasing out imports or Russian oil and natural gas, pledging last week to accelerate that process a year earlier than planned.

Following his speech, Trump was set to hold a handful of one-on-one meetings, including with Guterres and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He will also hold a group meeting focused on the Middle East, with officials from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Turkey, Pakistan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.

Trump is scheduled to host Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House next Monday.

Two-state solution conference

On Monday, a conference co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, focused on garnering support for the long-standing idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The hours-long meeting ended with several countries, including France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta and Monaco, announcing or confirming their recognition of a Palestinian state — a day after the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and Portugal did. Around three-fourths of the UN's 193 member countries now do.

Prime Minister Mark Carney said Monday the move to recognize Palestinian statehood is consistent with Canada's longtime policy of supporting a two-state solution. He said Canada and other countries are actively trying to create conditions for a ceasefire and a peace process.

""It's necessary in our judgment, and the judgment of most other countries in the world, that we have to push on this now,"" Carney said.

There were, however, protesters from out of town, including a contingent sent by the Adams County Democrats.
Griffin made it clear that he was willing to help voters of all political stripes register.
“We have a booth as a part of Heritage Days, where we’re registering voters of any party.
Griffin summed up the effort, saying, “Because, you know, we want more voters, not less, right?”","McCOOK, Neb. - The message went out from an entity called “Indivisible,” which describes itself as a nonprofit organization that “drives coordinated campaigns” to “defeat the rightwing takeover of American government.”

The message read, in part, “Many Nebraskans feel that the unlawful round-ups and detentions of immigrants by ICE are inconsistent with Nebraskan values.” The invitation then specified, “Come protest the creation of this detention center in McCook on September 20th at 1:00 p.m.”

Rumor merchants took that and ran with it, predicting busloads of Soros-funded protesters, the prospect of civil unrest and even whispers of an active shooter. The rumors were prevalent enough that McCook law enforcement released an unofficial statement acknowledging the rumors, but no busloads of protesters arrived, and if there was civil unrest on Saturday, it was limited to long lines at the food trucks.

There were, however, protesters from out of town, including a contingent sent by the Adams County Democrats. A spokesman for the group, Ryan Griffin, said, “We are just a group of concerned citizens that are just, you know, using their right to peaceful protest.”

When asked what outcome the group was seeking, Griffin said, “We’re just here to say that we don’t support the actions of Governor Pillen and President Donald Trump opening up an unneeded ICE immigrant detention center.” Griffin elaborated, “We believe immigrants are welcome; we welcome them to this country.”

Griffin qualified his position, saying, “If there are any of them that do commit crimes, we do believe they should be prosecuted. None of us are arguing that criminals should be left free.”

Signs held by the protesters followed a few distinct themes: immigration, human rights and participation by the State of Nebraska. One sign said, ”Immigrants built this country,” while another claimed that “Immigrants have always made America great.” One sign, wielded by former McCook resident Larry Harvey, simply read, “Stop the cruelty,” which paired nicely with the sign saying “Stop family separation.” “No Nebraska ICE camps” and “ICE hurts NE.”

Beyond the 1 p.m. protest, participants from both in and out of Red Willow County operated a vendor table in Norris Park where they registered voters. Griffin made it clear that he was willing to help voters of all political stripes register. “We have a booth as a part of Heritage Days, where we’re registering voters of any party. Republicans that come up to us, they’re more than welcome to register to vote.”

When the Gazette reached out to local Republican Party officials for comment, Red Willow County Vice Chair Pam Frecks replied, “I am not speaking for our local group but as an individual. Generally speaking, Republicans do not have a ‘groupthink’ mentality. As a Republican, I believe that individuals have a right to their own opinion, and there are probably differences of opinion within the community concerning the location of the ICE facility.”

Ultimately, it is unlikely that a few signs will have any more influence on the state/federal partnership than our locally elected officials have, but it seemed like a way to energize the grassroots of a party out of power and as a recruiting tool for future elections.

Catch up quick: Elias Escobar, an undocumented immigrant who was obtaining papers through a family-based petition from his wife, was stopped by immigration agents on his way to a construction job Wednesday.

Agents smashed his car window and pulled him out, even after his wife, Leslie Perlera Gonzalez, showed up saying he had a pending immigration petition, GBH News reported.

A Department of Homeland Security official later told Axios he refused to roll down his window and that the ""officers took appropriate action and followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve the situation.""

State of play: Elias Escobar is detained in the Plymouth County Correctional Center with other immigrant detainees.

Greater Boston Legal Services, where Perlera Gonzalez works, filed a lawsuit alleging his rights were violated.

Yes, but: The Trump administration has fought habeas lawsuits over immigrant detainees tooth and nail since ramping up immigration enforcement this year.

Context: Immigrants have historically been allowed to adjust their status through a handful of avenues if they have a relative or spouse who is a U.S. citizen.

With the exception of the first Trump administration, it is uncommon for immigration officials to detain and seek to deport an immigrant mid-petition or with legal status if the person poses no public safety threat, said Maggie Morgan, managing attorney for the GBLS immigration unit.

Morgan says she has seen reports of immigration agents detaining people before confirming their identity or status.

""This is violating due process not just for those individuals, but for everyone in the community who could be at risk of having this happen to them,"" Morgan said.

Zoom out: The LUCE hotline has received more than 100 calls in the last week flagging immigration enforcement activity.

Somerville residents tried to stop immigration agents from questioning a man they stopped. He complied and, within minutes, was placed in handcuffs despite having no known record, Rep. Mike Connolly told the Cambridge Day.

What they're saying: ""I believe that if Hernan doesn't get to come home, it has little to do with the rights or whether he deserves to be an American and more to do with the U.S. deciding who it likes,"" Frank Pinto, Perlera Gonzalez's cousin, told the crowd Monday morning.

The other side: The DHS official said any claims of racial profiling are ""categorically false.""

In the meantime, Mario Guevara is still at risk of being sent to El Salvador.
“But I have to remain strong and confident that the United States still has some caring and decency left and that in the end justice will prevail,” he wrote.","The Board of Immigration Appeals has ordered Emmy-award winning journalist Mario Guevara to be deported to El Salvador, a country he fled more than two decades ago after being persecuted for his reporting.

On Friday, Chief Appellate Immigration Judge Garry D. Malphrus, Appellate Immigration Judge Marcos Gemoets, and Temporary Appellate Immigration Judge Paul A. McCloskey — all appointed by Trump’s Attorney General Pam Bondi — handed down the deportation order.

Guevara’s attorneys were granted an emergency hearing in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia. The court didn’t issue a decision but asked for further briefing. In the meantime, Mario Guevara is still at risk of being sent to El Salvador.

The journalist’s supporters, including Georgia lawmakers, say the Trump administration is targeting Guevara because of his reporting on immigration raids.

“This is yet another example of the Trump administration’s pervasive attempts to stifle journalists and media from doing honest reporting or speaking unfavorably about the administration,” State Sen. Josh McLaurin (D) said in a statement. “This is one of the most dangerous periods for free speech in American history.”

Cory Isaacson, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Georgia, said it will be “devastating” if Guevara is deported. Guevara is represented by the ACLU and the state affiliate, the ACLU of Georgia.

“The immediate release of Mr. Guevara is the only way to correct this injustice that has immeasurably harmed his wellbeing and the wellbeing of his family, the community and the people of Georgia,” Isaacson said in a statement. “In a democracy, journalists should not be arrested for exercising their constitutional rights to report the news.”

In June, officers arrested Guevara while he was reporting on a “No Kings” protest in DeKalb County, Georgia. About a minute before his arrest, an officer told the other officers to “Keep an eye on the guy in the red shirt. If he gets to the road, lock his a** up. . .. He’s been warned multiple times,” according to his habeas petition. Another officer asked, “Press?” The first officer replied, “Yep.” He was arrested when he stepped off the sidewalk to move out of the way of officers coming through the area.

Although all charges were dropped, he has remained in ICE custody. DHS previously told Truthout in an email that Guevara has been detained because he entered the country illegally in 2004. This is false.

The judge who granted Guevara bond in July wrote that he “has a history of following the laws of the United States, as he legally entered the U.S. with a B1 visa, he has employment authorization and a social security number so that he can legally work in the United States, and he has a history of paying his taxes.”

Prosecutors successfully obtained a stay, or pause, of the bond decision. The government has argued that Guevara “is a danger to the community because Mr. Guevara had ‘on five separate occasions … recorded or live streamed’ law enforcement officers and ‘post[ed] videos of undercover agents, their vehicles, and tag numbers,’” as per Guevara’s petition. “The Government further states that ‘[l]ocal law enforcement reviewed the respondent’s public posts and learned that the videos were viewed by hundreds of thousands of people.’”

Guevero told The Altanta-Journal Constitution in a phone interview that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is retaliating against him because, “I was following them. I was showing their faces when they were arresting immigrants.” He said while he’s been locked up, some officers have said to him, “You gave me a hard time, Mario. Hey, remember me?”

The Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ) and the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) have condemned the court’s deportation order. SPJ said in a statement that the decision is “a chilling signal to every reporter in this country: If your coverage makes the government uncomfortable, you could be silenced.”

“SPJ stands firmly with Mario Guevara and calls for his immediate release and the restoration of his ability to remain in the United States,” the group continued. “Deporting him under these circumstances would undermine the First Amendment, erode public trust and set a dangerous precedent for all who believe in a free press.”

Today marks Guevara’s 100th day in detention. For much of that time he has been held in solitary confinement. On Friday, The Bitter Southerner published an essay by Guevara detailing the devastating impact his incarceration has had on himself, his career, and his family. The news outlet he founded, MGNews, is on the verge of bankruptcy. He’s experienced panic attacks and sunk into a depression.

“But I have to remain strong and confident that the United States still has some caring and decency left and that in the end justice will prevail,” he wrote. “Hopefully, soon all my tears and my family’s tears will be wiped away, and we can have fun and smile, triumphant, as we did before, together and in absolute freedom.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/cropped-Mario-Guevara-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:57:12.278660

Trump has already reduced U.S. support for the U.N. since his latest inauguration. He withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization and ended participation in the U.N. Human Rights Council. Global leaders are also dealing with wars in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan and concerns about artificial intelligence.

What did Trump say at the U.N.?

What they're saying:

Trump warns Europe immigration is ‘destroying your heritage’

Trump called immigration and policies confronting climate change a ""double-tailed monster"" that’s ruining Europe. His rhetoric was especially harsh on what he called ""the unmitigated immigration disaster.""

Here’s what he said: ""If you don’t stop people that you’ve never seen before, that you have nothing in common with, your country is going to fail. I’m the president of the United States, but I worry about Europe. I love Europe, I love the people of Europe. And I hate to see it being devastated by energy and immigration, that double-tailed monster that destroys everything in its wake.""

Then he directly addressed European leaders: ""You’re doing it because you want to be nice. You want to be politically correct, and you’re destroying your heritage.""

The president scoffed at past predictions on climate change

Trump urged European countries to abandon green energy initiatives, scoffing that, in decades past, some experts predicted that by the year 2000 ""climate change will cause a global catastrophe.""

He said scientists predicted some nations might be ""wiped off the map"" by now, but insisted that’s ""not happening.""

Actually, climate change has indeed triggered rising sea levels and intensifying storms that have caused small island nations to shrink. Such phenomenon has also cost enormous sums of money for disaster response, cleanup and rebuilding in the U.S. and around the world.

Nonetheless, Trump insisted it was ""the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world in my opinion.""

He said ""all of these predictions were wrong"" and ""made by stupid people,"" adding, ""If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.""

Trump points to US boat bombing and warns drug traffickers of more

Trump is unapologetic about authorizing the bombing of two boats U.S. officials said were carrying drugs, despite bipartisan criticism that the U.S. military actions violated the law.

""Let’s put it this way: People don’t like to take big loads of drugs in boats anymore,"" he said, promising more attacks if he deems it necessary.

""Please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,"" he said after the two attacks that U.S. officials said killed 14 people.

Many Democrats and some Republicans have questioned Trump’s policy as a potential overreach of executive authority in part because the military was used for law enforcement purposes.

Trump lectures the world on immigration policy

""It’s time to end the failed experiment of open borders. You have to end it now. I can tell you, I’m really good at this stuff. Your countries are going to hell,"" Trump proclaimed.

It was a lot of bravado on the world stage at the United Nations General Assembly — even for a leader who’s built his political career on public boasts.

Trump has launched a crackdown along the U.S.-Mexico border and pushed hardline domestic immigration policies.

""Once we started detaining and deporting everyone who crossed the border — and removing illegal aliens from the United States — they simply stopped coming,"" he said.

The president called his efforts a ""humanitarian act,"" arguing that it saved people who might have otherwise died trying to cross the U.S. border illegally.

Trump threatens Russia sanctions but says Europe must join in

Trump threatened to hit Russia with ""a very strong round of powerful tariffs"" if Putin doesn’t come to the table to end its war in Ukraine.

He claimed that would ""stop the bloodshed .. very quickly"" but also suggested fighting will not end as long as China and European nations continue buying Russian energy.

""They’re funding the war against themselves. Who the hell ever heard of that one?"" Trump said.

Trump tells Hamas to release all hostages now

Trump demanded on Tuesday that Hamas immediately release all hostages living and dead that it’s holding in Gaza, saying the time for partial releases is over.

Speaking to world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly, Trump also criticized several European nations, including U.S. allies, for recognizing a Palestinian state, which he called a reward to Hamas for its Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in Israel that sparked the current conflict.

""As if to encourage continued conflict, some in this body seek to unilaterally recognize a Palestinian state,"" Trump said. ""This would be a reward for these horrible atrocities, including October 7th. But instead of giving in to Hamas as ransom demands, those who want peace should be united with one message: release the hostages now.""

""Just release the hostages now.""

Trump blasts UN as being filled with ‘empty words’ and not helping end wars

Standing in front of top U.N. officials, before more than 150 world leaders, Trump blasted the international organization. He said they didn’t reach out to him on the various wars he says he has brought to a conclusion.

""I’ve always said the U.N. has such tremendous, tremendous potential. But it’s not even coming close to living up to that potential,"" Trump said. ""For the most part, at least for now, all they seem to do is write a really strongly worded letter and then never follow that letter. It’s empty words and empty words don’t solve war.""

U.N. chief warns world leaders

The other side:

With global peace and progress under siege, the United Nations chief challenged world leaders Tuesday to choose a future where the rule of law triumphs over raw power and where nations come together rather than scramble for self-interests.

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the U.N.’s founders faced the same questions 80 years ago, but he told today’s world leaders at the opening of their annual gathering at the General Assembly that the choice of peace or war, law or lawlessness, cooperation or conflict, is ""more urgent, more intertwined, more unforgiving.""

""We have entered in an age of reckless disruption and relentless human suffering,"" he said in his annual ""state of the World"" speech. ""The pillars of peace and progress are buckling under the weight of impunity, inequality and indifference.""

But despite all the internal and external challenges facing the U.N., he and General Assembly President Annalena Baerbock pleaded with its members not to give up. ""If we stop doing the right things, evil will prevail,"" Baerbock said in her opening remarks.

Guterres said the leaders’ first obligation is to choose peace, and without naming any countries, he urged all parties -- including those in the Assembly chamber – to stop supporting Sudan’s warring parties.

What is the United Nations?

Why you should care:

The United Nations, which emerged from World War II’s rubble on the premise that nations would work together to tackle political, social and financial issues, is in crisis itself. As Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said last week: ""International cooperation is straining under pressures unseen in our lifetimes.""

Yet the annual high-level gathering at the U.N. General Assembly will bring presidents, prime ministers and monarchs from about 150 of the 193 U.N. member nations to U.N. headquarters. The secretary-general says it is an opportunity that can’t be missed — even in the most challenging of moments.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.livenowfox.com/www.livenowfox.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/gettyimages-2236930053a.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-23 12:57:16.933999

Since President Trump took office, 15 people have died in immigration detention, 10 of those deaths occurred between January and June, Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote in a letter shared exclusively with NPR. The senators say that is the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.

""Whatever our views on border enforcement, immigration enforcement, immigration policy, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people does not want detainees abused while they're in U.S. custody,"" Ossoff told NPR in an interview.

The Homeland Security Department is rushing to expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests after Congress provided billions of dollars in additional funding. Across the country, reports of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and healthcare access have been the product of a focus to make more arrests. NPR has reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.

The letter follows a report Ossoff released in July that alleges human rights violations occurred at immigration detention centers, including mistreatment of children, citizens and pregnant women. DHS broadly refuted the claims.

Earlier this year, ICE officials announced the agency was out of detention space. By the summer, over 50,000 people were in detention but ICE only had 46,000 beds.

Since then, ICE has announced expanded detention space through the use of military bases and state partnerships in Indiana, Nebraska, and Louisiana.

But the rapid expansion and use of other facilities has drawn criticism from immigration advocates and Democrats.

Concern over conditions in detention also comes after DHS cut jobs in the oversight divisions focused on civil rights. This included widespread cuts within the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which conducts oversight of ICE and Customs and Border Protection detention.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was asked about deaths in custody and delays in reports during a Congressional oversight hearing in May.

""We do conduct a thorough investigation of all of those,"" Lyons said, adding that he would ensure that information on deaths in custody were publicly available online in accordance with Congressional mandates. ""ICE is dedicated to transparency.""

In the letter, Ossoff and Warnock reiterate the concern of delayed reporting of death.

""ICE is failing to meet its own standards for reporting detainee deaths, thereby hindering Congressional oversight efforts and leaving families in the dark as to their loved ones' fates,"" they wrote, adding that ICE guidancerequires the agency to post an interim notice of any detainee death to ICE's website ""within 48 hours,"" and directs that ""every effort should be made to post the interim notice"" sooner.

Most recently, ICE issued press releases confirming the death of a Mexican national on Aug. 31. The public statement was released two days after his death.Another detainee died on Sept. 8, and the release was issued seven days later. Neither is yet on an official ICE detainee death tracker. Another man, who was detained by ICE, died on Thursday in Nassau County, according to local reports.

The administration counters that immigration judges have not managed their mounting caseloads effectively, and that it has taken steps to streamline the process involved in adjudicating cases.
Immigration judges, who are more like civil servants, can approve or deny a final order of deportation.
""The dismissal of more immigration judges is an illogical and costly setback for the nation's immigration courts,"" said IFPTE President Matt Biggs in a statement to NPR.
Earlier this month, about 600 military lawyers were authorized to work for the Justice Department as temporary immigration judges.","Nearly 20 immigration judges received emails this month informing them that they are being let go, NPR has learned, adding to the over 80 judges that have already been cut by President Trump so far this year.

At least 14 immigration judges learned last Friday that they would be put on leave and that their employment would terminate as soon as Wednesday in some cases, according to two people familiar with the firings and a confirmation from the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), a union that represents immigration judges. The two people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals. Courts in Florida, New York, Maryland, California and Washington state are among those affected.

The move follows the firing of five other immigration judges earlier this month. The firings in September constitute the largest terminations in any month since two dozen immigration judges were fired in February right before their first day on the job.

The firings are seemingly at odds with the Trump administration's goals of immigration enforcement, advocates say. The administration counters that immigration judges have not managed their mounting caseloads effectively, and that it has taken steps to streamline the process involved in adjudicating cases. The dispute provides a window into just how complicated the Trump administration's efforts to lower illegal immigration and deport millions of undocumented people are.

Union leaders had been bracing for large cuts this month since it marked the end of the two-year probationary period for many immigration judges. The increased firings come as the Trump administration is trying to increase the number of deportations. Immigration judges, who are more like civil servants, can approve or deny a final order of deportation. Still, immigration advocates argue the high priority on immigration law enforcement is reducing the limited due process that immigrants receive because the dismissed judges are either replaced with adjudicators with no experience or are not replaced at all.

""The dismissal of more immigration judges is an illogical and costly setback for the nation's immigration courts,"" said IFPTE President Matt Biggs in a statement to NPR. ""At a time when the backlog has reached historic levels and the administration has made immigration enforcement a central issue, the removal of experienced judges is hypocritical, undermines the law, wastes taxpayer dollars, and further delays justice for citizens and immigrants alike.""

Not all judges to be dismissed this year have been at the end of their probationary period with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is a part of the U.S. Justice Department. Still, the firings have resulted in a culture of fear among EOIR employees. Dozens took the ""Fork in the Road,"" a voluntary resignation program introduced after President Trump took office aimed at reducing the size of the federal workforce. EOIR declined to comment.

In the past nine months, EOIR has lost more than 125 judges to firings and voluntary resignations, down from about 700 judges at the start of the year. The loss of judges has resulted in immigration cases being delayed as far out as 2029, NPR previously reported, as vacancies increase despite open job postings to fill roles in those courts.

Terminations continue amid growing backlogs

The latest sets of terminations landed after Congress approved a mega-spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including hiring more immigration judges. The funding and additional personnel are aimed at alleviating the growing case backlog, which stands at nearly 4 million. Hiring and training new judges can take more than a year.

In recent months, EOIR leadership has criticized judges for not efficiently managing their caseloads, and has encouraged adjudicators to streamline asylum reviews and give oral, as opposed to written, decisions on case dismissals.

Earlier this month, about 600 military lawyers were authorized to work for the Justice Department as temporary immigration judges. And the DOJ made changes to who could qualify as a temporary immigration judge — effectively lowering the requirements and removing the need to have prior immigration experience.

Former California state lawmaker and acting Los Angeles U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said Monday morning on “Fox & Friends” that the California law would not be enforceable when it comes to federal immigration agents.

Former California state lawmaker and acting Los Angeles U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said Monday morning on “Fox & Friends” that the California law would not be enforceable when it comes to federal immigration agents.

“We’re very confident the state of California does not and cannot have jurisdiction,” he said. “If you had every state trying to regulate the federal government, you would have complete chaos.”

On Saturday, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Senate Bill 627, called the “No Secret Police Act,” into law along with a host of other restrictions on immigration enforcement. It is slated to go into effect in January.

The governor said he believes the law is enforceable, comparing it to traffic laws that federal agents must comply with in various states.

“The supremacy clause basically asserts that we cannot interfere in federal operations. Well, federal operations have been conducted for decades and decades without masks. It’s never been necessary,” he said.

In response to the signing, Essayli posted on X that he had directed federal agents that the law would not affect them.

“If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress,” he said on X. Essayli has not filed a legal challenge to the new policy, though he mused on the cable news channel Monday that Newsom might file a legal challenge and get a judge to issue an injunction.

“You know what this is about,” he told host Lawrence B. Johnson. “This is to inflame the public.”

The mask question has been a central debate since immigration officials began ramping up enforcement in the state. The Department of Homeland Security contends the officers should be allowed to mask to protect themselves from online doxing and targeting by gangs.

In a news release issued Monday afternoon, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agency wouldn’t be following the new law, and asserted “ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults.”

Newsom on Saturday asked for proof of that claim, and encouraged federal officials to pursue criminal charges for people who dox their officers online.

“Do judges then start getting masks? Do elected officials start masking themselves? Does anyone that’s on the receiving end of modern-day bullying, um, as it relates to online activity? That’s why we have laws. Enforce the laws,” he said.

By waiting outside the courthouse, immigration agents appear to be complying with California law, though it’s unclear whether the word “courthouse” in the law includes the grounds outside the courthouse.
Gavin Newsom signed Saturday meant to keep immigration enforcement agents out of schools and hospitals, it’s unclear what California law enforcement can actually do to enforce the law forbidding immigration agents from making arrests inside courthouses.
The state Justice Department’s guidance to state courthouses provides some latitude to immigration enforcement agents.","Jennifer isn’t saying her brother is a saint. Far from it. He was convicted of domestic violence last year and entered a one-year intervention program. He graduated July 23 in a Fresno county courtroom where a judge told him he had done a good job.

Minutes later, while leaving the courthouse, five men and one woman in plain clothes approached him.

“Someone came up to him, got in his face and said his name,” said Jennifer, who did not want CalMatters to use her last name because she was concerned about immigration enforcement agents targeting other relatives. “And they grabbed him, and I tried to get between them.”

Her brother, who is undocumented, didn’t provide them with an identification.

“They shoved him in this car, which was a plain, beat-up van,” Jennifer said. “Then one of them asked if they should wait for ‘the other guy,’ and a different person said ‘we’re good with this one,’ like he was just part of their quota that day.”

Her brother is already back in Mexico.

Social media is awash with videos of federal agents making arrests at immigration court hearings, which are on federal property, inside federal courthouses.

What’s different about the detention of Jennifer’s brother is that it took place on the grounds of a state courthouse. Local media have reported the detention of at least two dozen other people on the grounds of California court buildings in Stanislaus, Glenn, Los Angeles and Fresno counties, and NPR reports federal immigration detentions in state courthouses across the country, from the Chicago suburbs to a county south of Boston.

During the last Trump administration, California Democrats were so concerned about ICE making arrests at superior court buildings and potentially discouraging witnesses from testifying that they passed a law to forbid that kind of enforcement.

Picking people up at a courthouse can have a “potential chilling effect” on witnesses, victims and even suspects who are afraid to show up for court, California Supreme Court Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero said earlier this summer.

“Making courthouses a focus of immigration enforcement hinders, rather than helps, the administration of justice by deterring witnesses and victims from coming forward and discouraging individuals from asserting their rights,” Guerrero said.

By waiting outside the courthouse, immigration agents appear to be complying with California law, though it’s unclear whether the word “courthouse” in the law includes the grounds outside the courthouse. Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office wouldn’t provide what it a spokesperson called “legal analysis” of those actions when CalMatters asked about them.

But at least one immigration enforcement action was a clear violation of state law.

In Butte County, immigration enforcement agents conducted an operation inside the county’s Oroville courthouse on July 28. State law forbids civil arrests “in a courthouse while attending a court proceeding or having legal business in the courthouse.”

“As far as the court is aware, ICE had not conducted enforcement actions inside one of its courthouses prior to Monday, July 28th,” Butte County Superior Court executive officer Sharif Elmallah said in a statement.

“The court is concerned by the potential chilling effect and other potential adverse impacts on participation in the legal system that may occur due to these enforcement actions being conducted in and around courthouses.”

As with the package of bills Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Saturday meant to keep immigration enforcement agents out of schools and hospitals, it’s unclear what California law enforcement can actually do to enforce the law forbidding immigration agents from making arrests inside courthouses.

The state Justice Department’s guidance to state courthouses provides some latitude to immigration enforcement agents. They may make arrests inside a courthouse if the case involves a national security threat, someone’s life is in danger, evidence is in danger or agents are in “hot pursuit.”

Failing all of that, under California law, immigration agents can enter a courthouse to detain someone whom they believe poses a danger to public safety if they can’t find an alternate location and they have the approval of a federal immigration enforcement supervisor.

ICE defends courthouse arrests

Jennifer believes immigration agents ran her brother’s name through their own database when it was posted on the Fresno County Superior Court’s public online court docket, then waited for him to appear.

In response to questions from CalMatters, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement responded with a July quote from a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson which asserted the agency’s right to make arrests of “a lawbreaker where you find them.” The spokesperson also said the arrests are safer for immigration agents, since the people they’re arresting have been through security.

Policies on courthouse arrests have seesawed through Democratic and Republican administrations.

The Obama administration in 2011 designated schools, hospitals and religious buildings as “sensitive locations” where immigration agents need permission to operate. ICE at the time said the list of sensitive locations was longer than those three types of places and urged agents to get permission from higher-ups before making arrests at any organization assisting “victims of crime.”

Trump undid that policy in 2018 with a directive instructing ICE agents to make arrests at state and local courthouses. They proceeded to do so, even in California. In 2021, the Biden administration reversed that guidance, putting courthouses mostly off-limits.In May, Wired reported that the new Trump administration went even further than its 2018 directive, explicitly removing instructions to agents that they should respect local laws that would prevent them from arresting people.

Are immigrants avoiding court?

Jennifer said word has already gotten out among the immigrant community in Fresno to stop attending court. Family members even tried to discourage her brother from appearing on the day he was detained.

“In general, people are just avoiding going to the courthouse, even after meeting with groups who inform them that there’s consequences to not showing up,” said Nora Zaragoza-Yáñez, a program manager for the Valley Watch Network, an immigrant rights group.

A Fresno County Superior Court spokesperson said the court hasn’t seen a change in the number of people appearing, but noted that in a county of 1 million people, such shifts among a relatively small population would be hard to notice.

The state Department of Justice said it’s aware of the courthouse arrests. As a former member of the Assembly, Bonta, now the state attorney general, was a co-author of the law that was meant to deter immigration enforcement at California courthouses.

“We are very concerned with the Trump administration’s actions, which make our communities less safe by deterring victims or witnesses of crimes from coming forward out of fear of getting caught up in the President’s mass deportation dragnet,” the California Department of Justice said in an unsigned statement to CalMatters.",https://calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091825_Fresno-Courthouse_LV_10.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 11:59:26.388777

PHOENIX (AP) — Southern Arizona voters will select a successor Tuesday to the late U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, a progressive stalwart who represented the state for more than two decades in Congress.

Grijalva died in March, resulting in the 7th Congressional District seat being one of three safely Democratic districts to become vacant due to lawmakers’ deaths. One has since been filled.

Another in Texas has yet to be filled, and a vacancy in a heavily Republican Tennessee district will be filled following an election in December.

Grijalva’s daughter, Adelita Grijalva, is facing off against Republican business owner Daniel Butierez, to fill the final 15 months of the late congressman’s term. Two third-party candidates also are on the ballot.

Grijalva has served on local boards, while Butierez made his political debut with an unsuccessful bid against Raúl Grijalva for the seat in 2024.

Butierez garnered more than one-third of the vote that year in the predominantly Hispanic district and expressed optimism after winning the GOP primary over the summer that he could attract more Democratic support this time.

Democrats enjoy a nearly 2-1 registration advantage over Republicans in the district, which covers parts of Tucson and a majority of the state’s border with Mexico. Most of the 7th District has been represented by Democrats since Arizona first became a state in 1912.

Grijalva has been a household name in Tucson for years. While there are benefits to name recognition, Adelita Grijalva has emphasized that she stands on her own record. The Democrat has the endorsements of fellow progressives U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Grijalva sailed to victory in the Democratic primary with more than 60% of the vote, defeating a slate that included a former state lawmaker and a Gen Z digital strategist. Similarly, Butierez won the GOP primary by large margins.

Immigration and border security have been part of the debate, as the Trump administration moves ahead with deporting people who are in the country illegally and reviewing the status of millions of others who hold U.S. visas for any violations.

Grijalva has said she would advocate for legislation that creates pathways to citizenship for recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and other migrants. She also supports prohibiting immigration enforcement operations at schools, churches and medical facilities.

Please note that the views of outside contributors do not reflect the official opinions of SCOTUSblog or its staff.

The Supreme Court on Sept. 8 lifted a lower court judge’s order prohibiting immigration agents from considering physical appearance and language use, among other factors, when deciding to stop and question people about possible immigration law violations. Though the court did not explain its reasoning, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s separate concurrence suggests that at least one member of the apparent six-justice majority believes the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution permits race-based immigration policing.

The court’s order in Noem v. Vasquez Perdomo stays a temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong in July barring federal officials from stopping, even briefly, people based on their “apparent race or ethnicity”; “[s]peaking Spanish or English with an accent”; “presence at a particular location”; and “the type of work one does.” Frimpong’s order applied to the Central District of California only, which includes Los Angeles and six surrounding counties. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit had rejected the Justice Department’s request to stay Frimpong’s order, prompting an appeal to the Supreme Court. The justices’ decision was unsigned and, at a mere four sentences, did not provide any explanation of the justices’ reasoning, common in cases that the court decides on its emergency docket.

Though Vasquez Perdomo highlights recent immigration operations in California, the litigation’s legal dispute centers on a constitutional clause typically associated with criminal law enforcement activities: the Fourth Amendment. Aside from permitting arrests based on probable cause to believe that the arrestee has committed a crime, the Fourth Amendment also allows government officials to briefly stop and question someone without first obtaining a warrant based on “reasonable suspicion” that the person is engaging in illegal activity. In making that stop, the official “must be able to point to specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant that intrusion.”

The Vasquez Perdomo lawsuit tests the Fourth Amendment’s limits regarding what constitutes “reasonable suspicion.” In its application for a stay from the Supreme Court, the government relied on United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, a 1975 decision in which the court concluded that Border Patrol agents can consider “Mexican appearance” to gauge potential violations of immigration law near the country’s southwestern border. To identify who looks Mexican, agents can consider “mode of dress and haircut,” Justice Lewis Powell wrote on behalf of his colleagues. Powell acknowledged that there are many U.S. citizens with “the physical characteristics identified with Mexican ancestry,” but “[t]he likelihood that any given person of Mexican ancestry is an alien is high enough to make Mexican appearance a relevant factor.” The justices were especially swayed by the government’s claim that there were between 1 and 12 million unauthorized migrants living in the United States in the early 1970s – 85% of whom, immigration officials said, were Mexican citizens. Whether a person appears to be Mexican is just one of many factors that officers can consider “in deciding whether there is reasonable suspicion to stop a car in the border area,” the court announced.

Kavanaugh’s concurrence in Vasquez Perdomo relies heavily on Brignoni-Ponce’s acceptance of race-based immigration policing. Across his 10-page opinion, Kavanaugh cites Brignoni-Ponce nine times. Five of those references come in two paragraphs explaining that the Fourth Amendment favors the government’s position. The Fourth Amendment gives law enforcement officers the flexibility to consider “any number of factors,” Kavanaugh explained, quoting Brignoni-Ponce. For that reason, immigration agents in Los Angeles and surrounding counties could constitutionally consider the “high number and percentage” of migrants living in the region in violation of immigration law; that they “tend to gather in certain locations” to look for work; that they “often work in certain kinds of jobs, such as day labor, landscaping, agriculture, and construction” because these “do not require paperwork”; that many “do not speak much English”; and their “apparent ethnicity.” To Kavanaugh, it is constitutionally permissible and “common sense” that these factors “constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.”

Despite going to the effort of providing his reasoning, Kavanaugh does not explain how immigration agents determine which people “do not speak much English” or how they identify ethnicity. He notes, correctly, that “many” people living in the Los Angeles area without the federal government’s permission “come from Mexico or Central America.” But it is one thing for a person to have been born in a particular eight-country region (which includes Belize, where English is the official language and about three-quarters of the population speak it) and another thing for immigration agents to know, first, where a specific individual hails from and, second, how much English they speak.

Neither country of origin nor English-language ability are readily apparent through observation, and neither is a good indicator of a person’s legal right to live in the United States. In Los Angeles County alone, more than half of residents who were born outside the United States are naturalized U.S. citizens. Meanwhile, in a county where 55% of the population ages five and older speaks a language other than English at home but 58% of that group also speak English at least “very well,” according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, there is every reason to think that most of the people in L.A. who speak a language that isn’t English also speak a lot of English. For that reason, in a region where multilingualism is common, the language that agents hear a person talking – assuming they even do hear a person talking before stopping them – is not a good indicator of what languages the person can speak.

Kavanaugh also fails to explain how immigration agents should determine a person’s ethnic appearance. Though he cites Brignoni-Ponce for support, he neither explicitly embraces nor rejects Powell’s explanation that “mode of dress and haircut” can help agents choose who to target. Whatever Kavanaugh thinks of the constitutional relevance of fashion choices, he unmistakably invites immigration agents to bring policing based on ethnicity into the 21st century. As they do, they are likely to find that many of the people they target are in fact U.S. citizens: Almost half the residents of Los Angeles County – 48% – identify as Hispanic or Latino, and almost three-quarters of those who are of working age are U.S. citizens. Indeed, two of the California residents suing DHS are U.S. citizens whom immigration agents stopped and questioned.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor – joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson – harshly criticized her colleagues on the court’s right flank. The court’s order permits government officials to target people who “look a certain way, speak a certain way, and appear to work a certain type of legitimate job that pays very little,” Sotomayor wrote.

Unlike the other justices in the majority, Kavanaugh went well beyond what was necessary to side with the government on the court’s emergency docket. By issuing a 10-page concurrence, he didn’t just explain his reasons for siding with the Trump administration’s contentious approach to immigration law enforcement in the L.A. area. Kavanaugh also made clear that, in his view, immigration agents can use multiple proxies for race without fear of judicial interference.",https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/supremecourt4-scaled-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 10:57:45.809658

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained a New Haven man driving on Dixwell Avenue, three blocks away from Yale’s Payne Whitney Gymnasium, Sunday morning.

Five unmarked cars surrounded the man as he was driving to visit a potential contracting site for his job as a tile installer, according to two of the man’s family members. He was a few blocks away from his home when agents apprehended him on Dixwell Avenue near its intersection with Webster Street, a video posted to social media indicates.

The agents brought him to ICE’s Hartford base before he was transferred to the Plymouth County Correctional Facility in Massachusetts, according to ICE’s online detainee locator system. In July, ICE detained Esdrás Zabaleta-Ramirez — an 18-year-old student at Wilbur Cross High School — at the same location.

The man’s wife, Claudia, who asked for her last name to be omitted because of her immigration status, said agents were waiting for her husband as he left his home and followed him on his way to work. Claudia said the person who posted the video on social media witnessed the entire encounter.

When it appeared the man would not open the door to his car, an agent broke his car window, according to Claudia. Another video from the scene shows the car’s passenger-side window almost entirely shattered.

Claudia said her husband told her ICE agents forced him out of the car and handcuffed him.

“He doesn’t understand why they were investigating him, because in that same encounter, they told him that he didn’t have a record,” Claudia said in Spanish.

The man’s cousin, who also requested anonymity due to her immigration status, wrote to the News that the man came to the U.S. to secure financial stability for his family in Guatemala. He first attempted to enter the United States in 2011 but was caught and deported. He returned in 2015 and has lived in New Haven since, the cousin wrote.

Currently, the man’s family live in New Haven’s Dixwell neighborhood. He has no criminal record, Claudia and his cousin said.

ICE’s Hartford and Boston offices, as well as the agency’s media inquiry email, did not respond to the News’ requests for comment on Monday about why the man was detained.

Claudia told the News that her husband is the household’s breadwinner and that she was not sure how their family would be able to afford rent without his income. The couple has two daughters, ages 1 and 3, and receives financial support from extended family, she said.

Unidad Latina en Acción, a local organization that advocates for immigrants’ rights, is working to raise money for the family and to help them secure a lawyer, the group’s community organizing director, John Jairo Lugo, told the News.

Lugo noted how close the arrest was to Yale’s campus and said ULA is working to recruit Yale students to support their rapid response line for future cases.

The two federal agents involved in Villegas González’s arrest weren’t wearing body cameras during the deadly shooting.","As two federal agents tried to revive a Mexican immigrant who was dying from gunshot wounds, one of them sought to explain the shooting.

“He tried to run us over,” the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer said in body camera footage captured by a Franklin Park cop arriving at the northwest suburban shooting scene Sept. 12.

Video obtained by the Chicago Sun-Times shows the blue jeans of the other federal agent were left bloodied and torn, and he told local police that he was “dragged a little bit.”

A short time later, Silverio Villegas González’s body was moved from the street and into an ambulance by a group of firefighters and paramedics. He was later pronounced dead at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, records show.

Speaking over a radio, the federal agent who told police that Villegas González tried to use his car as a weapon said his partner had suffered “a left knee injury and some lacerations to his hands.”

“Nothing major,” the injured agent said.

“Nothing major,” his partner echoed.

Shortly after the shooting, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported the agent “sustained multiple injuries” and was “seriously injured” when he was “dragged a significant distance” by Villegas González’s car as he fled a traffic stop. DHS officials said the agent had opened fire, fearing for his life.

The injured agent was eventually taken to a second ambulance, and his partner said he was going to follow behind, video shows. DHS said his condition was soon stabilized.

“I think we’re good, man,” the second agent said as he began to drive off. “Just shooken up a little.”

As streets were blocked off and nearby schools were placed on lockdown after the shooting, news crews and protesters gathered behind police tape nearby.

Demonstrators banged drums and chanted, while a member of the media asked Franklin Park Police Director Michael Witz if police would be fielding questions.

At one point, Witz explained to his officers that local cops wouldn’t be investigating the shooting. “It’s a federal shooting, you’re not going to investigate a federal officer,” Witz says.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said protocol calls for the “appropriate investigative agency” to initially review ICE shootings. But she didn’t answer questions about the body camera videos or say which agency is investigating the Franklin Park shooting, apparently the first by an on-duty ICE official since President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.

After another agency’s probe, ICE will follow up and review “every use of force incident and any discharge of an ICE firearm,” she said.

Dawn Catanzaro, a Franklin Park spokesperson, previously said “the FBI Chicago field office is in charge of the investigation,” referring questions to that agency. An FBI spokesperson previously said the agency responded to the shooting and assisted law enforcement on the scene, but wouldn’t comment on involvement in an ongoing investigation.

The body camera videos, obtained from Franklin Park police through a public records request, offer the most revelatory look yet at the aftermath of the shooting, which has drawn national attention and continued scrutiny.

The videos raise new questions about the narrative put forth by DHS, which is leading an ongoing deportation campaign in the Chicago area that has stoked fears and sparked protests.

The driver of the truck that was struck by Villegas González’s car told police that Villegas González reversed when the federal agents cut him off and tried to take him into custody, video shows. The truck driver said he assumed that Villegas González was shot before the collision, and he recalled hearing at least one gunshot.

“I don’t know if they shot him before and that’s why he crashed into me,” the driver told Franklin Park officers. “Because there should have been no reason for him to crash into me, he could’ve just gone to the left.”

Doubts have been cast on ICE’s narrative of the traffic stop that started the encounter. A witness said he was driving past as Villegas González’s sedan swerved into the semitractor-trailer and two agents approached the crash, but the witness said he didn’t see Villegas González dragging one of the agents behind his car.

Meanwhile, the feds have largely been silent on the incident since it happened, drawing criticism from Gov. JB Pritzker for a lack of transparency.

The two federal agents involved in Villegas González’s arrest weren’t wearing body cameras during the deadly shooting. A program requiring them was scrapped by the Trump administration, the Chicago Sun-Times has reported.

Mourners at a vigil for Villegas González said days after his death that the 38-year-old father and cook from Michoacán, Mexico, was a “devoted father” of two and “kind soul.” He was his two children’s caretaker and had dropped off one of his kids at school minutes before he was shot, according to U.S. Rep. Delia Ramirez, D-Ill.

Pritzker has called for a “full, factual accounting of what’s happened.” Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the killing. And Reyna Torres Mendivil, the consul general of Mexico in Chicago, said the Mexican government has requested a ”thorough investigation.”

“For everybody to be clear and to have peace of mind, I think it’s important to do that,” Torres Mendivil said.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ba0da90/2147483647/strip/true/crop/733x418+0+35/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F72%2F51%2F99c566bf45c6879e8097f8b8b52e%2F0922-fp-bodycam-still.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:57:31.169922

The 11 deportees sued the Ghanaian government last week, seeking their release. Eight of them had told the local court that they had legal protections from being deported to their home countries “due to the risk of torture, persecution or inhumane treatment.”

“We have to inform the court that the persons whose human rights we are seeking to enforce were all deported over the weekend,” their lawyer, Oliver Barker-Vormawo, told the court Tuesday at a virtual hearing, adding that the suit had become irrelevant.

“This is precisely the injury we were trying to prevent,” he said of the safety concerns of the deportees.

The 11 were four Nigerians, three Togolese, two Malians and one each from Gambia and Liberia, according to court documents seen by the AP.

The Trump administration’s deportation program has faced widespread criticism from human rights experts who cite international protections for asylum-seekers and question whether immigrants will be appropriately screened before being deported.

The administration has been seeking ways to deter immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally and remove those who already have done so, especially those accused of crimes and including those who cannot easily be deported to their home countries.

Faced with court decisions that migrants can’t be sent back to their home countries, the Trump administration has increasingly been trying to send them to third countries under agreements with those governments.

Ghana has joined Eswatini, Rwanda and South Sudan as African countries that have received migrants from third countries who were deported from the U.S.

The U.S. Department of Justice had argued in a federal court earlier this month that it had no power to control how another country treats deportees, and that Ghana had pledged to the U.S. it wouldn’t send the deportees back to their home countries.

“The legal issue in these cases involving fired DoJ employees is not just limited to them,” said Zelinsky.","As the Trump administration has fired federal employees and top officials for political reasons, blocked millions of dollars Congress appropriated and flouted legal norms, several legal outfits are providing crucial pro bono and other help to many individuals hurt by Donald Trump’s authoritarian actions, say lawyers involved and ex-prosecutors.

Lowell & Associates, Democracy Defenders Fund and the Washington Litigation Group, are among the leading legal groups with clients battling to get their jobs back, avoid prosecutions, or recoup millions of dollars that have been illegally blocked, say attorneys with the trio and experts.

Veteran white-collar lawyers, ex-justice department (DoJ) prosecutors and other legal talent at these firms are representing prominent figures Trump’s administration has fired to settle political scores, ex-officials his administration has launched investigations into, and scores of other officials ousted without cause, say lawyers.

Former DoJ prosecutors credit these smaller legal outfits for challenging administration moves that jeopardize the rule of law

“The creation of these new entities reflects a broad-based professional revulsion at the ongoing efforts to undermine the rule of law by the Trump administration, including turning the DoJ into an extension of the White House rather than a department that is faithful to the facts and the law,” said ex-DoJ inspector general Michael Bromwich.

These newer legal outfits in some ways are also helping fill a vacuum created by Trump’s pressure tactics on several major law firms with some Democratic ties which led them to agree to provide hundreds of millions in pro bono help to administration priorities.

Nine big law firms, including Paul Weiss and Kirkland & Ellis, struck deals with Trump in the first months of his second term to avert an executive order that would have made it very hard for them to represent their clients. In total, they agreed to provide almost $1bn in pro bono help to administration priorities including fighting antisemitism and veterans issues, the New York Times has reported.

A few lawyers have left these large firms including Skadden Arps and Milbank in recent months to join the smaller legal outfits now challenging Trump administration actions.

Consider Lowell & Associates which was started this spring by prominent white collar attorney Abbe Lowell and has quickly amassed several very high profile clients suing the Trump administration in cases involving alleged politically motivated firings.

Lowell, in tandem with an attorney for the FBI Agents Association, filed a major lawsuit on 10 September against the FBI director, Kash Patel, and other senior administration officials on behalf of two ex-senior officials, Brian Driscoll Jr and Steven Jensen, who were canned early this year they alleged in a politically driven purge.

Separately, Lowell teamed up with Democracy Defenders Fund in August to challenge Trump’s efforts to fire Federal Reserve Board governor Lisa Cook, as Trump sought to exert control over the historically independent Fed.

Two courts this month ruled against the administration which temporarily blocked Cook’s firing and allowed her to stay in her post for a pivotal Fed meeting on 16 and 17 September; the administration on the 18th appealed its case to the supreme court.

On another legal front, Democracy Defenders Fund won a major court ruling on behalf of AmeriCorps which it represented as counsel: a district court in July ruled that hundreds of millions of dollars Congress appropriated, but the administration nixed for AmeriCorps, should be restored.

Meanwhile, the Washington Litigation Group which was launched in August has already been tapped by about a dozen fired DoJ employees for legal help. It was formed by an elite group of veteran DC legal figures including former senior DoJ official Peter Keisler, retired DC judge Ellen Segal Huvelle and well-known white-collar lawyer Tom Green, who serve on an advisory steering committee.

Legal battles mounted by this trio and others involving attorneys with Democracy Forward and the Alden Law Group have helped spur a major surge in lawsuits against the administration that the New York Times in July pegged at over 400.

Given the Trump administration’s widespread attacks on the rule of law, the legal battles facing these new firms and their clients are daunting and the dozens of clients they represent vary considerably, say firm leaders.

“Week after chaotic week, we are seeing an onslaught of authoritarian actions, from dismantling government agencies, to firing public servants who refuse to toe the Maga line, to militarizing the police in Washington DC” said Susan Corke, the executive director of the Democracy Defenders Fund.

“The foundations of our democracy are being chipped away in real time, and we are facing a congressional majority that refuses to act as a check on executive power. That is why legal pushback is so critical right now. The courts remain one of the last places where truth, accountability, and the rule of law still matter … We are standing up for the principle that no one, not even a president, is above the law.”

Corke’s points are underscored by the big legal battles that the Fund has been waging.

In February, for instance, the Fund filed a lawsuit challenging the dismantling of USAID under the appointments clause because of the key role played by multi billionaire Elon Musk and his “department of government efficiency”. The lawsuit is now a class action on behalf of thousands of USAID workers who have lost their jobs.

The Fund, founded in 2023 by ex-ambassador Norman Eisen who serves as its executive chair, also conducts investigations in matters ranging from Trump’s ties to notorious sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein to the Trump family’s enormously lucrative stakes in cryptocurrency ventures.

To tackle other major legal battles sparked by Trump administration actions, Lowell created his small eponymous firm after leaving the much larger firm of Winston & Strawn where his high-profile clients included former president Joe Biden’s son Hunter, as well as Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner.

In a statement when the firm launched, Lowell said its mission would entail defending clients including institutions, individuals and others that are “facing politicized investigations, civil and administrative actions”.

Lowell’s firm has been on a roll signing up several leading figures who the Trump administration has either fired or tried to oust. Lowell has been representing Susan Monarez, the ex director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who was fired by the White House last month: Monarez told a Senate panel on 17 September that her firing came after health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, a well-known vaccine sceptic, pressured her unsuccessfully to oust career scientists and pre approve vaccine recommendations for the public.

In another high-stakes battle, Lowell and Democracy Defenders Fund filed successfully for a temporary restraining order with DC federal court on 2 September to block Trump’s firing of Cook on the grounds that he doesn’t have the authority to do so.

Another client is the New York attorney general ,Letitia James, who the justice department has been investigating for alleged mortgage fraud which James has denied. Trump has long deemed James a political foe for bringing a successful civil fraud case against Trump’s real estate empire last year with a $500m penalty. The penalty was overturned last month, but Trump and his two eldest sons remain barred from serving in leadership posts for a few years.

Last month too Lowell was hired to represent former Trump national security adviser John Bolton who became a leading critic of Trump at the end of his first term and wrote a hard hitting book about his tenure after Trump ousted him. The FBI recently raided his home amid allegations of retaining classified records.

“Any thorough review will show nothing inappropriate was stored or kept by Ambassador Bolton,” Lowell said in a 4 September statement that was the first public response from Bolton’s team related to the substance of the search.

Lowell’s firm has also teamed up with well-known lawyer Mark Zaid to represent three fired DoJ employees; and Lowell is representing Zaid, who has prominent whistleblower clients and whose security clearance was revoked by Trump.

Lowell’s small firm is staffed with several veteran attorneys who left Winston & Strawn and Skadden Arps after the latter firm cut a deal with the administration to avoid its crackdown on the legal profession.

Meanwhile, the even newer Washington Litigation Group is relying on four attorneys to handle its growing volume of cases, said steering committee member and senior counsel Nathaniel Zelinsky.

The firm’s other lawyers are James Pearce and Mary Dohrmann, who were part of special counsel Jack Smith’s team that brought charges against Trump for election subversion drive after his 2020 election loss and his retention of hundreds of classified documents after he left office, and DoJ veteran Samantha Bateman.

“In an environment where the executive branch has targeted law firms, the WLG stands ready to provide pro bono representation for those seeking to vindicate the rule of law,” said Pearce.

The firm has already filed a successful amicus brief on behalf of the Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey challenging Trump’s naming of Alina Habba, an ex-defense lawyer for Trump, to be US attorney for New Jersey after a very brief stint as interim US attorney.

In late August, a federal judge ruled in their favor declaring that Habba’s appointment was illegal which the government quickly appealed.

“The president’s efforts to install Alina Habba – like his attempt to purge the civil service of non-partisan public servants–are designed to mold the government into his image and undermine the rule of law,” said Zelinsky.

The firm has also been representing about a dozen justice department officials and employees who have been fired, often without cause or explanation, since Trump took office again. One such client is Tara Twomey, a career civil servant who was director of the executive office of the US Trustee program at DoJ which oversees bankruptcy cases and private trustees for about two years until her March firing.

“The legal issue in these cases involving fired DoJ employees is not just limited to them,” said Zelinsky. “The question is whether the President can fire every single employee in the Federal government – down to the person sweeping the floors – in violation of the laws Congress passed ensuring a professional, non-partisan civil service.”

Former DoJ officials say these newer legal shops are badly needed to counter administration attacks on the rule of law.

“The DoJ and the FBI are targeting people rather than crimes, and there is a vast need for lawyers to represent individuals and institutions that are under attack by the administration on multiple fronts,” said Bromwich.

A senior counsel with Steptoe, Bromwich has represented pro bono some clients ousted at DoJ including the former pardon attorney Elizabeth Oyer, who has been battling to get her job back with help from Democracy Defenders Fund and others.

Similarly, Daniel Richman, a Columbia law professor and ex-federal prosecutor, said: “It’s heartening but not surprising that a number of respected lawyers have put political differences aside to defend the governmental institutions they value and the individual government officials who have fallen victim to the Trump administration’s assaults on those institutions.

“Any retaliation by the administration against those lawyers or their clients may hurt them economically, but I’d like to think the profession values those with the law on their side who stand up to lawless and often vindictive executive action.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/575ea9c5dae5efa616e4babbd090b7238984d5a3/616_0_3344_2675/master/3344.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a9c96f818bc4d66b54dc02d283f39cc3",N,,2025-09-23 09:57:32.116366

A curated weekday guide to major news and developments over the last 24 hours. Here’s today’s news:

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

President Trump yesterday signed an executive order purporting to designate Antifa as a “domestic terrorist organization” and directing “all relevant agencies” to “utilize all applicable authorities to investigate, disrupt, and dismantle any and all illegal operations … conducted by Antifa, any person claiming to act on behalf of Antifa,” or those who financially support it. Legal experts point out that the United States does not have a “domestic terrorism” designation. Antifa, a shorthand for anti-fascists, is a diffuse political ideology and not a unified organization. Chris Cameron reports for the New York Times; Aaron Pellish reports for POLITICO.

Trump yesterday claimed that the use of a common pain reliever, acetaminophen, in pregnant women causes autism. He did not present evidence backing his claim. In a POLITICO op-ed that announced new research into the root causes of autism and endorsed a B-vitamin-based drug to treat the disorder, Food and Drug Agency Commissioner Marty Makary, National Institute of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya, and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator Mehmet Oz were more circumspect, noting that family control studies “have failed to find a correlation” between acetaminophen and autism. Azeen Ghorayshi reports for the New York Times.

The Agriculture Department yesterday put a team of federal economists and researchers responsible for producing the government survey that measures hunger in the United States on indefinite paid leave, the employees’ union said. According to a notice seen by the Wall Street Journal, USDA officials said the leave is “not a disciplinary action”. The staffers were told they were placed on leave while an “unauthorized disclosure” was being investigated, a union representative said. Dan Frosch and Patrick Thomas report.

Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently formalized new restrictions on when, where, and how the military and Pentagon leaders can engage with the public. Hegseth’s memo states that the Pentagon will prioritize “engagements with organizations that comport themselves professionally” and will make a “concerted effort to engage” with institutions representing differing perspectives. Colin Demarest and Sara Fischer report for Axios.

White House border czar Tom Homan did “absolutely nothing wrong” and “never took the $50,000”, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said yesterday, describing the FBI probe into Homan as “another example of the weaponization of the Biden Department of Justice against one of President Trump’s strongest and most vocal supporters.” The New York Times reported on Saturday that FBI agents last year made an audio recording of a meeting in which Homan appeared to promise to help the agents, posing as businessmen, to secure federal contracts related to border security. Devlin Barrett reports.

The Treasury Department will no longer carry out additional vetting of the members of the Taxpayer Advocacy Panel, with the panel’s work returning to “business as usual,” according to an email obtained by POLITICO. Danny Nguyen reports.

The commission overseeing the United States’ 250th birthday celebration yesterday announced it has terminated its White House-selected executive director, Ariel Abergel. The 25-year-old appointee “initiated a security breach of a … social-media account, attempted to procure the resignations of multiple commissioners by misrepresenting himself as acting on behalf of Congressional leadership, and engaged in multiple other serious and repeated breaches of authority and trust,” the commission’s spokesperson said. Abergel attributed his firing to his efforts to honor Charlie Kirk. Meredith McGraw and Jess Bravin report for the Wall Street Journal.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

The United States is considering sanctioning the entire International Criminal Court in retaliation for its investigations into suspected Israeli war crimes as early as this week, Reuters reports, citing several sources. While Washington has already sanctioned several ICC prosecutors and judges, sanctioning the court itself could significantly disrupt its operations. ICC officials had already held emergency meetings to prepare for the potential blanket sanctions, a source said. Anthony Deutsch, Humeyra Pamuk, and Stephanie van den Berg report.

The Treasury Department yesterday imposed new Global Magnitsky Act sanctions on the wife of Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the judge overseeing the prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro. The Brazilian Supreme Court earlier this month convicted Bolsonaro of organizing a coup to stay in power following his 2022 electoral loss. Jacob Wendler reports for POLITICO.

The U.S. government is set to revoke the visas of Brazilian Solicitor-General Jorge Messias and five other current and former Brazilian judicial officers, a Trump administration official told Reuters yesterday. Gram Slattery reports.

The Trump administration is exploring options to provide Argentina with a lifeline to combat its financial woes, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced yesterday. Argentinian President Javier Milei’s economic overhaul is facing growing opposition over the economy contracting amid austerity measures. Brian Schwartz, Ryan Dubé, and Sam Goldfarb report for the Wall Street Journal.

Russian President Vladimir Putin yesterday said he was prepared to abide by the existing limits on the number of deployed nuclear weapons for a year after the New START accord expires in February 2026, as long as the United States does the same and “does not take steps that undermine or violate the existing balance of deterrence potentials.” Andrew Osborn, Vladimir Soldatkin, and Jonathan Landay report for Reuters.

The State Department yesterday barred Iranian diplomats based in or visiting New York from shopping at wholesale club stores like Costco and purchasing luxury goods without specific permission, according to a notice set to be published this week in the Federal Register. Matthew Lee reports for AP News.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

The Trump administration will expand its use of AI in immigration enforcement from this Thursday, introducing ImmigrationOS, a system that allow agents to approve raids, book arrests, generate legal documents, and arrange deportations in one place, a former official said. Angélica Franganillo Díaz reports for CNN.

The Labor Department said yesterday that it will open investigations into employers that “abuse” the H-1B visa program, in order to “ensure employers prioritize American Workers.” Lauren Kaori Gurley and Danielle Abril report for the Washington Post

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. authorities on Saturday detained a man who allegedly aimed a laser at Marine One while Trump was on board, according to a complaint filed by a U.S. Secret Service officer. The filing states that the man was “shirtless, talking to himself and being loud” prior to the incident. Faith Wardwell reports for POLITICO.

“Jimmy Kimmel Live!” will resume airing tomorrow, Disney announced yesterday. In its statement, the company said that it suspended Kimmel over the comments he made about the killing of Charlie Kirk last week “to avoid inflaming a tense situation.” Aaron Pellish reports for POLITICO.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

Nvidia announced yesterday that it plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. According to a source close to OpenAI, the deal involves two inter-linked transactions, with Nvidia first investing into OpenAI to obtain non-voting shares, enabling OpenAI to then buy Nvidia’s chips. Deepa Seetharaman and Akash Sriram report for Reuters; Michael Action, Cristina Criddle, George Hammond and Tim Bradshaw report for the Financial Times.

Trump plans to sign an executive order delaying the enforcement of a 2024 law banning Tiktok for another 120 days to finalise the terms of a Washington-Beijing TikTok deal, a senior White House official said yesterday. The White House is “100 percent confident” that the deal will go through, the source added. The Chinese government has not confirmed a deal to date, with a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson telling reporters yesterday that China acknowledged receipt of “information on the basic framework consensus on the TikTok issue.” Anthony Adragna reports for POLITICO.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

France yesterday announced its recognition of Palestine’s statehood, with Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, and Monaco also announcing or confirming their recognition of a Palestinian state during a U.N. General Assembly meeting aimed at galvanizing support for a two-state solution. The United States did not attend the France- and Saudi Arabia-organized meeting. Joseph Krauss and Farnoush Amiri report for AP News; Fiona Nimoni reports for BBC News.

Trump will today present the most concrete proposal for ending the war in Gaza to date to a group of leaders from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Indonesia, and Pakistan, according to U.S. and Arab officials. “Our understanding is that Trump wants to get our feedback and support for the U.S. plan to end the war,” one of the Arab diplomats said. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Pro-Palestine strikes by grassroots unions caused major disruption across Italy yesterday, with some protesters storming Milan’s central train station and clashing violently with police. Giada Zampano reports for AP News.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israel’s offensive on Gaza City has taken hospitals in the city out of service, the territory’s Hamas-run health ministry said. Jordanian armed forces are also moving their field hospital in Gaza City’s Tel Al-Hawa neighborhood to Khan Younis for the safety of the hospital’s staff, Jordan’s state news agency Petra reported yesterday. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters.

Israeli artillery shelling and quadcopter drone attacks are driving people from their homes in Gaza City, local residents say. Israeli tanks have now advanced into the city centre, according to witnesses. Yolande Knell reports for BBC News.

Hamas authorities publicly executed three men accused of collaborating with Israel in Gaza City on Sunday, according to a Palestinian official and BBC Verify. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters; Merlyn Thomas reports.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES

During an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council yesterday, European allies warned that they would shoot down Russian jets or drones involved in any further incursions of NATO airspace. British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said NATO “is defensive, but be under no illusion…if we need to confront planes that are operating in NATO airspace without permission, then we will do so.” U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Michael Waltz told the Security Council that the United States “will defend every inch of NATO territory.” Ivana Kottasová and Nina Subkhanberdina report for CNN.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

Zelenskyy plans to meet Trump today in New York and is likely to discuss further U.S. sanctions on Russia, ahead of speaking to the U.N. General Assembly tomorrow morning. Tom Balmforth reports for Reuters.

The U.N. Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Russia, Mariana Katzarova, told the press yesterday that “repression [in Russia] is escalating,” with Moscow targeting civilians and journalists in order to silence opposition to the war in Ukraine. According to Katzarova’s report, since mid-2024 “at least 3,905 individuals [were] convicted on administrative or criminal charges for peaceful dissent.” AP News reports.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Copenhagen and Oslo airports stopped all flights late yesterday evening for several hours following drone sightings over both airports. The Danish police have not been able to confirm Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s social media claim that Russia had violated Danish airspace, but said they believe a “capable operator” sent them. Norwegian police confirmed that they seized the drone that was spotted over Oslo airport, but had yet to locate its operator. At the time of writing, there has been no confirmation the incursions are linked. Sune Engel Rasmussen reports for Wall Street Journal.

Ruling military juntas in Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger announced in a joint statement yesterday that they are withdrawing from the International Criminal Court, calling it an “instrument of neocolonial repression in the hands of imperialism.” The three states have said they instead want to establish “indigenous mechanisms for the consolidation of peace and justice.” AP News reports; Harry Sekulich reports for BBC News.

Brazil’s Chief Prosecutor yesterday announced that he has charged Brazilian congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of former President Jair Bolsonaro, with coercion. The prosecutor’s office said that Eduardo Bolsonaro has “repeatedly sought to subordinate the interests of Brazil and the entire society to his own personal and family agenda.” Eduardo Bolsonaro currently resides in the United States and responded to the charges as “bogus accusations” and “ongoing political persecution.” Tabby Wilson reports for BBC News; Reuters reports.

ICC prosecutors have charged former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte with crimes against humanity as an “indirect co-perpetrator” for murders committed in the Philippines between 2013 and 2022, a redacted charge sheet dated to July 2025 that was made public yesterday shows. Natasha Preskey reports for BBC News.

The U.N. Group of Human Rights Experts in Nicaragua said today that Nicaragua’s government is expanding its repression of opponents, targeting Nicaraguans living abroad. Gabriela Selser reports for Reuters.

Moldovan authorities said yesterday that they carried out 250 raids and detained 74 people as part of an investigation into the Russia-coordinated plan to destabilize the country ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary elections. AP News reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

The Supreme Court yesterday granted the Trump administration’s emergency request to remove FTC member Rebecca Kelly Slaughter until a hearing in December, staying a lower court order that had temporarily reinstated Slaughter in her post. The Court indicated it will consider oral arguments on whether a long-standing Supreme Court precedent limiting the president’s power to fire officials of independent agencies unconstitutionally interferes with the president’s ability to control the executive branch. Josh Gerstein reports for POLITICO; Lydia Wheeler and Jess Bravin report for the Wall Street Journal.

A federal judge yesterday temporarily ordered the Trump administration to recommence the flow of $500 million in funding for scientific research to the University of California, pending a final decision on the issue. In her ruling, the judge said that the government’s indefinite suspension of National Institute of Health grants was “likely arbitrary and capricious.” Eric He reports for POLITICO.

A federal judge yesterday granted a preliminary injunction of the stop-work order imposed by the Trump administration on the Revolution Wind offshore wind project. The order said that the company is likely to suffer irreparable harm if it does not restart work on the project and the government can carry out their review while the work is carried out. Kelsey Tamborrino reports for POLITICO.

A West Point law professor yesterday filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Military Academy, alleging the school is violating the First Amendment by banning opinions by professors in the classroom and some books and courses. Larry Neumeister reports for AP News.

“People arrive with very few resources, some with only the clothes on their backs,” said 56-year-old boat driver Nacor Rivera.
The family fled the South American country in 2017 in the face of a spiraling economy and mounting government repression.
For years, she lived in Colombia and Peru, like millions of other Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years.","JAQUE, Panama -- As the boat bounced across choppy Pacific waters, Mariela Gómez and her two children huddled for 17 hours on top of sloshing gas tanks, uncertain of what lay ahead in the dense jungle.

The 36-year-old Venezuelan mother was among a million migrants who journeyed across the continent in recent years in the hopes of reaching the United States. But with legal pathways slashed under U.S. President Donald Trump, she and thousands of other Venezuelans are now trying to make their way back in a “reverse migration.”

Over 14,000 migrants, mostly from Venezuela, have returned to South America since Trump’s immigration crackdown began, according to figures from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica.

Struggling to buy even food after failed attempts to stay in the U.S., Gómez can't afford the $280-per-person charge for the more frequented Caribbean route to Colombia. So a growing number of migrants like her are boarding boats that ferry cargo between Panama's capital and Colombia's jungle-clad Pacific coast.

The new route is half the price and twice as dangerous.

“We lost hope,” she said. “We’re trying to return, but we don’t have the money to go back.”

In recent years, migrants fleeing the crisis in Venezuela once crossed the perilous jungles of the Darien Gap between Colombia and Panama and waited months in Mexico for an asylum appointment in the U.S. But when Trump took office, many of those people were left stranded in Mexico. Without other options, they turned back, winding down through Central America on buses.

They chug aboard slow-moving cargo boats packed with merchandise along Panama’s other coast in the Pacific Ocean for days, before boarding precarious motor boats that shoot along the coast. The boats are often packed with 15 to 30 people. Hundreds so far have traveled the route, according to a United Nations report released earlier this month.

“People arrive with very few resources, some with only the clothes on their backs,” said 56-year-old boat driver Nacor Rivera. “Many can’t pay for the boat ride, so I’ve had to help a lot of them, carrying them for free.”

In June, one of those boats carrying 38 people crashed at sea, injuring a pregnant woman, children and a person with a disability who lost their wheelchair.

They land in jungled swathes of Colombia, a region rife with armed groups that prey on migrants, where there are no shelters and little access to medical care, according to the U.N. report.

“We urge authorities to care for people in this reverse migration to stop them from falling into criminal and trafficking networks of illegal armed groups, and turn them into victims of even greater violence,"" said Scott Campbell, a U.N. human rights officer in Colombia, in a statement.

Migrants land with serious cases of dehydration, burns, malnutrition and mental health issues. Those without money can “remain stranded in inhumane conditions,” the report said.

That was the case of Jesús Aguilar, a Venezuelan migrant who was stuck in a rural Panamanian town in the Darien Gap for two months. He managed to slowly scrounge together money to pay for a boat ride to Colombia after a local offered him work cleaning their farm.

Others, like Gómez’s family, spent months in Panama City saving money to travel back to Venezuela, but when they came up short, they decided to take the cheaper route along the Pacific.

Sitting on top of gasoline tanks, Gómez cradles her 5-year-old son swaddled in blankets. The family fled the South American country in 2017 in the face of a spiraling economy and mounting government repression.

For years, she lived in Colombia and Peru, like millions of other Venezuelans who have fled the country in recent years. Unable to make ends meet in countries that have struggled to manage the crush of vulnerable people, Gómez began to look to the U.S. with hopes of building a new life.

After crossing the Darien Gap and later the U.S.-Mexico border to Texas in October, her family was quickly swept up by the U.S. Border Patrol and handed over to Mexican authorities who dropped them in southern Mexico.

Shortly after, she decided her only way forward was to return home. Without work and with cartels preying on migrants like her, staying in southern Mexico wasn't an option.

At least in Venezuela she has her home and her family, she said.

“It would have been risking our lives and risking the life of my child” to keep going, Gómez said. “We're just hoping God protects us.”

Now, as she returns home, she's not sure what she will find in Venezuela, which has faced an ongoing crackdown on dissent by the government following last year's contested elections.

She said if the government of President Nicolás Maduro remains in power, staying in her country doesn't seem like an option. “I would have to leave my country again, maybe go to Chile,” she pondered. “I would have to try my luck in another country. Again.""

“But right now, we just have to focus on getting to Colombia,” she added.

Juarez Zeferino is now pursuing a legal path to come back to the US, where he had lived since he was eight.","Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino spends much of his days outdoors, harvesting bananas and hiking vast, bramble-laden trails. But for more than a quarter of 2025, he barely saw the sun. After being arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) in March, the farm-worker activist was placed in a detention center in Washington state, where he remained until he agreed to voluntarily leave the US.

“I probably would say five times, in the three months and a half I was in there, they offered me to go outside,” he explained on a Zoom call from his family farm in Guerrero, Mexico, where he has been for over a month.

Juarez Zeferino is among the thousands of people who have agreed to leave the country after arriving without documentation – a group that is reportedly growing.

His arrest was officially based on a deportation order about which he says he never received a notification.

Between January and July, Ice data shows that more than 11,000 non-citizens reported that they self-deported, but many others have likely done so without registering their departure with the government. The data does not make clear how many people, like Juarez Zeferino, chose to exit the US after being arrested.

Colleagues, friends and supporters of the 25-year-old organizer believe he was targeted by the Trump administration for his success as a farm worker organizer. Juarez Zeferino said he agrees with that assessment.

“I would say definitely,” he said when asked if he believes he was targeted. “I would say yes.”

Ice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reached for comment in July, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said that allegations of Ice politically targeting Juarez Zeferino were “categorically FALSE”, calling him “an illegal alien from Mexico with a final order of removal from a judge”.

The weeks-long stretches indoors were just one major problem Juarez Zeferino faced during his time in the Northwest detention center in Tacoma, Washington, a massive facility which holds more than 1,500 people who are being threatened with deportation.

Another was the food: meals would often arrive well after midnight, and at times featured “dangerously undercooked” meat. On several occasions, he said, detainees were served nearly raw, bloody chicken; those who ate it often suffered upset stomachs and painful cramps.

“I asked the guards why a lot of the foods were undercooked, or what’s happening in the kitchen,” he said. “The general answer they would give is that they were understaffed.”

The understaffing caused other issues, too. When Juarez Zeferino and others would attempt to receive medical care, for instance, they were often turned away after long, arduous waits.

“When I got sick, I just tried to sleep,” he said. “I stopped even bothering signing up to see a doctor, because I really had no hope of getting in front of one.”

The facility did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Juarez Zeferino’s most harrowing experience in the immigration jail came within his first week in the facility. At about 10pm, he saw a guard walking around with a list of detainees set to be placed on a deportation flight that night. He saw his name highlighted, and in a panic called his lawyer, who was able to have his name removed.

“But the only way we were able to stop it was because I saw my name,” he said. “If I didn’t see my name, they would just have pushed me out, put me on a flight.”

Despite these uncomfortable and sometimes torturous conditions, Juarez Zeferino struggled deeply with his decision to self-deport.

“It was very hard, especially with all the work that I have done, the relationships I’ve built, to decide to leave” he said. “I wasn’t sure how I was going to reconnect, or how I could continue the job of organizing.”

During his 18 years in Washington, Juarez Zeferino fought for labor protections for undocumented agricultural workers like himself, with a remarkable success rate. As a teenager, Juarez Zeferino helped win a farmworker union and organized an international boycott against berry giant Driscoll. He also played an integral part in winning statewide heat protections for outdoor laborers, a cap on rent, and guaranteed overtime pay.

Now, from Mexico, he is continuing to organize with Familias Unidas por la Justicia, the union he helped found, and Community to Community, the food justice group with whom he organizes. Every week, he attends remote meetings.

In recent months, he has been pushing Washington and other states to pass bills authorizing officials to regularly inspect Ice detention centers unannounced.

He is also still organizing for farmworker justice; one top priority is ending reliance on the H-2A contract labor program, which allows farmowners to recruit foreign agricultural laborers to work on their farms temporarily and then return to their home country.

Nearly a third of all Washington state farm laborers have now been replaced by guest workers via the program, which Juarez Zeferino has for years staunchly criticized, arguing it crowds out domestic workers in favor of foreign laborers who can be far easier to exploit and mistreat.

Juarez Zeferino believes the industry’s desire to “replace all local workers with imported guest workers” has fueled the Trump administration’s war on farmworker activists. Since his arrest, border patrol agents in May arrested farmworker organizers on a Vermont dairy farm, and in May, Ice arrested workers on a New York farm who were involved in a seminal labor case. In August, Ice raided the same New York farm again.

“They really want to push out all those folks that know their rights,” he said.

Juarez Zeferino is now pursuing a legal path to come back to the US, where he had lived since he was eight. But in the meantime, he is enjoying his time back in Santa Cruz Yucucani, the village where he is living for the first time since he was a child. He is staying with his parents and siblings, who left the US just days before he was arrested, and his partner.

Though he is still working on a farm, it belongs to his family, so he can take breaks whenever he likes.

The best part of being back in Mexico, he says, is picking plants to eat – not from fields, but from mountaintops where they grow wild.

“Just gathering the food is a whole experience,” he said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ef54f1607a2c6b98386edd6a32fb6050225152a/0_108_1536_1229/master/1536.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=805d92128665ad66845f243c14439b45",N,,2025-09-23 07:57:01.272260

""To be clear: We will NOT comply with Gavin Newsom's unconstitutional mask ban,"" DHS posted on X Monday morning.

The ban is a direct response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, where federal agents wore masks while making mass arrests. The bill was signed by Gov. Gavin Newsom Saturday and goes into effect in January.

The Democratic governor said the state is pushing back against the practice of masked agents without identification or badge numbers detaining people on the streets.

In a news release, DHS called the ban ""unconstitutional"" and claimed ICE officers are ""facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them.""

Trump administration officials have defended use of masks, saying immigration agents face strident and increasing harassment in public and online as they carry out enforcement in service of Trump's drive toward mass deportation. Obscuring their identities is necessary for the safety of the agents and their families, officials contend.

The brief urges the Supreme Court to affirm the Tenth Circuit.
GEO should not be allowed to take a shortcut to the appellate courts rather than face the respondents at trial.","This month, the Cato Institute joined an amicus curiae brief filed with the US Supreme Court, arguing that the GEO Group should not be allowed a pretrial appeal in a lawsuit, as ruled by the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.

GEO Group, the petitioner, makes billions of dollars a year operating private immigration detention facilities. The company allegedly forced every person detained at the Aurora Immigration Processing Center in Aurora, CO, to perform unpaid janitorial work, threatening that, if they refused, they would be sent to “the hole”—solitary confinement. In addition, GEO allegedly fulfilled its other staffing needs through a “voluntary work program.” Although technically voluntary, many people detained at the Center had little choice but to participate.

Working for GEO was the only way they could earn money to buy food and toiletries from the commissary or make phone calls while detained. These were not luxuries: The “inadequate” meals GEO reportedly served left those in its care “chronically hungry”—unable to get enough to eat without “voluntarily” working for GEO. Initially, the company paid these workers “$1.00 per day and a bottle of soda once a week.” GEO later reduced that to just $1 a day.

Over a decade ago, the respondents filed a lawsuit, alleging that GEO subjected them to human trafficking. The case has yet to go to trial in part because GEO sought a pretrial appeal under a doctrine that shields government contractors from liability for actions that were authorized and directed by the government. The Tenth Circuit held that GEO cannot appeal yet because the district court has not reached a final decision in the case. The Supreme Court has decided to review that ruling.

Cato joined a brief filed by the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center and the Institute for Justice. The brief urges the Supreme Court to affirm the Tenth Circuit. Judges have crafted numerous textually and historically baseless legal doctrines to advantage government officials in litigation. As illegitimate as these doctrines are when applied to actual government bureaucrats, it would be even worse to let private actors share in them, as GEO attempts to do here.

Since President Trump took office, 15 people have died in immigration detention, 10 of those deaths occurred between January and June, Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock wrote in a letter shared exclusively with NPR. The senators say that is the highest rate in the first six months of any year publicly available.

""Whatever our views on border enforcement, immigration enforcement, immigration policy, I think the overwhelming majority of the American people does not want detainees abused while they're in U.S. custody,"" Ossoff told NPR in an interview.

The Homeland Security Department is rushing to expand detention space and increase the rates of arrests after Congress provided billions of dollars in additional funding. Across the country, reports of overcrowding, unsanitary conditions and issues with food and healthcare access have been the product of a focus to make more arrests. NPR has reached out to DHS and Immigration and Customs Enforcement for comment.

The letter follows a report Ossoff released in July that alleges human rights violations occurred at immigration detention centers, including mistreatment of children, citizens and pregnant women. DHS broadly refuted the claims.

Earlier this year, ICE officials announced the agency was out of detention space. By the summer, over 50,000 people were in detention but ICE only had 46,000 beds.

Since then, ICE has announced expanded detention space through the use of military bases and state partnerships in Indiana, Nebraska, and Louisiana.

But the rapid expansion and use of other facilities has drawn criticism from immigration advocates and Democrats.

Concern over conditions in detention also comes after DHS cut jobs in the oversight divisions focused on civil rights. This included widespread cuts within the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which conducts oversight of ICE and Customs and Border Protection detention.

Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons was asked about deaths in custody and delays in reports during a Congressional oversight hearing in May.

""We do conduct a thorough investigation of all of those,"" Lyons said, adding that he would ensure that information on deaths in custody were publicly available online in accordance with Congressional mandates. ""ICE is dedicated to transparency.""

In the letter, Ossoff and Warnock reiterate the concern of delayed reporting of death.

""ICE is failing to meet its own standards for reporting detainee deaths, thereby hindering Congressional oversight efforts and leaving families in the dark as to their loved ones' fates,"" they wrote, adding that ICE guidance requires the agency to post an interim notice of any detainee death to ICE's website ""within 48 hours,"" and directs that ""every effort should be made to post the interim notice"" sooner.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3068x1726+7+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2f%2F56%2F50e3c2784ff4872782ef56419a24%2Fgettyimages-2233996808.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 06:57:40.170956

Seattle police are the target of new recruiting efforts by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

In a new Homeland Security advertisement that first aired last week, the commercial calls out Seattle-area officers encouraging them to join ICE.

“Attention Seattle law enforcement,” the ad begins, “you took an oath to protect and serve, to keep your family, your city safe, but in sanctuary cities you're ordered to stand down while dangerous illegals walk free.”

The ad urges law enforcement members to join ICE and help “catch the worst of the worst."" Those who join ICE can receive a $50,000 bonus, according to the advertisement.

Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson was quick to criticize the campaign.

""Trump is trying to deport our neighbors while weakening the progress we’ve made on public safety as a pretext to sending in the National Guard,"" she said. ""I have one message: stay out of Seattle.”

Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell's office said it is working with the Seattle Police Department (SPD) to prepare a statement to be released on Tuesday.

KING 5 reached out to the King County Sheriff's Office and has not heard back.

Officials with the Department of Homeland Security said the recruitment efforts are paying off and that people interested in becoming ICE agents are responding favorably to the messaging.

“ICE has received more than 150,000 applications from patriotic Americans who want to defend the homeland by removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from the U.S.,” said United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem in a Sept. 16 press release. “We have already issued more than 18,000 tentative job offers. Americans are answering their country's call to serve and help remove murderers, pedophiles, rapists, terrorists, and gang members from our country.”

The career pitch could make staffing shortages worse at the local level, said KING 5 Law Enforcement Analyst John Urquhart, the former King County Sheriff.

""If you want to fight crime, become a community police officer ... help people,"" Urquhart said. ""You can make a difference in your local community. You don't need to go to ICE, wear a mask, to fight crime.""

Washington state law prevents local law enforcement agencies from helping federal immigration agents. Seattle Municipal Code also restricts officers from enforcing federal immigration laws.

SPD has previously said it ""does not ask about an individual's immigration status unless directly connected to a criminal investigation, such as human trafficking.""

In recent months, ICE has become a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s second term in office, ramping up deportations and fear among those who are undocumented. The Trump Administration has a goal of removing 1 million people per year via ICE, according to the 2026 budget overview.

On the ICE recruitment website, it states interested entry-level candidates do not need any college education to apply and clarifies the offered benefits. The salary range listed is $49,739 to $89,528 per year, and $63,148 to $101,860 per year for candidates over 40 years old.

The Seattle Police Department offers a starting salary of $103,000 with a $7,500 signing bonus for new officers.

""This report is critical to our fight against hunger in America, and Trump has abandoned it just as he’s abandoned working families.""","Two months after President Donald Trump enacted the biggest-ever cut to federal food assistance, his administration ended a key yearly report on food insecurity, drawing widespread condemnation Monday from critics who accused the president of once again trying to hide the harms of his policies.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced Saturday that it will stop publishing its annual Household Food Security reports, claiming that the surveys—which are the federal government's primary means of gauging hunger—""failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder.""

""These redundant, costly, politicized, and extraneous studies do nothing more than fear-monger,"" USDA added.

Experts warned that the USDA's move will make it more difficult to track the harmful effects. Critics say that's exactly the point.

""Step 1: Increase hunger with massive SNAP cuts, increase food prices with tariffs,"" Congresswoman Shontel Brown (D-Ohio) said Monday on social media, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. ""Step 2: Abruptly end USDA hunger report.""

""The Trump administration doesn’t solve problems, it hides them,"" Brown added.

Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) also posted about the matter Monday, calling the USDA move ""shameful and cowardly.""

""Trump wants the USDA to stop collecting data on food insecurity because he knows hunger will spike after his Big, Ugly Bill kicks millions of families off food assistance,"" she wrote, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act the president signed on July 4.

The legislation approved the deepest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in history while slashing billions from other essential social programs to fund massive tax breaks for billionaires and corporations. The law ends health coverage and food assistance for millions of Americans at a time when more than 47 million Americans—including 1 in 5 US children—are living in food insecure households.

""As grocery prices rise and Republicans’ cuts to food assistance drive more families into food insecurity, President Trump wants to disguise these devastating effects from the public,"" Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said Monday on social media. ""This report is critical to our fight against hunger in America, and Trump has abandoned it just as he’s abandoned working families.""

As Common Dreams has reported, food banks and other lifelines—many of them severely underresourced—are bracing for a surge in hunger resulting from the Republican cuts.

The USDA's move follows Trump's August 1 firing of former Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, baselessly accusing her of manipulating economic data to harm him politically after the agency published a report showing only 73,000 jobs added to the economy the previous month.

Over the last several months, masked immigration officers have abducted people from courthouses, their cars, on the street, and at their workplaces.
Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin posted on X: “Good news for Americans and public safety: @ICEGov and @DHSgov law enforcement are part of the federal government.

“It serves no law enforcement purpose.”","The Trump administration says it will not comply with California’s new law barring law enforcement officials from wearing masks, which goes into effect next year. Over the last several months, masked immigration officers have abducted people from courthouses, their cars, on the street, and at their workplaces.

On September 20, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) signed the No Secret Police Act, which bars, with limited exceptions, local, state, and federal law enforcement officers from wearing “a facial covering that conceals or obscures their facial identity in the performance of their duties,” including a balaclava, tactical mask, gator, or ski mask. The prohibition does not apply to medical masks worn to prevent transmission of disease. Violation of the law is a misdemeanor and the officer is liable to the victim for no less than $10,000.

California is the first state in the country to ban the practice, although similar legislation has been introduced in Illinois and New York, as well as at the federal level.

“No one wants masked officers roaming their communities and kidnapping people with impunity,” State Sen. Scott Wiener (D), the bill’s sponsor, said in a statement. “As this authoritarian regime expands its reach into every aspect of daily life — including terrorizing people where they work, where they live, where they go to school, where they shop, where they seek health care — California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms.”

The Trump administration has indicated that it has no intention of complying with the legislation.

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin posted on X: “Good news for Americans and public safety: @ICEGov and @DHSgov law enforcement are part of the federal government. We don’t need to abide by this garbage.”

Acting U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli posted on X that he had “directed our federal agencies that the law signed today has no effect on our operations” and that “[o]ur agents will continue to protect their identities.”

“The State of California has no jurisdiction over the federal government,” Essayli said. “If Newsom wants to regulate our agents, he must go through Congress.”

The federal government is expected to challenge the law.

In an op-ed for the Sacramento Bee, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, argued that the legislation was constitutional. State and local governments, he wrote, “can require that federal employees comply with general laws unless doing so would significantly interfere with the performance of their duties.”

“ICE agents wearing masks is meant to evoke the terror of being kidnapped,” he continued. “It serves no law enforcement purpose.”",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/2025-9-22-masked-agents-california-.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 07:57:10.998159

Disputes over arrests

What we know:

On Monday, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Illinois) said he’s not necessarily buying the official numbers from DHS.

""Fewer than 30% of those who've been arrested have any kind of criminal background whatsoever,"" Durbin said. ""So 70% of the people who are being detained have no criminal record. The president can rant about rapists and murderers and terrorists and criminally insane people coming in as immigrants. But those who are being arrested don't have any indication of that behavior. So if we're going to make America safe, let's put the resources into stopping criminals.""

The senator’s comments come after several days of clashes between a handful of protestors and ICE and Border Patrol agents at the ICE processing center in west suburban Broadview.

The other side:

A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security blamed the actions and rhetoric of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker for escalating of tense situations.

""It is incumbent upon JB Pritzker, Mayor Brandon Johnson to turn down the rhetoric because they are repeating and really turning to violence,"" said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant DHS secretary, on Fox News.

Six women charged in connection with the shooting at the ICE Prairieland Detention Center on July 4 made their first appearances before a federal judge on Monday.

They face charges ranging from attempted murder of federal agents to hindering the prosecution of terrorism.

""I'm pretty sure the only reason that I wasn't there that night was because I was moving,"" James Barker-Murphey, a friend of some of the defendants, said.

Barker-Murphey says the group planned a protest that night, not an ambush.

""They were there to show solidarity with the people who were being kidnapped off the streets by ICE, they're being called terrorists,"" Barker-Murphey said.

According to a criminal complaint, four of the defendants dressed in black military-style clothing, some wearing body armor, and began shooting fireworks at the facility.

When an Alvarado police officer responded to the scene, another defendant in their group allegedly shot the officer in the neck from nearby woods, while another alleged shooter across the street fired 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed correctional officers who had stepped outside the facility.

""You do have some factors that already indicate that this was a premeditated attack—the number of people who were involved, the fact that they had to buy fireworks and bring firearms in advance, and the fact that they were all in coordinated clothing,"" Leigha Simonton, a 20-year veteran of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas, said.

Simonton calls the case unprecedented.

She says federal prosecutors are expected to present evidence that could prove the defendants planned to kill the federal officers.

""They would be looking at text messages, any other forms of communication to really understand how these people were talking about the attack,"" Simonton said.

""I don't think anybody should get shot in the neck. I mean, that's pretty common, like, human compassion,"" Barker-Murphey said.

The letter urges him to veto Assembly Bill (AB) 715—a dangerous classroom censorship bill that will silence Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Jewish, and other marginalized voices in California public schools by criminalizing honest discussions on Palestine and other global human rights issues.

In the letter, signatories outlined their concerns about AB 715’s vague and sweeping mandates on “factual accuracy,” its disproportionate focus on one form of hate outside a broader civil rights framework, and its reference to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA)’s definition of antisemitism. The IHRA definition was first incorporated in President Biden’s 2023 U.S. National Strategy to Counter Antisemitism and has been widely criticized—including by its own author—for conflating antisemitism with legitimate criticism of the state of Israel and being used to silence free speech on school campuses.

The letter also emphasized that, while challenging antisemitism in schools is essential, AB 715’s narrow framework erases, and even punishes, the identities and lived experiences of Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian students.

In a statement, CAIR-CA CEO Hussam Ayloush said:

“AB 715 is a dangerous bill that trades facts-based education and honest conversations on critical global justice issues for censorship and erasure. Our students deserve classrooms where they can speak freely, ask difficult questions, and see their histories accurately represented. Instead, this bill threatens to chill free speech and criminalize discussion of Palestinian history and the ongoing genocide in Gaza.

“Governor Newsom has a responsibility to protect students’ right to learn, and we strongly urge him to uphold this responsibility by vetoing AB 715. We cannot allow censorship to masquerade as safety.”

Organizations that signed onto the letter include American Muslims for Palestine, Islamic Shura Council of Southern California, the Council of Sacramento Valley Islamic Organizations, the Islamic Center of Southern California, the Muslim Community Association of San Francisco Bay Area, the Muslim Leadership Council of San Diego, and the Shia Muslim Council of Southern California.

In that case, the court sided with another FTC commissioner who was fired by Franklin D. Roosevelt as the president worked to implement the New Deal. The justices unanimously found commissioners can be removed only for misconduct or neglect of duty.

The justices’ decision then ushered in an era of powerful independent federal agencies charged with regulating labor relations, employment discrimination and public airwaves. But it has long rankled conservative legal theorists who argue such agencies should answer to the president.

The Justice Department argues Trump can fire board members for any reason as he works to carry out his agenda. “The President and the government suffer irreparable harm when courts transfer even some of that executive power to officers beyond the President’s control,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. Courts have no power to order reinstatement, only back pay, Sauer argued.

But Slaughter’s attorneys say that regulatory decisions will be based more on politics than on board members’ expertise if the president can fire congressionally confirmed board members at will. “If the President is to be given new powers Congress has expressly and repeatedly refused to give him, that decision should come from the people’s elected representatives,” they argued.

“They are human beings worthy of safety, dignity and love, not outsiders to be feared, but neighbors to be embraced,” said the Rev.","Nearly 300 people chanted and sang their way along Prince Avenue to the federal courthouse downtown Sunday afternoon in a protest march and rally against the Trump administration’s mass deportation campaign.

Sponsored by two Athens faith-based organizations, the tone of the protest was not so much political as moral and religious, condemning the crackdown as contradicting the spiritual teachings of the Christian, Jewish and Muslim congregations that form the two groups, the Interfaith Clergy Partnership of Greater Athens and the Interfaith Sanctuary Coalition.

Marchers held hand-drawn signs, chanted slongs like “Hey, ho, hey, ho, ICE has got to go,” and sang familiar protest songs such as “We Shall Overcome” as they made their way up the sidewalk, some using canes, some couples with strollers. Often, passing drivers blew their car horns in support.

Organizers warned the marchers after they had gathered across Prince Avenue from the Clarke County School District headquarters that if they encountered counterprotesters, they should meet them with love, but no counterprotesters materialized.

As they quietly gathered at the courthouse, music minister Tom Eggleston played hymns of his own composition on a portable electric organ set up on the building’s portico.

The Rev. Daryl Bloodsaw, one of the faith leaders who spoke after the long line of protestors had arrived at the federal building, quoted from the Bible: “It has been said, ‘We are commanded to love them as we love ourselves.’”

Bloodsaw is pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church West, a church with a long history of civil rights activism. Ebenezer’s sanctuary is a block away from the development going up at the old Milledge Avenue Varsity site, where Black students picketed the segregated restaurant. The church was at the heart of protests during the 1960s and 1970s, when racial barriers finally came down at the University of Georgia and the Clarke County public schools.

He reminded the gathering of how the Christian Bible instructs the faithful to treat strangers—with welcome and kindness.

“I feel like our democracy is being melted,” Bloodsaw said. Rights guaranteed to all by the Constitution are being eroded, such as the right to due process of law, he said.

“We are called here by our moral values,” said another speaker, the Rev. Pippin Whitaker of the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship. “We are living in a time of spiritual peril,” she said.

Chaplain Shane Sims of Athens Al-Huda Islamic Center told the crowd that immigration is “central” to his faith. “The earliest Muslims were immigrants,” he said.

“We are all beloved children of God,” said Joel Siebentritt, representing the Athens Friends Meeting (Quakers).

“God just made God’s children. It isn’t God’s children and somebody else’s,” said the Rev. Nikki Mathis of St. Gregory the Great Episcopal Church. She encouraged the marchers to “Pray the name, talk the talk and walk the walk.” The abuse of immigrants didn’t just begin in January, but has been going on much longer, she reminded them.

“They are human beings worthy of safety, dignity and love, not outsiders to be feared, but neighbors to be embraced,” said the Rev. Tom Buchanan of Covenant Presbyterian Church.

“This is not justice. It is certainly not the will of God,” Buchanan said.",https://flagpole.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0528-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 23:57:00.975428

Mr. Trump had fired Ms. Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, two Democratic members of the F.T.C., in March. The federal agency, which enforces consumer protection and antitrust laws, typically has five commissioners — three from the president’s party and two from the opposing party.

After their firing, the two commissioners had said they planned to challenge their removal in court, relying on a 1935 landmark Supreme Court case, Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, that also involved the firing of an F.T.C. commissioner.

In its brief order Monday, the court said it would consider in December the broader question of whether to overturn the precedent that has prevented presidents from removing independent regulators without cause and solely over policy disagreements.

The decision by the court’s conservative majority to allow Mr. Trump to remove Ms. Slaughter drew a dissent from the three liberal justices.

The facility is a processing center for people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.
Chicagoans and suburban residents, seeking to resist, have increasingly turned up at the Broadview facility protests.
Friday’s protests saw federal agents attack peaceful protesters, tear gassing them and shooting pepper balls.
“Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the agency.","CHICAGO — Organizers are planning daily protests at the Broadview ICE facility until it shuts down amid the Trump administration’s increased immigration enforcement activity.

Organizers have long held regular protests on Fridays at the facility, 1930 Beach St. in suburban Broadview; but now, they’re calling on demonstrators to join daily protests at 7-9 a.m. and again at 6 p.m.

“Shut down the Broadview ICE facility,” reads an Instagram post announcing the intent to now stage daily protests.

The facility is a processing center for people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Detainees are taken from the facility to detention centers across the United States.

That’s made it a key area as the federal administration has launched two operations — the ICE-led Midway Blitz and Border Patrol-led At Large — aimed at arresting undocumented people in Chicago and across Illinois.

Chicagoans and suburban residents, seeking to resist, have increasingly turned up at the Broadview facility protests. Friday’s protests saw federal agents attack peaceful protesters, tear gassing them and shooting pepper balls.

Over the weekend, there were reports the facility was “evacuating” people or closing entirely. Those are untrue, a Department of Homeland Security leader said in a statement Sunday.

“Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE,” said Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary of the agency. “Since Friday, rioters and sanctuary politicians have obstructed and assaulted law enforcement. These rioters have thrown tear gas cans, rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.

“Secretary Noem’s message to rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”

Federal agents have arrested 16 people connected to the protesters, McLaughlin said.

Last week, four Illinois lawmakers asked top officials at the Department of Homeland Security to disclose how many people have been held at the Broadview Processing Center and describe its conditions, Rep. Jesus “Chuy” Garcia said in a press release last week. Garcia is one of four representatives who ICE denied access to the building after showing up to investigate “inhumane conditions” earlier this summer.

Other Chicago ICE Sightings

Federal agents detained one person in the 2600 block of West 35th Place in Brighton Park, organizers of the Brighton Park Neighborhood Council reported on social media.

Early Monday, organizers and neighbors spotted federal agents wearing black vests that read “police” in Gage Park and Chicago Lawn, including at West 63rd Street and South Kedzie Avenue, West 55th and South Kedzie Avenue and West 63d and South Rockwell Streets, according to a social media alert posted by the Southwest Side Rapid Response team.

Northwest Side organizers said two people were detained by federal agents after receiving suspicious calls asking them to report to 5700 N. Harlem Ave., the Northwest Side Rapid Response Team said on social media. One person was detained Friday after receiving a call asking them to pick up a prize at that site, while another was detained when the person showed up to pick up scrap metal, according to the group. The group is “monitoring” the situation, it said.

At least one person was detained by federal agents Friday in Back of the Yards, near West 46th Street and South Damen Avenue, nonprofit Increase the Peace reported.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a law banning ICE agents and most law enforcement from wearing masks to hide their identities. He says it's the country's first. Trump administration officials say they won't obey it because the state lacks that authority. Gerardo Zavala of CapRadio in Sacramento reports.

GERARDO ZAVALA, BYLINE: Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom signed the new law over the weekend in Los Angeles, the city that has seen an immigration crackdown that he says continues.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

GAVIN NEWSOM: Unmarked cars. People in masks. People quite literally disappearing. No due process. No rights. No rights in a democracy where we have rights. Immigrants have rights.

ZAVALA: The law bars local and federal law enforcement from wearing masks except for things like riot gear and medical masks or when doing undercover work. Newsom also signed laws requiring officers to display their name or badge number and to restrict ICE access to schools and hospitals without warrants.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

NEWSOM: This is about the secret police. We're not North Korea, Mr. President. We're not the Soviet Union. This is the United States of America.

ZAVALA: ICE officials have said their agents face doxing, targeting and threats - something Newsom says are dealt with by laws protecting police. But Bill Essayli, the acting U.S. attorney for the central district of California, said on social media that the new mask law would have no effect on federal operations. Many California law enforcement groups also oppose the law. And Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, who's running for governor, called it reckless while campaigning Friday.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CHAD BIANCO: They didn't ban criminals from wearing masks. They didn't tell criminals that they had to identify themselves. They have a love affair for criminals, and they have an absolute hatred for law enforcement.

ZAVALA: The law could end up in court like other disputes between states and the Trump administration over sanctuary policies and the use of National Guard units. It takes effect next year, and a few other states are considering similar measures.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study published in 2020 found that between 2016 and 2018, ICE detained pregnant women over 4,600 times.
As Congress increased its oversight into the detention of pregnant women, that number dropped to just 158 pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women detained in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024.

SPRINGFIELD – U.S. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined U.S. Senators Patty Murray (D-WA), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and 26 other U.S. Senators to express grave concerns about the prevalence and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention.

In a letter to U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the lawmakers urgently requested that ICE stop detaining pregnant women absent exceptional circumstances, and asked the Department to provide information about the number of pregnant women in its custody and the treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women who are in ICE detention—as well as answers to a long list of additional oversight questions no later than September 26th.

A Government Accountability Office (GAO) study published in 2020 found that between 2016 and 2018, ICE detained pregnant women over 4,600 times. As Congress increased its oversight into the detention of pregnant women, that number dropped to just 158 pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women detained in the first half of Fiscal Year 2024. After President Trump took office this year, the Administration stopped providing reports to Congress on the number of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in their custody.

The Senators wrote: “We write to express grave concerns about the prevalence and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention. A recent Senate Judiciary Committee site visit and media reports point to the alarming detention of a significant number of pregnant women in ICE custody. We urgently request that ICE cease detaining pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women absent exceptional circumstances and that the agency provide information about the number and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in its custody.”

In their letter, the senators referenced reporting on 911 calls recorded from ICE facilities involving pregnant women in “distress, bleeding or suffering severe pain,” as well as a recent Senate Judiciary Committee staff visit to the South Louisiana ICE Processing Center in Basile, LA that found 14 pregnant women—a shockingly large number—detained at the time of the visit, with many of them receiving little to no medical care.

The Senators continued: “Medical research links ICE detention to high rates of pregnancy complications, with physicians finding serious risks to both fetal and maternal health. These already serious risks are heightened by the deteriorating conditions inside detention facilities, including severe overcrowding, reports of inadequate food and water, and lack of emergency medical care. At this time, we do not know how many pregnant women are in ICE custody, whether U.S. citizen babies have been born in ICE custody, and what provisions have been made for mothers’ and children’s health, safety, and wellbeing.”

The Senators concluded: “ICE’s own standards are unambiguous on the detention, monitoring, and treatment of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in detention. ICE Directive 11032.4, Identification and Monitoring of Pregnant, Postpartum, or Nursing Individuals (2021 Pregnancy Directive), states that ICE should not detain pregnant, postpartum, or nursing individuals except under very limited circumstances. If detention of these individuals is deemed absolutely necessary, the directive provides detailed requirements for ensuring that they are monitored closely, kept in suitable facilities, and given access to both routine and emergency health care… Given the urgent nature of pregnant women’s health and safety needs, we request that you ensure all detention facilities are in full compliance with current law and the 2021 Pregnancy Directive.”

“In defiance of medical evidence counseling against their detention, ICE is horrifically detaining pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women in conditions that compromise their physical and mental health. It is clear that ICE is ill-prepared to meet even the minimum healthcare and safety standards for pregnant women in their custody. The National Immigration Law Center calls on Secretary Noem to immediately halt the detention of pregnant, postpartum, and nursing women, resume transparent reporting, and ensure full compliance with federal law and agency directives. The health and dignity of these women must no longer be compromised,” said Jennifer Ibañez Whitlock, Senior Policy Counsel for the National Immigration Law Center.

“U.S. policy makes clear that pregnant, postpartum, and lactating women should not be detained — yet ICE continues to ignore these protections. We continue to hear reports of pregnant women being held in dangerous conditions without adequate food or medical care, putting their health and lives at risk. These harms are occurring in a black box, where we know precious little about immigrant women’s access to healthcare and nutrition. We thank Senators Murray and Blumenthal for demanding that the Department of Homeland Security end this inhumane practice and call for vital transparency around their access to services. Together we must shine a light on detention conditions and ensure these women and their babies are treated with safety, dignity, and humanity,” said Zain Lakhani, Director of Migrant Right and Justice at the Women’s Refugee Commission.

In addition to Durbin, Murray, and Blumenthal, the following 26 senators also signed onto the letter to Secretary Noem: Michael Bennet (D-CO), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NM), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Ben Ray Luján (D-NM), Ed Markey (D-MA), Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Jack Reed (D-RI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Adam Schiff (D-CA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Tina Smith (D-MN), Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Peter Welch (D-VT), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

The full text of the letter is available here.

In July, Durbin released insights from visits to two facilities in Florida, providing new incriminating insight into the cruelty of the illegal Trump mass deportation agenda, including overcrowding, inhumane conditions, no access to medical care, and difficulty accessing legal counsel.

In May, Durbin released insights from visits to two facilities in Louisiana and escalated congressional oversight of the Trump Administration’s aggressive expansion of immigration detention, which has created a major financial boon for private prison companies.

Earlier this year, Durbin released a revealing investigative report on inadequate care in Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities and pressed for further investigation into deficient medical care in CBP detention facilities after whistleblower reports alleged systemic failures by DHS to ensure proper oversight of its medical care contractor.

Durbin continues to actively investigate care in ICE detention facilities, which he initiated with letters to ICE and GAO. A June 2024 report from the American Civil Liberties Union, Physicians for Human Rights, and American Oversight found that 95 percent of documented deaths in ICE custody between 2017-2021 were likely preventable.

This oversight work was prompted by the death of Anadith Danay Reyes Álvarez, an eight-year-old Panamanian girl, at a CBP detention facility in Harlingen, Texas, on May 17, 2023.

Alvarado ICE Detention Center Ambush

What's new:

On Monday, six women were arraigned on charges connected to the ambush-style shooting of an Alvardo police officer at the Prairieland Detention Center on July 4.

They include Savanna Batten, Joy Gibson, Maricela Rueda, Elizabeth Soto, Lynette Sharp, and Rebecca Morgan.

The backstory:

In all, at least 16 people have been charged in the case.

According to the federal complaint, several of the defendants were dressed in black, military-style clothing.

The complaint states that the protestors began shooting fireworks at the detention center. Two people broke off from the main group and began to spray graffiti on vehicles and a guard structure.

Officials believe it was all a ploy to draw ICE detention officers out of the building. Instead, the correctional officers called 911 to report the vandalism.

When the Alvarado police officer arrived, a defendant positioned in the woods shot the officer in the neck. Another assailant across the street fired 20 to 30 rounds at unarmed correctional officers.

Investigators found AR-style rifles at the scene, two-way radios, and a total of 12 sets of body armor after searching the scene and the defendants' cars.

The complaint said the shooters ran away, but law enforcement officers stopped them.

One attacker had cellphones inside a type of bag that blocks cellphone signals.

The complaint called the attack a conspiracy.

What they're saying:

The six defendants’ supporters strongly dispute the conspiracy claim.

They argue the women were there to attend what they thought would be a peaceful protest.

They did not want to make any official statements after Monday’s arraignment but questioned why the hearings were taking place 11 weeks after the arrests.

The court-appointed attorney for the women also did not want to make any statements yet on what happened.

The attorney said the time was not unusual, given that both state and federal agencies are involved.

What's next:

Additional defendants will be arraigned on Tuesday.",https://images.foxtv.com/static.fox4news.com/www.fox4news.com/content/uploads/2025/09/1280/720/5p-head-2-alvarado-ois_00.00.00.58.jpg?ve=1&tl=1,N,,2025-09-22 22:57:03.441368

His wife Leslie Perlera, an attorney, alleged that Escobar's rights were violated during the operation.

Among the protesters were Margo Lindauer, attorney and law professor; Ashley Popperson, associate minister of Old South Church; Malden City Councilors Carey McDonald and Stephen Windslow; Massachusetts State Rep. Steven Ultrino and Maggie Morgan, managing attorney at Legal Services of Greater Boston. They were joined by family members.

“Here’s what I know. I cannot imagine the terror that he felt. I know that there was not a moment that he was alone. Not really. Although the authorities did all they could to keep him separate from his community, they could not get in the way the love that this community has for one another. They do not have that kind of authority. There hasn’t been a time when Hernan felt truly alone because this community has shown up for him,” Popperson told the crowd.

Shortly after, dressed in black and looking exhausted, Escobar's wife addressed the crowd.

“I want to thank everyone who came here today. I'm trying to memorize everyone who's been here so I can tell him when I talk to him later… he's going to feel as loved, as supported, as wanted as I have felt,” his wife said, getting emotional as she then recounted what her life was like with her “husband and best friend.”

According to Perlera and the legal team at Greater Boston Legal Services, the arrest was violent.

""My husband was still sitting inside the car when I arrived. I had the gun in his face; he didn't want to get out, so they broke the window,” she said.

In response, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a statement stating: “Officers took appropriate measures and followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve the situation in a manner that ensured the success of the operation and prioritized the safety of the public and our officers.”

An attorney involved in the case asserted that what happened represents a violation of constitutional rights and warned that ICE is detaining many people who, like Escobar, have no criminal record.

“The only thing I asked them was if they had identification. All I wanted to know was who they were and why they stopped him,” Leslie added.

After the arrest, Edgar was taken by ambulance to a hospital for his injuries and later taken to a detention center in Massachusetts.

“We've been married for almost a year,” Leslie commented, noting that they will celebrate their first anniversary in October. She also stated that Edgar is in the process of adjusting his immigration status to obtain residency.

Gavin Newsom’s unconstitutional mask ban,” DHS said Monday in a post on the social platform X. DHS suggested the masks provide protection for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who have seen a sharp rise in attacks in recent months.

“To be clear: We will NOT comply with [California Gov.] Gavin Newsom’s unconstitutional mask ban,” DHS said Monday in a post on the social platform X.

DHS suggested the masks provide protection for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents, who have seen a sharp rise in attacks in recent months.

“At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signed unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt,” DHS said in a statement.

“That’s Trump’s America, but that’s not the America we’ve grown up in. And so we are pushing back,” the governor said during remarks at a local high school.

The Trump administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration has hit California especially hard, where 27 percent of the residents are born outside the country. DHS has said 5,000 immigrants living in the U.S. illegally were arrested in Los Angeles from June to August.

The https://trumpcard.gov/ website went live with new information, outlining three categories of programs:

The Gold Card: Requires a USD $1 million contribution for permanent residency. The website states that the Gold Card is based on the individual’s ability to substantially benefit the United States. Notably there are no tax provisions; applicants would remain subject to worldwide income taxation.

The Platinum Card: Requires a USD $5 million contribution and allows the holder to reside in the United States for up to 270 days per year without being subject to tax on non-U.S. income. This would replace other temporary visas.

The Trump Corporate Gold Card: Allows a U.S. business to make a USD $2 million contribution to transfer an employee to the United States. This benefit may be transferable to another employee for a fee.

The website states that processing fees and background vetting will occur for all three card types, although no information about the fees or the process has been posted as of the date of this blog. The site also indicates that contributions will be made to the U.S. Department of Commerce, but no information is available about how those funds will be used by the U.S. government. Importantly, this contribution differs from the EB-5 program, where investors may eventually recover their investment funds depending on the success of the business. It also unclear whether the “vetting” will involve a background check, proof of the source of funds ( as required in the EB-5 program), or both. Moreover, there is no mention of dependent applicants or whether family members of the main applicable will receive benefits under the program.

Of particular interest is a statement on the website that a Gold Card will be either an EB-1 or EB-2 preference green card. These categories, and their underlying subcategories of permanent residence, are statutorily authorized by Congress and have specific visa number allocations. It is possible this designation could be challenged in court as outside the authority of the Executive Branch. Additionally, applicants born in Mainland China and India may face significant visa backlogs, as these delays already exist in the EB-1 and EB-2 preference categories.

At this time, it is unknown when the fees or application instructions will be released to the public. Based on the lack of information regarding requirements, fees, process, and timelines, it does not appear that applicants can apply yet.",https://www.eb5insights.com/files/2025/09/gold-card-Shutterstock_2278262673.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 21:57:18.208508

Detainee hospitalized over self-harm incident Several immigrant rights advocates raised alarm about a detainee inside the California City detention center whom they said attempted to take his own life.","Detainees inside California’s largest immigration detention center are being placed in solitary confinement, experiencing delays in medical care, and facing retaliation from officers for protesting “inhumane” conditions, two detainees told The Fresno Bee.

The detainees are among the 500 or so who’ve been transferred to the newly opened California City Immigration Processing Center, a 2,560-bed U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement detention facility about 70 miles east of Bakersfield.

“The living conditions are inhumane. We have all kinds of health hazards. It’s dirty, they don’t clean up or have any chemicals to clean. It’s unsanitary,” Sokhean Keo, a detainee who was transferred to the facility this month, told a Bee reporter in a phone interview.

Conditions at the 70-acre facility in the Kern County desert have been scrutinized by immigrant rights advocates since Tennessee-based private prison operator CoreCivic began housing undocumented immigrants there in late August.

Kern County-based immigrant rights advocates raised alarm regarding a detainee who was hospitalized this month after he attempted to take his own life. Detainees accuse facility staff of withholding medication.

Last Thursday, more than 100 detained individuals staged sit-ins and refused meals across several housing pods at the sprawling facility in protest over what they describe as widespread poor living conditions, according to the California Collaborative for Immigrant Justice, a Bay Area-based legal aid nonprofit for undocumented immigrants.

One detainee told The Bee that immigrants have been placed on 17-hour lockdowns and pepper-sprayed for participating in the sit-ins.

Attorneys for the nonprofit spoke with California City detainees who alleged officers in riot gear threatened use of force against detainees who participated in a sit-in and placed at least one housing unit on a multi-day lockdown without access to telephones. Immigrants at the facility told the nonprofit that four detainees were handcuffed and placed in solitary confinement, and one person was denied toilet paper by a CoreCivic officer for participating in a hunger strike.

In an email to The Bee, CoreCivic denied the accusations of unsanitary conditions and mistreatment of detainees. The operator said all detainees receive clothing, bedding and toiletries at no cost and have access to medical care and legal resources.

“No detainee has faced prolonged lockdowns of 17 hours or more or have been pepper sprayed for acts of disobedience,” said Brian Todd, a CoreCivic spokesperson.

“CoreCivic takes seriously our obligation to adhere to all applicable federal standards in all our federally contracted facilities, including our California City Correctional Facility (CCCF). All our facilities operate with a significant amount of oversight and accountability, including being monitored by federal officials on a daily basis, to ensure an appropriate standard of living and care for every individual.”

Detainee says he was threatened with solitary confinement

One of the detainees who spoke with The Bee said he was threatened with solitary confinement the day he was transferred to the California City detention center.

Sokhean Keo was transferred from the Mesa Verde ICE Processing Center in Bakersfield to the California City facility in early September and has been in ICE detention since January 2023. Keo, an immigrant from Cambodia, said he served time in prison for a “mistake” he made when he was 20 years old and had earned his release in 2023 before ICE agents detained him.

On his first day inside the California City facility, Keo said correctional officers forced him and others to take off their shirts and took pictures of their tattoos. Officers threatened to take Keo to “the hole,” or solitary confinement, unless he admitted to being affiliated with gangs, which he said he is not. Personnel withheld his medication for several days, he said.

“I don’t understand why we’re being threatened for not answering them,” Keo said. “I feel like giving up. There’s no hope for me anymore. Every day I wake up, I’m just sad. It’s horrible.”

The use of solitary confinement in immigration detention has grown exponentially under the second Trump administration, according to a report published Wednesday by the nonprofit group Physicians for Human Rights.

The sit-ins and meal refusals at California City mirror a broader wave of protests across immigration facilities in California, where an estimated 3,727 undocumented people are under ICE detention, according to a recent analysis of ICE data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. This data does not reflect the current detainee population at California City.

From Adelanto to Mesa Verde and the Golden State Annex, the hunger strikes have been part of a pattern of detainee protests over accusations of inadequate food, facilities and medical care in recent years.

A detainee who identified herself as Loba was detained in January 2024 and held at the Golden State Annex, an ICE facility in McFarland, before her transfer to California City in late August.

Loba said detainees in her dorm have been placed on lockdowns for more than 17 hours, in which they weren’t allowed to leave their sleeping quarters, pepper sprayed and prohibited from participating in Thursday’s sit-ins.

Loba also described severe issues inside the facility, including leaking pipes that flooded cells, food that was water-soaked, and poor food handling and sanitation practices, such as staff not using gloves or hair nets and failing to accommodate people with food allergies.

“It’s already been more than 20 days since I arrived here, and I still haven’t received my psychiatric medication,” she said. “It’s very traumatizing. We’re being locked in for more than a third of the day.”

Todd, the CoreCivic spokesperson, said the facility was impacted by the heavy rains and flash flooding Thursday after remnants of a tropical storm descended on southern California. CoreCivic informed ICE of the situation, and maintenance staff worked to mitigate rising water levels outside the facility and removed any water that seeped into the facility, Todd said.

“No detainees were required to be moved from their assigned living areas during our response,” he said.

ICE did not respond to requests for comment. CoreCivic did not immediately address the allegations of solitary confinement.

Detainee hospitalized over self-harm incident

Several immigrant rights advocates raised alarm about a detainee inside the California City detention center whom they said attempted to take his own life.

Jeannie Parent, a coordinator with Kern Welcoming and Extending Solidarity to Immigrants, said one of her volunteers spoke with a detainee who said someone tried to take their own life.

The details weren’t immediately clear. CoreCivic confirmed to The Bee that there was an incident of self-harm.

In a Sept. 11 statement, Ryan Gustin, senior director of public affairs for CoreCivic, said that on the morning of Tuesday, Sept. 9, a staff member called a medical emergency “after finding an individual inside of his living area who was observed trying to harm himself.”

The responding staff called for emergency medical services to respond to the facility, who transported the individual to a local hospital for assessment and possible treatment.

“Our government partners at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) were notified immediately of this incident,” Gustin said.

California City mayor says conditions are humane

California City Mayor Marquette Hawkins toured the ICE detention facility on Sept. 9 in what he described as an “oversight assessment.”

Detainees had access to dental, medical, psychiatric care, he said. He also said detainees wear either blue or brown uniforms, depending on whether they have a prior criminal conviction.

He said the conditions there appeared to be humane.

Hawkins acknowledged that the facility opened without the proper city permits and that the legal team is looking into levying daily fines.

“We are exploring all options related to CoreCivic not being in compliance with municipal code,” Hawkins said. “As a city, we have to respond to that.”

He also said he spoke with a representative from California Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office last week regarding the ICE detention facility “and other matters.”

Hawkins expects to receive an update from the city’s legal team at Tuesday’s California City Council meeting.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/latest-news/mapy3x/picture310416005/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/California%20City%20Correctional%20Facility%20-%20Lead%20Art.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 19:57:21.758204

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Guevara on June 18.","Free press advocates and lawyers for metro Atlanta journalist Mario Guevara are fighting to keep him in the United States after the Board of Immigration Appeals last week ordered he be deported to his native El Salvador.

Why it matters: Monday marked roughly 100 days since Guevara, a prominent Spanish-speaking journalist who founded digital media outlet MG News, was arrested while reporting at a protest in DeKalb County.

Driving the news: The ACLU of Georgia said it filed a temporary restraining order to halt the Board of Immigration Appeals' ruling Friday that Guevara must be returned to El Salvador.

The ACLU told Axios in a statement that it's concerned Guevara ""could be removed at any time because he remains in detention.""

What they're saying: Nora Benavidez, senior counsel and director of Digital Justice and Civil Rights at Free Press, an advocacy organization, said a coalition of over 25 human rights and press freedom groups is calling for Guevara's release.

Guevara is believed to be the only journalist who has been detained by ICE in the U.S. in connection with his work.

Benavidez said the government has tried to portray Guevara's activities ""as somehow dangerous, criminal or illegal.""

""It's really a case about this journalist who was … targeted because of his filming of police and ICE,"" Benavidez said. ""And so it feels like it's part of a much broader censorship regime that we're seeing.""

State of play: Guevara wrote in a letter published Monday on MG News' website that his arrest and ongoing detention have crushed his dignity ""because I've been humiliated by both federal and local authorities, and I don't believe I deserve it.""

""Life isn't always fair,"" Guevara wrote. ""If I'm deported, I'll leave with my head held high, because I'm convinced it's for carrying out my journalistic work, not for committing crimes.""

Catch up quick: After his June 14 arrest, federal immigration officials placed a hold on his detention at the DeKalb County Jail, meaning they would take him into custody upon his release.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained Guevara on June 18.

The fine print: Guevara has lived in the U.S. since 2004 and has three children. Two are U.S. citizens, and one requires long-term medical care.

Guevara was authorized to work in the country and was in the process of obtaining his green card when he was arrested, his attorney said.

In the alleged scheme, Homan promised immigration-related government contracts when he joined the Trump administration in exchange for the money, according to unnamed sources quoted by multiple media outlets.
At a press briefing on Monday, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Homan had accepted such a payment.
“Mr Homan never took the $50,000 you’re referring to, so you should get your facts straight,” she told one reporter.
She insisted that FBI agents and prosecutors found no evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing by the border czar.","Democrats have urged treasury watchdogs to investigate reports that Donald Trump’s border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 bag of cash from an undercover FBI agent in return for political favours.

In the alleged scheme, Homan promised immigration-related government contracts when he joined the Trump administration in exchange for the money, according to unnamed sources quoted by multiple media outlets. The justice department subsequently shut down a bribery investigation.

On Monday, Congressman Dave Min of California, a member of the House of Representatives oversight committee, wrote to treasury inspector general Russell George and treasury inspector general for tax administration Russell Martin to call for scrutiny of whether Homan reported the payment and whether it was connected to his private consulting firm.

“History suggests that we should follow the money – especially if it went unreported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS),” wrote Min, chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus’s Fighting Corruption Taskforce. “Under federal law, all income, legal or illegal, must be reported to the IRS, including payments stemming from bribery.

“Knowingly failing to report this income would likely violate federal tax law. Accordingly, I request that your offices investigate whether Mr Homan properly reported this payment on his 2024 federal tax return.”

Homan oversees the Trump administration’s campaign of mass deportations of people in the country illegally. An unapologetic immigration hardliner, he explained a decision to defy a court order that barred the deportation of alleged Venezuelan gang members by stating: “I don’t care what the judges think.”

Homan was previously an official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) under Barack Obama and its acting director in Trump’s first term. During Trump’s four years out of power, he ran a consulting business to help companies obtain immigration-related government contracts.

In the recorded sting operation, Homan accepted a $50,000 bribe contained in a bag from the restaurant chain Cava, claiming he would keep the money in a trust until he had completed his service in the Trump administration, a source told the Reuters news agency.

Homan was then investigated for bribery and other crimes but this was shut down after Trump took office, reportedly because he did not hold a government position at the time and because of the difficulty of proving that he had agreed to carry out any specific acts in exchange for the money.

At a press briefing on Monday, the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt denied that Homan had accepted such a payment. “Mr Homan never took the $50,000 you’re referring to, so you should get your facts straight,” she told one reporter.

“The White House and the president stand by Tom Homan 100% because he did absolutely nothing wrong,” Leavitt added. She insisted that FBI agents and prosecutors found no evidence of illegal activity or criminal wrongdoing by the border czar.

But Carol Leonnig, one of the MSNBC journalists who broke the story, responded on social media: “White House spokesperson says that Homan never took $50,000; we reviewed internal document saying Homan accepted the cash payment from undercover FBI agents in September 2024.”

Political pressure on Homan is mounting. On Sunday Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator for Massachusetts, posted on the X platform: “The act was caught on camera. The administration must turn over the tapes to Congress. Every decision made by Homan must be scrutinized for possible corruption.”

Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut added on Monday: “$50,000 cash in a bag – clearly Border Czar Tom Homan isn’t afraid to solicit personal payments in exchange for government favors. Trump leaders aren’t serving the country – they’re failing it, putting personal profit first. Another example of rampant corruption in this admin.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac9aaf9b2451a8ec78befb78e892d5c295e4df3f/730_0_5706_4565/master/5706.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=066d2b8113391f95556a467bf4537b55",N,,2025-09-22 17:56:51.851117

The court’s 6-3 decision is the court’s strongest signal yet that it may overturn Humphrey’s Executor v. U.S., a 90-year-old ruling that until recently largely protected independent agencies from undue political interference stemming from the White House.

In addition to granting Trump’s request to a stay lower court ruling reinstating FTC Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter, the court also said it will hear oral arguments in December on officially overturning Humphrey’s.

The majority did not offer a legal explanation in exempting Trump from standing court precedent.

Justice Elena Kagan, in a dissenting opinion joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, heavily rebuked the court for granting the stay while Humphrey’s remained precedent.

“The President cannot, as he concededly did here, fire an FTC Commissioner without any reason,” Kagan wrote. “To reach a different result requires reversing the rule stated in Humphrey’s: It entails overriding rather than accepting Congress’s judgment about agency design.”

“The majority may be raring to take that action, as its grant of certiorari before judgment suggests. But until the deed is done, Humphrey controls, and prevents the majority from giving the President the unlimited removal power Congress denied him.”

In her dissent, Kagan also echoed complaints and frustrations that several federal judges have raised about the majority’s use of the court’s emergency — or “shadow” — docket.

Dozens of times now, the court has granted the president broad exemptions from normal legal and legislative procedures and given him extraordinary control over the executive branch — often without detailing their reasoning.

These consequential emergency rulings have often left lower court judges in a bind, not knowing whether they should follow formal court precedent or the majority’s shadow docket orders — which are not binding legal precedent.

“Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars,” Kagan wrote. “Still more, it should not be used, as it also has been, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President, and thus to reshape the Nation’s separation of powers.”

For 45 years, the U.S. Catholic Church has celebrated National Migration Week, which has traditionally been linked to the Vatican’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees (WDMR), as an opportunity for the Church to reflect on the circumstances confronting migrants and to engage in prayer and action for those who are forced to flee their homes. In solidarity with the Vatican, National Migration Week will use the theme chosen by Pope Leo XIV of “Migrants, missionaries of hope.”

WDMR typically occurs on the last Sunday of September, however, this year it will take place on Oct. 4-5 to coincide with the Jubilee of Migrants that will include meetings and festivities in the presence of the Holy Father. On Oct. 5 at 10:30 a.m. (Rome time), Pope Leo XIV will celebrate Mass for the Jubilee of the Missionary World and the Jubilee of Migrants at the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls.

“As Pope Leo’s theme of ‘Migrants, missionaries of hope’ reminds us, our migrant brothers and sisters are not strangers; they are family in Christ,” said Cardinal Blase J. Cupich, archbishop of Chicago. “They enrich our Church and serve as a reminder that the gospel knows no borders and that God’s love is for all people.”

National Migration Week culminates locally on Sunday, Sept. 28, 2025, with a 5:15 p.m. Mass at Holy Name Cathedral, 735 N. State St., Chicago. Bishop Lawrence J. Sullivan, vicar general of the Archdiocese of Chicago, will preside over the Mass that will begin with a procession of nations representing 15 countries and feature readings and prayers in nine languages including English, Spanish, Polish, Italian, Swahili, Filipino, Bahasa (a language spoken in Indonesia), Luganda (a language spoken in central Uganda) and Vietnamese. A parishioner of St. Anne Parish in Barrington will offer a testimony of the collaborative immigrant ministry with Holy Family Parish in Inverness.

The Archdiocese of Chicago’s National Pastoral Migratoria (Immigrant Social Ministry) has coordinated a comprehensive effort with other U.S. dioceses which have Pastoral Migratoria to raise awareness about National Migration Week. In the dioceses of New York, Newark , Baltimore, Orange, Calif., Stockton, Calif. and Joliet, Ill., Pastoral Migratoria leaders are coordinating rosaries, legal clinics, health fairs, holy hours, forums, and other events to support the immigrant community. The dioceses of Los Angeles, Newark and Washington, D.C., will hold Masses in observance of National Migration Week.

In his message for the 111th World Day of Migrants and Refugees 2025, Pope Leo XIV said the observance offers us an opportunity to reflect on the connections between hope, migration and mission. The Holy Father said in part, “In a world darkened by war and injustice, even when all seems lost, migrants and refugees stand as messengers of hope. Their courage and tenacity bear heroic testimony to a faith that sees beyond what our eyes can see and gives them the strength to defy death on the various contemporary migration routes.”

WASHINGTON — The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) vehemently condemns California Governor Gavin Newsom for signing the “No Secret Police Act,” which further demonizes law enforcement and attempts to ban law enforcement from being able to protect their identities to keep them from being targeted by cartels, criminal rings, terrorists, and doxxed online.

This stunt comes as our ICE officers are facing a more than 1000% increase in assaults against them, including vehicles being used as weapons towards them, and doxing campaigns targeting federal officers and their families. When our heroic law enforcement officers conduct operations, they clearly identify themselves as law enforcement while wearing masks to protect themselves from being targeted by highly sophisticated gangs like Tren de Aragua and MS-13, criminal rings, murderers, and rapists. Our officers also wear vests marked with ICE/ERO or Homeland Security and are flanked by vehicles marked with the name of the department.

“Governor Gavin Newsom is fanning the flames of division, hatred and dehumanization of our law enforcement. At a time that ICE law enforcement faces a 1,000% increase in assaults and their family members are being doxxed and targeted, the sitting Governor of California signs unconstitutional legislation that strips law enforcement of protections in a disgusting, diabolical fundraising and PR stunt,” said Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin. “He signed this piece of legislation the same day his team made a menacing threat against Secretary Kristi Noem online. The violent rhetoric and demonization must stop. To be crystal clear: we will not abide by Newsom’s unconstitutional ban.”

Despite these obstacles from Governor Newsom, ICE continues to put the safety of Californians first and remove violent criminal illegal aliens from the streets of California. Below are examples of some of the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens arrested in California since January 20, 2025, who Governor Newsom’s sanctuary policies protect at the expense of the American people:

In response to the protests, President Donald Trump later deployed approximately 4,000 National Guard troops to the city without the consent of Gov. Gavin Newsom.

Later, 700 active-duty Marines were sent to the region. A small number of troops remain stationed in the city.

Trump has defended the deployment, saying he “saved” Los Angeles after the Supreme Court cleared the way for federal agents to continue conducting sweeping immigration raids in Los Angeles by lifting a restraining order from a judge who found “roving patrols” were leading to indiscriminate arrests.

A US State Department “concept note” for the event outlines an approach that seems determined to run roughshod over the rights of refugees.

This is happening parallel to an executive order that requires a national-interests review of all conventions and treaties the United States has joined.

Alarmingly, the US State Department’s list of the “core principles” in its concept note fails to include the principle of nonrefoulement, which holds that refugees cannot be returned to places where they would likely be persecuted, the foundation of the global refugee system.

The note asserts that “every nation has the absolute right to control its borders.” While international law is highly deferential to states in controlling their borders, the principle of nonrefoulement maintains that states don’t have unfettered discretion to push people away.

Everyone’s right “to seek and enjoy asylum in other countries from persecution” is the flip side of nonrefoulement. If countries are prohibited from sending someone to a place where they would be tortured or persecuted, they need to afford them a way to secure protection.

The US concept note contends that “asylum is a temporary, not permanent, status, and that asylees should ultimately return home.” But in reality, that depends on the home country situation. If the threats and harm that caused someone to flee their country are unchanged, or get worse, sending them back is not an option.

The note also asserts that “sovereign states, not transnational bodies, make the determination whether conditions in a country of origin permit return.” True, but in making refugee determinations in good faith, states should respect assessments by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, whose determinations are guided by its mandate, whereas states often have conflicting interests.",https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/styles/opengraph/public/media_2025/09/202509afr_libya_coast_guard_interception.jpg?h=53227e21&itok=sw49CGoq,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:10.659203

(WPVI) -- A Chester County man is facing human trafficking charges after being accused of forcing two young immigrant girls to work for him, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office announced on Monday.

Officials say Ramiro Caal Jolomana forced the juvenile girls, ages 14 and 17, to work on a mushroom farm, with little compensation, while threatening to have them punished or deported if they strayed from him.

Investigators say the girls were allegedly being charged for ""debts"" after being brought into the U.S. by Jolomana.

Founded in 2023, Wasatch Immigration Project said it quickly saw demand for legal assistance exceed the service capacity of its four part-time volunteer attorneys. The project opened its Park City office in June 2024 and, in its first full year of operation, represented 266 clients and filed over 350 applications or other legal forms. The firm ended 2024 with over 150 people on its wait list and said it saw a surge in need in early 2025 due to changes to immigration policy and enforcement.

“It is a scary time for many members of our community who are trying to navigate the immigration system,” said Maggie AbuHaidar, executive director and one of the firm’s volunteer attorneys. “In order to reach more people, more quickly, we have been working hard to raise the funds needed to grow our legal team.”

With individual donations and grants from the Utah Bar Foundation and Park City Community Foundation, the firm hired its first full-time attorney, Laura Rojas, in March. Although Laura has helped the team put procedures in place to reduce its waitlist, many individuals and families who live and work in the Wasatch Back are still waiting to be seen — and many more call every day asking for help, the firm said.

“With generous support from community members, a special service contract from Park City, and recent grants from the Women’s Giving Fund, the Marriott Daughters Foundation, and the Promontory Foundation, we have now expanded our legal team again with the hire of two new full-time attorneys, Jessica Hamilton and Kaite Hogan,” said AbuHaidar.

Hamilton and Hogan both graduated from the S.J. Quinney College of Law at the University of Utah in May and sat for the Utah Bar exam in July. They both learned that they passed the Bar just last week.

After graduating from the University of Kansas, Hamilton spent two years in Washington, D.C. working for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, a nonprofit that provides pro bono legal services to undocumented minors in detention. For two years during law school, she directed the Pro Bono Initiative Immigration Clinic, a monthly legal clinic staffed by Utah attorneys to provide pro bono legal advice to immigrants. Hamilton was recently profiled by the law school for her work in expanding access to justice.

“As someone deeply committed to immigrant justice,” Hamilton said, “I’m honored to join the (Wasatch Immigration Project) team and stand with families in the Wasatch Back as they navigate the complex immigration system. I look forward to helping (Wasatch Immigration Project) expand its capacity so that even more families can access the legal support and representation they deserve.”

Hailing from Washington state, Hogan graduated from Utah State University before attending law school. She focused her law school studies on immigration law, completing multiple intern placements with renowned local immigration law firms and nonprofits, including Gardner & Taylor, Stowell Crayk, Catholic Community Services, and No Mas. Just prior to graduation, the law school’s alumni honored Hogan with its Outstanding 3L Colleague Award.

When asked why she chose to focus on immigration law, Hogan said, “It is to the detriment of our society to ignore the plight of a minority for the easy routine of the majority.”

Working for Wasatch Immigration Project was the “right fit” for her, she said, because “the organization has chosen to support all members of our community and make the continual effort to uphold basic human rights.”

“Kaite and Jessica are joining WIP with a demonstrated passion for the work we do and the clients we serve, as well as a level of practical experience unusual for recent law school grads,” AbuHaidar explained, adding, “So, they will be able to hit the ground running, which is good, because running is all we have been doing since January.”

In addition to hiring two new Staff Attorneys, WIP hired its first full-time paralegal, Yoselyn Monsalve, in May and added a part-time paralegal, Santiago Carvajal, in August. Both law school graduates in their countries of origin, Monsalve and Carvajal are unable to practice law in the United States, but are “contributing a wealth of knowledge, experience,

perspective, energy, and compassion to WIP’s legal team,” said AbuHaidar.

With these new hires over the last six months, WIP has transitioned from a nearly all volunteer-driven organization to an established non-profit law firm. “Once we understood the need in the community, the transition was necessary to make the organization as sustainable as possible,” said John Sharkey, WIP Board Chair and one of the firm’s volunteer attorneys. AbuHaidar added, “Frankly, it is hard to imagine how we were functioning before expanding our team. And we could not have done any of this without the overwhelming support of the Park City community.”

Uncle Sam asking you to defend the homeland.

Others reference a glorified version of the past. White settlers traveling across the planes toward their Manifest Destiny as Native Americans retreat to the shadows.

These are the words and images the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is using to recruit more than 10,000 Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents by the end of the year, which would make it the largest law enforcement agency in the federal government. DHS is also offering signing bonuses of $50,000, student loan repayment and starting salaries as high as $80,000.

These posts have millions of views on social media platforms like X. Experts who study extremist groups are flagging them as dangerous.

Pete Simi is a sociologist at Chapman University who has been studying extremist groups and violence for more than 25 years.

“Propaganda is an art,” he said. “It’s a very powerful way of communicating and it typically obscures the truth. When it’s done effectively, it makes it hard to call it out.”

Ambiguity plays a major role in white supremacist messaging because it allows whoever posts hateful rhetoric to hide behind plausible deniability, Simi said.

Coded language

Simi went on to say that someone who isn’t versed in far-right extremist culture will see an image of Uncle Sam and won’t think twice about it. But the posts DHS is using to recruit ICE agents can be interpreted through a white nationalist lens.

For example, the caption on the post showing settlers expanding westward, the words heritage and homeland are capitalized.

“In white supremacist circles, H.H. stands for Heil Hitler,” Simi said.

Also, the caption contains exactly 14 words, which is a symbolically significant number for people who follow that ideology.

White nationalists use messaging with 14 words as a hidden reference to a famous phrase from the 1980s: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”

“It became one of the most central slogans among white supremacists,” Simi said. “They reference it in everything from tattoos, to t-shirts, to emails. It’s just ubiquitous among these folks.”

ICE did not respond to questions from KPBS about the agency’s recruitment efforts and concerns raised by experts like Simi.

Because ambiguity is such a big part of extremist communications, the messages can be interpreted in a variety of ways, Simi said. Whoever posted the image can simply say people are overreacting — it’s just an old painting with a caption that happens to have 14 words.

Which means academics or members of the media cannot say for sure whether something is explicitly supporting extremist ideology.

“Unless you’re able to find the person who created that post and they were to admit that this was intentional, it’s hard to ever definitively say,” Simi said.

Cautionary tale

Historically, the federal government has struggled with rapid expansions to law enforcement agencies.

In the mid-2000s, when Customs and Border Protection’s (CBP) workforce grew by 20,000, anti-corruption measures took a back seat to the hiring spree, according to a 2012 report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO).

At the time, agency policy required every employee to undergo an internal affairs review every five years to ensure they were still fit for service.

But CBP employees responsible for those reviews said they conducted ""few periodic reinvestigations during fiscal years 2006 to 2010 because resources were focused on meeting mandated hiring goals,” according to the report.

By 2010, the agency had a backlog of 15,000 investigations, according to the report.

During the hiring binge , criminal organizations like drug cartels tried to infiltrate the agency. The 2012 report also notes that corruption convictions among CBP agents increased during that time.

ICE did not respond to questions asking what measure they have in place to ensure standards do not drop during the current expansion.

A change in standards

ICE’s current expansion comes at a unique time for the agency, according to experts like Allie Preston, who studies law enforcement as a senior policy analyst for the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank.

“It has turned into a militarized, authoritarian form of policing and I really think it will damage this institution’s ability to continue,” Preston said.

While polling shows there is broad support for arresting and deporting immigrants convicted of violent crime, there is significantly less support for masked agents stopping anyone they suspect of being in the country illegally — even if they have no criminal record.

As part of her research, Preston regularly interviews retired local and federal police officers. Lately, they’ve told her that ICE’s aggressive enforcement tactics are eroding trust between communities and law enforcement.

“They say this is undermining the work of local law enforcement who, in many cases, have had to work really hard to build trust in their communities,” she said.

In addition to the deteriorating trust, Preston is also concerned about the fact that ICE has already lowered hiring, training and oversight standards.

The agency waived age restrictions that previously required applicants to be older than 21 and younger than 37 or 40 depending on the role. DHS officials also cut down ICE’s 18-week training course to eight weeks, and waived Spanish-language requirements, vehicle pursuit courses and other training.

In March, the Trump administration cut staff to DHS’s Office of Civil Liberties and Civil Affairs — which investigated civil rights complaints filed by the public related to DHS and ICE enforcement.

“In light of everything that’s happened, it’s really like a perfect storm of different circumstances that are making policing more dangerous for communities and really undermining the roles that they are supposed to be playing,” Preston said.",https://cdn.kpbs.org/dims4/default/6c44b3d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+725/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkpbs-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F71%2Fb3%2Fdca601b94a6fa0fe12809c9a6932%2Funclesam.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:28.159556

UN Member States, the UN itself, civil society around the world and in the United States, and U.S. leaders who understand the essential role of human rights and the rule of law have a critical role to play in standing up for multilateral human rights, humanitarian, and refugee treaties that protect the human rights of people everywhere.

In the wake of an executive order issued in February, the Trump administration has conducted a “review” to determine “which organizations, conventions, and treaties are contrary to the interests of the United States and whether such organizations, conventions, or treaties can be reformed.” That order also stated that the U.S. would not participate in the UN Human Rights Council, would not fund UNRWA, and would review membership in UNESCO, from which it subsequently withdrew. Among the many treaties that the U.S. has ratified or signed are core multilateral human rights, humanitarian, and refugee treaties. While the order called for review within 180 days, the results of the review—if indeed it is finalized—have not been publicly reported.

In August 2025, the United States decided to refuse to participate in its own Universal Periodic Review (UPR) before the UN Human Rights Council, an unprecedented and damaging step to human rights accountability. On September 12, 2025, Reuters reported that the Trump administration is trying to enlist UN Member states in an effort to undo legal norms and agreements that protect refugees from persecution, and plans an event during the UN General Assembly to advance its efforts. The report also indicated that there had been no signs of broad support for the plan. Trump administration nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration testified on September 11 that he would seek to work with other countries to build support for “reform” of international agreements and norms on migration.

True reform does not tear down multilateral international treaties and endanger human lives. Indeed, the Trump administration’s plan for refugees fleeing persecution appears designed to abandon refugees to persecution. Whatever label is slapped on the initiative, the reality is that the Trump administration approach is to cut aid and resettlement that helps other countries host refugees, block people seeking refuge from U.S. asylum, end temporary protections despite ongoing dangers, and subject people seeking U.S. asylum to enforced disappearances, refoulement to torture and persecution, family separations, due process denials, and arbitrary detention in horrible conditions. While banning refugees from resettlement, the administration is ramping up efforts to resettle white Afrikaners. This right-violating approach should not be exported to other countries.

Policies and systems can be strengthened through genuine reforms that adhere to the law and protect lives. By contrast, steps towards undermining or withdrawing from refugee, human rights, and/or humanitarian treaties would threaten the human rights and safety of people around the world and undermine international law, stability, peace, and prosperity.

Citizen men appear to be the ones posing as ICE to assault immigrant women.","In July, President Trump and Congressional Republicans rammed through a sweeping budget bill that invests over $100 billion in ICE and border enforcement. In recent months, ICE agents — often masked, wearing plain clothes, and without anything to outwardly identify them as agents — have escalated their campaign of terror on immigrant communities at the direction of this administration, worsened after Trump rescinded policies that once restricted immigration enforcement in locations like domestic violence shelters, hospitals, and churches. Predictably, all of this has resulted in chaos and devastating state-inflicted violence — and a chilling rise in civilian violence against women.

A letter from the Democratic Women’s Caucus (DWC) addressed to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump administration officials, which was shared with HuffPost, alleges that civilian men are impersonating ICE agents to kidnap and sexually assault immigrant women. It wouldn’t be difficult to do as ICE agents increasingly wear plain clothes, conceal their faces to avoid accountability, and are not required to wear paraphernalia to identify themselves as officers. ICE has also directed its agents to detain undocumented people they encounter incidentally, even if the agents don’t have an arrest warrant.

The allegations are horrifying: A North Carolina man has been accused of posing as an ICE agent, threatening to deport an immigrant woman, then kidnapping and raping her; police in New York are searching for a man suspected of posing as an ICE agent, assaulting and trying to rape a woman, before robbing her and fleeing the scene in broad daylight.

“All our lives, we are taught to fear masked men in unmarked vehicles,” the DWC wrote in an August letter to the administration. “We learn we should run from such men to avoid being kidnapped, sexually assaulted, or killed. Yet, ICE is increasingly conducting raids and arrests in masks, plain clothes, without visible identification or badges, using unmarked vehicles — tactics that cause confusion, terror, and mistrust among the public.”

Lawmakers in the California legislature and in Congress have introduced legislation to address horrific scenarios like these, by requiring ICE agents to have proper identification and prohibit them from covering their faces. This could be a step in the right direction.

But we can’t bury the deeper, driving forces behind why this is happening. This phenomenon is only possible because of the outsized power that state agents — ICE, police officers, prison staff — have always had to abuse and control women and victims' bodies. Civilians are impersonating state agents to assault vulnerable women and victims because state agents — under every presidential administration — have always been able to do this.

The reason civilians would even think to pose as state agents to get away with sexual violence is that, nationwide, state power in a range of forms is routinely wielded to perpetrate gender-based violence. Unmasking ICE agents is important, but it’s a Band-Aid on a broader, systemic crisis.

Sexual abuse, often inflicted on children, is rampant across the immigrant detainment system. In one survey, 40% of police officers self-reported acting violently toward their spouses or children, and 60% of prison rapes are committed by guards and staff.

Sexual assault is the second-most common form of police misconduct, according to one study. From 2013 to 2014, an Oklahoma City police officer, Daniel Holtzclaw, was accused by 13 Black women of exploiting his state power to sexually abuse them. (Holtzclaw was ultimately convicted of assaulting eight of those women, and sentenced to 263 years in prison.) Over the last decade, cops in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, and other states have similarly been ousted after being accused by local women of stalking or harassment.

It wasn’t until 2022 that Congress passed the Closing the Law Enforcement Consent Loophole Act, ending a practice that previously allowed cops to defend themselves from allegations of sexually abusing people in their custody by claiming the encounter was consensual — which, some legal experts have argued, is impossible due to the massive power disparity between a state agent and a detainee. BuzzFeed reported in 2018 that 35 states have no laws to prohibit supposedly “consensual” sex between police officers and a person in custody.

All too often the government and legal system enact violence on victims while protecting assailants, which amounts to state violence: In one survey, about a quarter of victims who called 911 due to a domestic violence incident reported being arrested or threatened with arrest themselves. It is estimated that just 3% of rapists will ever spend a day in prison, while a 1999 survey of a women's maximum security prison in New York found that 90% of incarcerated women were survivors.

Outside of directly carceral contexts, just look at abortion bans, which grant lawmakers sweeping access to and power over our bodies. In 2020, a whistleblower alleged that a doctor at an immigrant detainment center had nonconsensually sterilized women; ultimately over 40 women claimed that they’d been subjected to invasive medical procedures while in ICE custody.

To be clear, men wouldn’t be posing as ICE agents and assaulting women if ICE didn’t exist. Its very existence — and the vile policing of immigrants in this nation altogether — dehumanizes immigrants and renders them exponentially more vulnerable to a range of violent acts, including gender-based violence.

Laws like the Laken Riley Act — which subject any undocumented immigrant who is merely accused of one of several crimes such as shoplifting to potential, indefinite detainment — are devastating for immigrant domestic violence victims, whose abusers or traffickers can potentially threaten to report them for made-up crimes if they don’t comply, experts have warned.

The Preventing Violence Against Women by Illegal Aliens Act, introduced in January, would similarly render immigrant abuse victims exponentially more vulnerable to detainment, should their abusers wield the common abusive tactic DARVO (Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim-Offender) to accuse them of abuse.

These pieces of legislation rely on white supremacist tropes that portray immigrant men and men of color as predatory and violent toward white American women. There is no crime statistic that could ever justify this nation’s shameful treatment of immigrants — and, that said, US citizens are substantially more likely to be the perpetrators of violent crime than noncitizens.

Citizen men appear to be the ones posing as ICE to assault immigrant women. And the Trump administration is shipping immigrant men to horrific, foreign prisons that effectively operate as torture sites — in some cases to face brutal sexual violence — and wielding any imperfection in an immigrant's record to justify it, much like how our patriarchal society treats rape victims who are “imperfect” victims.

Among the most upsetting aspects of this rising crisis of violence against immigrants and women is how predictable it was. Of course men believe that if they pose as the state they can perpetrate the same violence the state often does to terrorize and violate women and victims, especially victims in more precarious positions. But unmasking ICE isn’t enough. The agency must be abolished, and the root causes of state and carceral violence must be addressed.","https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68d16d1fae58da46c3dc9463/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/2233847009",N,,2025-09-22 15:57:00.682068

NEW YORK – Last week, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York rejected a discovery request by an individual sanctioned for violence against Palestinians in the Israeli occupied West Bank that would have undermined established protections for civil society groups and threatened their ability to continue their advocacy work without fear of irreparable harm. The court adopted arguments advanced by the organization targeted by the request, Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), and an amicus brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), and Human Rights First.

“The court’s decision affirms DAWN’s right to engage in research, reporting, and advocacy without coercive interference by people who disagree with its speech. NGOs should never be forced to comply with this kind of abusive request, and this decision will allow human rights organizations’ work to continue providing accountability for human rights abuses,” said Nathan Freed Wessler, deputy director of the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project.

The court found that DAWN did not have to comply with a discovery request filed by Isaac Levi Pilant, dual U.S.-Israeli citizen who was previously sanctioned under the West Bank sanctions program. DAWN had publicly recommended that the U.S. government impose sanctions on him and others for documented violence against Palestinians. After President Trump effectively terminated the program, Pilant filed an application against DAWN and its executive director, Sarah Leah Whitson, pursuant to a U.S. law that provides a mechanism for foreign litigants to obtain discovery from people and entities in the United States. He sought a court order for an extremely wide set of information related to DAWN’s investigation of Pilant and its sanctions advocacy efforts for use in a possible future defamation case in Israel against Yesh Din, an Israeli human rights organization.

“This ruling confirms that foreign litigants cannot exploit our courts to silence NGOs that report on human rights abuses and advocate for accountability,” said Bobby Hodgson, assistant legal director at the NYCLU. “The Constitution protects organizations like DAWN from being forced to reveal confidential aspects of their work. The discovery process cannot sidestep the First Amendment — and we’re glad the court agrees.”

The court’s decision reflected the arguments put forth in the supporting amicus brief. The court found that various protections, including the reporter’s privilege and statutory provisions, barred it from granting the discovery requested. It further found that Pilant had failed to demonstrate how the requested information was relevant to contemplated litigation against a different organization in Israeli court.

As explained in the ACLU and HRF amicus brief, the U.S. government has established frameworks and processes to encourage nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to share sensitive information that can assist it in more effectively implementing various human rights and corruption sanctions and visa restriction programs. Undermining the protections for NGOs to securely and confidentially share this information would not only impact the ability of the U.S. government to use such tools to hold human rights abusers and corrupt actors accountable, but it would also put NGOs, victims of abuse, and others in civil society in jeopardy by opening them up to retaliation and harassment from people they accuse of human rights violations.

The brief further argued that Pilant’s broad discovery request implicates information protected under the First Amendment and the reporter’s privilege, which provide grounds to reject his request under the relevant discovery statute.

The policy was used to deny more than 12,000 U visa applications before it was blocked in federal court.
That, said Jean Bruggeman, a longtime expert in immigration, human trafficking and domestic violence, was one of the original problems Congress set out to solve with these visas.
Visas for victims of human trafficking have slowed Advocates who fight human trafficking say the T visa plays a critical role for victims of sex trafficking, overwhelmingly women and girls.
“U visas serve a valuable purpose, and this is a case where they were abused.” Other law enforcement officials agree that the visas are essential to public safety.","This story was originally reported by The 19th.

Immigrant women were facing high rates of domestic violence, and yet the fear of deportation and lack of trust in police was so pervasive it kept many of them from reporting the crimes to law enforcement. That made it “virtually impossible” to hold many perpetrators accountable, Congress found.

In response, lawmakers from both parties created two new visas: U visas for victims of domestic violence and other serious crimes, and T visas for victims of human trafficking. About 3 in 5 U and T visa applicants are immigrant women.

Twenty-five years later, the programs are bogged down by lengthy wait times, which have grown to over a decade. Now, with President Donald Trump back in office, they’re also facing an existential threat.

At the center are thousands of immigrants who have been trafficked or have been the victim of a violent crime, who reported that crime to law enforcement, and who bear the physical or mental scars of that crime — all requirements to obtain one of these visas. Their lives remain stuck in limbo as they await a decision, now more vulnerable to detention and deportation due to Trump’s aggressive immigration agenda.

Project 2025, the blueprint for Trump’s second term and whose architects hold high-ranking roles in his administration, calls for the total elimination of the two visas, concluding that “victimization should not be a basis for an immigration benefit.”

Until then, the blueprint calls on the president and federal agencies to use their power to “significantly restrict” access to the programs. Data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), lawyers working with crime victims and gender-based violence advocates say that work toward that goal is already underway. Similar efforts were undertaken in Trump’s first term, when, for example, a new policy was quietly rolled out that rejected any application with a blank space — even if it was something simple, like a middle name section left blank because the applicant didn’t have one. The policy was used to deny more than 12,000 U visa applications before it was blocked in federal court.

Since Trump’s second inauguration, the administration’s close cooperation with local police to help with immigration enforcement, layoffs at the agency that handles visa applications and the stripping away of policies that protected applicants from deportation have all had a chilling effect on new applications and could be exacerbating processing delays for new applications.

“I’m concerned that what we’re seeing is the early days of a multifaceted effort to chip away at these programs — make them less accessible, less desirable, less functional,” said Kursten Phelps, a lawyer with the Tahirih Justice Center, a nonprofit that offers legal and social services to immigrant women and girls.

Data from January through March published by the agency that handles these visas, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), shows a sharp drop off in U visa applications, which are granted to immigrant victims of domestic violence and other crimes who cooperate with police. The data shows that while T visa applications for human trafficking victims remained steady, the agency approved far fewer applications than it had previously, despite a growing backlog.

Advocates for immigrant victims of crime say the Trump administration’s aggressive approach to immigration enforcement makes it easy for abusers to use the fear of deportation as a tool for coercion. That, said Jean Bruggeman, a longtime expert in immigration, human trafficking and domestic violence, was one of the original problems Congress set out to solve with these visas.

“I would love a world in which we don't need the T and the U visa. That is the world I am working towards, where we have a fair and honest immigration system that … can’t be used as a weapon against immigrants,” said Bruggeman, the executive director of Freedom Network USA, a nonprofit focused on human trafficking.

Until then, she said, “we at least have to protect the brave victims and survivors who come forward and ask for our help.”

Reporting crimes and applying for a visa is riskier under Trump

Denisse, now 40, immigrated from Mexico in the mid-1990s seeking safety and better work opportunities. She met her future partner while working at a restaurant in New York City. The pair dated and eventually welcomed two daughters. Her first pregnancy, Denisse said, marked the beginning of years of beatings, verbal abuse and rape. Once, Denisse said, her partner threatened to kill her with a screwdriver. On another occasion, she found he had taken photos of her undressed; he threatened to distribute them to friends and family, which left her with a lasting fear of hidden cameras.

After a night of beatings and strangulation in 2015, Denisse decided to call the police. “I just thought, ‘No more. He’s going to kill me.’” The 19th is not publishing Denisse’s last name out of concern for her safety.

She was hesitant to press charges — Denisse had little support or financial stability, was not authorized to live or work in the United States, and was afraid of losing custody of her two daughters. Eventually, she decided to help the authorities prosecute her former partner, and was counseled by social workers about the U visa. She submitted an application in 2018, and by 2023, had received a “bona fide determination” — an acknowledgement that Denisse had met the basic criteria for the visa.

That determination came with a work permit and deferred immigration enforcement while she waits for a final decision on her case. The long wait times have taken a toll.

“I’m living in the in-between,” she said. With Trump’s inauguration, that limbo has become scarier: She fears that she is no longer safe from being detained, deported and separated from her children, especially since her pending application makes her visible to federal immigration officials.

“I’ve heard of people being detained, even having a work permit like me,” she said. “I can feel the fear creeping in.”

Advocates for immigrant victims of crime say that the Trump administration’s policies are making it riskier for victims to reach out to law enforcement and submit visa applications, challenging the goals of a program approved by Congress with bipartisan support.

Kinda Velloza, an immigration attorney based in the Atlanta metro area, said reaching out to law enforcement — already a difficult task for many victims — has become a scarier proposition since the Trump administration began working with local police to enforce immigration laws. That’s especially true if immigrants perceive their locality as being hostile to immigrants.

“If they are victims of crime, they're not calling law enforcement — they're not going over there to report anything,” Velloza said. “So, I think we're going to see a decline in new visa filings because nobody's just voluntarily putting themselves in the U.S. immigration system right now.”

A spring 2025 survey of 170 advocates and lawyers for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence and human trafficking, conducted by the Alliance for Immigrant Survivors, found that more than three-quarters said their clients had concerns about contacting the police. Victims have long been hesitant to contact law enforcement, but Trump’s immigration agenda is challenging advocates’ long-held advice to always seek help.

One advocate in the report said they watched a human trafficking victim with no criminal record be detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The incident has made them question whether it is advisable to tell victims that it’s safe to seek help from law enforcement.

Data from DHS confirm applications for U visas have slowed. In the first three months of the year — a window that includes the last three weeks of Biden’s term — applications for U visas fell by almost half from the previous three months. Approvals and denials continued at a similar rate.

The data is an early glimpse into the program under Trump. Advocates for immigrant victims point to two policy changes that could contribute to the chilling effect. First, the Trump administration rolled out new guidance in February telling ICE officers that they don’t have to actively check if someone has a pending U or T visa while carrying out arrests — meaning that they could be more easily detained and deported by ICE.

The administration also reinstated a policy from Trump’s first term that allows ICE to immediately start deportation proceedings against people who are denied a U or T visa. Phelps said the policy is already leading to arrests of U and T visa applicants, and complicates an immigrant’s decision to apply for the program in the first place.

That deportation policy was shown to have a particularly strong impact on human trafficking applicants. A 2022 report out of Boston University based on DHS data and a survey of close to 200 legal experts working with T visa applicants found that while applications under the program had been rising since 2008, they decreased dramatically after the new deportation policy went into effect. Between 2019 and 2021, DHS sent “Notices to Appear” — the letter that triggers deportation proceedings — to nearly 2,000 U and T visa applicants.

Wait times have long plagued the programs

Luz, an immigrant from Ecuador with two children born in the United States, has waited nearly five years for the initial determination in her case and accompanying work permit — just the first step in a long journey to possibly obtaining a U visa.

USCIS estimated last year that the median wait time for a U visa was over six years; for a T visa, it was about 15 months. But lawyers who file these applications say the waits can be much longer. The Domestic Violence Project at the Urban Justice Center, which regularly helps victims file applications, projects that someone who filed in 2020 should expect to get a final decision in 2033, while someone who files this year could be waiting nearly two decades at the current rate.

Luz had been married as a teenager in rural Ecuador and eventually followed her partner to New York City in the mid-1990s. When she arrived, she found poor living conditions, low-paying work and spousal abuse that began almost immediately. She lacked family or community support and spoke little English.

One night, when her partner came home intoxicated and violent, hurting Luz and one of their daughters, Luz called the police.

After the arrest, a law enforcement official encouraged Luz to take her claims to court, instead of dropping the charges, which victims of domestic violence often do. Years later, a mental health counselor urged Luz to apply for a U visa; she filed for it in October 2019. The 19th agreed not to publish Luz’s last name out of concern for her safety.

Luz works at a grocery store under conditions that have exacerbated her asthma — extreme cold and heat, and dust. The pay is also low, which has put strain on her family as food costs rise. She has not received a work authorization, which she said has kept her from pursuing work in health care. She’s interested in working for a pharmacy or a lab, a desire born out of her being a caregiver decades ago for her brother during a battle with liver disease.

“Well, that’s my dream,” Luz said. “And at the same time, I think about how many women like me are sitting, waiting with frustration, wondering if they’ll accept my application or not — if I’ll wind up in the same or a worse situation.”

A 2022 USCIS Inspector General’s report flagged the backlog facing U visas and said it was putting victims at risk. Mismanagement of the program, the report found, was leaving “legitimate victims waiting more than 10 years to receive U visas.”

Some visa applicants are also experiencing longer waits for the immigration agency to even acknowledge their applications. During the Biden administration, that acknowledgement often spared someone from deportation. That’s no longer the case.

The 19th documented the case of a Salvadoran immigrant, Yessenia Ruano, who was forced to self-deport in June after filing a T visa application in February. At the time, the wait for a receipt number was around four weeks. That same month, the Trump administration fired 50 employees from USCIS. By early May, an agent told Ruano that the wait had grown to four months.

By the time Ruano could show the proof of her T visa application in May, ICE agents said it wasn’t enough and told her to leave the country or face detention.

In August, Democratic Reps. Gwen Moore and Jimmy Panetta introduced legislation that would protect most U and T visa applicants from immigrant detention and deportation. Moore cited Ruano’s case.

“By subjecting these vulnerable individuals to immigration enforcement, the Trump administration is helping create a two-tiered justice system that empowers criminals and discourages certain victims from coming forward,” Moore said. “Congress created these visas as a tool to make our communities safer and support the flow of critical information during criminal investigations. This legislation creates stronger T and U visa protections, helping victims and law enforcement.”

The Protect Immigrant Witness and Victim Protection Act would also lift the cap on U visas and require USCIS to issue work permits to applicants if their cases are pending for over 180 days.

Visas for victims of human trafficking have slowed

Advocates who fight human trafficking say the T visa plays a critical role for victims of sex trafficking, overwhelmingly women and girls.

During the first two months of the Trump administration, USCIS denied more T visa applications than it approved, a first in the history of the program.

Between January and March — a window that includes the last three weeks of Biden’s term and the first two months of Trump’s second term — USCIS approved 430 applications and denied 497. Taken altogether, the agency decided 927 cases — a number advocates say is strikingly small next to the backlog.

“There is a significant slowing down of adjudications of these applications,” said Martina Vandenberg, founder and president of the Human Trafficking Legal Center, a nonprofit that connects victims of human trafficking with pro-bono legal representation.

“It's troubling to see the numbers dropping. You could understand the lack of approvals without the backlog, but there's no excuse for not adjudicating,” Vanderberg added.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment on the decline in adjudications of T visa applications.

The Human Trafficking Legal Center and other groups had advocated for more resources to speed up decisions in T visa cases during the Biden administration. In 2023, for the first time in history, the number of T visa applications exceeded Congress’ 5,000 visa cap.

Despite the growing number of applications, USCIS has never reached that cap. Between October 2023 and September 2024, the agency received a record 15,332 T visa applications and approved 3,786. About 600 applications were denied, and the backlog grew from about 9,000 applications the year prior to more than 20,000.

This year, Vanderberg said the organization has no hope that USCIS will meet the cap. “I think we'll be lucky to see 2,000 approvals.”

The role of the visas in maintaining public safety

Last month, the Justice Department said it uncovered a decade-long scheme that resulted in hundreds of fraudulent U visa applications. Three small-town police chiefs in Louisiana took hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for false reports of armed robberies.

A federal prosecutor on the case who has worked at the agency for over 20 years said in a news conference that the scheme exposed flagrant abuse of the program — but that the visas are an important law enforcement tool.

“These visas are designed to help law enforcement and prosecutors prosecute crimes where you need the victim or the witness there, ” U.S. Attorney Alexander C. Van Hook said last month. “U visas serve a valuable purpose, and this is a case where they were abused.”

Other law enforcement officials agree that the visas are essential to public safety.

“If they don't have to worry about the fear of being deported, they're more likely to report a crime to law enforcement, and that's important to us,” said Captain Jeffrey Bunge, the director of the special victims investigations division at the Montgomery County Police Department in Maryland.

In an interview with The 19th, Bunge described U visas as critical to the work of law enforcement — from building trust with immigrant communities to report crimes to mounting strong cases for prosecution that may involve several victims.

Bunge runs the office that issues law enforcement certifications for his police department and described a careful process in which officers work to link the certification request to a crime report and ensure that the agency gets the cooperation of the victim. Not every jurisdiction has a dedicated office like Montgomery County’s.

The U visa program isn’t without criticism. The 2022 USCIS watchdog report found that the program was mismanaged, susceptible to fraud and that better data was needed to understand whether it was meeting the goals that Congress laid out — protecting victims and helping law enforcement.

The report argued that USCIS could do a better job making sure that it wasn’t approving cases using fraudulent law enforcement certifications and that the agency could take a closer look at how it defines whether a victim was helpful to a law enforcement case.

Experts in the visa programs agreed that while improvements could be made, their existence continues to play an important humanitarian and public safety role.

“It does us no good if there are serious crimes that are taking place in the community, and we can’t investigate and charge and arrest those individuals. Particularly for the U visa, [these] are some of the more serious crimes,” Bunge said. “We want to get the bad guy or the bad girl off the street so that overall makes the community safer.”",https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/phpthumb/phpThumb.php?src=/files/entryimages/112823_lukeville_migrants-2363_1.jpg&fltr[]=wmi|/gfx/shareoverlays/sentinellogo4color_nobackbig.png|BR|77|4|4|0]&w=1200&h=630&zc=C&f=jpg,N,,2025-09-22 15:57:06.574793

That's an important story unto itself—not just in the birthright citizenship cases, but more generally. For all of the attention that is (understandably) being paid to the unprecedented number of cases the Trump administration is rushing to the Supreme Court (we're up to 28), and to the Court's (troubling) behavior in those cases, they represent only a small subset of the broader universe of legal challenges to Trump administration behavior. In the majority of cases in which the government is losing in the lower courts, it is (1) not seeking emergency or expedited intervention from above; and (2) otherwise complying with the adverse rulings while the cases move (very slowly) ahead.

Because this reality doesn't make for quite as attractive headlines, it's one to which too many folks are largely oblivious. That's a problem worth fixing—not only because it's important to tell both sides of the litigation story, but because including these cases paints a more complicated (and, in my view, far less nihilistic) picture of the role of the courts—and of the law, more generally—as a check on the Trump administration.

Vladeck goes on to explain that the birthright citizenship order - like a number of other Trump policies - remains blocked by lower courts, and that the administration often chooses not to appeal, or to do so only slowly. He also notes that this record shows that the Court's ruling in Trump v. CASA, Inc., barring most universal injunctions, has so far not had the devastating effect some predicted, because lower courts have found other ways to impose broad injunctions constraining illegal policies:

[F]olks might recall the loud and sharp debate following on the heels of the Supreme Court's ruling in CASA over just how much (or how little) of an impact that decision would have on the ability to challenge lawless (and allegedly lawless) behavior by the Trump administration. As I wrote at the time, the answer was always going to depend upon what happened both on remand in those three cases and elsewhere—and on how viable other means of seeking nationwide relief would be in challenges to Trump administration policies. It's still early, but at least so far, the returns have largely borne out the views of those who did not think that CASA would be a cataclysm. To be clear, that doesn't mean CASA was rightly decided (or even rightly framed, as Professor Jack Goldsmith has explained). And the Court may yet impose tighter limits on (1) nationwide class actions; (2) state standing; (3) what plaintiffs must show to demonstrate that a universal injunction is necessary to obtain ""complete relief""; or (4) nationwide vacatur of rules under the Administrative Procedure Act—any of which will necessarily affect the ability of plaintiffs to bring nationwide challenges to federal policies. But at least for now, CASA's effects have been decidedly modest—and felt most perhaps by lawyers, who have had to reconfigure many of the lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Vladeck opposes the ruling in CASA (as do I). But he's right that its impact will depend on the scope and availability of alternative modes of relief. I made a similar point in my post criticizing CASA at the time it came down.

I think Vladeck's other points here are mostly well-taken, as well. In assessing the impact of the judiciary we should look to the full range of cases, not just those that reach the Supreme Court on the ""shadow"" docket, as the latter are in some ways unrepresentative (Vladeck is a well-known longtime critic of the shadow docket). His analysis undercuts some left-wing narratives about the seeming ineffectiveness of the judiciary. And, as he notes, it also undercuts right-wing narratives to the effect that lower-court rulings against the administration are all indefensible ""Lawfare"" that will surely be overturned by the Supreme Court. If the latter were true, we would expect to see the Administration taking many more of these cases to the Supreme Court, at an accelerated pace.

That said, we should not assume that the judiciary has been completely effective, or even close to it. Some of the Supreme Court's rulings blocking lower court decisions against Trump have been badly flawed and are likely to have harmful effects. The recent ruling on racial profiling in immigration enforcement is a notable example. And some illegal actions are hard to stop completely or swiftly enough through judicial rulings alone.",https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/06/Court-4-1.png,N,,2025-09-22 15:58:02.272946

Chellie Pingree says federal officials are prohibiting attorneys from accompanying their clients to routine immigration appointments here in Maine.

Chellie Pingree says federal officials are prohibiting attorneys from accompanying their clients to routine immigration appointments here in Maine.

Pingree, a Democrat representing Maine’s 1st Congressional District, also joined calls from local officials to get a tour of the U.S. Immigration Customs and Enforcement office in Scarborough that opened five years ago amid secrecy.

In a letter Monday to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Pingree said town officials have been denied entry to the office and that such moves risk “deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.”

“Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation — as well as DHS’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law,” she said. “I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.”

She further called on federal officials to immediately disclose any written policy that prohibits barring attorneys from its facilities.

Public officials across the country have been showing up at ICE facilities to get eyewitness accounts of the conditions, only to be rebuffed and in some cases arrested. Last Thursday, 11 officials were arrested at an ICE detention facility in New York City. The Trump administration has made aggressive immigration enforcement, detention and deportation a top priority since his inauguration eight months ago.

Sue Roche, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, a nonprofit that provides legal assistance to immigrants, said attorneys in Maine have been rebuffed on “multiple occasions over the past months” when trying to join clients at their routine appointments, including clients with active immigration cases.

“In the current environment, with the federal government flagrantly disregarding due process and attempting to indiscriminately deport as many people as they can, having your attorney by your side during any ICE appointment is beyond critical,” Roche said in a written statement.

The Scarborough facility has been cloaked in secrecy since plans were first made public in 2020. Two years later, ICE remained tight-lipped about its operations, though at the time it was listed as a “check-in location,” rather than being used for “enforcement and removal operations.”

ICE was later forced to produce nearly 2,000 pages of records after being sued, but the additional information did not answer basic questions about operations, how many detainees could be held and for how long.

It’s still unclear what the facility is used for and federal officials did not respond to an interview request for this story.

That uncertainty is unacceptable to residents like Louise Secordel, who was alarmed that Scarborough police officers had called the U.S. Customs and Border Protection earlier this summer after pulling over a van that was subject to statewide alert amid a fatal drowning investigation in Waterford. CBP and ICE are separate agencies within the Department of Homeland Security that perform similar and sometimes overlapping functions.

Scarborough police apparently called border patrol because the men didn’t speak English and needed help with translation. Federal agents ended up arresting 14 men, including the brother of the drowning victim.

“What began as a sad drowning accident became a questionable detention, aided by our local police resources, of individuals working in our community, with no transparency about what has happened to them since,” Secordel said.

Jonathan Anderson, vice chair of the Scarborough Town Council, said he, too, has been trying to get a tour of the Scarborough facility and open up a dialog between town leaders and ICE since the June 14 arrests, which took place along the busy Route 1 corridor.

Anderson said he is seeking more information about the activities so he can address constituent concerns and ensure ICE is following local town ordinances.

He also wants to ensure that “it’s a facility that is treating people humanely.”

“This is something I know many people in our community are worried about,” Anderson said. “And we’re just looking for transparency around what’s happening and getting to know our neighbor a little bit better.”",https://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/41174386_20250204_pingree_0004.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 14:58:13.195767

Activists and some Illinois democrats running for office were seen gagging and struggling to breathe as tear gas filled the air.","The Department of Homeland Security has addressed rumors on the future of a suburban immigration facility closing following days of protests that have escalated to numerous clashes between demonstrators and guards.

According authorities, there are currently no plans to temporarily close the facility in suburban Broadview.

""Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing are FALSE,"" Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs at DHS, said in a statement.

The department accused demonstrators of throwing tear gas cans, rocks, bottles and fireworks at law enforcement, while also slashing car tires and blocking entrances to the building. Protesters were often seen trying to block vehicles or federal agents entering or exiting the facility, with federal agents then firing pepper balls at the crowd of protesters.

The National Lawyers Guild alleged agents appeared to ""fire projectiles directly at individuals, including at their heads"" and said at least two people were taken to nearby hospitals.

Protesters were often seen trying to block vehicles or federal agents entering or exiting the facility, with federal agents then firing pepper balls at the crowds. Videos and photos captured numerous scuffles between protesters and ICE guards outside the facility.

DHS accused the state of refusing to ""answer multiple calls for assistance,"" blaming its sanctuary city policies, but in his own statement Gov. J.B. Pritzker denied receiving any calls for help.

""It's completely false to suggest the state or local municipalities have been obstructing federal officials. The state has not received multiple calls for assistance from the federal government and would remind them the importance of coordinating with local law enforcement to protect public safety,"" Pritzker's office said in a statement. ""Governor Pritzker has been clear that violence is unacceptable and everyone needs to follow the law, which includes federal agents respecting constitutional rights to peaceful protest.""

The governor's office added that the village of Broadview and Cook County have also not requested state help.

According to DHS, at least 16 protesters have been arrested at the facility so far. The National Lawyers Guild reported at least 10 of those arrests were ultimately released.

""Secretary Noem’s message to rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" McLaughlin's statement read.

“These egregious acts of violence against people exercising their rights to free speech exemplify this administration’s flagrant assault on the First Amendment,"" Brad Thomson, a volunteer attorney with NLG Chicago, said in a statement. ""The violent use of government power to suppress dissent embodies the authoritarian and xenophobic agenda being pursued by federal authorities.”

The heightened demonstrations come as officials conduct what they've called ""Operation Midway Blitz"" in the Chicago area. In just two weeks, more than 550 undocumented immigrants have been detained by ICE, the agency told NBC 5 Investigates.

The Broadview facility serves as a processing center for many of those arrested.

Though protests have taken place every Friday for weeks, the clashes on Sept. 19 were some of the most tense so far. That evening, tensions escalated as someone in the crowd launched fireworks outside the heavily armed ICE compound. Federal agents responded to the fireworks with tear gas and dozens of rounds of pepper ball shots.

Activists and some Illinois democrats running for office were seen gagging and struggling to breathe as tear gas filled the air. Some used milk and water to clear their eyes.

Kat Abughazaleh, who is running for Congress in Illinois' 9th District, was thrown to the ground by federal agents at the protest.

""What's really important to mention here, I’m gonna have a bruise on my side, but that doesn’t hold a candle to the people trapped in the facility are dealing with,"" Abughazaleh said.

A photo captured by NBC Chicago photographer George Mycyk Friday morning showed a bottle of what appeared to have been sprayed at protestors, marked with the words ""riot control.""

""We just got sprayed with -- I don't know if it was tear gas, or pepper spray -- I know it stung my eyes,"" NBC Chicago reporter Jenn Schanz, who was at the scene, said.

In recognition of the inalienable human dignity of each person, States built a rules-based system to maintain peace and security and to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. Multilateral refugee, humanitarian, and human rights treaties are central to the objectives enshrined in the UN charter, and essential to preventing and deterring conduct that harms people and threatens global stability and peace. Adherence to treaties has saved lives, upheld human dignity, and protected millions of people from persecution, torture and other human rights abuses.

Human rights treaties play a vital role in helping people live safely and protected where they are, reducing the conditions that lead to forced migration. The Refugee Convention, its Protocol and other agreements provide a foundation for states to host refugees and provide critical protection, thereby reducing onward displacement. Indeed, the substantial majority—over two-thirds—of refugees are already hosted in neighboring states and nearly three-fourths are hosted in low- and middle-income states.

Treaties and norms that protect people from persecution and other human rights abuses are more necessary than ever. Many of us have witnessed, day in and day out, how international treaties and law save lives and protect people from return to persecution, torture, and other serious human rights abuses. Indeed, the Refugee Convention and its Protocol have protected millions of people from persecution. The sad reality is that today’s global crises and mass displacements often stem from, or are exacerbated by, the failure to adhere to international human rights, refugee and humanitarian conventions and law.

We call on States to:

Sign and/or deposit instruments of ratification or accession to human rights, refugee, and humanitarian treaties, and encourage other states to do so – including by welcoming those that do so during the UNGA Treaty Event and by marking the upcoming 75th Anniversary of the Refugee Convention through acceding to the Refugee Convention and Protocol and encouraging other states to do so.

Celebrate and affirm support for such treaties, and explain the ways they benefit people and states.

Share steps taken to fulfill and honor commitments under treaties – such as enactment of implementing legislation, celebrating treaty commitments, measures taken in response to treaty body recommendations or UPR, or creating a national human rights institution. With respect to the Refugee Convention and its Protocol, share steps taken to strengthen asylum systems, support rights protection capacities, or increase cooperation through expanded resettlement and/or aid that helps enable other countries to host large numbers of refugees.

Should there be any denunciations, withdrawals, or attempts to reject, “reform,” and/or replace such treaties with frameworks that deny people protection from persecution and human rights abuses, we call on states to express strong disagreement, reiterate support for such treaties, explain their benefits to human lives, peace, and stability, emphasize the negative impacts of actions that undermine such treaties, and urge reversal of such efforts.

Many people now safely living in countries around the world are the children and grandchildren of people who fled persecution and found refuge in other countries. Conversely, before states came together to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, human rights treaties and the Refugee Convention and Protocol, millions were abandoned to suffer horrific fates. Too many continue to suffer due to the failures to uphold human rights and humanitarian norms.

At this critical crossroads, we call on states to work together and with civil society to strengthen—and reject efforts to undermine—the treaties and norms that protect people from persecution and other human rights abuses.

Executive Order Related to H-1B Nonimmigrants Issued

Note: This news item was originally posted Sept. 20, 2025; it was updated with additional information and reposted Sept. 22, 2025.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order Sept.19, which places a ""restriction on entry"" of certain (H-1B) nonimmigrant workers and a new $100,000 fee. The executive order went into effect at 12:01 a.m., Sept. 21, 2025, and will remain in effect through Sept. 21, 2026, unless extended or changed.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued memoranda clarifying the executive order Sept. 20, and the U.S. State Department posted an H-1B FAQ Sept. 21.

Based on the administrative guidance in the memoranda and FAQ, it does not appear that this new order applies to individuals who are in the United States or those outside the United States who have an approved or pending H-1B petition. There are still a number of questions raised by this order, including whether it will apply to H-1B applications for extension or change of employer/change of status. It does appear to apply to new H-1B applications, although it is unclear whether cap-exempt H-1B employers/employees may be exempt or able to obtain a national interest exemption.

While the order is likely to be challenged in court, due to the uncertainties and potential for impact, the Office of International Education recommends the following:

Individuals in H-1B status who were not in the United States at the time of the order were encouraged to re-enter the United States by 11:59 p.m., Sept. 20, 2025 (before the order took effect Sept. 21), if possible.

Individuals currently in the United States on an H-1B visa are advised to consider travel carefully and potentially postpone international travel in the near future. While the new memoranda seem to minimize travel risks for individuals who currently hold H-1B status, until the implications and applicability of this new executive order are more fully clarified and potential litigation unfolds, travel guidance may continue to evolve.",https://www.cmu.edu/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-22 12:58:52.885068

IRS seeks to rebuild legal staff after mass resignations. Following an exodus of attorneys from the Office of Chief Counsel, the IRS has opened hiring for more than 60 positions in areas such as international tax and litigation support, reports Tax Notes. The office has lost about 13 percent of its workforce this year, part of broader staff reductions across the agency, and had previously rescinded job offers due to a federal hiring freeze. Experts say the agency may need added resources to handle litigation and implementation of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

Court scrutinizes IRS–ICE tax data sharing. A federal judge has ordered the IRS to identify individuals involved in providing taxpayer data to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but allowed some names to remain sealed. The case, Center for Taxpayer Rights v. IRS, focuses on a memorandum of understanding under which the IRS shared addresses of 47,000 taxpayers under investigation for remaining in the U.S. after deportation orders. Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly has also restricted further disclosures without court notice.

This payment is new and is in addition to the existing registration and filing fees for H-1B petitions which generally are less than $4,000 for private employers. On September 20th, the White House provided much needed clarification that the payment only applies to new H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025 and does not impact current H-1B workers or beneficiaries of pending H-1B petitions.

The immigration shift targets new H-1B petitions for beneficiaries who are currently outside the United States. This affects employers' talent acquisition strategies with overseas hiring plans facing immediate and costly decisions. The intent is to encourage U.S. employers to hire U.S. workers instead.

Future federal court litigation is anticipated and may impact implementation of the Proclamation. Additional governmental guidance is also anticipated to further clarify the scope of the payment and the logistics of payment collection. Unless extended, the Proclamation is set to expire on September 21, 2026.

Who is NOT impacted by the Proclamation?

The White House, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection all separately confirmed all H-1B workers currently in the United States are not subject to the Proclamation with no restriction on international travel. In addition, the Proclamation and $100,000 payment will not apply in the following scenarios:

Beneficiaries with pending or approved H-1B petitions filed prior to September 21, 2025.

Beneficiaries of H-1B petitions filed after September 21, 2025, seeking extension/amendment of H-1B stay, or change of H-1B employer within the United States.

Family members in H-4 dependent visa status.

Based on the guidance from the Department of State, we anticipate that foreign nationals currently outside the United States with pending or approved H-1B petitions as of September 21, 2025, should be able to secure new H-1B visas at U.S. counsular posts abroad and enter the United States in H-1B status after September 21, 2025.

Who Is Subject to the Proclamation and $100,000 Payment?

Beneficiaries of new H-1B petitions filed after 12:01am EDT on September 21, 2025, currently abroad, who attempt to enter the United States in H-1B status will be subject to the $100,000 payment. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service will not adjudicate H-1B petitions and the Department of State will not issue H-1B visas without evidence of the $100,000 payment for the new H-1B workers outside of the United States.

National Interest Exemptions

The Proclamation authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to grant exemptions of the $100,000 supplemental payment to any individual foreign national, all foreign nationals working for a company, or all foreign nationals working in an industry, if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines that the hiring of such foreign nationals ""is in the national interest and does not pose a threat to the security or welfare of the United States."" We are awaiting further details on the logistics of the national interest exemption process. We anticipate that employers seeking an exemption will be required to provide strong documentation demonstrating the employee's or the organization's strategic importance, economic harm, or public interest impact if the entry payment was enforced.

Prevailing Wage Changes anticipated for H-1B Petitions

The Proclamation directs changes be made to the way prevailing wages are set in the H-1B program and prioritizes higher paid and higher skilled foreign workers. The Secretary of Labor is instructed to initiate rulemaking to revise prevailing wage levels so that they align with the policy goals of the Proclamation. Additionally, the Secretary of Homeland Security is instructed to initiate rulemaking to prioritize the admission of high-skilled, high-paid nonimmigrants.

Employers who sponsor H-1B beneficiaries will need to budget for higher level wages, and specific geographies where prevailing wages are higher or lower under the current rules. Employers may run a risk of Requests for Evidence or denials of their petitions if they routinely only qualify for the lowest of wage level for lower paid, entry-level positions. Department of Homeland Security will develop rules that favor applicants who are both highly skilled and well-compensated setting thresholds for minimum wages, educational or experience as distinguishable factors.

The new wage rules are anticipated to be published followed by a comment period before the next H-1B lottery which is expected to begin in March 2026. In the meantime, the current prevailing wage levels remaining in effect.

Next Steps for Employers

Identify potential future foreign national hires who are abroad and assess the financial and operational implications of the $100,000 payment.

Evaluate whether any positions or business units may qualify for national interest exemptions.

Evaluate and stay informed of recommendations related to rulemaking changes to the prevailing wage levels and prioritization of highly skilled and highly paid nonimmigrants.

The decision comes two and a half months after President Donald Trump signed legislation sharply reducing food aid to the poor. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.

The decision to scrap the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Household Food Security Report was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.

In a press release Saturday, the USDA said the 2024 report, to be released Oct. 22, would be the last.

""The questions used to collect the data are entirely subjective and do not present an accurate picture of actual food security,'' the USDA said. ""The data is rife with inaccuracies slanted to create a narrative that is not representative of what is actually happening in the countryside as we are currently experiencing lower poverty rates, increasing wages, and job growth under the Trump Administration.''

The Census Bureau reported earlier this month that the U.S. poverty rate dipped from 11% in 2023 to 10.6% last year, before Trump took office.

Critics were quick to accuse the administration of deliberately making it harder to measure hunger and assess the impact of its cuts to food stamps.

""Trump is cancelling an annual government survey that measures hunger in America, rather than allow it to show hunger increasing under his tenure,"" Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, said on social media.

Civil society from around the world urgently calls on States Parties to the Rome Statute to do everything in their power to stop the proposed US sanctions against the ICC, an independent judicial institution with a mandate to confront impunity for the gravest crimes known to humanity. Sanctions against the ICC, taken unilaterally by a non-State Party, amount to an all-out assault on a global court backed by 125 States Parties and relied on by the international community to ensure accountability for atrocity crimes. Such sanctions would leave countless victims abandoned by obstructing a last resort to justice, weaponising the global financial system to choke the Court’s work, and entrenching double standards where power and politics dictate which survivors deserve justice.

Sanctioning the ICC would mark a dangerous turning point in the history of international justice, transforming a system designed to hold the most powerful accountable for atrocity crimes into one that instead shields the powerful. It involves retreating from hard-fought progress toward a rules-based order to a world where might triumphs over right. An international justice system built over decades could crumble in the face of external pressure exerted to unduly influence the course of justice. It is a total affront to the rule of law with devastating repercussions for justice everywhere: if the ICC can be manipulated through financial coercion, no court or accountability mechanism is safe in any country or region.

Sanctioning the ICC as an institution could sever the Court’s ability to function, including its access to financing from banks and states, and block essential services needed to keep it operating. US control over the global financial system ensures the impact of mere threats of sanctions reaches far beyond Washington, as non-American banks, insurers, and service providers often over-comply in fear of themselves being sanctioned, blocking even basic transactions. Without funds, the Court risks not being able to keep the lights on, pay staff, protect data, protect witnesses supporting its work, pay legal aid to victims and defendants, let alone deliver reparations to victims. It threatens core functions of the Court, including the detention of suspects. Hard-won gains, such as the recent arrest and surrender of former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and the German arrest of Libyan suspect, Khaled Mohamed Ali El Hishri, could be lost. Ongoing investigations of alleged international crimes in other situations might be stalled or abandoned indefinitely, leaving victims unable to access justice worldwide.

If sanctions render the Court inoperative, there will be no way back and one of the most relevant institutions of the past century will have been lost. The global community cannot let this happen.

The signatories call on ICC States Parties to urgently save the ICC and the Rule of Law by:

– Publicly and firmly rejecting sanctions against the ICC as an institution, its staff and officials, and organisations and individuals supporting its work.

– Bilaterally engaging with the US Administration to prevent designations against the ICC as an institution, its staff and officials, and organisations and individuals supporting its work.

– Adopting domestic and regional blocking measures including enforcing the European Union’s Blocking Statute (Council Regulation (EC) No 2271/96), to demonstrate solidarity and protect individuals and entities from the impact of sanctions and shield businesses within their respective territories so that they can continue to work with the ICC, its staff and officials, and civil society supporting the Court.

– Protecting service providers by guaranteeing that providing services to the ICC and organisations supporting its work is lawful and shielded.

– Developing practical alternatives to the US-dollar banking network of transactions that are cleared through the US financial system, so the Court and its supporters can keep funding their essential work.

– Providing guidance and creating legal safeguards to prevent non-US banks and service providers from over-complying with threats of US sanctions.

– Fulfilling their legal obligations under the Rome Statute, including financial contributions to the Court’s annual budget, strong political backing to the Court’s independence and continued functioning, cooperation with the Court notably on the arrests and surrender of suspects, and resisting any pressure to disengage in response to sanctions.

Paragon Solutions, Israel’s premier mercenary spyware firm, is headquartered on the top five floors of a glass panel skyscraper that sits next to a discount bank branch in central Tel Aviv. When I stopped in for a visit last month, I encountered twenty-somethings with smartwatches gliding through open floor plans, dogs lounging on shag carpets, fridges stacked with glass bottles of sparkling water, and conference rooms angled to gaze out over the hazy Mediterranean. The breezy atmosphere was at odds with the controversies the company has recently faced. But perhaps by then most of the staff knew the tide had changed.

Earlier this month Paragon scored one of its heftiest deals yet when the Trump administration reactivated a $2 million contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), following the firm’s acquisition by Florida-based investment group AE Industrial Partners last December. The company builds surveillance weapons such as Graphite, a zero-click smartphone hack that can access encrypted communications, turn on the camera and microphone, and vacuum up every text, direct message, intimate photograph, and personal file stored on the device—all without the user noticing. The technology gives those who deploy it a power once reserved for the top commanders of the world’s most vaunted spy outfits.

Scandal came for the company earlier this year when Italian authorities reportedly used Paragon’s spyware to surveil prominent journalists and human rights activists. For the Trump administration, it might have been a proof of concept. The news of the DHS deal—quietly announced on a federal procurement form that was circulated by journalist Jack Poulson—reversed a U.S. government freeze on a deal originally minted in 2023. Over the last decade, American law enforcement agencies have tested and even procured spyware offered by companies with spotty human rights records. Yet outrage surrounding the abuse of Pegasus—another zero-click surveillance tool sold by Paragon’s main rival, the NSO Group, itself based just north of Tel Aviv in Herzliya, near Mossad’s headquarters—propelled Biden to sign an executive order clamping down on government use of commercial spyware.

Trump’s reelection has changed all that. Over the last eight months, he has aspired to govern the United States like a strongman. The summer began with federal agents dispatched to round up undocumented migrants at gun point in Los Angeles. It ended with U.S. military forces carrying out a drone strike in the Caribbean, killing eleven Venezuelans in a brazen execution that legal experts say amounts to a war crime. Arming DHS with Paragon’s mercenary spyware spells only further escalation.

Like a reaper drone, mercenary spyware is an expensive weapon usually reserved for elite military operations. The technology became popular with national security agencies in the early 2010s at the height of U.S. counterinsurgency campaigns in the Middle East. Militant organizations were hiding behind state-of-the-art encryption, and superpowers were lacking in the ingenuity needed to hack their phones. The NSO Group was the first to capitalize on the opportunity.

Within a few years’ time, a handful of companies came to dominate the industry. Whether headquartered in Israel or elsewhere, they were often staffed by Israeli veterans of elite intelligence outfits such as Unit 8200. Military-trained developers had spent years honing their surveillance skills in the occupied Palestinian territories and neighboring countries; now they could apply them for eye-watering salaries at the behest of governments eager to shore up their power. Israel’s foray into the private surveillance industry was a natural update to the country’s old brand as the world’s ultimate security state.

The technology was initially marketed as a weapon, for use in military conflicts or intelligence operations. But despots, keen to surveil and terrify their enemies, found it hard to resist a tool that can decipher the secrets stored in anyone’s personal phone, and spyware companies found it hard to resist the prospect of more paying customers. Soon enough, the industry was embroiled in a number of public relations disasters. Governments in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Latin America became enthusiastic customers. A technology marketed to clamp down on terrorism, drug cartels, and pedophilia was used to monitor, blackmail, and arrest journalists, human rights advocates, and opposition politicians. Among the victims was journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi, who in 2018 was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where he was murdered and dismembered. Pegasus was found on the phones of his wife and at least one other associate.

Though most victims of mercenary spyware evade such cruel fates, they still describe the technology’s effects as debilitating. “Pegasus was (the authorities’) sending me a message that anything they wanted they could have, that nowhere was free from their control,” Salah Hamouri told me when we spoke in Ramallah in 2022. The lawyer was one of six Palestinian activists who found the NSO group’s spyware on their devices in late 2021. Hamouri, also a French citizen, figured something was amiss when he picked up his phone after gym sessions to find he had been active on Instagram during stretches of time he stored the device in a locker. But news of the hack—confirmed by a forensic scan on his iPhone—sent him spiraling. In the aftermath, Hamouri spent months offline, not even speaking to his wife and kids in Paris over encrypted messaging apps. By the time we met he was carrying a pink Motorola flip phone and still limited his communication to just a few people. “The only time I feel secure is when I’m not using any kind of technology, but it’s impossible to live like that,” he said.

Painstaking documentation of similar travails led to international investigations and lawsuits here in the United States. For the Biden administration, which had toyed with buying the technology, the mounting pressure was enough to shift their course: rather than signing deals with the firms, it wound up blacklisting a number of them. Unable to access their biggest market, the industry seemed, for a moment, to be on the wane: the NSO Group and its peer companies teetered on the edge of bankruptcy; in recent years three other Israeli spyware outfits folded.

Then came Trump’s return. He campaigned on a pledge to build up American military power, and even before taking office, he promised Silicon Valley titans hefty contracts to develop surveillance and weapons systems for U.S. security agencies—in August, the surveillance firm Palantir scored a $10 billion contract with the Department of Defense—while casually talking of conquering Greenland. In campaign speeches, Trump offered an alternative to the last few decades of liberalism: belligerent nationalism, hard militarism, and a frontier ethos.

Many tech CEOs were eager to cash in. They parroted conservative talking points, vowing to inject Silicon Valley with a warrior spirit to protect Western civilization. Executives from Meta, OpenAI, Palantir, and Thinking Machines enlisted in a special unit within the newly renamed Department of War. Others signed deals with DHS to make the agency over into what its secretary, Kristi Noem, has called a “vigilant and proactive and innovative” force. And all of this has been helped by the massive entanglement of the U.S. and Israeli military-tech complex—a longstanding economic relationship that Trump has not invented whole cloth. The late twentieth century’s steady supply of tanks and Uzis morphed into a twenty-first-century exchange of predator drones, facial recognition algorithms, and, now, spyware.

Still, DHS’s contract with Paragon marks escalation, coming amid Immigration and Custom Enforcement’s brutal crackdown that critics say is flouting constitutional checks on the agency’s power. In recent months the DHS has sought to ramp up its mass surveillance capacities; ICE has detained valid visa holders based on social media posts at odds with the Trump administration’s position on Palestine. It has offered Palantir a $30 million contract to develop ImmigrationOS, a surveillance database that advocates worry “concentrates enormous power in the hands of AI-driven platforms with minimal public oversight.” And in February, The Intercept reported that it was courting companies to develop a tool—making use of “social and behavioral sciences” and “psychological profiles”—allowing the agency to monitor individuals who criticized it on social media.

The Paragon deal also demonstrates how the U.S.-Israel alliance will endure despite plummeting domestic support for the war in Gaza. Calls for sanctions on Israeli armaments have mounted in recent months, as Israeli officials barrel ahead with an expanded offensive in Gaza City. Endless documentation of war crimes, skyrocketing civilian casualties, allegations of famine have fueled calls for sanctions on Israeli armaments. Various EU member states have frozen the import of Israeli manufactured weapons and surveillance systems. Germany and Spain have halted all arms sales to Israel, while many members of the Hague Group, a collective of several countries in the Global South, has banned arms transfers and sales. Though 84 percent of Americans support an immediate ceasefire, the Trump administration has balked at even the most tepid of sanctions.

There are old and strategic interests at play. The United States has long relied on Israel’s military prowess to further its interest in the Middle East, from the CIA, the NSA, and Mossad tag-teaming targeted assassinations in Syria and Iran to Israeli and American security bodies sharing a steady stream of surveillance data extracted from governments, militant networks, and civilians. Despite campaigning on an “America First” campaign platform, Trump is keen to maintain these relations and often praises Israel as a bulwark against Iranian influence in the region.

More than anything else, though, Trump is a power-monger. He finds a compelling model in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s strongman rule and the military arsenal that backs it up. Indeed, Netanyahu has managed to cling onto power through brute displays of military force. Exploding pagers in Beirut, suicide drones beelining toward Iranian nuclear scientists’ bedrooms, 2,000 munitions dropped on civilian complexes in Gaza city, bombing Hamas negotiators in Doha: all of these have distracted from charges of corruption, the dismantling of Israeli democratic institution (imperfect as they may have been), and the fact that more Israelis have died under his watch than any government since the 1970s. Last week, as Israeli troops invaded Gaza City and a United Nations inquiry accused Israeli officials of genocide, Netanyahu told a group of American congressmen the he was remaking Israel into a warrior nation. “We’re going to be Athens and Supersparta” he said, “we’ll have to defend ourselves and know how to attack our enemies.”

Trump has copied a few of Netanyahu’s strategies in the months since he assumed the presidency. Since March, U.S. airstrikes in Yemen have killed over 500 combatants and more than 200 civilians, more than all those killed in two decades of U.S. bombings in the country. As of June, Trump had deployed thousands of National Guards into the heart of U.S. cities. Noem requested “drone surveillance support” to turbocharge their efforts to find and arrest undocumented migrants in Los Angeles. ICE has detained a record-breaking number in recent months, though actual deportation numbers are lagging behind the “millions and millions” promised.

For those living under this expanding offensive, the results are catastrophic. Some have been held for months on end in crowded detention centers. Others, including legal residents, have simply been deported without due process. And that’s just within U.S. borders. Abroad, the embrace of aerial targeting and drone strikes with vanishingly few efforts to minimize civilian casualties mark an unrestrained phase of U.S. militarism, one that shirks even the most symbolic adherence to human rights norms and international rule of law. Instead, allegations of war crimes are touted by those in power as proof of a job well done.

Which returns me to the Tel Aviv skyscraper where Israeli developers build out mercenary spyware at the behest of America’s DHS. On the sunny day I stopped in for a visit, a surveillance UAV hummed somewhere just beyond cloud cover. Fighter jets rumbled overhead on their way to launch guided munitions towards Gaza city.

Amnesty International has issued a call for the data analytics companies Palantir and Babel Street to “immediately cease their work with the US administration related to immigration enforcement.” Amnesty’s action is an important reminder that surveillance technology not only raises critical policy issues around just what kind of a society we want to live in, but that when connected to abusive and illegal actions such as those being taken by the Trump Administration, it can also violate internationally recognized human rights standards. And that can apply to other companies besides Palantir and Babel Street.

In its letters to the two companies, the renowned global human rights group points out that companies have a “responsibility to protect human rights,” including the rights of refugees, asylum-seekers, and migrants. Amnesty writes,

The scope and meaning of this responsibility have been articulated in the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UN Guiding Principles). The UN Guiding Principles require all businesses, from small and medium-sized enterprises to large multinational enterprises, to avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts through their own business activities.

The Trump Administration’s systematic abuses of immigrants certainly count as human rights violations. As Amnesty and my ACLU colleagues have been pointing out, the administration has been violating human rights obligations to protect migrants and asylum seekers, violating due process rights, violating the right to free expression, and engaging in arbitrary and prolonged detention and cruel and degrading treatment. For example, as Amnesty explains, while the U.S. government may have

discretion to deny and revoke visas to applicants, they may not do so in ways that violate rights protected by the US Constitution and international human rights law, including rights to free speech and due process.

As ICE, CBP and others carrying out the Trump Administration’s human rights violations increasingly tap into surveillance infrastructures being run by private companies, those companies have an obligation not to facilitate such violations — and as Amnesty points out, also have human rights responsibilities under United Nations principles to be transparent about how they’re addressing activities in contexts where they “pose risks of severe human rights impacts.”

Unfortunately, there are a growing number of companies that are engaging in mass surveillance, including those collecting significant amounts of data through our cellular networks, video surveillance cameras, face recognition and license plate recognition systems, and other technologies that could prove useful to the Trump Administration’s efforts to target undocumented and documented immigrants and other assorted perceived enemies.

Let’s not forget that two large Chinese companies, Dahua and Hikvision, were sanctioned by the U.S. government in 2019 for their role in carrying out surveillance that was connected to the current Chinese government’s ongoing oppression of the Uighur minority in the Xinjiang province. These are not small companies; their products were widespread in the U.S. surveillance camera market. The government issued the sanctions against the companies for “enabling” and being “implicated in”

human rights violations and abuses in the implementation of China’s campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs, and other members of Muslim minority groups in the XUAR. [emphasis added]

Tragically, now we are seeing a policy, directed from the top, of intentional “human rights violations and abuses,” “repression,” and “arbitrary detention” here in the United States.

In a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, Pingree stressed that preventing legal counsel from attending such visits undermines constitutional protections and erodes public confidence in DHS’s commitment to transparency and accountability.

“Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation—as well as DHS’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law,” Pingree wrote. “If DHS or ICE maintain such a stance, I ask that you provide in writing the policy that allows for legal counsel to be turned away from your facilities. Further, should this policy exist, it raises significant questions about transparency and the right to representation. I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.”

Pingree also formally requested a tour of the ICE field office in Scarborough, Maine, citing concerns raised by local town officials who have sought to engage with the facility but have been denied entry.

“Clear and consistent communication with community leaders, advocacy organizations, and local officials fosters greater transparency and ensures that enforcement operations are implemented fairly and humanely,” Pingree wrote. “Without these relationships, DHS risks deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.”

The Congresswoman reiterated that robust constituent services and agency oversight are core congressional responsibilities, and said she will continue to monitor DHS’s responsiveness.

Dear Secretary Noem,

As you know from your time in the U.S. House of Representatives, providing casework and acting as an intermediary to executive agencies is one of the most fundamental services we provide for our constituents, ensuring that the government serves the people it represents. My office frequently assists constituents with immigration petitions pending with your agency—including adjustments of status, naturalization, and non-immigrant visa petitions—that have been delayed or lost. I take immense pride in my ability to serve the thousands of Mainers who have sought assistance from my office.

Moreover, robust casework functions to directly support Congress’s oversight responsibilities. Elevating constituent concerns provides valuable insights into how federal programs are being implemented on the ground. It can also reveal systemic inefficiencies, inequities, and gaps in service that may warrant legislative or administrative attention.

It is within this oversight capacity that I raise alarm about several reports from my district that attorneys have not been permitted to accompany their clients to routine check-in visits at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities. Blocking access to legal counsel is incompatible with our values as a nation—as well as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)’s stated commitments to transparency, accountability, and the rule of law. If DHS or ICE maintain such a stance, I ask that you provide in writing the policy that allows for legal counsel to be turned away from your facilities. Further, should this policy exist, it raises significant questions about transparency and the right to representation. I strongly urge you to repeal any policy that would deprive individuals of their constitutional right to due process.

In service of my oversight responsibilities, I request your assistance in scheduling a tour in the coming weeks of the ICE field office within my district in Scarborough, Maine. In accordance with this request, I wish to stress the importance of the Department’s responsibility to engage with and be responsive to the local communities in which ICE facilities operate. It has been brought to my attention that officials from the Town of Scarborough have made efforts to engage with the ICE facility in the Town, but have yet to be allowed entry. Clear and consistent communication with community leaders, advocacy organizations, and local officials fosters greater transparency and ensures that enforcement operations are implemented fairly and humanely. Without these relationships, DHS risks deepening mistrust and eroding the very public confidence it requires to operate effectively.

I respectfully request a written response to this letter no later than 30 days from receipt. Please provide confirmation of whether a policy exists prohibiting legal counsel from attending routine ICE appointments, and if so, its legal justification. My office will also follow up on scheduling a visit to the Scarborough, Maine facility as soon as possible.

Thank you for your prompt attention to these matters. Congress will continue to closely monitor the Department’s responsiveness, and I fully expect your office will take the necessary actions to address these concerns. Please reach out to my office at (202) 225-6116 should you have any questions.

On the evening of Feb. 11, 22-year-old Ward Sakeik sat on a plane from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Miami. She and her husband, Taahir Shaikh, were returning from their honeymoon, but he was sitting a few rows away. She didn’t look back at him — her handlers told her that even smiling at him could be considered a crime.

Sakeik, a wedding photographer who’s lived in Texas since the age of 9, hadn’t slept for two days. She’d spent nearly 36 hours confined to a small intake room at the Cyril E. King Airport in St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Tired, she kept her eyes on the book she’d brought on board. It was about marriage and relationships.

Behind her, a woman made small talk. “You look like you’re so sleepy,” Sakeik remembered the woman saying before offering her a pillow. “Here, borrow this.”

The woman — along with almost every other passenger on the plane — was unaware that Sakeik and three others were in ICE custody. Sakeik had been on her honeymoon one day and detained the next.

After arriving in Miami, Sakeik and her fellow detainees were ushered to the back of the plane to deboard. Sakeik was searched and handcuffed while her new husband, a U.S. citizen who was not detained, was free to go back to their new home alone.

“I was just so filled with anger, it’s like human trafficking,” Sakeik later told The Barbed Wire. “Everything happened behind the airport, under the airport, on the side of the airport, I felt like I was being trafficked.”

Sakeik spent the next 141 days in ICE detention. Her release in July made national and international headlines as a dragnet of immigration crackdowns has caught immigrants on legal paths to citizenship alongside those with criminal histories who were the supposed targets.

As a Palestinian woman born in Saudi Arabia — a country with no birthright citizenship — she is stateless.

This week, Israel launched ground invasions on Gaza City as a United Nations inquiry found Israel has committed genocide in Palestinian territories. Sakeik has nowhere to be deported to — though that didn’t stop the Trump administration from trying.

In addition to her husband and legal team, Sakeik said a sisterhood she formed while detained with other women helped her to survive the trauma of her experience in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. Now, she is using her platform to bring attention to the plight of women in detention, including the case of 32-year-old Palestinian Leqaa Kordia, the second Columbia University protester arrested this spring. Kordia, who did not attend Columbia University as a student but protested on its grounds in solidarity, has since been dubbed “the forgotten prisoner” while sitting in ICE detention for over six months.

The Barbed Wire spent several days with Sakeik. The following is reconstructed from her memory, as well as interviews with her husband, Shaikh, and her lawyers. Sakeik spoke in-depth about her time in detention to shed light on some of ICE’s increasingly scrutinized and legally dubious practices, which she described as stripping her of her humanity.

“Being detained was one of the hardest, most difficult challenges that I’ve had to face in my entire life. Physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually challenging,” Sakeik said. “I wouldn’t wish this upon anybody, not even my worst enemy.”

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said “any claim that there is a lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.”

The statement continued: “Meals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE. Why does the media continue to fall for the sob stories of illegal aliens in detention and villainize ICE law enforcement?”

‘There’s no place else that ward can call home’

The United States once seemed to Sakeik like a break from conservative Saudi Arabia, where she spent the first few years of her life before her family moved to Texas seeking asylum in 2010. Her parents’ asylum request was denied, but the family was granted an order of supervision, which allows noncitizens awaiting deportation or other immigration proceedings to stay in the U.S. without being held in detention. Their order required annual check-ins, among other conditions.

In Garland, Sakeik, who is Muslim, had “the most beautiful, craziest childhood,” with her tight-knit Middle Eastern family. As a middle child, Sakeik said she “wanted to do everything that my older sister did.”

“I wanted to breathe the same air she was breathing.”

Sakeik was a model student. She took an interest in photography in the 9th grade, when a teacher, who she affectionately called Mamma Donna, handed her a camera. She stayed late to use a school laptop to learn Photoshop and attended football practice and games, taking action shots she’d sell to the players and their parents for $1.

Sakeik graduated early from University of Texas at Arlington in 2023, with a bachelor’s degree in journalism and a minor in Arabic, to build her photography business.

All the while, her annual check-ins with ICE had become routine: She went to the same ICE processing center every year for 13 years. ICE officers there remembered her. One even congratulated her on graduating from college.

Sakeik met Shaikh briefly in college. He later hired her to take professional head shots for his job at Fidelity Investments.

“Headshot sessions take me like, max, 25 minutes. This took two hours,” Sakeik said.

They got engaged in September 2024, then wed in Dallas in January in front of more than 300 guests. The happy couple beamed at each other, hands interlocked underneath twinkle lights as their families looked on.

They chose the U.S. Virgin Islands for their honeymoon destination. Sakeik said she picked it because of the gorgeous views. But it also kept her in line with one of the conditions of her order of supervision — she must remain in a U.S. territory.

In a photo taken in St. Thomas, Sakeik smiles, relaxed, on the edge of a pier in a white silk dress. After nine days of watching glorious sunsets over the water, Sakeik and Shaikh packed and headed out from their hotel, back home.

But when they arrived at the St. Thomas airport, Sakeik was flagged by a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent who asked if she was a U.S. citizen. Sakeik tried to explain that she had an order of supervision that allowed her to legally stay in the country, and had been in compliance with ICE for years. She said she showed him notice of her next reporting date with ICE as proof. It didn’t seem to matter.

When she asked why she was detained, Sakeik said the agent told her it was because she’s not a U.S. citizen.

Photos of Sakeik’s life — her graduation, wedding, and honeymoon — were soon splashed across news sites the world over, as her husband pleaded for her release.

During her detainment, Sakeik was shuttled between three facilities, each of which she said suffered from overcrowding and hygiene issues. In some, there were cockroaches, ants, grasshoppers, and spiders, which bit the women, Sakeik said after she was released.

Sakeik’s legal team argued that the U.S. government did not have the right to deport her due to protections offered to Palestinians under a deferred enforced departure memorandum enacted by the Biden administration. Because of the Israeli response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack carried out by Hamas, the Biden administration determined that civilians were in danger in Gaza and deferred the removal of Palestinians in the United States until Aug. 13 of this year.

Yet, the Department of Homeland Security said they had the authority to detain her.

“Ward Sakeik chose to fly over international waters outside the U.S. customs zone and was then flagged by CBP trying to renter (sic) the continental U.S.,” McLaughlin, the assistant secretary, said in a statement.

Sakeik’s lawyers disagreed. Maria Kari, an attorney on Sakeik’s legal team, emphasized that her client had a right to travel to U.S. territory.

“We all have these documents that we take for granted that allow us to get on flights and see the world, but this is something that Sakeik has never had,” Kari added. “There is no country that claims her to be a citizen of that country. There is no place else that Sakeik can call home.”

‘This is just the beginning’

By the time the van reached what seemed to be an old pink adobe hotel, Sakeik was indignant. Only later did she learn she was at the Broward Transitional Center in Pompano Beach, Florida.

The staff, Sakeik said, were disrespectful — “they literally bullied us.” The food was disgusting. “I wouldn’t even feed it to dogs,” she said. And it was freezing cold.

“I started getting extreme depression. I couldn’t walk, I couldn’t talk, I felt paralyzed,” Sakeik said. “I would cry the entire time. I started having panic attacks.”

By her third week in Broward, Sakeik said she realized she needed to get into a routine. She started working out with old dance DVDs. And she made friends: She bonded with a woman from Slovakia and two Muslim women in her dorm.

Meanwhile, Sakeik and her legal team filed a green card application, and a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court. They argued she was being wrongfully detained, in violation of the Biden administration’s deferred enforcement memo.

As her lawyers continued to work on her case back in Texas, Sakeik began making preparations for Ramadan, a sacred time for Muslims that typically involves fasting, communal prayer, and reflection. She said she got the OK from officers and the art department to hang lanterns and a banner she made that read, “Ramadan Kareem.” Later, she was instructed to take it all down.

“I’m celebrating the holiday that’s supposed to be the closest with families alone in a place that I don’t know, I don’t have family around me, and you took down my decorations,” Sakeik said. “I started crying, but I didn’t let it get to me.”

Instead, she decided to host a dinner. Sakeik used commissary funds for ingredients, and with help from a friend from Taiwan, she made sushi from crushed Doritos, tortillas, and uncooked Maruchan noodles.

That same night, Sakeik said she was told to pack her bags. “Baby, you are going back home! You’re going to Dallas,’” Sakeik remembered an officer telling her. She left her shampoo and conditioner along with her remaining food as a parting gift to her roommates. But as she waited with a handful of other women downstairs, a friend turned to her: “I don’t think we’re going home. We’re being transferred. This is just the beginning.”

‘Just like human trafficking’

Sakeik and her friend spent two days in handcuffs as they were transferred to Texas, first to a facility in Harlingen, then El Valle Detention Center outside of McAllen.

The facility was packed, Sakeik said, and covered in dust. Every day, more women were shuffled in, processed, and then taken away, “literally, just like human trafficking.” By the time she left, Sakeik said there were 100 detained women in each of the three women’s dorms. There was no privacy, even in bathrooms where they showered six at a time.

She faced a greater language barrier at El Valle since many detainees only spoke Spanish.

Still, she managed to make friends. She got close with another Muslim woman. They cooked together, ate together, prayed together.

“It’s very normal to bond off of trauma. So a lot of friendships are being made in there,” Sakeik said. “You have to now make family there, because God knows how long it’s gonna take for you to see your actual family.”

On June 11, Sakeik was told she was being transferred, though not where.

“I didn’t even pack my stuff. I was too busy saying goodbye to all the girls,” she said.

Her newfound friends cried, cheered her on, and helped her gather her things: “It was a beautiful sisterhood.”

She was put in a van and taken to Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, where other women told her they’d already spent four days in an overcrowded intake room. Later, she was shuffled to another room, where Sakeik said she slept on the ground. The next day, Sakeik said ICE agents wrote numbers on their wrists — she was #4 — then boarded them onto a bus to Alliance Airport in Fort Worth.

When Sakeik saw that the Palestinian woman next to her had a #3 on her wrist, she said she knew she was being deported. She had only $45. She turned to the woman and said, “‘Can I please stay with you until my husband comes? Please?’ She’s like, ‘Absolutely. We have enough to buy a shawarma and to make a phone call.’”

However, with no explanation, Sakeik and the Palestinians on the bus were brought back to Prairieland. She later heard that Israel’s airspace may have been closed following their bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities.

Back at Prairieland, Sakeik met 32-year-old Leqaa Kordia.

Like Mahmoud Khalil, Kordia was arrested after protesting at Columbia University over the war in Gaza last year, though prosecutors later dropped the charges against her. Then, after President Donald Trump came into office threatening to deport protesters who are foreign students, Kordia was arrested in March in New Jersey. The Department of Homeland Security said she’d overstayed an expired student visa; her lawyers said she’s been detained for her pro-Palestinian activism.

Just a week earlier, Kordia had been confined to Prairieland while a federal court hearing in her case went on without her.

Both cases had made national news.

“I saw you on TV!” Kordia later said to Ward when the pair first met.

Ward said she could tell that Kordia — wrapped in a sweater — was sick. The fact that she was still so friendly was endearing to Sakeik. The pair became fast friends. They talked about growing up in Middle Eastern households, their favorite dresses, “girl talk, all that good stuff.”

For Sakeik, Prairieland was both the closest to — and furthest from — home. After the failed effort in mid-June, ICE attempted to deport Sakeik again on June 30.

By then, her lawyers had filed an emergency motion to keep her in the country, as well as another habeas petition in federal court for the Northern District of Texas. They asserted that the government had violated Sakeik’s due process by trying to deport her while deferred enforcement for Palestinians was still in effect. A judge in the case granted a temporary restraining order prohibiting her from being deported.

Sakeik’s husband and lawyers said that, despite the order, they had to argue with Prairieland staff over the phone to stop them from moving her again.

“Two days later, I was released,” Sakeik said. She later found out she had been, once again, only a hair’s breadth away from being deported.

‘They’re mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers’

Sakeik and her lawyers spoke at a press conference from the Wyndham Hotel in Irving on July 3 — fewer than 36 hours after she was finally released. The hotel was familiar; she’d done photoshoots at its wedding venue.

The specifics of Sakeik’s legal status are complex. She had a final order of deportation stemming from her parents’ asylum application years ago — which DHS said was part of the reason she was detained.

However, her lawyer, Maria Kari, said that the final order was issued when she was a child, and that it doesn’t mean immediate deportation. “You won’t be removed if there’s no place that accepts you, and there is no place that accepts Ward and her family,” Kari told The Barbed Wire. “They are stateless.”

Additionally, Kari said Sakeik has never had a credible fear interview — part of the asylum process allowing applicants to explain why they fear persecution or torture were they to be deported. Sakeik said she fears, in part, that no country will take her.

DHS said that “following her American husband and her filing the appropriate legal applications for her to remain in the country and become a legal permanent resident, she was released from ICE custody.”

Kari countered — “we don’t accept that statement, what they did was unlawful” — noting that Sakeik got preliminary approval on her green card application days before DHS tried to deport her for the second time. Still, she should be protected as her green card application process plays out, Kari said.

At the press conference, Sakeik summed up her case a different way: “I was criminalized for being stateless,” she said. “I didn’t choose to be stateless.”

Then she pivoted to her sisters — the women she met in detention, and who she is now focusing her efforts on supporting.

“I want to share with you the honor of those who I left behind,” Sakeik told reporters. “Women who come here for better lives are voiceless and helpless. A lot of these women don’t have the money for lawyers or media outreach. They come here to provide for their families.”

“They’re mothers, daughters, sisters, grandmothers,” she continued. “They’re superheroes. There are humans, and their lives hold value, and I will continue to fight with them.”

Sakeik’s return home was accomplished through the proper legal channels, but her wellbeing was only ensured by her friendships with the women who kept her company during detention. These women, from backgrounds both similar and wildly different from Sakeik’s, provided her a network of support.

“We bonded over trauma, over this thing we share,” Sakeik said.

When Sakeik was detained, her husband and attorneys started a social media page and a petition to present to their local congresswoman, which grew to more than 4,000 signatures. Shaikh also gathered testimonials from Sakeik’s mosque, professors, friends, teachers — anyone they could think of. Imam Omar Suleiman, the founding president of the Yagqeen Institute for Islamic Research, also shared Sakeik’s story to millions.

Since her release, Sakeik has paid that work forward.

She has become an outspoken critic of Trump’s immigration policies, namely relating to the broad criminalization of immigrants across ethnicities and backgrounds. But she’s also become an outspoken advocate for Leqaa Kordia, whom she calls her best friend, and whose case has been platformed by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Texas Civil Rights Project. In May, Kordia’s legal team told reporters that she hadn’t had access to halal meals, which meant she had lost nearly 50 pounds since her arrest in mid-March.

In June, Korida’s attorneys filed a petition to the court citing the “miserable conditions” in the Prairieland detention center, which was so crowded upon her arrival that she slept on the floor and developed “a severe rash,” reported The Dallas Morning News. Kordia’s attorneys have said the lack of hygiene at Prairieland “makes her feel unworthy of God,” the newspaper reported.

That same month, U.S. Magistrate Judge Rebecca Rutherford issued an opinion recommending that Korida be released from federal custody.

Still, as summer turns to fall, Kordia remains in detention.

In late August, Sakeik held a letter-writing event on Kordia’s behalf, which drew almost 100 supporters to a coffee shop in Irving.

“Inside, you hold onto the smallest things that can give you hope,” Sakeik said in a video posted on Instagram two weeks ago, urging others to send messages of support to Kordia. With no phones inside, letters matter more than ever, Sakeik explained.

“To know that you have voices behind you” can make all the difference in the world, she continued. “People assuring her that they care for her and she’s not alone — and that she will never be alone. There’s people behind her.”",https://19thnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/palestinian_woman_ICE.jpeg,N,,2025-09-22 11:59:44.104986

ACLU argues practice violates Wisconsin law Detainers are based on administrative warrants, which are often signed by immigration officials with the Department of Homeland Security.
“ICE calls these warrants,” Schwarz said, describing the documents that lead to immigration detainers.
Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s GOP-controlled Assembly passed a bill that would withhold money from counties that don’t comply with immigration detainers.
“The unlawful collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE destabilizes communities and erodes trust in law enforcement,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, in a news release announcing the ACLU’s lawsuit.","The American Civil Liberties Union is suing five Wisconsin sheriffs over their practice of holding people in jail at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The group filed a petition with the Wisconsin Supreme Court this week on behalf of the Milwaukee-based immigration rights group Voces de La Frontera.

The petition asks the court to take up the case directly. That’s because Wisconsinites need statewide clarity on the issue, said Hannah Schwarz, an attorney with the ACLU of Wisconsin.

“There’s this really inconsistent patchwork of enforcement affecting the public rights of individuals,” she said.

In the first seven months of this year, ICE sent more than 700 requests to local jails across Wisconsin, asking them to hold someone for an additional 48 hours after that person was set to be released, according to the lawsuit.

Most, but not all, Wisconsin sheriffs are choosing to comply with those requests, which are known as detainers.

But the suit specifically names the sheriffs of Walworth, Kenosha, Brown, Marathon and Sauk counties as defendants because those counties have been among those carrying out the highest numbers of detainers in Wisconsin, Schwarz said.

ACLU argues practice violates Wisconsin law

Detainers are based on administrative warrants, which are often signed by immigration officials with the Department of Homeland Security. If detainers are honored, someone could end up staying in jail even after they post their bond or after criminal charges against them are dropped.

The goal of detainers is to give immigration agents more time to pick someone up if that person is suspected of being in the country illegally.

But the ACLU contends those requests do not give jails the legal authority to keep holding someone after that person was supposed to be let out.

“ICE calls these warrants,” Schwarz said, describing the documents that lead to immigration detainers. “We do not consider them warrants. Under Wisconsin state law, a warrant is something issued by a court or a judge. That is not happening here.”

The ACLU argues that under Wisconsin law, jailing someone for extra time because of a detainer amounts to a new arrest. According to the ACLU, that arrest needs to be authorized by a judicial warrant, in which a court determines that there is probable cause.

Schwarz argues the current practice of granting detainers doesn’t have enough checks and balances, and it can lead to the wrong people being targeted for deportation.

“In ICE detainer cases, there’s no neutral third party, there’s no judge,” Schwarz said. “That has led to a system where people can get wrongfully caught up in this dragnet.”

Marathon County Sheriff Chad Billeb declined to comment on the lawsuit because it’s a pending legal matter. Other sheriffs named as defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Earlier this year, Wisconsin’s GOP-controlled Assembly passed a bill that would withhold money from counties that don’t comply with immigration detainers.

Even if it clears the Republican-led Senate, that bill is likely be killed by a veto from Democratic Gov. Tony Evers.

Republican backers have argued the proposal would protect public safety by compelling local authorities to cooperate with federal law enforcement.

Opponents, however, have said such requirements would take away local decision-making. And they’ve said it’s a mistake to treat local cops as an extension of immigration enforcement.

“The unlawful collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE destabilizes communities and erodes trust in law enforcement,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera, in a news release announcing the ACLU’s lawsuit. “(It) has a chilling effect on victims and the vulnerable who might otherwise seek help from the police.",https://wislawjournal.com/files/2025/08/new-gavel.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 12:00:23.553664

When including the removal of wildlife habitat protections—on public and private lands—the total impact of the rollbacks stretch across more than 175 million acres of U.S. land, an area larger than California, Florida, and Georgia combined.

Earlier this summer, public opposition forced Congress to remove language from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that would have sold millions of acres of public lands. Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s actions will directly affect far more states and regions of the country than Congress’ proposed sell-off, with more than 70 percent of U.S. states feeling the impact of these rollbacks.

At the same time, the Trump administration is also increasing sales that will hand corporations primary control of public lands, including those lands stripped of their conservation protections.

“Even after Americans loudly rejected attempts to sell off public lands, the Trump administration is rolling forward with actions to transfer control of massive amounts of public lands for corporate profits,” said Drew McConville, senior fellow for Conservation Policy at CAP and co-author of the report. “These efforts to unprotect and sell out public lands are wildly out of step with what the public wants.”

Trump administration actions to eliminate or weaken protections for public lands include:

Removing protections for some of the most intact national forest lands

Opening sensitive Arctic wildlife habitat for drilling

Eliminating restrictions on mining for ecologically sensitive lands and waters

Erasing conservation requirements and habitat protections

The new analysis represents a conservative estimate of affected lands and does not quantify the impacts from public lands attacks on the horizon—such as potential erasure of national monuments—or the widespread impacts of rewriting regulations and policy to favor oil and gas, mining, and timber extraction across publicly managed lands.

Since late December, J. Dale Shoemaker, a reporter for the Investigative Post, a nonprofit newsroom based in Buffalo, has filed seventeen Freedom of Information Act requests with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Customs and Border Protection to guide his deep dives into federal law enforcement activity, deportation actions, and ICE detention centers in upstate New York. In return, he says, he has gotten only documents that were redacted beyond comprehension, or nothing at all. “I have not received a satisfactory response to a single one of them,” Shoemaker said.

Ryanne Mena, of the Los Angeles Daily News, sent ICE a FOIA request on January 24 for all grievance forms filed by detainees at facilities in Adelanto, California, between 2016 and early 2025. Nearly eight months later, she said, she’s received nothing: ICE “has failed to provide me with an estimated date of production despite repeated requests.”

Monica Eng, a reporter for Axios, filed a FOIA request with ICE in February, seeking data she hoped would inform stories about where and why agents were apprehending people in Illinois. At first, she said, ICE officials appeared willing to cooperate. But by March, ICE had denied Eng’s request in full, citing “ongoing law enforcement investigations.” Axios filed an administrative appeal with ICE, but hasn’t received a response. “I have filed a lot of FOIAs, and my requests to the Trump Department of Homeland Security have been some of the least successful and least transparent,” Eng said.

ICE and CBP have become centerpieces of President Donald Trump’s quest to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from US soil through aggressive law enforcement tactics and billions of dollars in new federal funding. But CJR spoke to nearly two dozen reporters, editors, and other people at news organizations and open-records watchdog groups across the country who have filed FOIA requests with the agencies, and who say that ICE and CBP officials routinely deny or ignore those requests. The agencies have never been particularly open with the press, but many reporters believe that their experience is part of an enhanced effort by the Trump administration to conceal immigration agency operations, even in possible violation of federal law. Some also described the agencies’ press offices as functionally useless, with media officials providing few, if any, answers to even their most basic of inquiries.

Chioma Chukwu, the executive director of American Oversight, a nonprofit organization that advocates for public access to government records, said ICE and Border Protection have an “abysmal” track record of transparency. Of 137 requests her group has filed with ICE and CBP over the course of 2025, there has been a “substantive response” to just one—“and that took almost seven months,” Chukwu said. “ICE and CBP remain among the slowest and least transparent agencies we deal with, routinely flouting FOIA’s requirements and denying the public timely access to information about their operations.”

This stonewalling comes at a time when ICE—and its parent organization, the Department of Homeland Security—has repeatedly cracked down on journalism about its operations. The department has described the video recording of ICE agents as “violence,” with a department spokesperson promising to prosecute those who “illegally harass ICE agents to the fullest extent of the law.” Multiple reporters have been arrested or injured while covering protests or anti-ICE rallies, including Salvadoran journalist Mario Guevaram, who was detained while covering a rally in Georgia in June, and Australian reporter Lauren Tomasi, who was shot in the leg with a rubber bullet as she reported on an anti-ICE protest in Los Angeles. In early September, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction ordering DHS to stop using “nonlethal” weapons against journalists. “Under the guise of protecting the public, federal agents have endangered large numbers of peaceful protesters, legal observers, and journalists—as well as the public that relies on them to hold their government accountable,” the judge wrote. “The First Amendment demands better.”

Some news outlets told CJR they believe that, in ICE’s and CBP’s handling of their FOIA requests, the agencies are themselves violating federal law by ignoring statutory deadlines or failing to respond altogether. By law, government agencies must determine within twenty business days whether to fulfill or deny a FOIA request and “immediately notify” the requester of their decision. Agencies may also extend this deadline because of “unusual circumstances.” If fulfilling a FOIA request requires significant time, agencies are required by law to offer requesters an “opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request.” Requesters have the right to appeal agencies’ FOIA determinations, and if all else fails, they may sue the government in federal court.

Several media organizations have done just that this year, including the New York Times, the Washington Post, and The Guardian. “Suing is the process at this point because they literally don’t respond any other way,” said Mick Dumke, investigative editor for Block Club Chicago, a nonprofit news organization that sued ICE in May to obtain federal records about immigration enforcement actions in the Chicago area during Trump’s first ten days in office. In Block Club’s case, legal action worked, at least in part: ICE released a list of area detentions and bookings but redacted key information such as detainees’ names, times of arrest, and the locations where they were being held. Block Club Chicago’s lawsuit is ongoing.

“ICE has long had an official policy to not comply with FOIA, and we have had to file lawsuits to obtain access,” said Susan Long, a cofounder of the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which has itself filed numerous immigration-related FOIA requests this year. “The issue with the Border Patrol is primarily a problem with inadequate staffing,” she added. Asked about her organization’s success rate in obtaining responsive documents in a reasonable period of time, Long said, “Close to zero.”

In response to a series of written questions, ICE spokesperson Miguel Alvarez said in early September that his agency was working to “have some information to you shortly.” As of publication, ICE had not provided any information. CBP officials did not respond to repeated phone and email inquiries.

The two agencies do post some of what they call “essential records and information” in online FOIA reading rooms, as well as “accountability and transparency” or “library” webpages. In recent days, for example, ICE has released detention facility contract documents and spreadsheets listing details about arrests and deportations. But the spreadsheets lack key information about the people involved, such as their names, birth dates, and case numbers—data that would typically be available in police reports generated by local or state agencies. In CBP’s online library, a section for “body-worn camera video releases” contains only two such videos from 2025.

At the nonprofit newsroom CalMatters, reporters Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos did obtain a spreadsheet of the criminal histories—or, in many cases, the lack thereof—of CBP detainees in Kern County, California. “I basically annoyed them into giving us the spreadsheet,” Fry said. After their story came out, the government went cold: Fry says she hasn’t been able to reach FOIA officials by phone since late April, despite many attempts across multiple other FOIA requests. Reporters Doug Livingston of the Marshall Project, Evan Goodenow of the Loudoun Times-Mirror in Virginia, and Nancy Guan at WUSF-FM in Tampa described similar radio silence in respect to their FOIA requests.

Some reporters say that in the wake of limited government responses, they’re doubling down on shoe-leather reporting and community engagement to tell immigration stories. Bloomberg News reporter Mike McDonald filed a FOIA request early this year with ICE, seeking records about charter flights used to remove migrants from the United States. The agency denied his request for expedited processing, “and I never heard back after that,” he said. The story he ultimately wrote—“Airline at Center of Brazil Fiasco Key to Trump’s Deportations”—relied on the airline’s public financial filings, rather than documents obtained by FOIA.

Jenna McMurtry, of Jackson Hole Community Radio, took another approach: stifled by a “frustrating” lack of communication from ICE about a local enforcement operation, including no response to a FOIA request, she wrote an article and broadcast a report in March about that very obfuscation. “It was greatly appreciated by our audience,” McMurtry said. “We want to be able to understand who ICE wants when they come to town.” (In mid-September, ICE finally produced records responsive to McMurtry’s FOIA request, but they’re “mostly redacted,” she said. Her newsroom is still considering next steps.)

But for many, the grind of daily newswork or limited resources makes protracted FOIA fights impractical. “I haven’t followed up. Way too busy with other stuff,” said Denver Post reporter John Aguilar, when asked about his February FOIA request seeking information about ICE detainees arrested by the agency’s Denver field office. Mark Keierleber, an investigative reporter for The 74, an education-focused digital news site, said, “For a small, nonprofit outlet like The 74, filing FOIA lawsuits really isn’t in the cards. Sometimes I wish it was.”

Luke Harold, a reporter for the San Diego Union-Tribune, said he had a “productive conversation” with one of ICE’s FOIA officials in February about amending a request seeking records about tunnels below the US-Mexico border. But, Harold said, he hasn’t heard anything since. He filed the same request with Border Protection, which he said hasn’t communicated at all save for an automated email receipt of his request. “The only aspect of FOIA that has been efficient, for me, is rejection,” Harold said.",https://www.cjr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ice-black-box-bw.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 12:00:00.887312

Trump has threatened to declare a new national emergency in Washington, D.C., after city leaders confirmed that the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) would stop cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Trump has threatened to declare a new national emergency in Washington, D.C., after city leaders confirmed that the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) would stop cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

The warning comes after Trump invoked emergency powers under the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in August, federalizing the MPD and deploying thousands of National Guard troops to combat what he described as a wave of crime.

The order expired Sep 10., when congressional Republicans failed to extend it, returning control of the department to Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration.

Mayor Bowser announced the shift in approach during a press conference addressing the city.

“The federal government [was informed] that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with ICE in removing and relocating illegal aliens,” Bowser said.

She added that if federal oversight continued, the city would be unable to maintain the decreased crime in the long term.

“Crime would eventually come roaring back,” Bowser said.

Trump responded on Truth Social by blasting Bowser’s decision and pledging to reassert federal authority.

“To the people and businesses of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!” he wrote.

The dispute highlights a long-running tension in the capital over local autonomy. Under the Home Rule Act, Congress and the President maintain broad authority to override D.C. laws and policing, a power Mayor Bowser has repeatedly criticized.

“D.C. residents deserve to govern their own city without interference from Congress or the President. Our local leaders know what is best for our communities, and federal micromanagement undermines that,” Bowser said.

Civil liberties groups argue that Trump’s framing of immigration enforcement as crime prevention is misleading.

Monica Hopkins, executive director of the ACLU of D.C., does not believe local police should cooperate with ICE.

“Immigration enforcement is not the role of local police — and when law enforcement aligns itself with ICE, it fosters fear among D.C. residents, regardless of citizenship status,” Hopkins said.

Advocates also warned that federal crackdowns often destabilize immigrant communities.

Casey Carter Swegman of the Tahirih Justice Center said the increased federal presence will not make people feel safer.

“This situation is tearing families apart and increasing fear and mistrust between communities,” Swegman said.

Some grassroots organizations argue the policy disproportionately targets vulnerable groups.

Eduardo Zelaya, organizing director at CASA, said he is concerned that the administration’s crackdown does not focus on legal status or criminal activity, but rather seems to specifically target minority communities in Washington, D.C.

“This is really alarming … This is not about you having a legal status or you being a criminal; this is completely targeting minorities in Washington, D.C.,” Zelaya said.

Trump and his republican allies in congress point to the results of the August surge as proof of success.

The decline in crime during the federal crackdown aligns with a broader downward trend that began before the intervention. Data from the Metropolitan Police Department shows that violent crime in Washington, D.C., has steadily decreased over the past several years, suggesting that the recent drop is part of a longer-term pattern rather than solely the result of increased federal enforcement.

President Trump’s administration reported more than 2,300 arrests, though an Associated Press review found over 40 percent were related to immigration enforcement rather than violent crime.

Some officials from outside the District supported the Aug. 11 emergency declaration to federalize D.C. enforcement.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine agreed to keep 150 Ohio National Guard members stationed in D.C. through November 2025, citing ongoing security needs.

As the debate continues, the standoff underscores the fragile balance between federal oversight and D.C.’s push for greater self-governance.

“Our North Star is protecting Home Rule and D.C.’s autonomy. D.C. residents, we are going to continue to make the right decisions — the tough decisions — and we are going to get to the other side of this,” Bowser said.

With Congress now considering a series of bills that could further limit home rule, the U.S. capital remains caught between two visions of public safety — one driven by federal immigration priorities and another shaped by local demands for autonomy.

Indiscriminate immigration detention is also expensive.","The Trump administration is building a multi-billion dollar deportation industrial complex to meet its reported goal of arresting 3,000 immigrants a day—more than one million immigrants a year. Despite the administration’s claims that it is targeting “the worst of the worst,” Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data show the great majority of immigrants in detention—more than 70 percent in early September—have no criminal record. In its haste to hit the historically high target, ICE is even arresting and locking up U.S. citizens.

If not criminals, who exactly is the administration arresting and detaining?

According to the Cato Institute’s analysis of ICE data, between Oct.1, 2024 and June 16, 2025, ICE arrested approximately 204,000 people. Around 65 percent, or 133,000 individuals, had no criminal record at all but were being held in detention because the government claimed they do not have a lawful reason to stay in the United States. Compared to the first year of the first Trump administration, arrests of noncriminals have increased 500 percent.

Many immigrants with no criminal background entered the United States lawfully or were protected from deportation at the time of their arrest, but the government now seeks to end their status. They may have been allowed to enter the country under a process called “parole,” which permits individuals to stay in the country temporarily at the government’s discretion, typically for humanitarian reasons. They could have been granted temporary protected status, which applies to certain individuals who face unsafe conditions in their home country; or they could have come to a port of entry and requested protection from persecution or torture. Others could have entered unlawfully—an act that under the law is confusingly both a criminal act and permissible if the person enters to apply for asylum; or overstayed a visa—an act that qualifies them for deportation under civil law but is not a criminal offense.

ICE does not publish data about the percentage of people in each category, but the Pew Research Center estimates that as of 2023, 5.6 million immigrants—approximately 40 percent of the 14 million immigrants in the country without permanent status and thus categorized by DHS as “without documentation”—had some form of limited status or protection from removal, such as a temporary protected status, parole, or a pending asylum application.

In fact, it is possible that far more than 40 percent of those arrested and detained have some legal protection from deportation. To meet its aggressive target, the government is likely pursuing immigrants who are the easiest to locate—such as those who already gave the government their address when they applied for some form of protection. And we know that the administration is targeting people who are going through normal, lawful activities like taking their kids to school, attending church, going to work, renewing a visa, going to an ICE office for a required check in with an immigration officer, or appearing in immigration court. Indeed, the sharpest growth in ICE arrests is those without a criminal record.

Cato concluded that ICE classifies 35 percent of the individuals it arrested as having a criminal offense on their records, with only 7 percent convicted of a violent offense. The upshot is that at least 65 percent of the people ICE is keeping behind bars are being detained without a public safety rationale. Instead of focusing detention resources on people who could pose a significant public safety risk, the administration is largely locking up immigrants who pose little to no risk, separating them from their families, employers, and communities.

In its zeal to arrest as many people as fast as possible, ICE has also unlawfully detained U.S. citizens, despite having no authority to do so. Northwestern University Professor Jacqueline Stevens, a scholar of deportation, analyzed cases in two detention centers from 2006 to 2008 and found that one percent of people in immigration detention were citizens. Assuming that percentage has held steady, that would mean over 2,000 American citizens locked up by ICE this fiscal year alone. The actual number may be even higher; Stevens only counted detainees who were later confirmed by a judge to be a citizen, excluding many released before reaching court.

Keeping immigrants with no criminal record behind bars has led to significant overcrowding, deaths, illness, and hunger. Immigrants in a New York facility sued the government, claiming they were not given enough food, were denied access to medical services and their attorneys, were not given soap, toothbrushes or menstrual supplies, and were required to sleep on the floor in overcrowded rooms. The court granted plaintiffs’ injunction and attributed the conditions to the administration’s ongoing policy of detaining immigrants to the maximum extent possible: “the heat remains on, and the temperature is likely to rise.”

With ICE rushing to open new offices nationwide, the deportation machine is expanding its reach and capacity, further accelerating arrests and detentions. The effects of large-scale immigration detention on immigrants, their families, their communities, and the U.S. economy will take months or years to measure.

Indiscriminate immigration detention is also expensive. American taxpayers pay approximately $152 dollars a day per person to keep immigrants detained, thus keeping tens of thousands of immigrants who pose little to no public safety threat in detention for millions of dollars a day. Less intrusive alternatives to detention, such as the assignment of a case manager, cost as little as $4 a day. Assigning a case manager to the 65 percent of immigrants without a criminal record would save taxpayers nearly $5.5 billion each year, and case management programs have resulted in nearly perfect compliance. Under one program, 99 percent of immigrants showed up for a required appointment with an ICE officer and 100 percent appeared for court hearings.

Detaining citizens and immigrants without a public safety rationale is inconsistent with American values of liberty or fairness. It is also a waste of taxpayer money.",https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-22335615181.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 10:57:22.484678

Homeland Security touted information obtained through drones in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on June 10.
Five Democrats on the House Oversight Committee called the deployment a “gross abuse of authority” and asked Homeland Security to explain what had occurred.
“My bill to ban military surveillance drones over our cities puts Trump and his administration in check,” said Gomez.
“Los Angeles will not stand by while the federal government turns weapons of war against our residents,” said Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who introduced the resolution.","When MQ-9 Predator drones flew over anti-ICE protests in Los Angeles this summer, it was the first time they had been dispatched to monitor demonstrations on U.S. soil since 2020, and their use reflects a change in how the government is choosing to deploy the aircraft once reserved for surveilling the border and war zones.

Previous news reports said the drones sent by the Department of Homeland Security conducted surveillance on the weekend of June 7 over thousands of protesters demonstrating against raids conducted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The Predators flew over Los Angeles for at least four more days, according to tracking experts who identified the flights through air traffic control tower communications and images of a Predator in flight.

Those amateur sleuths, who monitor flight traffic and identified the first flight, which was confirmed by Customs and Border Protection, shared their findings on social media.

Defenders of using drones to monitor protests say the aircraft, with their high-tech capabilities, can provide authorities useful and detailed information in real time. Human rights advocates fear the new policy will impinge on civil rights.

The drones, which fly at around 20,000 feet to conduct surveillance, can beam a live video feed to various government agencies — ICE, the military and more . The MQ designation refers to the drone’s abilities and function. In military parlance, M means multi-use and Q indicates it’s an unmanned aerial vehicle.

When asked about the additional days of flights over Los Angeles, Homeland Security did not directly address the questions but said the flights were meant to protect police and military.

“CBP’s Air and Marine Operations (AMO) has provided both Manned and Unmanned aerial support to federal law enforcement partners conducting operations in the Greater Los Angeles area,” the department said in a statement.

“Both platforms provide an unparalleled ability with Electro-optical/infrared sensors and video downlink capabilities that provide situational awareness and communications support that enhance officer safety,” the statement added.

Homeland Security touted information obtained through drones in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on June 10. The post included footage of vehicles on fire and protesters squaring off with law enforcement personnel, apparently to show why it was necessary for the Trump administration to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles.

“WATCH: DHS drone footage of LA rioters,” the post read. “This is not calm. This is not peaceful. California politicians must call off their rioting mob.”

The post was dated June 10, but it was not clear if the video was from a Predator drone.

Supporters of civil liberties are asking why this equipment, which has been used to drop laser-guided bombs on targets in countries like Afghanistan, is being used for domestic issues.

The deployment of Predators over protesters is a significant departure from the U.S. government’s policy not to fly the drones over demonstrations, to avoid the perception they are spying on 1st Amendment rights activity, U.S. officials said.

The last time Homeland Security sent a Predator to fly over protesters, according to U.S. government officials, was in Minneapolis during the 2020 protests against the killing of George Floyd by a police officer later convicted of his murder.

Five Democrats on the House Oversight Committee called the deployment a “gross abuse of authority” and asked Homeland Security to explain what had occurred.

At times the drones are requested by law enforcement or other authorities to fly over a region, say, to help monitor forest fires, or to provide surveillance for the Super Bowl, officials said.

The Predators come equipped with cutting-edge infrared heat sensors and high-definition video cameras, and can track scores of individuals within a 15-nautical-mile radius.

The drone uses an artificial intelligence program, called Vehicle and Dismount Exploitation Radar, or VaDER, to detect small objects — a human being, a rabbit, even a bird in flight. The infrared sensors can identify heat signatures even inside some buildings.

In response to the drone flights over Los Angeles, Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-Los Angeles) introduced a bill in July that would restrict Predator drones and other unmanned aircraft from being deployed by the U.S. government over demonstrators.

“My bill to ban military surveillance drones over our cities puts Trump and his administration in check,” said Gomez. “This is not just about Los Angeles, this affects the entire country. I refuse to allow Trump to use these weapons of war, capable of carrying bombs, as tools for law enforcement against civilians.”

On Sept. 16, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously approved a resolution endorsing Gomez’s Ban Military Drones Spying on Civilians Act.

“Los Angeles will not stand by while the federal government turns weapons of war against our residents,” said Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who introduced the resolution. “Spying on people engaged in peaceful protest is unconstitutional, dangerous and a direct attack on democracy.”

The drones were first brought to the U.S. southern border in 2005 and retrofitted for surveillance operations. Homeland Security deployed the drones to fly the length of the 2,000-mile, U.S.-Mexico border, searching for drug traffickers and groups of undocumented migrants.

Just an hour south of Tucson lies Ft. Huachuca, one of four MQ-9 drone bases from which the drones deploy along the southern border and into the interior of the U.S.

As with the MQ-9, military-grade technology often finds its way into the interior of the country, experts say.

“It is tested in war zones, the border, tested in cities along the border and tested in the interior of the country,” said Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a privacy rights organization. “That tends to be the trajectory we see.”

With a drop in migrant crossings into the United States, experts anticipate drones will be deployed more often over demonstrations in the coming years.

“If somebody in the Trump administration decides there’s a need to use drones in the interior over U.S. citizens, resources won’t be an issue,” said Adam Isaacson, who covers national security for the Washington Office of Latin America, a human rights research group. “Because there’s just not that much to monitor at the border.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a29d403/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+160/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff2%2F4d%2F5d5d97e149efb3a8b27a778cf5ec%2Fdrone-policy.JPEG,N,,2025-09-22 09:57:18.888924

The United Nations also has overseen effective responses to countless humanitarian crises, sparing countless lives.
The administration shares the mistaken, though dominant, view in conservative and MAGA circles that the United Nations is intrinsically biased against the United States.
Whether it is privacy protections from AI systems, conditions in the workplace, or averting another pandemic, the American people have a direct interest in the United Nations.
Just as at home, the Trump administration is selling out Americans, their values, and interests at the United Nations.","Much has been said about the demise of the so-called rules-based international order since President Trump took office for the second time. Even before the second Trump administration began, the United Nation’s uneven responses in Ukraine and Gaza were generating questions about the integrity of this order. To be clear, descriptions of the post-World War II international system were often more aspirational than real. International law has been inconsistently applied, and many countries—particularly the great powers—have freely trespassed on these norms when it has been expedient. There have been extended periods in which veto-wielding U.N. Security Council members, the permanent five, have gridlocked the body. If the General Assembly has been more active, that is in part because it lacks any material enforcement power.

Yet, it would be unfair to consider the United Nations a failure analogous to the League of Nations. In addition to fears of mutually assured destruction; the comparative stability of bipolarity as opposed to multipolarity; and an era of American hegemony, the United Nations deserves at least some credit for the absence of great-power war—the Korean War being the only potential exception—in the latter half of the 20th century and into the 21st. The United Nations also has overseen effective responses to countless humanitarian crises, sparing countless lives. And, perhaps most importantly, the alphabet soup of technical “specialized agencies” that most Americans do not even know exist have made life safer, healthier, and more prosperous for people on every continent, including Americans.

Tragically, if predictably, none of this seems to matter to the Trump administration. The administration shares the mistaken, though dominant, view in conservative and MAGA circles that the United Nations is intrinsically biased against the United States. The conspiratorially minded subscribe to the fever dream that the United Nations is a world government in waiting, primed to dispossess Americans of their constitutional rights. More sober voices in the administration are fixated on the limitations of the United Nations and the amount the United States expends on annual dues and voluntary contributions, personifying Oscar Wilde’s definition of a “cynic” as “a man who knows the price of everything, and the value of nothing.”

While a complete withdrawal from the U.N. system does not appear to be on the Trump administration’s agenda, it is pursuing a series of initiatives to radically scale back U.S. involvement in ways that will harm both America and Americans. First, the administration launched a comprehensive review of the U.S. role in all international organizations, which was scheduled to be completed last month. Though we do not yet know the outcome, the expectation is that the administration will decide to exit at least some international bodies it deems to be less relevant to U.S. interests—perhaps the Food and Agriculture Organization or even the U.N. Development Programme. This a la carte approach to membership in U.N. bodies may seem like sensible cost cutting, but it ignores the reality that a country’s actions (or inactions) in one organization can reverberate positively or negatively in another. In one recent example, the Trump administration failed to prevent a Chinese bid to host a meeting of the International Telecommunications Union, the organization responsible for regulating access to digital connectivity (something that impacts Americans on a daily basis), breaking a streak of U.S. victories in the organization.

Second, President Trump has already withdrawn from several U.N. bodies, preempting the conclusion of his administration’s review and undermining U.S. influence over important policies. This includes the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the U.N. Human Rights Council. UNESCO is responsible for, among other issues, setting global artificial intelligence standards and rules, funding Holocaust education, and promoting scientific cooperation on shared global threats. While the WHO’s performance during the COVID pandemic left much to be desired, it would be preposterous to suggest that Americans would be better protected from communicable diseases in the absence of an established coordination mechanism.

Third, the Trump administration has, so far, cut $1 billion in financial contributions to the United Nations through a congressional rescission and is seeking to claw back another $1 billion appropriated by Congress. Even worse, President Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request would withhold the annual mandatory contribution to the U.N. regular budget; zero out peacekeeping funding from more than $1 billion; and slash voluntary U.N. contributions by $1.2 billion. Together, these cuts would amount to more than $4 billion—and that does not include planned cuts for refugee and migration funding that are often implemented by the United Nations. Critically, the administration’s financial wrecking ball would not only affect the bodies from which the administration has withdrawn but also organizations in which the United States remains a member. The International Labor Organization (ILO) is just one of the more inexplicable examples. President Trump should explain to American workers how ceasing funding for a body dedicated to promoting labor standards around the world—averting a race to the bottom in employment conditions—helps those negatively affected by globalization.

As has been reported, the major U.S. rival in great power competition, China, has eagerly stepped into the breach created by the Trump administration’s international retrenchment. Beijing has succeeded in placing at least 39 Chinese nationals in U.N. positions, increasing its influence across a wide array of issues and bodies. China also made a $500 million contribution to the WHO after the administration’s withdrawal from that organization. As President Trump is seeking to exit peacekeeping missions, China has contributed more than 1,800 uniformed personnel to missions, while Chinese financial contribution now account for nearly a quarter of the U.N. peacekeeping budget. In many ways, Beijing’s response has created the worst of both worlds for Washington. China is supplanting the American role on the “cheap,” doing enough to overtake the United States, but not enough to ensure the same level of public goods and services to the international community.

Amid the deployment of the National Guard in American cities, brazen assaults on the First Amendment, and the denial of due process, Americans can be forgiven for being skeptical of the United Nation’s relevance to their lives. The reality, however, is not subject to interpretation: Every single American is affected by what happens outside U.S. borders and in global institutions. Whether it is privacy protections from AI systems, conditions in the workplace, or averting another pandemic, the American people have a direct interest in the United Nations. Just as at home, the Trump administration is selling out Americans, their values, and interests at the United Nations. Under this form of “leadership,” Americans will always come last—not first.",https://www.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/08/cap_social_share.png,N,,2025-09-22 11:59:25.410980

According to the Guardian, at least two refugee NGOs that support asylum seekers who received notices from the Home Office that they will be removed to France under a ‘one in, one out’ scheme have closed their offices after receiving ‘credible’ threats to their safety.

A statement from several organisations, such as Liberty, Care4Calais, Bail for Immigration Detainees, and lawyers, said organisations supporting migrants, refugees and asylum seekers had been the target of increased media reporting and social media attacks in the last few days.

'Divisive rhetoric, which fuels mistrust, misinformation and hostility towards migrants and migrant organisations, is placing our communities, staff and volunteers at serious risk. These attacks are not just words on a page - they have consequences. Communities are living in fear, our staff and volunteers are receiving abuse, and our offices are being targeted,' the statement said.

'The migration sector, already struggling with scarce resources, is now being forced to operate quietly, fearing that visibility will bring abuse or even physical danger.'

Illinois, where Chicago has become a focus of federal law enforcement and ICE activity, has seen ICE arrests increase 46% this year.
Minnesota, despite its similarities to Wisconsin in total population and number of Hispanic residents, has seen ICE arrests increase 95% this year.
But under Trump, Michigan ICE arrests increased 152%.
“But I do agree [about] the power of local communities being able to reject and say that we know what’s best for our local communities.","ICE arrests in Wisconsin from January to the end of July this year increased 22% compared to the same time period last year and most of that increase has come from federal authorities arresting people who have been charged with but not yet convicted of a crime, according to federal data compiled by the Deportation Data Project.

Advocacy groups say the increase in arrests has sown fear and confusion among the state’s immigrant communities, and the intensity of ICE’s tactics have drawn attention and controversy across the country. But Wisconsin has thus far avoided the full brunt of President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown compared to the state’s four midwestern neighbors.

Iowa, which of the five states had the lowest number of ICE arrests last year under President Joe Biden, has seen arrests increase 293% this year under Trump.

Illinois, where Chicago has become a focus of federal law enforcement and ICE activity, has seen ICE arrests increase 46% this year.

Minnesota, despite its similarities to Wisconsin in total population and number of Hispanic residents, has seen ICE arrests increase 95% this year.

Last year, Michigan and Wisconsin had nearly equal amounts of ICE arrests. But under Trump, Michigan ICE arrests increased 152%.

Luis Velasquez, statewide organizing director for Voces de la Frontera, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the administration’s tactics have caused fear to spread through immigrant communities across the state — even if the total number of arrests hasn’t increased as much as in other places. And while the numbers haven’t increased substantially, local law enforcement across the state has shown an increased willingness to devote resources to the federal immigration crackdown. The number of county sheriff’s offices participating in a federal collaboration program with ICE has jumped from nine to 14 this year.

“In many ways it is like a psychological warfare that this administration has launched,” Velasquez said.

Tim Muth, a staff attorney at the ACLU of Wisconsin, said the data can’t be used to predict future ICE activity in the state, but in the first eight months of the Trump administration, ICE is working with local law enforcement in ways that have terrified immigrants.

“We don’t want to speculate on individual statistics or on what the future plans of the Trump regime may be, but we can say that increased collaboration between local law enforcement and ICE is instilling a sense of fear and instability in Wisconsin’s immigrant communities,” Muth said in an email. “We know they are ramping up their deportation agenda, and they are relying on local authorities to make it happen.”

Trump was elected after running on a platform of “mass deportations” and taking advantage of a backlash against a spike in the number of people making claims for asylum at the U.S./Mexico border under President Joe Biden. But Velasquez said it feels like ICE’s increased role is doing nothing to address the real challenges of immigration policy.

“There isn’t this thoughtful, strategic conversation, to really solve these issues,” he said. “It has been very radical, the way that it’s been enforced. So on the ground people have lost that kind of sense of let’s talk about solutions. It feels very reactive. People are not shopping, with school started again, there’s fear about ICE going into schools. It’s charged with anxiety and fear. It’s unnecessary suffering that is being caused statewide.”

He points to instances in which people living in the country without legal authorization have been arrested after showing up for court dates or been accused of bizarre crimes by the federal government.

“What people are sensing in one way is this is a system that doesn’t make sense. It’s not working for us,” he said. “And then, on the other hand there’s people who are saying, ‘Well, I can be accused of any crime, and then I could just be detained.’”

The Trump administration and Department of Homeland Security officials have regularly claimed ICE is targeting “the worst of the worst,” rooting out violent criminals and gang members. But NBC5, a Chicago TV station, reported this week it could find no criminal record for people the department arrested on immigration charges, claiming they were violent offenders.

Across the Midwest the increase in ICE arrests has been driven by targeting people who have been charged but not convicted of crimes — a tactic that experts say violates due process and makes communities less safe.

In Wisconsin, under Biden, 56% of those arrested by ICE were convicted of a crime and 9% had pending criminal charges. This year under Trump, 60% of those arrested have been convicted of a crime and 24% have pending criminal charges.

That data includes cases such as Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, the Mexican immigrant who had appeared for a court date in Milwaukee County in a misdemeanor battery case when federal agents from ICE, the FBI and DEA arrived at the courthouse to arrest him. That arrest led to federal authorities charging Milwaukee County Judge Hannah Dugan with a felony for allegedly obstructing the arrest.

Nationally, 70.8% of people in ICE custody have no criminal convictions, according to data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

“ICE will continue to prioritize the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens who have committed violent crimes, ensuring our children are protected and justice is served,” the agency, which did not respond to a request for comment, said in a news release on Wednesday about its arrests of six individuals without legal documentation convicted of sex crimes in six different states.

While the administration emphasizes justice when it says it is targeting dangerous criminals, Muth said arrests of people not yet convicted damages the criminal justice system.

“Picking up persons on ICE detainers while charges are still pending subverts the criminal justice system and deprives persons of their right to trial,” he said. “We also remain deeply concerned about the ongoing erosion of due process, as immigrants across the country have been abruptly rounded up by masked agents, detained and arrested without explanation, all while their families are kept in the dark about what’s happening to them. These horrifying scenes point to the federal government’s willingness to ignore the rights of immigrants and betray fundamental principles of our immigration system.”

Luca Fagundes, a Green Bay-area immigration attorney, says ICE operating in courthouses is the “easy road” for rounding up immigrants because people have little choice to avoid a court date — even if the crime is as simple as driving without a license, which immigrants without legal authorization to live in the country are unable to obtain in Wisconsin.

“People are showing up to traffic court, and when their case is called their identity is confirmed, which makes it very easy for an ICE officer to detain them after leaving the courtroom,” Fagundes said in an email. “That person, who showed up for court (again, for perhaps something as simple as driving without a license) is now being arrested and detained by ICE. They will then be transferred to an ICE facility where they wait weeks or months for a bond hearing with an immigration judge. While in ICE custody waiting to see the immigration judge, they typically then miss the next court appearance they may have on their traffic court matter, and that results in a warrant for their arrest on that simple traffic matter.”

“It’s a domino effect of catastrophe for that individual,” she added, “and, if applicable, their family.”

Velasquez said the modest increase in arrests here in Wisconsin has triggered fear. But he said successful organizing efforts to protect migrant farm workers and prevent more law enforcement from signing agreements with ICE may have helped stave off raids on farms and, for now, helped keep Wisconsin’s immigrant workforce safer than workers in other states.

“There’s people who are being detained, so people are feeling it, regardless of the data,” he said. “But I do agree [about] the power of local communities being able to reject and say that we know what’s best for our local communities. We’re not going to be seduced by money, by this administration. … We know our local communities better, and we don’t want our workers to suffer.”

“I think that there are powerful alliances that are being built across Wisconsin,” he continued. “That may be the reason why we haven’t gotten hit. But who knows — that could dramatically change tomorrow, right? So we do recognize the small victories, and this is good news, right? But at the same time, I think we need more dialogue. We need more common sense policies. We need more conversations of what we agree on.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 09:57:26.612906

Every Monday morning, I’ll be offering an update on goings-on at the Court (“On the Docket”); a longer introduction to some feature of the Court’s history, current issues, or key players (“The One First ‘Long Read’”); and some Court-related trivia. If you’re not already a subscriber, I hope you’ll consider becoming one—and upgrading to a paid subscription if your circumstances permit:

There is, alas, plenty of Supreme Court-related news, including the (now five) pending emergency applications from the Trump administration, all of which I’ll briefly cover below. But I wanted to use this week’s “Long Read” to tell a slightly different story—about cases that aren’t making headlines, for instance, the ongoing litigation challenging President Trump’s executive order purporting to limit birthright citizenship. That order remains on hold—thanks to a series of rulings by lower courts after the Supreme Court’s 6-3 ruling on June 27. These lower-court rulings have flown under the radar—at least largely because the government has not sought emergency relief from the courts of appeals or the Supreme Court, nor has it refused to comply with them. For now, it is “taking the L.”

That’s an important story unto itself—not just in the birthright citizenship cases, but more generally. For all of the attention that is (understandably) being paid to the unprecedented number of cases the Trump administration is rushing to the Supreme Court (we’re up to 28), and to the Court’s (troubling) behavior in those cases, they represent only a small subset of the broader universe of legal challenges to Trump administration behavior. In the majority of cases in which the government is losing in the lower courts, it is (1) not seeking emergency or expedited intervention from above; and (2) otherwise complying with the adverse rulings while the cases move (very slowly) ahead.

Because this reality doesn’t make for quite as attractive headlines, it’s one to which too many folks are largely oblivious. That’s a problem worth fixing—not only because it’s important to tell both sides of the litigation story, but because including these cases paints a more complicated (and, in my view, far less nihilistic) picture of the role of the courts—and of the law, more generally—as a check on the Trump administration. Hence, today’s post.

But first, the (more conventional) news.

On the Docket

There were only two orders out of the full Court last week, and neither came in a Trump-related case. On Tuesday, over no public dissents, the Court denied a stay of execution to Florida death-row inmate David Pittman, who was executed Wednesday evening. And on Friday, the full Court granted a stay of the impending state-court trial in the New Jersey Transit case—in which the Court has already granted certiorari to decide whether New Jersey Transit has sovereign immunity. The unsigned order came with at least a bit of an explanation—with the justices emphasizing that

the pending damages trial before the Supreme Court of the State of New York would be barred if New Jersey Transit Corporation were entitled to sovereign immunity from suit. Respondents, on the other hand, identify no tangible irreparable harm they would face if the trial were delayed until after this Court decides the pending case.

The extent to which the justices continue to publicly rest upon traditional equities balancing in non-Trump-related applications is quite revealing—all the more so in light of the apparent disappearance of comparable analysis from the Trump cases.

The only other news out of the Court last week was the release of an amended argument calendar for the November session—to accommodate the late-added argument in the tariffs cases, which is now set for Wednesday, November 5. Hamm v. Smith, an important Alabama death penalty case in which the state is the petitioner, got bumped—presumably to December.

To my mind, the real news out of the Court last week was the continuing accretion of emergency applications from the Trump administration—which filed three new applications, on top of the two that are already pending (I wrote about the administrative stays entered by Chief Justice Roberts in those first two cases for last Thursday’s bonus issue). Even by the unprecedented standards of the last eight months, having five applications from the government pending at the same time is, for lack of a better word, insane.

Just to briefly summarize all five, and their current posture:

Trump v. Slaughter (filed September 4; administrative stay entered by Chief Justice Roberts on September 8): Seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had prevented the President from removing without cause the last Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission.

Trump v. Global Health Council (filed September 8; administrative stay entered by Chief Justice Roberts on September 10): Seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had prevented the President from engaging in “pocket rescissions” of significant sums of mandatory foreign aid appropriations.

Trump v. Cook (filed September 18; response due Thursday by 4 p.m. ET): Seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had prevented the President from removing a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors based upon untested (and seemingly pretextual) claims of mortgage fraud. As I noted on Bluesky on Friday, the fact that Chief Justice Roberts ordered a response without issuing the “administrative” stay the government was also seeking (and that he did issue in the Slaughter case) seems to suggest that such relief is not forthcoming.

Trump v. Orr (filed September 19; no response requested yet): Seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had blocked a State Department policy that would require all new U.S. passports to identify the holder by their biological sex at birth. (No, I don’t understand what the “emergency” is either.)

Noem v. NationalTPS Alliance (filed September 19; no response requested yet): The latest application in the case about “temporary protected status” for approximately 300,000 Venezuelan migrants—seeking a stay of lower-court rulings that had granted summary judgment on one of the challenges to Secretary Noem’s abrupt revocation of TPS earlier this year (the district court rested on a different ground than the one that had formed the basis for the preliminary injunction that the Supreme Court stayed, without explanation, back in May.)

It seems likely that we’ll get rulings in Slaughter and Global Health Council this week. I suspect that we won’t hear anything about the other three (besides requests for responses in the last two) until next week at the earliest. And keep in mind that next Monday is the justices’ “Long Conference”—their first meeting in person since they rose for their summer recess, when they have plenty of other business to conduct. Needless to say, it will be yet another busy and chaotic week at the Court—even if no other late-breaking applications make an appearance. And given how things are going, that seems … unlikely.

The One First “Long Read”: What if Adverse Lower-Court Rulings Fall in the Forest and No One Sees?

One of the hardest things about trying to pay attention to all of the relevant legal developments these days is just how many of them there are. Whether or not it’s possible for any outlet to comprehensively cover the litigation against the Trump administration, it stands to reason that the headlines are going to gravitate toward (1) adverse rulings that the administration makes a lot of noise about appealing and seeking to freeze pending appeal; and/or (2) rulings with which the administration at least appears to not be complying.

The problem is that those cases are in the distinct minority. Even with its preposterous pace of emergency applications in the Supreme Court (28 in less than eight months), the Trump administration is not seeking emergency relief in a substantial majority of the cases in which it is losing in the lower courts. And although there are certainly some high-profile examples of apparent non-compliance (and other shady litigation behavior), those, too, are the exceptions that prove the rule.

A good (series of) cases in point are the birthright citizenship cases. Recall that, back on June 27, the Supreme Court partially stayed three different “universal” injunctions against President Trump’s executive order purporting to limit the classes of children who would be entitled to citizenship by dint of being born in the United States. The Supreme Court’s ruling left the injunctions against the order in place for the plaintiffs in those three cases—but nobody else. And so the question quickly became whether the order would ever go into effect against the rest of those who would be affected.

At least thus far, the short answer is “no.” Here’s a quick summary of what’s happened since in each of the three cases that were consolidated in the Court’s June 27 ruling—and a fourth case that was not part of the CASA ruling:

CASA, Inc. v. Trump (D. Md. / Fourth Circuit): After the Fourth Circuit returned the case to the district court, on August 7, Judge Boardman granted the plaintiffs’ motion to certify a nationwide class action on behalf of any child whose citizenship would be affected by the executive order and entered a preliminary injunction on behalf of that class. Although such an order could have been subject to an immediate interlocutory appeal to the Fourth Circuit (an appeal during which the government could also have sought a stay), the government has not appealed either the preliminary injunction or the class certification decision. Instead, it is (slowly) moving forward in the district court; its answer to the plaintiffs’ original complaint is due, as it turns out, today.

Washington v. Trump (W.D. Wash. / Ninth Circuit): On July 23, a divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the universal injunction entered by the district court against the birthright citizenship executive order—holding that, consistent with Justice Barrett’s majority opinion in CASA, a universal (that is, non-plaintiff-specific) injunction was necessary to provide “complete relief” to the state plaintiffs. Judge Bumatay dissented on the ground that he did not believe the state plaintiffs had standing. The government did not seek rehearing en banc from the full Ninth Circuit (the time for doing so has expired); nor has it otherwise sought a stay of the ruling, the mandate from which issued on September 15. The time within which to either file a petition for certiorari in the Supreme Court or to seek an extension of time for doing so is still running (it will expire on October 21). But even if the government does eventually seek Supreme Court review (something Solicitor General Sauer verbally committed to during the CASA oral argument), it will not have done so with any alacrity.

New Jersey v. Trump (D. Mass. / First Circuit): Two days after the Ninth Circuit ruled in the Washington case, the district court in the New Jersey case (filed in Boston) reached the same conclusion—i.e., that a “universal” injunction was necessary to provide the plaintiffs with “complete” relief. It therefore reaffirmed its nationwide preliminary injunction against the executive order on July 25. As in the Maryland case, the government has neither appealed Judge Sorokin’s order nor has it sought a stay. Instead, it is also now (slowly) defending against the lawsuit on the merits—with its answer currently due one month from today (October 22).

Barbara v. Trump (D.N.H. / First Circuit): At least some of the government’s behavior in the three cases that went to the Supreme Court might be explained by the posture of a fourth case—one filed in the District of New Hampshire. On July 10 (so, before any of the post-Supreme Court rulings on remand in the other three cases), the district court in Barbara v. Trump certified a “provisional” nationwide class of everyone to whom the birthright citizenship executive order would apply and granted preliminary injunctive relief to the “provisional” class. Perhaps expecting the government to challenge both rulings, Judge Laplante stayed his order for seven days to allow the government time to appeal (and, presumably, to seek a stay pending appeal). But the government did not appeal right away or seek a stay. Instead, it waited until September 5—three days before the 60-day deadline for appealing would have expired—to appeal Judge Laplante’s rulings to the First Circuit. And it has yet to file anything in the First Circuit seeking either (1) a stay of Judge Laplante’s rulings; or (2) even expedited review thereof. It’s appealing, but begrudgingly, at best.

In other words, there are now four different injunctions in place blocking the birthright citizenship executive order from going into effect—two universal injunctions (emanating from the Western District of Washington and the District of Massachusetts); and two injunctions on behalf of nationwide classes of everyone who would potentially be affected by the order (emanating from the District of New Hampshire and the District of Maryland). The only one of those cases in which an appeal is actively proceeding is the New Hampshire case, in which it is proceeding … slowly.

I realize that that’s a lot of litigation procedure to swallow, but it seems to me that there are four takeaways worth emphasizing:

First, these cases are not outliers. The obvious explanation for the government’s tortoise-like behavior is that it believes it is going to lose these cases (which is almost certainly true), but that’s also true in lots of other challenges to other Trump administration behavior. To take just one visible set of examples, consider the district court rulings blocking four of President Trump’s executive orders targeting specific law firms. Several of those rulings are now being appealed, but at a similar pace to the appeal in Barbara—the government filed close to the deadline; it didn’t seek any kind of stay of the district court ruling; and it hasn’t sought any expedition in the court of appeals. Especially given how successful the government has been at obtaining emergency relief from the Supreme Court, and at obtaining at least expedited review from courts of appeals (and the Supreme Court), its decision to seek neither should be read for exactly what it suggests—the government is going through the motions, but is otherwise accepting the inevitability of losing these cases. Were it more confident on the merits, there’d be much more of a reason to move with more dispatch.

Second, we’re not paying enough attention to these cases. I don’t know how many of those reading this piece were aware of the machinations in each of the four birthright citizenship cases discussed above, but I’ll confess that even I had to look up where things stood in two of them—and I suspect I’m at the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to paying attention to these developments. Yes, appeals on the 57th day of a 60-day period without a request for a stay aren’t as newsworthy as a lot of what’s going on in the world (even in the litigation world). But that doesn’t mean it’s unimportant that the government is behaving this way. To the contrary, it underscores that the narratives we’re seeing in the media and elsewhere are skewed by the squeaky wheels. That may be inevitable, but that doesn’t mean we should condone it. Instead, even if we’re not following every jot and tittle in the cases in which the government isn’t acting like its hair is on fire, we should appreciate that (1) those cases exist; and (2) there are a lot of them. That matters for calibrating narratives about how effective the courts have been as a check on the Trump administration (very, even accounting for the Supreme Court’s one-sided behavior to the contrary); for pushing back against hysterical claims from the right about allegedly widespread misbehavior by lower-court judges (Make Denominators Great Again); and, more broadly, for thinking about what “law” is in 2025.

Third, folks might recall the loud and sharp debate following on the heels of the Supreme Court’s ruling in CASA over just how much (or how little) of an impact that decision would have on the ability to challenge lawless (and allegedly lawless) behavior by the Trump administration. As I wrote at the time, the answer was always going to depend upon what happened both on remand in those three cases and elsewhere—and on how viable other means of seeking nationwide relief would be in challenges to Trump administration policies. It’s still early, but at least so far, the returns have largely borne out the views of those who did not think that CASA would be a cataclysm. To be clear, that doesn’t mean CASA was rightly decided (or even rightly framed, as Professor Jack Goldsmith has explained). And the Court may yet impose tighter limits on (1) nationwide class actions; (2) state standing; (3) what plaintiffs must show to demonstrate that a universal injunction is necessary to obtain “complete relief”; or (4) nationwide vacatur of rules under the Administrative Procedure Act—any of which will necessarily affect the ability of plaintiffs to bring nationwide challenges to federal policies. But at least for now, CASA’s effects have been decidedly modest—and felt most perhaps by lawyers, who have had to reconfigure many of the lawsuits against the Trump administration.

Fourth, and related, the events of the past three months (and, indeed, the past week) drive home one last point that ought to be obvious, but that seems worth saying out loud anyway: The ruling in CASA did absolutely nothing to take pressure off of the Supreme Court’s “emergency” docket. Since the June 27 ruling, the Trump administration has continued to file applications for emergency relief at just about the same clip as it was filing before that ruling; if anything, the average has gone up. If part of the Supreme Court’s goal in CASA was to reduce the volume of district court rulings that would produce effects justifying immediate consideration of emergency applications, well, it failed.

More broadly, this last point suggests, as I’ve been arguing for quite some time, that efforts to defend the proliferation of Supreme Court interventions on the emergency docket as a response to the rise of universal injunctions in the lower courts are confusing causation with correlation. The Supreme Court is intervening in these cases because it can, and because it wants to—regardless of the scope of the relief the district court entered (the removal-without-cause cases—where the dispute is over whether a single person can serve in a single position—are good examples). Were there a more direct relationship between universal injunctions and the growth of the emergency side of the shadow docket, CASA should’ve had a much more dramatic effect.

SCOTUS Trivia:

Stays Directed to Federal Courts vs. State Courts

I’ve written before about the revealing difference in verbiage when the Supreme Court remands a case to a lower federal court versus a state court—how federal courts are instructed to conduct “further proceedings consistent with this opinion,” and how state courts are instructed to conduct “further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.”

As my friend and appellate lawyer Sean Marotta flagged on Bluesky, that difference also showed up in the stay the Court issued in the New Jersey Transit case last week—a rare grant of emergency relief against state court proceedings. The Court’s brief order specified that the stay would persist “pending the issuance of the mandate of this Court.” That’s in contrast to stays of rulings in lower federal courts, which are usually left in place “pending the sending down of the judgment of this Court.”

This distinction reflects a very nerdy but potentially significant distinction in how the Court returns cases to lower courts. For cases coming from the lower federal courts, the Court does not usually issue a mandate; under Rule 45 of the Court’s rules, it merely sends its judgment (and, where applicable, opinion respecting the judgment) “down” to the court of appeals and/or district court. But for cases coming from state courts, the Court does formally issue a mandate—reflecting the (fascinating and, every so often, significant) reality that, although the Supreme Court has general supervisory authority over the lower federal courts, its powers over state courts are both narrower and more specific.

A curated guide to major news and developments over the weekend. Here’s today’s news:

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSE

The United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and Portugal yesterday announced they now formally recognize Palestinian statehood. The series of statements came on the eve of the annual U.N. General Assembly this week, during which France has pledged to vote for recognition of a Palestinian state. Israel and the United States will boycott the U.N. summit, Israel’s U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the leaders who recognize a Palestinian state are “giving a huge reward to terrorism” and the international community “will hear from us on this matter in the following days.” Mark Landler reports for the New York Times; Dana Karni and Oren Liebermann report for CNN; John Irish and Michelle Nichols report for Reuters.

The U.N. General Assembly on Friday voted to allow Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to address the Assembly using a video link, after the United States said it would not grant him a visa to attend the gathering in New York. Michelle Nichols reports for Reuters.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR — U.S. RESPONSE

The Trump administration is seeking Congressional approval for a sale of weapons to Israel worth nearly £6 billion, sources say. According to the sources and documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal, the arms would be paid for by the U.S.-provided foreign military financing, and would likely not be delivered for two to three years. Jared Malsin and Robbie Gramer report.

President Trump plans to meet a group of Arab and Muslim leaders tomorrow on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting to discuss ending the war in Gaza, according to two Arab officials. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

Netanyahu has asked the Trump administration to put pressure on Egypt for Cairo to scale down a recent military buildup in the Sinai Peninsula, according to a U.S. official and two Israeli officials. Netanyahu claimed Egypt was carrying out activities that amounted to substantial violations of its 1979 peace agreement with Israel, for which the United States serves as guarantor. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Israeli forces yesterday blew up more residential buildings in Gaza City, killing at least 40 Palestinians and prompting many others to flee, according to Gaza’s health officials. Nidal Al-Mughrabi reports for Reuters; Samy Magdy reports for AP News.

Israel yesterday kept the main border route for Palestinians to cross from the occupied West Bank into Jordan closed, days after a Jordanian truck driver killed two Israeli soldiers. It is not clear when the Israeli Airports Authority, which oversees the country’s crossings, plans to reopen the route. Fatima AbdulKarim reports for the New York Times.

Qatar wants an apology from Israel for its strike on Doha before it resumes its mediation on a Gaza peace deal, sources say. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR

NATO intercepted three Russian jets over Estonia’s airspace on Friday, which had entered without permission and remained there for 12 minutes. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte praised the alliance’s response as “quick and decisive.” Russia’s defense ministry denied that its jets had entered Estonian airspace and instead claimed that they flew over “the neutral waters of the Baltic Sea.” The Estonian Prime Minister announced that he has requested NATO Article 4 consultation following the incursion. Sophie Tanno reports for CNN; Jaroslav Lukiv and Joe Inwood report for BBC News.

Germany’s air force yesterday sent two jets to track a Russian aircraft that had entered neutral airspace over the Baltic Sea. “Our quick reaction alert force […] was tasked by NATO with investigating an unidentified aircraft without a flight plan or radio contact in international airspace” Germany’s air force said. Reuters reports.

RUSSIA-UKRAINE WAR — INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES

President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen announced a fresh package of Russian sanctions on Friday, saying “it is time to turn off the tap.” The package includes a plan to phase out purchases of Russian natural gas by the beginning of 2027, a year sooner than planned. The plan needs to be approved by EU members states. Jeanna Smialek reports for the New York Times.

The U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting today on Russian incursions into Estonian airspace, U.N. and Estonian officials say. Nina Subkhanberdina reports for CNN.

OTHER GLOBAL DEVELOPMENTS

Russia plans to intervene in Moldovan elections and disrupt the Moldovan government’s plan for EU membership, according to documents seen by Bloomberg. The documents show that Russia intended to employ Moldovans abroad to vote, stage disruptive protests, and begin a widespread disinformation campaign on social media. The strategy was agreed in spring and coordinated directly by the Kremlin in order to undermine President Maia Sandu’s Party of Action and Solidarity chances of winning on 28 September. Bloomberg has been unable to confirm whether Russia is implementing these plans ahead of the election next Sunday. Alberto Nardelli reports.

Nepal’s new Prime Minister Suhsila Karki established a three-member judicial commission on Sunday to investigate the killings of more than 70 people by the Nepalese armed forces during the student protests that began earlier this month, as well as arson and the looting of properties carried out by protestors. Bhadra Sharma reports for the New York Times.

A drone strike on a mosque last Friday has killed more than 70 people in El-Fashr, Sudan, a senior medical source told BBC News. The source said 78 people had died and about 20 others were injured, but the process of extracting bodies from the building was ongoing. No entity claimed responsibility for the attack. Barabara Plett-Usher and Peter Mwai report.

The International Court of Justice said on Friday that Mali’s application to file a case against Algeria over the shooting down of a Malian military drone by Algerian forces can only proceed if Algeria accepts the ICJ’s jurisdiction. Stephanie van den Berg reports for Reuters.

An Israeli strike on southern Lebanon yesterday has killed five people, including three children. Lebanon’s Speaker of the Parliament, Nabih Berri, claimed in a statement yesterday that four U.S. citizens were killed in the strike, while a State Department spokesperson said “while the situation is fluid, so far, indications are that the five killed were not U.S. citizens.” The IDF posted that it had “struck and eliminated” a Hezbollah operator and acknowledged that “several uninvolved civilians” were also killed. Mohammed Tawfeeq and Charbel Mallo report for CNN.

The U.N. Security Council decided on Friday to implement “snapback” sanctions on Iran, with the sanctions coming into effect on September 27, 2025. Barak Ravid reports for Axios.

The EU’s cybersecurity agency said today that airport disruptions that affected automated check-in systems provided by Collins Aerospace over the last few days were caused by a ransomware attack. Without saying where the attack came from, the ENISA agency said in a statement that “law enforcement is involved to investigate” the malicious software that locks up data until the victim pays to have access restored. Reuters reports.

The High Seas Treaty was ratified by Morocco on Friday, the 60th nation to do so, crossing the threshold for U.N. treaties to go into effect. It is the first legal framework aimed at protecting biodiversity in international waters, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of the ocean. The United States has yet to ratify the instrument. Max Bearak reports for the New York Times; Annika Hammerschlag reports for AP News.

TECH DEVELOPMENTS

The Washington-Beijing Tiktok deal will ensure that U.S. companies control the algorithm in the U.S. version of the app, the White House announced on Saturday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the tech giant Oracle will be responsible for the app’s data and security, and U.S. companies will control six of the seven board seats. Aamer Madhani reports for AP News.

Trump said in an interview on Sunday that Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, the chief executive of Fox Corporation, may be among the investors involved in bringing TikTok under U.S. ownership. A source confirmed that the potential investment would be made by the Fox Corporation. Lauren Hirsch and Emmett Lindner report for the New York Times.

Nvidia and Abu Dhabi’s Technology Innovation Institute (TII) have launched a joint lab in the UAE that will focus on developing next-generation AI models and robotics, the TII announced today. This will be the first Nvidia AI technology centre in the Middle East. Frederico Maccioni reports for Reuters.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS — COUNTERNARCOTICS POLICY

The U.S. military has conducted a third strike on a vessel in the Caribbean, Trump said on Friday, asserting that U.S. intelligence had “confirmed the vessel was trafficking illicit narcotics” to the United States and that three people were killed. The real goal of the military buildup in the Caribbean is to remove Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro from power, according to several current and former military officials, diplomats, and intelligence officers. Andrew Jeong reports for the Washington Post; Barak Ravid reports for Axios; Eric Schmitt reports for the New York Times.

Drug Enforcement Administration officials earlier this year advocated for a series of military strikes in Mexico targeting cartel leadership and infrastructure there, sources say. The DEA proposals, supported by DEA’s then-acting administrator, Derek S. Maltz, drew pushback from the White House and Pentagon, the sources add. Dan Lamothe and Ellen Nakashima report for the Washington Post.

Maduro wrote to Trump days after the first U.S. strike on an alleged drug boat in early September, offering to engage in direct talks with U.S. Special Envoy Richard Grenell, according to a letter shared on Telegram by Venezuela’s Vice President Delcy Rodriguez. Trump yesterday declined to confirm he had received Maduro’s letter. Stefano Pozzebon reports for CNN.

Dominican Republic authorities yesterday said that they have recovered 377 packages of cocaine from a speedboat that was destroyed recently by the U.S. Navy. The officials from the Dominican Republic’s National Directorate for Drug Control said they worked in collaboration with U.S. authorities to locate the vessel. Manuel Rueda reports for AP News.

U.S. FOREIGN AFFAIRS

Trump administration officials are in talks with the Taliban about re-establishing a small U.S. military presence at Afghanistan’s Bagram Air Base as a “launch point” for counterterrorism operations, sources say. According to a U.S. official, the talks include a potential prisoner exchange, economic deal, and a security component. Lara Seligman and Michael R. Gordon report for the Wall Street Journal.

The Senate on Friday confirmed Michael Waltz, a former national security adviser, to serve as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Trump removed Walz from the post of security adviser amid the fallout from the revelation that Walz inadvertently invited a journalist to a Signal group chat in which he, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and other top officials discussed the details of a military operation in Yemen. Megan Mineiro reports for the New York Times.

Taiwan’s de facto ambassador to the United States, Alexander Yui, this month privately met with the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, a group that officials say has emerged as a key White House power node. A White House official downplayed the encounter, describing it as an informal conversation. Gram Slattery and Trevor Hunnicutt report for Reuters.

South Korea would agree to a deal between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in which Pyongyang would agree to freeze production of its nuclear weapons, rather than get rid of them, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung told BBC News. Jean Mackenzie reports.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said on Friday that Budapest will designate Antifa as a terrorist organization “following the American example.” Christian Edwards reports for CNN.

European leaders are privately furious about U.S. interventions in their domestic affairs, and increasingly believe that Trump’s aides are pressing for regime change in Europe, aiming to replace governments of the center-left and center-right with coalitions of the far right, the New York Times reports. Steven Erlanger reports.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION ACTIONS

Trump on Saturday demanded that Attorney General Pam Bondi move to prosecute several of his political opponents, urging the prosecutions of New York Attorney General Letitia James (D), former FBI director James B. Comey and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). In a series of social media posts, Trump claimed all three were “guilty as hell” and “impeached [him] twice and indicted [him] 5 times, over nothing.” Trump also claimed he had fired U.S. Attorney for Eastern District of Virginia Erik Siebert, who on Friday resigned after being pressured to launch an investigation into James. Bondi appointed Mary “Maggie” Cleary, an assistant U.S. attorney who once claimed she was “framed” for being at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to lead the office on an interim basis. Jeremy Roebuck, Perry Stein, and Salvador Rizzo report for the Washington Post; Kyle Cheney and Josh Gerstein report for POLITICO.

Trump said that he would nominate senior White House aide Lindsey Halligan to replace Siebert. Halligan served as one of Trump’s attorneys in the early days of the FBI’s investigation into Trump’s retention of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Alanna Durkin Richer and Meg Kinnard report for AP News.

The Trump administration has shut down a bribery investigation into Tom Homan accepting a bag with $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents last year, according to sources. Homan apparently took the money and agreed to help the agents, posing as businessmen, to secure future government contracts related to border security. FBI Director Kash Patel ordered the investigation to end over the summer, a source said, while a different source said that Emil Bove, a former senior DOJ official who is now a federal appeals court judge, said the case was an example of a “deep state operation” when he was briefed on the it in February. Patel and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said that DOJ prosecutors and FBI agents “found no credible evidence of any criminal wrongdoing” while investigating. Devlin Barrett, Glenn Thrush. Alan Feuer, Maggie Haberman, and Hamed Aleaziz report for the New York Times; Sarah N. Lynch reports for Reuters.

The Defense Department on Friday said it would require journalists to pledge that they will not gather any information, including unclassified information, that has not been expressly “authorized” for release. Under the new policy, the DOD will revoke the press credentials of the reporters who possess confidential or unauthorized information. The announcement drew widespread condemnation from members of the press. Scott Nover reports for the Washington Post; David Cohen reports for POLITICO.

The Agriculture Department on Saturday announced it is cancelling the government’s annual report measuring household food insecurity, the federal government’s main gauge of U.S. residents’ ability to access adequate meals. Announcing the move, the Agriculture Department said the report had become “overly politicized, and … unnecessary to carry out the work of the department.” Dan Frosch, Patrick Thomas, and Andrea Petersen report for the Wall Street Journal.

The Securities and Exchange Commission last week dropped civil enforcement cases against Devon Archer, Trevor Milton, and Carlos Watson, three men convicted of large-scale white-collar fraud whose sentences Trump pardoned or commuted. The SEC decision to drop the cases means they will not have to pay any additional civil penalties to the government or face restrictions on work in securities-related positions. Kenneth P. Vogel reports for the New York Times.

The Treasury Department has ordered the Taxpayer Advisory Panel, a federal advisory committee for the IRS, to suspend public meetings while the White House vets its membership, according to an email seen by POLITICO. A panel member said that at least two members of the panel are stepping down because of the White House vetting directive. Danny Nguyen reports.

U.S. IMMIGRATION DEVELOPMENTS

Trump signed an executive order on Friday to impose a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas beginning yesterday. Amazon, Alphabet’s Google, Microsoft and others warned existing H-1B holders not to leave the country and urged overseas employees to return to avoid difficulty re-entering, according to notes seen by the Wall Street Journal. The White House announced on Saturday that the change only applies to new visas. Alejandra Jaramillo and Adam Cancryn report for CNN; Chip Cutter, Amrith Ramkumar and Ray A. Smith report for the Wall Street Journal; Myah Ward and Giselle Ruhiyyih Ewing report for POLITICO.

The Trump administration announced on Friday that it would terminate protections for around six thousand Syrians living in the United States under the Temporary Protected Status program. The Homeland Security Department said that Syrian nationals will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the United States, after which they will be subject to arrest and deportation, and that “conditions in Syria no longer prevent their nationals from returning home.” Washington Post

Journalist Mario Guevara is facing imminent deportation to El Salvador as an immigration appeals court has closed his case and ordered his removal. An immigration judge earlier ordered his release on bond and a clear legal path to residency. George Chidi reports for the Guardian.

U.S. DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

A judge in Florida threw out Trump’s defamation suit against the New York Times on Friday. The judge called the 85-page complaint “improper and impermissible” in its current form as it failed to contain a “short and plain statement of claim,” providing Trump with 28 days to refile. Michael M. Grynbaum reports for the New York Times.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION LITIGATION

A district judge directed Meta on Friday not to provide personal information of Instagram users accused of releasing personal details about a border officer to the DHS, pending further order from the court that would rule on the legality of the DHS’ subpoenas seeking the names and other personal information of accounts that posted the name of the border agent. Alfred NG reports for POLITICO.

The Justice Department filed an appeal on Friday asking the Supreme Court to let it limit passport sex markers for nonbinary and transgender people by removing the use of “X” as an identification marker for gender. Lindsay Whitehurst reports for AP News; Devan Cole and John Fritze report for CNN.

Rethinking IEEPA Accountability and Oversight

,Human Rights,2025-09-22 12:10:35+00:00,Nebraska Public Media,"As ICE partnerships spread in the Midwest, incentives rise and civil rights concerns deepen",Not Available,,,,,https://nebraskapublicmedia.org/en/news/news-articles/as-ice-partnerships-spread-in-the-midwest-incentives-rise-and-civil-rights-concerns-deepen/,"A law enforcement agency can sign up under multiple models, depending on what resources they have, such as a jail.
At least 1,700 of those involved the 287(g) program, according to data on ICE’s website.
Florida and Texas lead the nation with roughly half of all 287(g) agreements, driven in part by state laws requiring ICE 287(g) cooperation.
According to ICE, after a law enforcement agency joins the 287(g) program, ICE will train officers in immigration law, multicultural communication and avoiding racial profiling.
“287(g) agreements undermine safety in our communities, for all of us, regardless of what model it is,” she said.","Since President Donald Trump began his second term, agreements allowing local law enforcement agencies to perform federal immigration duties have surged from 135 in January 2025 to more than 1,000 in September.

The program, known as 287(g), lets officers from state and local agencies collaborate with ICE under three models. Responsibilities range from questioning immigration status in jails under the jail enforcement model and serving ICE warrants under the warrant service model to making immigration-related arrests under the task force model.

Local agencies pay the costs of participating in exchange for ICE training, limited enforcement powers and, soon, financial incentives from the federal government. A law enforcement agency can sign up under multiple models, depending on what resources they have, such as a jail.

As of Sept. 18, there were 34 agreements across Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, a sharp increase from just three in January. At least three other agreements are pending in the region, according to ICE’s public database.

“Most of our neighbors are doing it. Generally, any of those cooperative agreements only help us,” said Sheriff Chad McCumbers of Sioux County in western Nebraska. He joined ICE’s efforts under the task force model in September, and his deputies will soon have the authority to question immigration status and make arrests in the county.

ICE says expansion of the 287(g) program “keeps our communities safer,” a sentiment many participating sheriffs and local law enforcement officers agreed with in interviews with The Midwest Newsroom.

Interviews with participating agencies in the four states show more than 70 local officers have been authorized under the task force model, which acts as a “force multiplier,” that increases all parties’ collective capacity to carry out enforcement, according to ICE.

The Department of Homeland Security recently announced financial incentives for working under this model, and eligible task force officers could soon receive quarterly monetary performance awards up to $1,000, based on the successful location of undocumented immigrants targeted by ICE and overall assistance in furthering ICE’s mission.

“This bonus, which is essentially a bounty, has bad impacts at the local level, including for law enforcement leaders, who’d rather their police forces be focusing on actual public safety threats versus violations of civil immigration law,” said Nayna Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council.

In late August, DHS reported that ICE deported nearly 200,000 people in the first seven months of Trump’s second administration. At least 1,700 of those involved the 287(g) program, according to data on ICE’s website.

A DHS announcement in September said the rapid expansion of the 287(g) task force model since January has bolstered ICE’s personnel with 8,501 additional local and state law enforcement officers. At least 2,000 more are in training.

The model enables trained officers, under ICE supervision, to question people about their immigration status, make certain warrantless arrests, issue detainers and hold or transport individuals to ICE detention centers. They can also serve warrants, collect evidence and prepare documents for ICE.

The Obama administration retired the model in 2012 amid civil rights concerns. Trump revived it in his second term, and it now accounts for more than half of all agreements nationwide. In the Midwest, Illinois is the only state that explicitly bans the agreements.

The task force model is expanding ICE’s reach without directly hiring new personnel, which has been apparent in recent months.

Task force model partners have been part of multiple large-scale ICE operations since January, including traffic-stop operations in Nashville, according to ProPublica, and a week-long operation in Florida that led to over 1,120 arrests. Florida and Texas lead the nation with roughly half of all 287(g) agreements, driven in part by state laws requiring ICE 287(g) cooperation.

“It has been wonderful to see people jump in and be a part of it to make sure that we have not just the authorities that we need to go out there and to work, but also to have the local knowledge and the people in the community that really want to be a part of the solution,” Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a statement to ProPublica in June.

In Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, 287(g) participation is voluntary, and decisions to join these agreements have been made without formal public input. As of September, all four states have one state-level agency participating in the task force model and there are at least 74 authorized officers across the region.

The Midwest Newsroom confirmed 53 Missouri Highway Patrol troopers have been trained under the program, along with three state troopers in Iowa and three agents at the Kansas Bureau of Investigation. Six state troopers in Nebraska are in the training process.

At the county and municipal level, The Midwest Newsroom confirmed nine deputies in Pulaski County, Missouri, and six deputies in Shawnee County, Kansas, have completed training to participate in the task force model. At least nine others are in training.

Interviews with state and local law enforcement officers show efficiency and alignment with the Trump administration’s immigration efforts, concern about being labeled a “sanctuary” and encouragement from state leaders are among the factors leading to local agreements in these states.

“We got listed as a sanctuary county at one time, and we are not,” said Banner County Sheriff Zane Hopkins in Nebraska, referring to a now-deleted list on the Department of Homeland Security website last year. Hopkins said he, along with one other deputy, are starting their task force training this month in their county of less than 700 people.

For Sheriff Stacy L. Ball in Pulaski County, Missouri, it was a safety decision, he said.

“I have the I-44 corridor that runs from Chicago to Texas. So that’s a major corridor for trafficking, and whether it’s people or drugs,” he said.

Ball has signed all three 287(g) models, becoming one of at least 23 agencies across the country with triple participation in the program.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a lawyer and policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said this kind of expansion is strategic for ICE.

“They’re recognizing that ICE alone does not have enough personnel to be attempting to carry out Trump’s mass deportations campaign,” Bush-Joseph said.

The Trump administration has stated goals of 3,000 deportations a day and 1 million a year. Bush-Joseph said the new funding incentive will likely accelerate local partnerships.

Salaries, overtime and new cars

The One Big Beautiful Bill, which Trump signed into law in July, includes $75 billion for ICE over four years, making the agency the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in U.S. history.

The unprecedented allocation has trickled into salary reimbursements for eligible 287(g) officers and agency bonuses for identifying undocumented immigrants.

According to a Sept. 2 news release, starting Oct. 1, 2025, participating law enforcement agencies can be fully reimbursed for the annual salary and benefits of each eligible trained 287(g) officer, including overtime coverage up to 25% of the officer’s annual salary. A bonus structure offers up to $1,000 per officer per quarter for locating undocumented immigrants and assisting ICE.

Mindy Rush Chipman, executive director of the Nebraska ACLU, called the incentive perverse.

“It’s going to encourage some law enforcement departments to put immigration enforcement over the real public-safety needs of that particular community,” Rush Chimpan said. “It’s just taking a model that was already harmful to communities and amplifying it.”

Sheriff Ball in Missouri disagreed with that sentiment. “This doesn’t give us permission to go out there and actively hunt. We follow the law, we follow the Constitution, and if it comes across us, then we deal with it,” he said.

Money has long been a barrier for agencies considering 287(g) participation. Local law enforcement agencies have historically taken on the salary, overtime and other associated costs of the program.

Prince William County in Virginia spent $25.9 million over five years in the program. Alamance County, North Carolina, spent $4.8 million for just one year of its 287(g) program, and Harris County, Texas, chose to end its program in February 2017 because it ended up costing an extra $675,000 per year.

It is unclear how much the program is costing counties or states in the central Midwest.

On Sept. 2, Patrick Yoes, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the largest law enforcement organization in the U.S., issued a statement celebrating the announcement of the cash infusion from ICE.

“The new reimbursement models reflect DHS’s commitment to equipping our TFM (task force model) programs with the tools and resources needed to meet all challenges,” Yoes wrote.

Yoes said that every trained and credentialed officer will receive up to $7,500 for essential equipment, including a laptop and mobile phone with cellular service upon becoming operational and qualified law enforcement agencies may receive up to $100,000 for the purposes of purchasing new vehicles.

Yoes and the Fraternal Order of Police did not respond to requests for comment. ICE and DHS did not respond to requests for comment about the new reimbursement opportunities. Two local agencies in the region confirmed they have received communications from ICE about the funding.

Most law enforcement agencies contacted for this story said the new funding announcement does not immediately change their procedures, but for McCumbers, in Sioux County, Nebraska, it means the possibility of hiring more staff in his county of about 1,100 residents.

“We’re very busy as it is, but it might change priorities a little bit if we have a monetary incentive,” McCumbers said.

‘Ripe for abuse’

When Brown County, Nebraska, received an outreach email about the 287(g) program this year, the sheriff signed up for all three models.

A Brown County official said the county did not want to be seen as not cooperating with ICE, thinking the counties around them would also sign up.

The county soon found itself in agreements it could not fulfill with a small, rural department. In January, ICE suspended its advisory board to process agreements in a “timely manner,” leaving no designated oversight group to vet applications from local agencies.

A Brown County official said she was left to figure the program out herself, and leaders quickly decided to withdraw from all three memoranda of understanding with ICE.

“We’ve decided to withdraw from the 287(g) MOU on all models,” Brown County said in an emailed statement to The Midwest Newsroom. “It is our opinion that this program is better suited for Law Enforcement at NSP [Nebraska State Patrol] or large cities such as Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island or counties with I-80 running through them.”

ICE did not respond to emails asking about Brown County’s approval. The county also declined to share its emails with ICE, citing privacy reasons. As of Sept. 18, it is still listed as a participating agency on ICE’s public list.

Immigration advocates said Brown County’s short-lived involvement with ICE again raises the question of oversight in the program. In 2018, ICE’s own internal watchdog released a report stating that ICE had not prepared adequately for 287(g) program growth and might not be training or monitoring law enforcement officers efficiently.

In 2021, the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog, released a separate report outlining how ICE had expanded the program rapidly without measuring whether it improved public safety or ensured that civil rights safeguards were being followed.

“With that proliferation of these agreements and very little oversight, no one checking to ensure that they are adhering to laws, the Constitution, you know, it is ripe for abuse,” said Chioma Chukwu, executive director of American Oversight, a nonprofit watchdog currently suing ICE for withholding public records related to 287(g).

As of September 2025, the Government Accountability Office is still monitoring two open recommendations on its website that have yet to be addressed. They include establishing performance measures and goals to manage the program and to assess its partners to optimize program resources. ICE did not respond to emails asking about its 287(g) oversight mechanisms.

Three sheriffs participating in the program told The Midwest Newsroom that oversight has been sufficient and they do not have civil rights concerns.

Training fast-tracked

Training has been a main concern for immigration advocates critical of the 287(g) program. According to ICE, after a law enforcement agency joins the 287(g) program, ICE will train officers in immigration law, multicultural communication and avoiding racial profiling.

In a June complaint, American Oversight asked for instruction and guidance materials as well as emails about the training, but is still waiting for the requested documents.

“We’re asking for materials that should have already been created, training materials,” Chukwu said. “It is unreasonable for them to take as long as they’ve taken to produce information.”

In Florida, training has been streamlined in recent months according to a news report from WUSF. Previously, the jail enforcement model required four weeks of training, and is now only five days. The warrant service officer model training went from eight to four hours. The task force model training reportedly requires 40 hours of training.

“One week of training is certainly not enough to meaningfully educate somebody on what enforcement should look like and what violations of immigration law matter,” said Gupta, policy director at American Immigration Council, a nonprofit advocacy organization.

“We understand from talking to sheriffs around the country that they are decreasing the training requirements and sometimes just talking about training and not following up meaningfully in practice and using PowerPoints that exclude training on the Fourth Amendment and protections against racial discrimination,” Gupta said.

In Missouri, Pulaski County Sheriff Stacy L. Ball said the training is online and in-depth.

“There’s a lot to go through, and at the end, you take a test of your knowledge for each module,” Ball said. “We don’t know every law. We got to look in our books, just like everything, and that’s what this is. This gives us a foundation.”

No chance for public comment

According to ICE guidance, a participating agency must hold a public steering committee meeting, consisting of local law enforcement leadership and ICE officials, in the first six months of a 287(g) agreement, with 30 days’ notice before the meeting.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation did not hold a public meeting. In an email to The Midwest Newsroom, a KBI representative said this requirement was not an explicit part of its 287(g) agreement. The agency referred all reporter questions to ICE, which did not respond. The Iowa Department of Public Safety is past the 30-day advanced notice mark and also has not scheduled a public meeting, even in the face of public calls to end its 287(g) agreement.

“We won’t stop until the Iowa ICE Task Force is disbanded and civil rights are respected,” Iowa resident Ninoska Campos told KCRG. Campos was one of seven people asked about their immigration status during an April traffic stop in Dubuque, Iowa.

The Iowa Department of Public Safety told The Midwest Newsroom that the officer involved was not a 287(g) task force officer, and he did not contact one during the stop.

“287(g) agreements have already led to that kind of racial profiling because local police, of course, cannot tell if a person is undocumented or in violation of immigration law, because nobody wears that as a sign on their head, and so local police often go into communities where they’re more likely to find immigrants,” Gupta said.

Gupta also said the agreements undermine public safety by making immigrant communities afraid to report crime, and they divert local policing resources away from public safety challenges.

Rush Chipman, the ACLU of Nebraska executive director, said she saw this firsthand in Dakota County, Nebraska, in 2018, when it signed the first 287(g) agreement in the state. At the time, she was a practicing immigration lawyer, and said her clients were worried about reporting crime out of fear they could be questioned themselves.

“287(g) agreements undermine safety in our communities, for all of us, regardless of what model it is,” she said.

METHODS

To report this story, journalist Naomi Delkamiller interviewed five law enforcement officers in active 287(g) agreements in the central Midwest to learn why they decided to participate, if they had civil rights concerns and if newly announced financial incentives would affect their policing. She had email correspondence with four additional law enforcement agencies in the region and reviewed dozens of 287(g) MOAs covering all three models. She reached out to policy analysts, experts and immigrant-rights advocates to understand the existence and effects of these partnerships and reviewed multiple investigations related to the oversight and transparency of the program. Delkamiller also looked at current litigation involving the program and local and state laws that encourage or ban participation across the country.

These changes, along with other recent policy shifts, will make the path to U.S. citizenship more challenging for many applicants.

What is changing?

The new civics test will require applicants to answer 20 questions, instead of the current 10 questions. Additionally, the number of possible questions is increasing from 100 to 128. While most questions are the same, the new test adds more ""why"" questions (e.g., ""Why is the Electoral College important?"" ""Supreme Court justices serve for life. Why?"" ""Why is it important to pay federal taxes?"" ""Why were the Federalist Papers important?"" ""Why did the United States enter World War I?""). The new test asks many more questions on American history since the 20th century, and it eliminates all geography questions. It also adds more questions on federalism and increases the number of examples that must be given to answer certain questions (e.g., ""There were 13 original states. Name five [rather than three]."")

When will the changes be implemented?

Applicants filing on or after October 18, 2025 (30 days after the Federal Register notice) will have to take the new test. Applicants who are at least 65 years old who have resided in the U.S. as lawful permanent residents for at least 20 years will continue to have a more abbreviated test: They will continue to have to answer 6 out of 10 questions correctly, and the possible questions will be specifically marked on the new test.

Why is this happening?

USCIS says these updates are meant to ensure applicants fully understand and embrace American values. However, the changes are also part of a broader push to tighten naturalization requirements. For example, last month USCIS made changes to what is required for an immigrant to have ""good moral character,"" another requirement of U.S. naturalization. Until recently, good moral character was identified primarily by a lack of disqualifying acts and has included detailed background checks. Moving forward, USCIS will now take a ""holistic approach"" and look for positive contributions to American society, including receipt of good character statements from employers and neighbors.

A recently issued USCIS Policy Memo states that officers may also undertake neighborhood investigations to this end—something that has not been seen in decades—ensuring that naturalization applicants show character commensurate with the standards of average citizens in their community. Even actions ""while technically lawful, [] inconsistent with civic responsibility within the community"" may be disqualifying.

What are the possible risks associated with this approach?

While one hopes that these new requirements will be administered consistently and evenly, the changes could lead to discrepancies in adjudication, with officers potentially relying on statements of neighbors who may not know the applicant and who may be framing their knowledge through their own bias or stereotypes.

What should you do now?

If you have an upcoming naturalization test, make sure you understand the policy changes and study the correct questions. To navigate a rapidly-changing immigration law landscape, consider contacting our office to speak to an attorney.

“AI tools have been around for more than a decade.","The Trump administration is sharply expanding its use of artificial intelligence in immigration enforcement, using technology not just to track migrants but also to help determine who gets targeted for deportation.

To power immigration enforcement — a top policy priority for President Donald Trump — the administration is deploying artificial intelligence algorithms to sift through a vast array of records. Officials say the tools can flag potential violations, prioritize leads and direct officers on next steps, accelerating processes that once relied on slower, manual reviews.

Acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons has described a vision of squads of trucks sweeping up immigrants with the efficiency of Amazon delivery routes: “Like Prime, but with human beings,” he said in April during the Border Security Expo in Phoenix.

Driving that vision is ImmigrationOS, a new platform that consolidates these tools into a single interface. The system, which DHS will start using Thursday, includes workflows that allow agents to approve raids, book arrests, generate legal documents and route individuals to deportation flights or detention — all in one place.

“It doesn’t just collect data — it structures what agents do with it,” a senior DHS official said.

While some of the technology has been previously used piecemeal for immigration efforts, the scale of this project is unprecedented. The system also draws from traditionally non-immigration data sources, including Suspicious Activity Reports and financial transactions flagged under the Bank Secrecy Act. Those tools — more commonly deployed in counterterrorism or anti-money laundering cases — are now being repurposed to identify potential immigration enforcement targets, from people suspected of identity fraud to those working without authorization.

Some experts warn the growing reliance on opaque algorithms raises serious concerns. Bias, overreach and reduced human oversight are all possible, particularly as the Department of Homeland Security ramps up deportations and executive orders pushing AI adoption while dismantling so-called woke or regulated systems.

“What we’re seeing in these upcoming contracts is a shift,” said Steven Hubbard, a data scientist at the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration nonprofit. “In the past, AI tools were primarily used to support efficiency — flagging a case for review or assisting with facial recognition. But the new systems described appear to be more prescriptive, guiding agents on what actions to take rather than simply supporting their decision-making.”

Under the Biden administration, DHS began publishing AI “inventories” to disclose how agencies use artificial intelligence. These reports reveal that AI tools are already embedded in identity verification, fraud detection, check-ins for alternatives to detention, and even chatbots for internal use.

Now that effort is ramping up, with the help of Palantir, a major government contractor also used by the Department of Defense.

Earlier this year, ICE awarded the company nearly $30 million to develop ImmigrationOS. The system is being designed not just to collect information but also to shape enforcement decisions — a move critics say outsources judgment to software and raises concerns about oversight and accountability.

CNN has reached out to DHS and Palantir for comment.

Palantir has said that it believes AI should be used to “enhance human execution and decision-making rather than replacing it” and that “it’s essential to preserve fundamental principles of privacy and civil liberties while using data.”

A former DHS official who worked in the current Trump administration told CNN that ImmigrationOS marks a fundamental shift in enforcement infrastructure. “They’re combining data sets from Treasury and other agencies into an observability platform,” the official said.

The former official added that the new platform will also use Internal Revenue Service and census data. It includes built-in workflows that allow agents to approve raids, book arrests, generate legal documents, and route individuals to deportation flights or detention — all from a single interface.

“You can go in and, you know, raid and arrest, get your approval to do that in the system,” the official said. “Then it’ll route them through to detention or removal. That entire lifecycle is built into the software.”

The former official also raised alarms about ICE’s growing dependence on Palantir. “One of the things that we’ve been concerned about is relying so heavily on a primary vendor … it means that you’re locked into their ecosystem,” they said. “Substantial portions of the IT infrastructure now require Palantir’s tools to function.”

Beyond vendor lock-in, the system also marks a decentralization of authority. Under new Trump-era directives, ImmigrationOS will be accessible directly to officers on the ground — not just at headquarters. “The idea is to push AI down to the operators,” the official said. “Let the officers on the ground use it how they see fit, instead of managing it centrally.”

Hubbard cautions that while the focus is often on facial recognition or surveillance, the real impact may lie deeper — in the quiet, automated decisions that affect who gets targeted, detained or deported. “If AI becomes the basis for enforcement action,” he said, “oversight isn’t optional — it’s urgent.”

Former acting ICE Director John Sandweg, who served during the Obama administration, says the debate isn’t about whether AI can be useful, but how it’s deployed. “These tools can be used for good or bad,” Sandweg said. “This administration has made clear it wants to ramp up arrests — they’ve said it themselves.”

Sandweg noted that ICE’s embrace of technology is not new. “AI tools have been around for more than a decade. They can play a critical role in identifying threats and terrorists. ICE has always embraced technology — in the past, it was to focus on terrorism threats.”

But he questioned the need for AI in certain day-to-day enforcement operations. “You don’t need AI to go to Home Depot and arrest people,” he said.

Additionally, a former top DHS official, speaking at an immigration compliance panel under Chatham House rules, said ICE “now has a new AI tool to do the work of I-9 auditors more quickly and effectively.” Such auditors are responsible for reviewing employment eligibility forms (known as I-9s) to verify that workers are legally authorized to work in the US. They check documents such as passports, green cards and visas, and flag discrepancies or potential violations.

But critics say that same efficiency, if left unchecked, could sideline human judgment in favor of algorithmic speed — with real-world consequences for real people.

“You can’t take it [AI] as gospel,” said a different former DHS official. “AI is good, but not as good as a human being.”","https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/2025-07-11t004902z-1854409221-rc20kfakvyms-rtrmadp-3-usa-migration-california-raid-20250919211100909.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",N,,2025-09-22 09:57:38.841326

McLaughlin said ""rioters and sanctuary politicians"" have thrown ""tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks at law enforcement, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property,"" adding that 16 people have been arrested and warning that anyone who assaults officers ""will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

The clarification followed a HuffPost report, later corrected, that cited internal DHS communications suggesting the site might be evacuated. Immigration rights groups, including the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, vowed to continue their campaign to close the facility, calling it a ""de-facto detention center"" and accusing ICE of ""gross human rights violations.""

The Broadview center has become a flashpoint for activists and federal agents. On Friday, protesters clashed with officers for hours outside 1930 Beach St., where agents fired pepper balls and released tear gas to disperse crowds.

Several demonstrators were arrested, including one woman seen on video being thrown to the ground and handcuffed.

The servicemember alleged that the company promoted its advances as fee-free and interest-free while requiring a monthly subscription and imposing expedited transfer fees. The complaint further claimed that these charges resulted in triple-digit APRs similar to payday loans and that repayment practices, including automatic debits and repeated withdrawal attempts, worsened financial strain for users.

In its motion, the EWA provider argued that its ""non-recourse advances"" do not count as credit. The court disagreed stating that, among other reasons, the EWA provider mandates that consumers authorize the company to automatically debit their bank accounts for repayment, a clear indication that they expect to be repaid. The company also moved to arbitrate the suit, arguing its users agreed to arbitrate any disputes when they signed up with its services. The court rejected arbitration, ruling that the MLA applies to the case and accordingly precludes arbitration against covered servicemembers.

Putting It Into Practice: Courts across the country are increasingly allowing TILA claims against earned wage access providers to proceed, raising the possibility that these products may ultimately be classified as credit (previously discussed here).

Thanks to an outpouring of opposition from across the political spectrum, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) was forced to withdraw language from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that would have sold millions of acres of public lands to pay for tax cuts for billionaires.1 Nonetheless, a flurry of orders and proposals from the Trump administration—some supercharged by lesser-known provisions in the OBBBA—are still in motion to open up vast amounts of public land for extractive development, allowing it to be leased and claimed by drilling, mining, and logging companies.

The Trump administration has made little secret of its plan to let private companies drill, mine, and log America’s public lands. In fact, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum—who is charged with overseeing the majority of U.S. public lands—recently told those extractive corporations that he views them as “the customer” for his department.2

Compared with Congress’ failed attempt to sell public lands, these Trump administration actions have garnered substantially less public and media attention. But collectively, they will remove protections from approximately 88 million acres of public lands and directly affect more regions of the country than Congress’ proposed OBBBA sell-off.3 The administration’s actions include removing protections for some of the most intact national forest lands, opening sensitive Arctic wildlife habitat for drilling, eliminating restrictions on mining for ecologically sensitive lands and waters, and erasing conservation requirements and habitat protections.

Simultaneously, the administration is hitting the gas on sales that will hand corporations primary control of public lands, including those lands recently stripped of their protections. Together, these actions amount to a massive transfer of control over public lands and a dramatic reversal in the long tradition of American land conservation.

8 Ways Special Interests Are Asking President-Elect Trump To Sell Out U.S. Public Lands

Drew McConville, Jenny Rowland-Shea

The lands targeted for eliminated or weakened protections

Collectively, the Trump administration has already initiated actions that could eliminate or weaken protections from more than 175 million acres of U.S. lands—larger than the states of California, Florida, and Georgia combined4—according to new analysis by the Center for American Progress. This accounts for removing protections from 88 million acres of public lands and weakening species protections across more than 87 million acres of wildlife habitat.

TABLE 1

The reach of these Trump administration actions extends beyond the states targeted by the Senate’s rejected sell-off proposal. That plan would have sold national public lands from 11 eligible states, including Alaska and most Western states5—minus Montana, which was exempted.6 The Trump administration’s sell-out actions will reach far beyond, touching public lands in more than 70 percent of U.S. states.7 Counting the erasure of long-standing protections for the habitat of threatened or endangered species, the impacts to America’s natural lands and waters extend even farther.

FIGURE 1

The acreage totals detailed in this report include most of the protected land already targeted by publicly announced Trump administration actions, as well as wildlife habitat particularly threatened by certain Endangered Species Act rollbacks. However, these totals still underestimate the extent of lands at risk. In particular, they do not capture the impacts of redirecting how public lands will be managed more broadly—for example, by eliminating the Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) Public Lands Rule. They also understate the scope of wildlife habitat likely to be affected by gutting endangered species requirements and do not account for public lands actions on the horizon, such as potential erasure of national monuments. Moreover, they do not account for other public lands that could be affected by the Trump administration’s reckless push to sell access for oil and gas drilling, timber harvests, and mining, which could sacrifice additional areas valuable for recreation, wildlife, or cultural and historic resources that lack formal protective status or could not be easily estimated in this analysis.

Major actions in motion

The summaries below highlight the most consequential actions currently in motion to unprotect and sell out public lands to the highest bidder. Many of these actions stem directly from orders signed by President Donald Trump that redirected America’s public land managers to prioritize and expand drilling, logging, and mining, 8 while others were initiated or announced by his Cabinet leadership.9

Unprotecting public lands and wildlife habitat for corporate gains

A set of actions proposed or anticipated from the Trump administration is poised to erase protections for uniquely sensitive and valuable lands, opening these places up for drilling, mining, logging, and other extractive development. Collectively, these actions threaten approximately 88 million acres of public lands.

“Roadless area” protections for national forests

First announced on June 23, 2025, Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins is eliminating protections for nearly 40 million acres of national forests conserved as “roadless areas,” opening some of the most ecologically intact forests in the country to industrial development.10

Ending these forest protections, first established by the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule, would open the public lands to potential logging, oil and gas drilling, and, in the case of Eastern forests, new mining.11 The direct impacts would be widespread, with national forests in 36 states and Puerto Rico losing protection.12 This includes the Tongass National Forest in Alaska,13 a national treasure harboring some of the last remaining old-growth coastal rainforest in the world.14

An estimated 48 million people source their drinking water from watersheds that currently enjoy roadless area protections, with major cities such as Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City reliant on drinking water sourced from now-threatened forests.

Erasing conservation protections for these forested lands would affect the drinking water supply for millions, unparalleled recreational opportunities, commercial fisheries, wildlife habitat, and much more. An estimated 48 million people source their drinking water from watersheds that currently enjoy roadless area protections,15 with major cities such as Atlanta, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Salt Lake City reliant on drinking water sourced from now-threatened forests.16 Meanwhile, outdoor user groups estimate that roadless national forests under threat protect more than 25,000 miles of trails, more than 8,600 climbing and bouldering routes, and more than 760 miles of whitewater paddling runs.17 Finally, roadless areas provide habitat for more than half of the at-risk wildlife species in the continental United States18 and filter clean water that supports high-quality commercial and recreational fisheries.19

Although Secretary Rollins attempted to justify this action, in part, as a solution for wildfire risk, it followed President Trump’s executive order mandating a dramatic expansion of timber production on public lands and removal of “undue burdens” for timber.20 Additionally, recent analysis of more than 30 years of fire data found that roads substantially increase the risk of fire ignition in national forests.21 U.S. Forest Service findings published during the first Trump administration found that national forest lands with and without roads burned at similar rates in total, while also finding no evidence that roadless requirements were limiting fuel reduction activities nationwide.22

America’s arctic and other Alaskan lands

President Trump wasted no time in aggressively dismantling conservation measures across national public lands in Alaska, issuing a specific executive order on Alaskan resource exploitation on January 20, 2025.23 In addition to mandating the reversal of the protections described below, the order also targets protections for the Tongass rainforest in Southeast Alaska and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as described elsewhere in this report:

FIGURE 2

Western Arctic: On June 2, Trump’s Department of the Interior announced a proposal to eliminate safeguards conserving 13 million acres of “special areas” in the Western Arctic24 and subsequently unveiled a plan to open even more lands to drilling.25 The Western Arctic, also known as the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, is the largest stretch of intact public lands in the United States,26 and special areas are intended to conserve the most ecologically and culturally important lands, which are home for migrating wildlife and are relied on for subsistence by more than 40 Alaskan Native communities.27 The Trump administration’s proposals directly threaten one of North America’s largest caribou herds;28 polar bear, beluga whales, and other at-risk species;29 and breeding grounds of birds that migrate all across America and to every continent across the globe.30

28 million acres of D-1 public lands: President Trump’s executive order directed Secretary Burgum to eliminate long-standing protections for 28 million acres of public lands in Alaska. This reversal would open lands and waters across the state, collectively the size of about 37 Yosemite national parks, to destructive industrial development.31 Known as “D-1” lands and overseen by the BLM, these public lands are home to uniquely intact habitats that support vital fish and wildlife populations. About 75 percent of the targeted lands are designated as places where rural communities have priority to hunt and fish for subsistence.32 Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland reaffirmed protections for these areas in 2024 following extensive public input, Tribal consultation, and scientific evaluation.33 In fact, more than half of the federally recognized Tribes in Alaska proactively called for retaining the protections the Trump administration is now dismantling.34

Brooks Range and Ambler Road: President Trump and Secretary Burgum ordered steps to approve the Ambler Access Project across the iconic Brooks Range and Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve.35 Rejected by the Department of the Interior in 2024,36 this destructive project—a 211-mile private road to benefit a foreign mining company37—would cut through 11 major rivers and 3,000 streams and disrupt migration routes for more than 164,000 caribou.38

Lands protected from mining and drilling

Consistent with President Trump’s directives to prioritize mining and drilling across public lands,39 his administration is now targeting public lands that were explicitly protected from mineral leasing and mining claims. Existing or proposed “mineral withdrawals” protect specific lands from extractive development—often due to their unique ecological, cultural, and/or recreational resources—and typically respond to requests from citizens to conserve treasured places at risk of destructive development:40

Boundary Waters (Minnesota): The interconnecting lakes and streams that comprise the Boundary Waters of northern Minnesota are beloved by countless Americans for clear and clean waters, abundant fish and wildlife, star-filled dark skies, and seemingly endless opportunities for wilderness adventures.41 But actions by the Trump administration put this legacy directly at risk. With a social media post on June 11, 2025,42 Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced that she and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum would eliminate the mineral withdrawal for the watershed that feeds the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, opening more than 225,000 acres of national forest to destructive copper sulfide mining opposed by the vast majority of Minnesotans.43 One month later, the Department of the Interior took action to reinstate canceled leases for the Twin Metals mine,44 a massive project at the doorstep of the Boundary Waters wilderness proposed by a Chilean-owned mining company with a track record of toxic spills.45

Greater Chaco region (New Mexico): In the Greater Chaco region of New Mexico, the Trump administration is quietly taking aim at protections prohibiting new oil and gas leasing on public lands surrounding Chaco Canyon and the Chaco Culture National Historical Park.46 Final protections were adopted for this 336,000-acre area in 2023 to conserve extensive cultural and historic resources, including more than 4,700 known archaeological sites, following decades of Tribal and indigenous advocacy and extensive Tribal consultation and public input.47 In addition to preserving sacred lands and a cultural legacy dating back more than a millennium, these protections encompass more than 60,000 acres of New Mexico’s highest-value ecological resources, providing vital desert habitat and connectivity for wildlife.48

Upper Pecos River (New Mexico): Without warning or opportunity for public input, the Trump administration canceled protections for the Upper Pecos watershed on April 4, 2025. Trump officials buried the notice about two canceled mineral withdrawals at the bottom of an unrelated press release, leaving reporters to later confirm which places were affected.49 These public lands enjoyed temporary protections as land managers evaluated a longer-term mineral withdrawal—and Congress considered permanent protections—to prohibit mining and associated impacts in the Pecos River watershed.50 Recognized by the state of New Mexico for its valuable waters and culturally significant to the Jemez and Tesuque Pueblo, this special area provides vital habitat for imperiled Rio Grande cutthroat trout and other wildlife, as well as various recreation opportunities.51 This watershed is threatened by proposed mining for gold and other metals, even as cleanup continues from a catastrophic 1991 mining spill of toxic sludge from a legacy mine located in this same area.52

Ruby Mountains (Nevada): At the same time protections were stripped from the Upper Pecos, the Trump administration lifted drilling restrictions for the Ruby Mountains of Nevada.53 Known as the “Nevada’s Swiss Alps,” the Ruby Mountains are a renowned destination for fishing, hunting, and other recreation and provide refuge to the state’s largest mule deer herd, at-risk Lahontan cutthroat trout, and other iconic wildlife.54 Responding to calls from Tribes, hunters, anglers, conservationists, and other community members, the area was put off-limits to new oil, gas, and geothermal drilling in 2024 while a process was initiated to establish longer-term protections.55 The Trump administration’s action leaves these special public lands immediately vulnerable to leasing by oil and gas interests.

Other Western public lands

Additionally, the Trump administration has taken steps to rewrite the rules that apply across public lands and redraw management plans to favor oil, gas, coal, and other extractive development at the expense of landscape health and future generations:

Public Lands Rule: On top of targeting protected lands, the Trump administration is gutting conservation requirements that apply broadly across 245 million acres of public lands.56 By moving to rescind the BLM Public Lands Rule,57 also known as the “Conservation and Landscape Health Rule,” the administration is targeting the fundamental requirement that natural resource conservation should be treated on par with drilling, mining, and other extractive uses of public lands.58 Eliminating this rule would undercut requirements aimed at balancing land use decisions, conserving the most ecologically significant lands, and considering community proposals to conserve highly important lands.59 Ultimately, the impacts of this rollback are hard to quantify in advance, but they will be seen over time as land use decisions skew in favor of extractive development and away from long-term stewardship of public lands.

Land use plans in Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming: Complementing the effort to rig the system by eliminating the Public Lands Rule, the Trump administration is targeting completed public land management plans for a hasty rewrite. In particular, the Trump administration has indicated that it will revise at least five recently finalized plans that govern management of public lands in parts of Alaska, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming.60 Mandated by orders aimed at “unleashing” energy and other resource production61—and mirroring legislation from congressional Republicans to revoke or block these same plans62—the effort appears particularly aimed at reversing limitations on oil, gas, and coal development. In total, such a reversal would eliminate or weaken protections for an estimated 6.4 million acres of public lands,63 directly threatening wildlife migration corridors, Alaska Native subsistence resources, outdoor recreation opportunities, and more.64

Endangered species habitat

One of the most far-reaching and harmful actions being advanced by the Trump administration is a proposal that would gut key habitat protection provisions of the Endangered Species Act. This landmark law prohibits harm to endangered species, which, for a half-century, has included injuring or killing wildlife by modifying or destroying their habitat.65 As a result, clear-cutting or strip-mining the lands relied on by endangered wildlife is generally prohibited if it results in injury or death of the wildlife. This is not an all-out ban on habitat-related harm; the law allows some activities to proceed with assurances that harm is appropriately minimized and mitigated—offset by other beneficial activities, for example.66

In recent years, the evidence of a global extinction crisis has become more and more glaring. In October 2023, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced that 21 U.S. species were being simultaneously removed from the endangered list due to their extinction,67 and scientists estimate that 40 percent of animals and 34 percent of plant species in the United States are now at risk of extinction.68 A top driver of this alarming extinction trend is habitat loss and degradation.69

But earlier this year, the Trump administration issued a formal proposal to completely eliminate this definition of species “harm” and green-light habitat destruction for imperiled wildlife.70 This action would weaken protection for habitat that currently stretches across tens of millions of acres of natural lands and waters in all parts of the United States. Available data suggest that this action could weaken protections across more than 87 million acres of vital wildlife habitat.71 Corporate interests, which have fought these habitat protections for decades,72 celebrated the proposal.73

A threat to protected lands on the horizon: National monuments

The Trump administration is also threatening to wipe national monuments off the map, targeting special lands or waters protected by past presidents under the Antiquities Act. Buried in the fine print of an order from Secretary Burgum on February 3, 2025—without openly using the words “national monument”—was a directive to review existing national monuments for potential changes in the name of “unleashing” American energy and minerals.74 Already, President Trump has acted to erase protections for vast ocean areas within the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument;75 various news reports suggest other national monuments may be next.76 At risk are up to 13.5 million acres of public lands,77 from coast to coast, that protect outstanding recreation opportunities, scenic beauty, wildlife populations, scientific treasures, cultural heritage, and more.

Fire sales on oil and gas leases, mine approvals, and timber

While the Trump administration removes protections for special lands and waters, it is also moving rapidly to sell control of available public lands to the highest bidder. That push was just dramatically supercharged by new mandates and loopholes tucked into the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which hand even more control to industry to claim public lands while slashing the royalties and fees paid to drill those lands.

Oil, gas, and coal leasing

President Trump and Secretary Burgum have issued numerous orders aimed at making it easier for the oil and gas industry to lock up national public lands for oil and gas development.78 In addition to broad directives to expand leasing, approve drilling proposals, and eliminate requirements that slow development, Secretary Burgum has implemented “emergency” permitting procedures to bypass endangered species protections and compliance with the National Historic Preservation Act,79 while also shrinking the time for public input and environmental review.80 Moreover, Trump and Burgum mandated the expansion of new oil and gas leasing in the Western Arctic and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge—making the entire 1.56-million-acre coastal plain available for drilling and related development.81 With the help of the courts, President Trump also reinstated the oil leases held by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Administration from the 2021 lease sale in the Arctic Refuge,82 which had previously been canceled.83

At the same time, the Forest Service is in the process of finalizing a rule that would fast-track oil and gas leasing in national forests,84 affecting nearly 190 million acres across the United States.85 As proposed by the Trump administration in 2020, the rule would take substantial authority away from the Forest Service to determine where oil and gas leasing happens on national forests, while also short-circuiting environmental review and public input.86

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act will supercharge efforts by the Trump administration to give oil and gas companies free rein over more than 200 million acres of public lands.

Meanwhile, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will supercharge efforts by the Trump administration to give oil and gas companies free rein over more than 200 million acres of public lands.87 Most notably, the new law mandates formal lease sales every three months in nine Western states and mandates nine sales across millions of acres in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and Western Arctic over the next decade.88 It also gives the oil and gas industry unprecedented control over what lands it can lease, stripping the ability of federal land managers to deny leases on land with clear wildlife, recreation, archaeological, or other conflicts.89 Essentially, the oil industry can choose to drill in a popular fishing or camping spot, or next to a national park or hospital, and the BLM can do nothing to stop them.

The OBBBA also cuts oil companies a major price break—cutting royalty rates on oil and gas from nearly 17 percent to just 12.5 percent and eliminating the modest $5 per-acre lease nomination fee—while reinstating the practice of “noncompetitive leasing” to allow companies to quietly scoop up leases on public lands at rock-bottom prices after a public auction ends.90 Royalties for coal from public lands, meanwhile, are cut from 12.5 percent down to just 7 percent, and the OBBBA mandates that an additional 4 million acres of public lands be made available for coal leasing within 90 days.91

Timber sales

Consistent with this pattern, President Trump is pushing reckless policies to sell out America’s public forests for timber profits as well. Through a March 2025 executive order, Trump directed public land managers to tap into emergency authorities under the Endangered Species Act to facilitate timber production and explore ways to avoid required environmental review.92 A month later, Secretary Rollins abruptly declared nearly 60 percent of national forest lands to be in a state of emergency due to wildfire risk and forest health, claiming that the situation warranted the use of emergency legal authorities to facilitate commercial timber harvesting, among other qualifying activities.93 As discussed above, Rollins has also taken steps to remove conservation protections for special national forest lands, which would open some of the most recreationally and ecologically valuable public forests for commercial logging.

Subsequently, Congress passed President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act,94 which dramatically accelerates logging on public lands. To help offset the bill’s expensive tax cuts—which predominantly benefit the wealthiest Americans95—the final legislation mandated massive increases in timber sold from public lands.96 In fact, the law ultimately requires more than a 75 percent increase in timber sales across both national forests and BLM public lands.97 It also mandates that public land managers enter into new 20-year timber sale contracts.98

Mining prioritized everywhere

On March 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order that aims to make mining the No. 1 priority across all public lands, trumping all other uses of those lands where legally allowable.99 Specifically, the order mandates that the secretary of the interior make mineral production and mining activities the “primary land uses” of any federal lands with mineral deposits or reserves. That means, by direction of the president, mining would take precedence over outdoor recreation, wildlife conservation, preserving archaeological or cultural sites, and any other use.

While a president cannot unilaterally allow mining in areas deemed off-limits by Congress—national parks, for example—Trump’s order is already precipitating the reversal of protections for special areas, threatening the Boundary Waters and other treasured places. With Trump’s mining order also mandating the review and revision of public land management plans and with a proposed rule aimed at speeding mine approvals in national forests currently under review by the White House, more rollbacks of protections are likely on the horizon.100

In addition, Trump’s order requires land managers to fast-track approvals for mines on federal lands, while also directing relevant government agencies to find ways to subsidize the corporations developing these mines. Notably, Trump’s executive order applies to more than just “critical” or strategic minerals and explicitly includes minerals such as gold, copper, and uranium. Under a legal framework dating back to 1872, companies can generally stake claims and mine for valuable minerals on Western public lands without paying royalties for the minerals they extract.101 Trump’s order is poised to dramatically expand that giveaway of public resources while throwing in additional taxpayer money for selected corporations.

Locking in private rights to public lands

While oil leases and mining claims do not transfer ownership of the land itself, the legal rights to drill and mine can be—and often are—extended again and again. Additionally, drilling, mining, and other extractive development can have long-lasting impacts on land health, clean water, and wildlife populations.102

Federal oil and gas leases are issued for a 10-year period, and they can be easily extended for a producing well or if the company simply demonstrates that drilling operations are in progress at the end of those 10 years.103 These extendable eases can be acquired “competitively” for as little as $10 per acre, plus administrative fees and a rental fee starting at $3 per acre each year.104

The oil and gas industry is already sitting on 35 million acres of leased federal lands, an area about the size of Florida, and it produces on less than half of those acres.105 Even while they are not actively producing, companies can benefit from stockpiled leases that pad their balance sheets.106 Larger and more frequent lease sales pushed by President Trump, particularly combined with reduced fees and the return of noncompetitive leasing thanks to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, are likely to result in even more extensive speculation and stockpiling.

Additionally, hardrock mining claims can be staked across the vast majority of Western public lands for just $49 per claim and may also be extended indefinitely even if the claim is not actively developed—generally by paying an annual fee of $200.107 Companies can then develop and sell the valuable minerals without paying royalties,108 often extracting substantial profits from public resources with no public compensation.

Once acquired, oil and gas leases and mining claims are treated as preexisting development rights that outweigh future conservation action long into the future. In fact, more than 3,700 mining claims exist today within the boundaries of what are now national parks or national monuments,109 and legal battles to cancel antiquated leases to conserve high-value public lands can extend for many years.110

Conclusion

Just as it was nearly impossible for the public to track the many harmful provisions buried in the 850-plus page One Big Beautiful Bill Act,111 following the maelstrom of anti-conservation actions from the Trump administration can be a daunting proposition. But with more than 175 million acres of land protections already slated for elimination and weakening, the collective impacts are on track to be massive. Ongoing efforts by President Trump’s Cabinet to further weaken environmental protections mean the total impact will only grow from here.

With more than 175 million acres of land protections already slated for elimination and weakening, the collective impacts are on track to be massive.

Meanwhile, parallel actions to sell or give control of available public lands to corporate interests for drilling, mining, and logging could spell long-term losses for the American public. At rock-bottom prices, extractive corporations can scoop up long-term leases or mining claims that encumber public lands for many decades. That includes formerly protected lands and waters treasured today for their outdoor adventure opportunities, wildlife, and history.

Ultimately, the Trump administration’s efforts to un-protect and sell out public lands are wildly out of step with what the public wants.112 Widespread outrage sparked by Congress’ attempt to sell off public lands was a powerful reminder that Americans expect their public lands to be kept in public hands. It remains to be seen whether the steady onslaught from the Trump administration will catch as much public attention and, critically, whether elected officials in positions of power will take steps to stop it before it is too late.

“Close your eyes in the summer and you’ll hear children laughing at the park, dogs barking and the familiar bells of the paleteros,” said Chuy Reyes, a Chicago-based photographer who documents the lives of street vendors.

In a way, street vendors stepped into an untapped market and are often overlooked as essential contributors to society.","A gentle breeze carried the scent of sweet fruit and earthy vegetables from Rodolfo Espinoza’s produce stand on an early Tuesday morning on the Southwest Side of Chicago.

Espinoza and his wife carefully arranged their produce under a blue tarp: bananas nestled among the tomatoes, serrano peppers between the strawberries, avocados stacked next to mangos. The tarp serves as a makeshift shelter that shields their products from the hot sun in the summer and biting wind during winter.

“¡Buenos días, pásele, pásele!” Espinoza cheerfully called out to passersby, inviting them to browse his offerings. “Good morning, come in, come in.”

A señora, wrapped in a rebozo and wearing an apron, stopped to buy peppers. Most of Espinoza’s customers, he said, are familiar faces from the neighborhood.

After his first sale of the day, Espinoza made the sign of the cross. Lately, sales have been slow.

“People don’t really go out anymore. They’re scared of ICE. We’re scared too, but we have no other choice,” Espinoza said. “With God’s grace, nothing will happen to us.”

In the three weeks since President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security announced the start of “Operation Midway Blitz,” its latest immigration enforcement surge in the Chicago region, street vendors and their customers have vanished from familiar corners across the city. The crowds no longer gathered around the elotero after church, paleteros outside of schools.

Their quiet disappearance marks not just a loss of income, it’s also the erosion of a culture cherished by many in the city. Street vendors have long been a vital thread in Chicago’s societal and economic fabric, their work revolving around traditional dishes and products that often can’t be found anywhere else in the city. They serve fellow immigrants craving a taste of home.

“Close your eyes in the summer and you’ll hear children laughing at the park, dogs barking and the familiar bells of the paleteros,” said Chuy Reyes, a Chicago-based photographer who documents the lives of street vendors. “They bring joy and flavor to our city and some of the most beautiful people I’ve met; that’s why I share their stories — so they can be seen and heard. What they do is a dying art, born of love.”

Now, their livelihoods, many of them older immigrants who have been in the country for decades, are under even greater threat with the immigration enforcement surge. They’ve historically been among the city’s most vulnerable workers, often facing financial uncertainty, a lack of benefits and danger because of precarious work conditions, such as targets of crime.

A few remain, relying on faith to keep going, such as Espinoza and his wife. But for most, the uncertainty has only deepened after legal protections were rolled back by the Supreme Court earlier this month, allowing federal immigration agents to target individuals based on race, language, or the type of work they do.

Street vendors are especially at risk “because historically most, if not all in Chicago, are Latino immigrants — Mexican to be exact — and speak Spanish,” said Dolores Castañeda, a community organizer and researcher.

Data on street vendors remains limited as their transient nature makes them difficult to track. Chicago legalized street vending in 2015, and that same year, a study by the Illinois Policy Institute counted roughly 2,000 street vendors in the city. Today, the Street Vendors Association of Chicago puts the estimate closer to 3,000, said Martin Unzueta, director of Chicago Community and Worker’s Rights, who works closely with the association.

For many, becoming a street vendor is pure necessity, and sometimes a sacrifice. They are often without legal documents, have age limitations or face other life circumstances that prevent them from working elsewhere.

But as they tread along, they serve fellow immigrants nostalgic, familiar flavors such as pan artesanal, camotes, gorditas or tepache.

For Rodolfo Alvarez, that taste is tamales.

Alvarez, owner of Alvarez Hardware on 18th Street in Pilsen, has lived in the area for 62 years. Recently, a friend stopped by Alvarez’s shop with tamales that he planned to sell at his nearby cafe. They were good, Alvarez said, but “too Americanized.”

He feels the same way about the tamales sold at popular Mexican restaurants, who tend to cater to customers who might not be as “spice-tolerant,” Alvarez said with a laugh.

“They just aren’t spicy enough, they have too little salt or too much — but I love it hot; even my grandkids like spicy,” Alvarez said. But the homemade tamales, usually tamales rojos from a nearby street vendor, never fail to satisfy his craving.

“Those are the ones that remind me of home,” he said.

Throughout the decades, Alvarez has witnessed changes to the local landscape in Pilsen, the ebb and flow of new development, shifting demographics and cultural conservation.

But nothing has been as drastic as the too-quiet streets on Mexican Independence Day. He’s hopeful it’s only temporary.

“The street vendors used to always go through the streets shouting what they have … candies or ice cream or popsicles or corn — all the kids will come out, and even grown-ups too,” Alvarez said. “Maybe they missed a flavor from their (youth) … that’s what we had here, and I think we will keep up with the traditions again.”

Street vending gained popularity in Chicago during the 1970s, according to Lilia Fernandez, a history professor at the University of Illinois Chicago. Migration from Mexico continued but as jobs declined at industrial warehouses across the steel mills, railroads, packing houses and stockyards, many Latino communities turned to the informal economy to survive.

In a way, street vendors stepped into an untapped market and are often overlooked as essential contributors to society.

“Immigrant vendors and small business owners often provide goods that aren’t readily available in the mainstream market,” Fernandez said.

Still, the work is not easy.

Take Espinoza. After taking some hard hits in his life, the 60-year-old said there’s not much else he can do to make a living. The sidewalk produce stand has sustained him and his wife for six years. He turned to vending after losing his job and falling ill during the pandemic.

“We survived then, and we worked mostly every day out here,” Espinoza said smiling. Today, he intends to resist the odds yet again.

But advocates worry that vendors, especially those on the Southwest Side, are being targeted by immigration agents, racially profiling them to meet their quotas.

On Sept. 7, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained a flower peddler with no known criminal record. Concerned bystanders recorded his arrest and the video went viral. He was deported a few days later.

Five days later, images of federal immigration agents arresting two palateros selling popsicles in Mount Prospect circulated on Facebook, garnering hundreds of comments. Many of them said they had bought a popsicle from the vendors a day ago, or that buying from those paleteros had been a long-standing tradition for families in that neighborhood.

“This is very detrimental to Latino people — Mexicans, Hondurans, Guatemalans — everyone is just trying to make a living, to pay rent and buy clothes and food for their children by selling small things,” said Obdulia Delgado, a well-known community member who shared the images on Facebook.

Delgado said the street vendor presence in Mount Prospect and nearby Palatine is dissipating. There were always fewer vendors in the suburbs compared to the city, she said, now they are even more vulnerable.

A recent study by the University of Illinois Chicago, funded by the Center for Healthy Work, focused on the experiences and health impacts of vendors in South Lawndale to showcase their struggles and find ways to support them.

The research, led by Castañeda, found that informal work offers limited social protections, advancement opportunities, and leaves workers vulnerable to discrimination and exploitation. Many face unsafe working conditions, irregular income and the constant fear of deportation, all contributing to stress.

“It’s cruel to step on someone already vulnerable knowing well that they’re not criminals — these are honest people working, contributing to the economy — just because they want to reach deportation numbers, just because they look Mexican,” Castañeda said. “They’re forgetting the richness that they have brought to our city, to our country.”

Castañeda and others have been working to educate vendors about their rights, urging them to prepare in case of an arrest and to identify safe spaces if federal immigration agents are spotted in the area while they’re working.

Ciria, who asked that her last name be withheld for safety reasons, said she keeps her elote cart close to home, with her door left open at all times.

“Si la migra viene, corro para la casa,” Ciria said. “If ICE comes I’ll run home to hide.”

The Mexican grandmother has been in the country for nearly three decades, but like most longtime immigrants, has not been able to legalize her status because of complex policies. She said she would be required to leave the country for10 years or more before starting the legalization process.

“People think it’s easy to fix your papers. ‘Get in line,’ they said. That’s foolish, there’s no line,” Ciria said.

Faustina Vargas, 51, who sells homemade bread early each morning, shares a similar story. By 10 a.m. on a recent Tuesday, she had sold only one bag for $6.

Vargas has lived in Chicago for 28 years and managed to buy a home with her husband.

“It was a dream come true and something we worked so hard for,” Vargas said, who refused to stay home even after the news that ICE would be patrolling the area where she sells her bread. “But right now, even if we’ve paid our taxes every year, even if we pay our mortgage, it doesn’t feel like it’s ours.”

Still, she holds on to hope.

“I pray every day,” she said. “When I start getting anxious or nervous, I pray again. I pray for us, immigrants and for them, so that God softens their hearts.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CTC-L-vendors-deportation01.jpg?w=1024&h=683,N,,2025-09-22 03:57:00.200366

We produced this episode earlier this year in May, and we thought it was a good time to run it again because it's about the way the US is treating immigrants. It's about an immigrant to the United States who is very badly treated by the US government.

A lot has changed since May, and at the end of the episode, we're gonna give you an update, so please stay tuned for that.

ROGER: Tio - Como esta todo? Feliz Cumpleano. Que le pasa un fine excelente. Que Dio le Bendiga sempre.

HOST: Roger Eduardo Molina Acevedo: 29 years old, Venezuelan. Millennial. From the state of Aragua. That was a message of him calling to wish his Uncle Noel a happy birthday.

MUSIC

Roger is not married, but has a common-law relationship with his partner Daniela Nuñez. No kids. They just landed at the airport. Together. Their first time on U.S. soil. She’s standing beside him. They make their way from the plane towards border control and customs.

Roger graduated from high school. Back in Venezuela, he worked at his family hardware stores. Loves soccer. Has a tattoo of a soccer ball, a pine forest, a REAL madrid Crown, and nd an infinity sign with the word family.

He and Daniela both have been invited into the country - pre-approved for refugee status.

Roger’s uncle, Noel, told him, “If you’re gonna go to the United States — do it the legal way.”

NOEL: Irregular, no usted busca la manera, pero de irse de manera regular, okey,

Host: Two nights ago, January 7, 2025, he and Daniela stayed in a hotel paid for by the International Organization for Migration, the entity that helped them both get refugee status. Roger sends his uncle a 34 second video giving him a little tour of the space.

ROGER’S HOTEL TAPE (just sounds, we hear a couple “este”’s

That’s what you’re hearing now.

But now they’re at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport. And they’ve just made it through the Visitors line, the line for non-citizens, to Border Control.

Juan: Cuándo fue la primera vez que que supiste que algo podría estar mal con tu sobrino que le podría haber pasado algo?

Host: That’s Juan Papier translating, he's deputy Director for the Americas at Human Rights Watch. And he’s translating between me and Uncle Noel. Noel is Venezuelan too, but lives in the Dominican Republic. My question to Uncle Noel: When was the first moment you realized that something was wrong with your nephew?

NOEL: Ya me había llamado para decirme que que todo había salir mal.

Juan: he called me that everything went badly.

Host: The agent at the border control station asks Daniela: “Are you afraid to return to your country?” She says no. That same day, they put her on a plane and deport her back to Venezuela.

Now to Roger:

Noel: Los funcionarios de migración que lo atendieron le dieron un tatuaje que tiene en el brazo derecho y empezaron a hacer los preguntas por el respecto a ese tatuaje.

JUAN: They stopped him, eh and they about one of the tattoos. He has eh and they asked him questions about the tattoo what does this tattoo min they said that the tattoo was Associated with some of the criminal groups that operate en en Venezuela.

[MUSIC]

Host: For what it’s worth, there is no evidence that tattoos of a pine tree forest, a soccer ball, REAL Madrid or an infinity sign with the world “family” on it are associated with Venezuelan gangs.

Juan: He got very nervous, eh? He thought that they would do something to him, eh? The officers threatened to call the FBI and to get him arrested he called me he was very scared, eh? Think thinking that something bad could happen to him.

HOST: On today’s episode, forced disappearances at the U.S. border - the deportation of the Venezuelans.

This is Rights & Wrongs, a podcast from Human Rights Watch. I'm Ngofen Mputubwele. I am a writer, a lawyer, and a radio producer. Human Rights Watch asked me to look at human rights hotspots around the world through the eyes and ears of people on the front lines of history.

This week, The Loaded Gun

NOEL: Roger es mi sobrino, pero vamos a decir tú, eh, yo lo siento como muy claro. Y él se apoyaba muchísimo en, es más, se apoyaba much demente en su propio papá. Sí, todo este proceso que él ha vivido siempre me llamaba todos los días, eh? Me decía cómo se sentía que, pues obviamente me siento muy mal por lo que lo está viviendo. Y más aún, porque en este memento no puedo hacer nada.

Host: Roger is my nephew. He relied on me as a support even more than his own father. This whole situation that he has endured, he has called every day, telling how he feels. And I feel ill knowing what he’s undergoing. And what’s worse, there’s nothing I can do.

——

Host: Before we continue with Roger, let’s hop over to Washington, D.C. for a moment. One of the big conversations being had in the U.S. Congress right now surrounds a law called the Alien Enemies Act.

ARCHIVAL-PBS NEWS HOUR: The supreme court ruled late yesterday that the Trump administration can continue to use a rare 18th century law war authority to deport… (fade down)

NGOFEEN: What is the law that is like in question here? What is, what is this law?

AKSHAYA: The Alien Enemies Act of 1798. / [it] allows the president to take really, uh, broad actions against people who aren't citizens of this country. / it enables the president to direct people who work for him, to detain people, to deport them, to also restrict how they live their lives.

Host: This is AKSHAYA Director of Crisis Advocacy, Human Rights Watch.

NGOFEEN: And so the law has only been used, uh, four times now, this fourth time is this year by President Trump?

NGOFEEN: four?

AKSHAYA: Yeah, four.

NGOFEEN: Oh, okay.

AKSHAYA: You can count them.

Ngofeen:Oh, wow.

Akshaya: … On your hand. So I said, this thing's only been used four times. The other three times we're in wars. Like wars that we study in history, books we know about them. World War II, World War I, the War of 1812. The reason that our current president has deployed this act is he says that, uh, this country is being invaded by a Venezuelan gang.

Host: Back to Roger. And just a reminder here, both Roger and his partner were legally approved to come to the United States. This was not an illegal crossing.

NOEL: Me llamó todavía estando en en el aeropuerto. Sí. Detenido.

Host: The next day Roger is still at the Dallas/Fort Worth airport in Texas. Still detained. Uncle Noel happens to have Venezuelan friends in Texas. They put him in touch with an immigration attorney. Uncle Noel calls the immigration attorney, who says,

NOEL: Eh? Él me dijo mira, // tiene dos opciones

Host: Look, your nephew has two options. Either:

Noel: o él va a la corte para hacer la solicitud asilo

Host: Roger goes to court to request asylum

Noel: o él va a ser deportado.

Host: Or Roger will be deported.

Noel: Sonos sonos dos opciones. Eh a él lo llevaron desde el aeropuerto a un primer centro de de atención que se llama Montgomery.

Host: From the airport, Roger is taken to a detention facility called the Montgomery Processing center. Also in Texas. Uncle Noel stays in touch, obviously. After consulting with the lawyer, the lawyer says, Llook, given the look of things in the U.S., your nephew is better off requesting to self-deport to Venezuela.

Host: Uncle Noel relays this info to his nephew.

Noel: El el abogado nos hizo una recomendación que nosotros la rendimos. El abogado nos dijo, eh, ya se acerca la toma de posición del preside de Donald Trump. Yo le recomiendo no quedarse esperando la corte para para pelear por el asi, sino por el contrario, pedir la solicitud de de retiro de asi civil que pronunciaba a la posibilidad de solicitar a la civil. Yo se documenté a él. Y él me dijo absolutamente que sí, porque ya él no quería estar en estados unidos.

Host: Nephew Roger says, Uncle Noel, I want to get the hell home. To Venezuela.

Noel: Me digo, tío que me quiero oír. No quiero estar un minu más acá.

Host: I don’t want to be here one minute longer. Reminder, in case you forgot —his partner, Daniela, is gone.

Noel: No le he contado algo que que que digamos que importante. Es que los entrevistaron a los dos a Roger y a Daniela a, eh, pero a Daniela sí, la deportaron a manos.

Host: Roger enters the ICE detention system.

JUAN: We made many requests twice, asking about his condición, eh, telling them constantly. He was not a criminal that he had no committed any crime, eh and they told us there was. No he didn't have any criminal record in the United states and they said that they didn't know way he was being held we as multiple times for him to be eh deported but they didn’t answer.

Noel: Y la situación se tornó especialmente complicada cuando lo trasladaron a un centro de atención que se llama Joe el College de pretención center

Host: Roger is transferred to Joe Coley Detention Center, and that’s when things get bad.

NOEL: cuando llegó ese centro, detención me llamó llorando muy muy nervioso. Porque me dijo que le habían cambiado su atuendo y lo habían. Le habían colocado un at acuerdo de criminal.

Host: When he arrived at the center, Uncle Noel tells. he called me crying and very very nervous. He told me that they changed his detention outfit to one that was for criminals. I.e. for someone who had committed a serious crime, a red jumpsuit.

NOEL: a lo lo hicieron de robo, necesidad.

Host: A jumpsuit that’s red.

Noel: él me llamó muy asustado diciéndome que por qué le estaban haciendo esto? Que qué hago?

Host: He called me asking, why are they doing this? What do I do?

Noel: Entonces yo le pregunté que si era solamente a él que lo habían vestido de esa manera. Y me dijo no a todos los venezolanos nos colocaron de ese color.

Host: So I asked… are they doing this to you or to everyone? And he said…. To everyone who is Venezuelan, they are making us wear this color.

Noel: De robo. Entonces yo tratando de de calmarlo poco, yo le digo, bueno, pero si son todos los venezolanos, eh? Tranquilízate. Porque cuando tú llegues a Venezuela, tú no has cometido delito, por lo cual no va a pasar nada.

Juan: so i was trying to calm him down and i told him, eh? If that's happening to all Venezuela don't worry when you are sent back to Venezuela you will be okay, because you have never com a crime and nothing wrong to happen to you

NOEL: Yo siento que ya estaba todo organizado para mover a los venezolanos bajo la ley de enemigos de extranjero.

Host: But I feel that all of this was organized so as to move the Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act.

Host: A month passes. Roger in Joe Colley. Uncle Noel stressed. The two talking by phone a much as possible. And then finally, good news. He’s gonna be deported.

NOEL: El día 13 de marzo en donde me llamó muy contento, pu que les habían dicho que iban a ser reportado.

Host: March 13. Phone call. Roger.

Juan: on the thirteenth of march. He called me he was very happy because finally. He was told he was going to be deported.

Host: He says hey uncle, tío …

Noel: muy tío. Se acabó la pesadilla. Me van a deportar que mañana nos vamos.

Juan: He told me that the nightmare was over And this is something I like to emphasize because they were like to they were all told that they were going to be sent back to Venezuela.

Noel: Les dieron porque todos estaban contentos porque les dijeron que la deportación sería Pablo. Venezuela, okey,

Host: ICE has a documentation system, a registry, where you can check on the status of someone who’s been detained. Whenever Roger is shifted from detention center to detention center, it's always documented on this searchable online list on ICE / the Department of State's website. Then. Next thing Uncle Noel knows, Roger suddenly disappears from the immigration registry.

[MUSIC]

NOEL: en lunes … llamé a primera hora.

Host: Monday morning, Noel tells me, as soon as they open, I call the detention center.

Noel: Y me dijeron en el centro de atención y hidalgo que él ya no estaba allí. Roer ya no está aquí. Dónde está? No le podemos dar información.

Host: Roger isn't here. Where is he? We can't give you any other information. Call this other detention center. Which one? And they give me the number.

Noel: Llame a otro centro de atención a cuál? Y me daba mi número. Llamaba a ese número, me decía lo mismo, no está, llame a otro y me daban otro número.

Host: I call this number, they told me the same thing, call another detention center, and they gave me another number,

Noel: Yo pasé literalmente toda la mañana llamando centro de detención en Texas. Llamé a más de 10 y en ninguno me daban información, eh?

Host: I spent literally the whole morning calling immigration detention centers in Texas. I called at least 10 and no one gave me any information.

Noel: Al final de la tarde de ese día, desde el l 17 octubre, conseguir el número de la sede central de ice en en Houston,

Host: At the end of that afternoon, around 5pm, I got the number for the central office of ICE in Houston.

Noel: llamé a ese número literalmente llorando que quería información de mi sobrino mismo.

Host: And I called this number, literally, crying. That I wanted information about my nephew.

NOEL: Y una señora cuando no toca, estaba llorando. Me dijo lo único que te puedo decir es que tu sobrino fue extraído de los estados unidos. Manda

Host: And a woman on the phone when she noticed I was crying she said, the only thing I can tell you is that your nephew was removed from the United States.

Then crickets. Nothing.

Then, later that week:

ARCHIVAL-CBS NEWS: The pictures are striking. More than 200 Venezuelans flown on government planes out of Arlington, Texas, last week.

In the news, the images of planes at an airport in El Salvador. A maximum security prison in El Salvador.

ARCHIVAL-CBS NEWS: One of the world’s most notorious prisons. Heads shaven. Arms shackled.

El Salvador. Not Venezuela. For Uncle Noel, still no word of where his son is. Until

ARCHIVAL-CBS NEWS: Today, CBS news has obtained a list of 100s of people deported. Hundreds of alleged gang members sent this past week to El Salvador

There’s a leak. A list of people deported on that plane is leaked to CBS:

NOEL: Eh, cuando se filó la la lfa de las personas que habían sido el día hacia allá que pudimos percatarnos porque su nombre aparecía en la l.

JUAN: So we suspecting that he might el salvador we the images, eh that were posted online about the way they treated the Venezuela people who were sent fortunately we didn't see him in the videos because it would have been tragic for his mother to see him treated that way. It wasn’t until Wed list Salvador we confirm got so.

---

NGOFEEN: because there's such a fire hose of things happening at once, I think I'm like. Yeah, many of us overwhelmed a bit with like, not even emotionally, I just mean like tracking which thing is which thing. This is the, this is the situation that we've been hearing about in the news with like, … turn the plane back …Like, no, don't ship them off. Bring the plane back. And then the federal government being like, no, we're not bringing them back. That that's this. Is that right?

AKSHAYA: Yeah.

NGOFEEN: Okay. That's, that's what this is?

AKSHAYA: Yeah. So there and uh, there were a bunch of people on those planes, like 200, uh, almost 240 people, 137 of those men, the government says, um, they removed under the Alien Enemy Act. We are a month and a half out. Since that happened, they still have not said the names of the 137 people. Yeah. Imagine. Yeah. If that was your family member, they haven't even acknowledged the actual names. So the only thing we've got the government to say is 137 of those people were removed under the Alien Enemies Act. The other hundred some were removed under other legal authorities.

--

NGOFEEN: Have you spoken to him since he’s been there?

JUAN: Has podido hablar con él desde que lo enviaron al salvador.

NOEL: No hemos hablado ni una palabra con nada.

JUAN: We have been able to communicate a single word to him.

NOEL: Ellos están siendo víctima de un delito del esa humanidad que se llama desaparición forzosa. Lamentablemente, eh, ejecutada por un país al cual le tengo mucho cariño y mucho como tengo en estados unidos, pero lamentablemente entraron en una onda terrible de hacer desapariciones de los migrantes.

Host: Noel says, they are victims of a crime called forced disappearance. Done by a country that I respect deeply, i.e. the United States, but they have become part of a wave for disappearances of migrants.

AKSHAYA: this isn't even their home country. They were just sent to a third country to be kept in a jail. Um, and we don't know the details of that agreement. Not only has the government not made public, the names of the people who they put in this jail, they haven't told the Congress, they haven't told the public like, what are the terms, what are the El Salvador, uh, what, sorry, what does the El Salvador government say it's gonna do? Are we paying them for this? How are the people gonna be treated? Yeah. Is it at the same standards as a prison in the United States or not? Um, and a lot of it is just completely unknown.

Ngofeen: Mm-hmm. And

Akshaya: … It's the kind of thing that… we typically document in, uh, some of the other crisis situations mm-hmm.

That I work on. Right. And forced disappearances, people being detained in the context of, um. A repressive government that doesn't let them talk to their lawyers or their families. Uh, and they don't know how long they're gonna be in jail or when they'll get out, or even what charges they're being held under. Mm-hmm. Like that's the, the situation that these people are facing and it's at the hands of the US government… is using.

Host: If you watch the videos of the Venezuelans landed in El Salvador, it’s disturbing. People heads shorn like sheep. Their heads held down. By loads of armed officers.

AKSHAYA: in partnership with, uh, Kristo Al, who's this El Salvador based human rights organization mm-hmm. Um, people have done autopsies on people who passed away while they were in these prisons. Uh, and they have come to really worrying conclusions about, uh, the treatment that led to people's deaths, to prisoner deaths. and so what we found is evidence that people are being tortured./ And then there are, there smaller things like they, they use particular kinds of handcuffs that link your hands and your legs together that can kind of force you to stoop./ And people might have noticed that in this video that is played, um. Or that was posted by El Salvador's government and then by members of the US government as well that showed the men being brought off the plane. And you notice they're stooping and that's because they're handcuffed their hands to their legs. And the UN expert on torture, um, an ill treatment, she did a specific report on devices that are used for torture. And those kinds of handcuffs are one of them.

Host: Reminder: Roger, 29, millennial, has no criminal record. None. And there’s something else he doesn’t have now -- due process.

AKSHAYA: So one of the things that came out in the litigation

Ngofeen: mm-hmm.

AKSHAYA: Um, and also has now been publicly released through this records act. So we, you know, we know this is what they were using

Ngofeen: mm-hmm.

AKSHAYA: Is this validation guide that the government put together and they gave people points to decide are you a member of this gang or not. So, um, it was a point system and, um, you need to get eight points according to the government to be deemed a gang member.

You could get up to four of those points for just having tattoos. Like if you have four tattoos, four points. Um, and then the other factors that were included, there were things like, um, wearing smart urban streetwear. Uh, yeah. Uh, they mentioned in their guidance when they, what they mean by that, that, you know, um, any jerseys with players from Venezuela or if you have the Jordan Jumpman, uh, those I guess are indicia according to whoever.

Made this list for the government.

Ngofeen: Mm-hmm. Um,

AKSHAYA: Meanwhile, actual experts on this gang have been interviewed, … experts on this particular group, UA have said, yeah.

There's no, nothing like that. Tattoos don't even mean anything, uh, in the Venezuelan context. It's just, you know, like common culture among young people. Yeah. And, uh, the clothes, like Yeah. People tend to be proud when someone from their country makes it big in a professional sports team. Yeah. Um, that can't be a reason to think that Yeah.

You're in a gang.

Host: Now, that we're here. My lawyer brain wants to understand how we got here, legally. Because, like it or not, the U.S. government is claiming that it is acting legally. So how is it making that argument? That’s after the break…

ACT II

--

Ngofeen: Can you tell me about the history of the law a nit?

AKSHAYA: Yeah, so the act came about, uh, back in the 1790s. The newly formed American government, this was the second president, uh, John Adams was worried about, uh, French citizens who were.

On US territory and, uh, French influence over this young American government. And so he, uh, helped pass a set of four laws that are called the Alien And Sedition Acts. And The Alien Enemies Act was one of those, um, these laws were basically, uh, so broad and problematic that they were almost immediately criticized // Thomas Jefferson, who ended up being this country's third president, launched a huge campaign against them, said this is, um, a recipe for presidential.

Dictatorship almost that it's, uh, something that gives far too much power to the executive branch because it limited what could be published through the Sedition acts, and then it put all of these restrictions on people who weren't nationals of this country.

Ngofeen: Mm-hmm.

AKSHAYA: … because of that blowback … Adams was kind of pushed out of power mm-hmm. And Jefferson took over, uh, and he campaigned on how. Problematic, these acts were. Three of the acts were basically repealed or replaced almost immediately, as soon as Jefferson got into power. Okay. Um, this one was never used then. That's why I called the loaded gun.

It was the fourth act and they never had cause to use it because there actually didn't end up being a war with France

Ngofeen: Uhhuh.

Akshaya: He didn't end up using this act but the act, uh, stayed on the books and then it was picked up again three times. One during the war of 1812. Uh, when the US was fighting the British. And then two times in World War I and World War II.

[ MUSIC.]

Host: Here’s a story about when this was used in World War I. When the U.S. was, reminder, fighting Germany.

AKSHAYA: Among the people who were detained and these people like detained for over a year, almost two years, um, was a German born conductor, uh, of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and pretty much the whole symphony.

And they put them all in this detention camp in Georgia. Uh, and some of the reasons why they rounded them up were they talk in German at the rehearsals. Uh, they didn't play the stars strangled banner when someone requested it once. And, um, the guy, the, you know, the, the German conductor, Carl Muck was his name.

He actually had Swiss citizenship, but they still rounded him up because of his place of birth. Uh, and that. Example to me. Um, it just, uh, it paints such a vivid picture. 'cause um, there was this whole group, they were kept in a camp in Georgia, and they protested what was being done to them because they, you know, had, it was hot.

It was sticky. Yeah. And they weren't able to get out. And they, um, decided to play Mozart, uh, which is a German, um, famous classical music composer.

Host: Technically Austrian, but German in the broad sense.

Akshaya: They decided to play Mozart in the nude in the prison camp. And this has been documented as their protest act. Uh, and they still were kept there. You know, it, it got some public attention, but it took many, many months for them to get out.

Uh, and he was just, you know, this was just one example.

Host: Here’s the text the Alien Enemies Act:

Whenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.

As AKSHAYA says -- the law has always been used in instances of war.

AKSHAYA: President Trump is using this act for the first time that any president has ever used it outside of the context of a war declared by Congress.

Akshaya: They're making it clear that their motivation is less about any kind of real national security concern vis-a-vis this, uh, ostensible gang. And much more about a mass deportation agenda, which the president announced in his rallies when he was campaigning back in, uh, you know, September, October, November of last year.

Which they have reiterated since they've come into office. And which, uh, vice President Vance, uh, has been tweeting about very openly. They're saying, we are concerned if we have to give every person who, um, this administration would like to deport you process that would take too long.

Ngofeen: Mm-hmm.

Akshaya: And so things like this act, uh, which allow.

Or at least purport to allow the government to take shortcuts suddenly are very attractive. Like, why would someone look back into the history books and dust off this law from 1798 that hadn't been used in years? There has to be a motivation. Uh, and it's not because we're in a declared war. There is no war declared against Venezuela.

There's no war declared against tr de Laua, which is the gang that, uh, this declaration says is invading this country. Uh, president Trump can issue a proclamation making those claims, but that doesn't make it true.

Host: But while one may not agree with it, one has to assume the government will argue something different. LIke, the text grants the President powers in the case of declared war OR invasions / predatory incursions. So I asked AKSHAYA the painful question? Isn’t the government’s argument that: we’re being invaded? I.e.

NGOFEEN: we, we, we sort of like at the start of the term, said that we're being, we're being invaded. Um, and we've specifically said as to the, you know, we perceive the Venezuelan gang as an invasion. // that is what, um, meets the sort of threshold in, uh. Uh, in the law of like, there being, you know, the, like the war isn't required in the law textually, and so we're doing something that like Yeah. It, there is a war. That's why we said there's an invasion. Like what's sort of your response to that?

Akshaya: Yeah. So I, I have two ways to think about this. Yeah. One is, that's actually the whole reason why we wrote this report because the law in and of itself is a problem.

Host: Human Rights Watch has published a report on the situation unfolding under the Alien Enemies Act.

AKSHAYA: And Congress should have, even before President Trump came into office, have gotten rid of it. Struck it off the books, repealed it, and then we wouldn't be in the situation of reading between the lines or allowing it to be instrumentalized for patently absurd claims. Yeah. Right. So a simple solution is get rid of this law.

Ngofeen: Yeah.

AKSHAYA: Um, the other part of it is that. It is true that the law says that the president can invoke it in context where the country is facing an invasion or a predatory incursion.

AKSHAYA: Uh, but those claims have to be borne out by facts. And it's, I mean, it's really not about you and me deciding, but I would hope that judges are given the opportunity to scrutinize that. Uh, and I think something that's really concerning about the way the Trump administration has been using this law these past couple weeks is they're saying not only can we unilaterally make this declaration, um, we can then say that individuals are part of this gang based on extremely, um, flimsy indicia things like, oh, they have tattoos, or they're wearing Jordan sneakers, or they, um. You know, maybe talked to someone who was a gang member, we think. like very flimsy assertions. Uh, so, and we shouldn't be questioned about these things and judges shouldn't even question us about if there's, uh, an invasion or not. It's our decision, Uhhuh, and that's where I think the whole idea of separation of powers comes into play. Uhhuh. And I feel like that's what we should talk more about. Yeah. This country, the way democracy has been so resilient in this country over many decades and generations is because the executive branch is when it's tempted to overreach checked by either Congress or the judiciary. That's the Supreme Court.

NGOFEEN: Yeah.

AKSHAYA:The scary thing that we're seeing right now, and it's playing out with this case with the Alien Enemies Act, is when judges are attempting to check that executive power. The executive branch is kind of saying, nah. We're gonna do it anyway. and that's why I'm watching this really closely.

// I think one of the most ridiculous things, um, that I've seen when researching this is as a part of this whole debate., The president of El Salvador, who's, uh, big on social media //

HOST: This is President Nayib Bukele.

AKSHAYA:Wrote Oopsie, uh, when commenting about the judge's orders Uhhuh. So it's like they openly know what they were supposed to do.

NGOFEEN: Yeah.

AKSHAYA: And they're rubbing it in the faces of the judges that they're not listening.

[MUSIC]

NGOFEEN (to Noel): You know at the beginning the of the year lot of people do new year resolutions right where you're like thinking of the year ahead if you could go back and talk to yourself on January first and sort of prepare yourself for the year to come. what would you tell yourself?

Noel: Vale, ojalá yo pudiera volver para el para el tener o porque haría todo lo posible para que él no realice ese viaje. Sí, este o por lo menos, no sé. Le daría recomendaciones vue. Voy a repetir esto. Yo admiraba no pude ser lo mismo la última vez que viaj eh? Viaje. Y eso hace poco la ah, bueno, me le dije de mar y con miedo por primera vez, luego de más de 15 años, dejando todos los años por primera vez, sentí miedo de tanto.

Eh, sentí miedo de de ser señalado, deter encarcelado. Definitivamente. Sí. Ah, que ha sido un año muy difícil. Quisiera que esta pesadilla se terminara. Ya lo digo, vivo en todos los medios. Yo literalmente, yo no, no, no, duermo fácil. Duermo muy poco. Me despierto en las madrugadas y le digo a Dios cuando me despierte, que si él me despierta a mi par, no me pueda dormir como usted, porque sé que debe estar una situación difícil que no se la molestó con la actual

JUAN: i wish i gogo back to January first and i will do everything en my power to stop from going to the United states or to give him advice i used to admire the United states but i can say the same right now i I've been going to the United states for the last fifteen years and this year for the first time i felt i felt fear i feel fear of being in prison of being accused it's been a very difficult year so far i ask god every day for this nightmare to end i don't sleep well and every time i wake up in the middle of the night i tell god that if he's waking me Nephew can sleep, i am fine with that because im sure he's having a very difficult situation that es incredibly unfair.

Host: I have to say. This is the point of these policies. To frighten people. That doesn’t make them legal.

NGOFEEN: What would you say to your nephew if you could?

JUAN: Y la última pregunta es qué le dirías a tu sobrino si pudieras hablar con él?

NOEL: Un abrazo enorme. Hay un abrazo enorme. Yo obviado para Venezuela mañana y estoy rogándole a Dios, eh, que él, que él lo deporten mientras que que allá, porque sé que él también me quiere abrazar.

JUAN: Give a big hug en fact am traveling to Venezuela tomorrow and i pray to god that he vice tu Venezuela and weekend meet and sea each again and hug each other again

Noel: Te que que sería maravilloso esa oportunidad de reencuentro, eh?

Fíjate algo, eh? Como una semana antes de de que lo deportan, él me dijo que se quería suar que ella no quería vivir esa situación. Si eso me lo digo estando en estados unidos donde hablábamos todos los días, no me quiero imaginar qué está pasando esa.

Juan: en fact when he was in the United states. He he called me one day suicide the states i imagine how he feeling en el salvador.

Juan: Sentimos mucho, noél.

Ngofeen: So that was the episode we produced last May, and as I said, there've been a lot of changes. Here's just one. On July 18th as part of a prisoner exchange, 252 Venezuelans the US sent to CECOT in El Salvador were released.

Roger was one of them. He's back in Venezuela and he joins me now on Zoom, along with Human Rights Watch’s Juan Pappier, who's gonna translate and also answer a few questions I have for him. Roger, first question is just, uh, a hard one, I guess, but how are you?

Roger/Spanish: In spite of what happened, I’m fine.

Ngofeen: Now you're back in Venezuela. have you, like, have you been able to start your life back together? And in particular we were curious if you've been able to see Daniela, your partner.

Roger/English/Translation: His partner came from Colombia. She was in Colombia. She came back to Venezuela in September, and they were able to meet, to hug, to kiss each other. It was very emotional and here they are trying to restart their lives and, yeah, trying to, to, to start again.

Ngofeen: When you talk to people, what do you say about what it was like inside of CECOT?

Roger/English: From the moment I, we arrived, I said, my God, what is gonna happen to us? Then I realized we were in CECOT because I had seen the prison in some videos. They beat us since the moment we arrived. If you spoke out loud, they hit you. If you didn't go to bed, they hit you. For moments, I thought we were in hell because when they were not hitting me, they were hitting my cell mates, and the worst part was not knowing anything.

We didn't know what was going to happen with us. We didn't know anything about the situation.

Ngofeen: Juan, you and others at Human Rights Watch have been investigating what happened in CECOT, and you'll issue a report soon. Can you tell me some of what you learned so far?

Roger/English: So far we have interviewed 40 people who like Roger were detained in CECOT and more than a hundred of their family members. We are documenting the torture that these people endured.

They were beaten during daily searches. They were beaten when they allegedly disobeyed prison rules. They were beaten as they were transferred to CECOT. They were beaten when the US Secretary of Homeland Security, Kristi Noem, visited. They were constantly and repeatedly beaten and tortured in prison.

These cases of torture occurred both in the hallways of the prison and also in what guards called “the island”, an isolation cell, very small, of only a couple of meters, that was dark, that had very limited natural light and natural air where people were held in complete isolation as punishment for supposedly disobeying prison rules such as speaking with other detainees or showering at the wrong time.

Ngofeen: Thank you, Juan. And actually, I just have one last question for Roger. What do you want people outside of Venezuela, people like me in the states or in other parts of the world? What do you want them to know about your experience?

Roger/English: I've been waiting for people to ask me this question because I really want to send a message to the world. Some people say that we are lying. That it is not true that we were beaten. Some say that this is a show that the Venezuelan government is trying to put out to accuse the US government. That's not true.

But if you don't believe me, if you don't believe my 252 cellmates, then ask President Naib Bukele of El Salvador, ask President Donald Trump, ask the director of the CECOT prison, to release the videos because they were recording us all the time. And in those recordings you could see how we were beaten, how we were forced to kneel, how we were humiliated. And I'm sure they will not release those recordings because if they do, all the lies that Bukele is putting out will end.

Ngofeen: Roger, thank you so much for talking to us. I know briefly, and I know you've talked to so many people, uh, but thank you. I really appreciate it.

Roger: Vale, gracias, que estén bien.

Ngofeen:In a few weeks, Human Rights Watch will release a report about what went on with the Venezuelan immigrants in CECOT. So keep an eye out for that. You've been listening to Rights and Wrongs from Human Rights Watch.

This episode was produced by me and Curtis Fox. Sophie Soloway is the associate producer, Ifé Fatunase and Stacy Sullivan are the executive producers. Thanks also to Anthony Gale.

The controversy has highlighted tensions between U.S. immigration enforcement priorities and international humanitarian obligations, with receiving countries caught between diplomatic pressures and human rights concerns.
ARRA warned that accepting such deportation arrangements creates dangerous precedents allowing powerful nations to outsource migration responsibilities without accountability, potentially undermining regional solidarity on migration governance.
The statement emphasized broader implications beyond migration policy, arguing that national sovereignty should not be compromised through unequal international arrangements that treat vulnerable populations as disposable burdens rather than rights-holders.
The organization’s intervention demonstrates how regional advocacy groups are increasingly challenging international migration arrangements they view as violating sovereignty and human rights through coordinated legal and diplomatic pressure campaigns.","The Asylum and Refugee Rights Advocates (ARRA) has issued a scathing critique of the United States government’s escalating practice of deporting migrants to countries other than their own, warning that such policies undermine international human rights standards and threaten the sovereignty of recipient nations.

In a statement released September 21, ARRA Founder and Executive Director Dr. Okey James Ezugwu highlighted the controversial deportation of 14 non-Ghanaians to Accra earlier this month, describing it as part of a disturbing global trend that violates fundamental refugee protection principles.

The deportation flight included 13 Nigerians and one Gambian, none of whom were originally from Ghana, according to lawyers representing some of the deportees who challenged the removals in federal court.

Dr. Ezugwu, a legal practitioner and retired Assistant Comptroller General of Nigeria Immigration Service, emphasized that Ghana has confirmed the 14 West Africans were subsequently sent to their home countries, where lawyers say some face risks of persecution or torture.

The ARRA statement documented similar third-country deportations to South Sudan, Eswatini, Uganda, Rwanda, Djibouti, Panama, Costa Rica, and El Salvador, demonstrating what the organization describes as a systematic approach to circumventing traditional deportation procedures.

The rights advocacy group challenged the legal foundation of such removals, arguing they violate the principle of non-refoulement enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention, which prohibits returning individuals to places where they risk persecution or harm without proper asylum screening.

Earlier this month, the U.S. deported more than a dozen non-Ghanaian nationals to Ghana, making Ghana the latest country to accept these third-country deportations under arrangements that ARRA characterizes as politically and economically coercive.

The organization expressed particular concern about reports of abusive treatment during transport, inadequate legal safeguards before removal, and the burden placed on receiving states that lack resources to integrate deportees properly.

Dr. Ezugwu has established ARRA as a prominent voice in West African migration advocacy, previously addressing xenophobic attacks against Nigerian immigrants in Ghana and discrimination against Ghanaian descendants in The Gambia.

His background as a retired senior immigration official lends credibility to ARRA’s technical critique of deportation procedures, particularly regarding violations of international refugee law and bilateral agreements.

U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan declined to intervene in the deportations, clearing the way for the 14 West Africans to be sent to their home countries from Ghana, despite legal challenges arguing they faced persecution risks.

The controversy has highlighted tensions between U.S. immigration enforcement priorities and international humanitarian obligations, with receiving countries caught between diplomatic pressures and human rights concerns.

ARRA warned that accepting such deportation arrangements creates dangerous precedents allowing powerful nations to outsource migration responsibilities without accountability, potentially undermining regional solidarity on migration governance.

The organization called on the United Nations, African Union, and regional blocs to develop frameworks ensuring deportee safety and dignity while balancing member states’ security needs through rigorous human rights scrutiny of third-country arrangements.

The statement emphasized broader implications beyond migration policy, arguing that national sovereignty should not be compromised through unequal international arrangements that treat vulnerable populations as disposable burdens rather than rights-holders.

Dr. Ezugwu’s critique reflects growing African concerns about asymmetrical migration partnerships that place disproportionate responsibilities on developing nations while limiting their agency in determining acceptance criteria and integration support.

The ARRA position represents broader civil society pushback against what advocates characterize as expedient solutions that prioritize political convenience over humanitarian principles and sustainable migration management approaches.

Conflicting accounts emerged about whether all deportees had actually been returned to their home countries, with lawyers for four men saying they remained detained in Ghana, highlighting ongoing legal and practical complications.

Going back even further, since World War II the out party has gained an average of more than two dozen House seats.
In Trump’s last midterm election, in 2018, Democrats won 40 House seats — including seven in California — to seize control.
There are 435 House seats on the ballot next year.
Over the past three decades, every time the president’s net job approval was negative a year from the midterm election, his party lost House seats.","A handful of seats are all that keep Republicans in control of the House, giving President Trump untrammeled sway over, well, pretty much everything, from the economy to the jokes on late-night TV to the design of the Cracker Barrel logo.

It’s a number that’s both tantalizing and fraught, depending on your political perspective.

For Democrats, that eyelash-thin margin means they’re thisclose to regaining power and a political toehold in next year’s midterm election. All they need is a gain of three House seats. For Trump and fellow Republicans, it means their hegemony over Washington and life as we know it dangles by a perilously thin thread.

That tension explains the redistricting wars now blazing throughout our great land.

It started in Texas, where Trump pressured Republicans to redraw congressional lines in hopes of handing the GOP as many as five additional seats. That led California Democrats to ask voters, in a Nov. 4 special election, to approve an eye-for-an-eye gerrymander that could yield their party five new lawmakers.

Several other states have waded into the fight, assuming control of the House might be decided next year by just a few seats, one way or the other.

Which could happen.

Or not.

Anyone claiming to know for sure is either lying, trying to frighten you into giving money, or both.

“History is on Democrats’ side, but it’s too early to know what the national political environment is going to be like,” said Nathan Gonzales, one of the country’s top political handicappers and publisher of the nonpartisan campaign guide Inside Elections. “We don’t know the overall mood of the electorate, how satisfied voters [will be] with Republicans in power in Washington or how open to change they’ll be a year from now.”

A look back offers some clues, though it should be said no two election cycles are alike and the past is only illuminating insofar as it casts light on certain patterns.

(Take that as a caveat, weasel words or whatever you care to call it.)

In the last half century, there have been 13 midterm elections. The out party — that is, the one that doesn’t hold the presidency — has won 13 or more House seats in eight of those elections. Going back even further, since World War II the out party has gained an average of more than two dozen House seats.

In Trump’s last midterm election, in 2018, Democrats won 40 House seats — including seven in California — to seize control. (That was 17 more than they needed.) A Democratic gain of that magnitude seems unlikely next year, barring a complete and utter GOP collapse. That’s because there are fewer Republicans sitting in districts that Democrats carried in the most recent presidential election, which left them highly vulnerable.

In 2018, 25 Republicans represented districts won by Hillary Clinton. In 2026, there are just three Republicans in districts Kamala Harris carried. (Thirteen Democrats represent districts that Trump won.)

Let’s pause before diving into more numbers.

OK. Ready?

There are 435 House seats on the ballot next year. Most are a lock for one party or the other.

Based on the current congressional map, Inside Elections rates 64 House seats nationwide as being at least somewhat competitive, with a dozen considered toss-ups. The Cook Political Report, another gold-plated handicapper, rates 72 seats competitive or having the potential to be so, with 18 toss-ups.

Both agree that two of those coin-flip races are in California, where Democrats Adam Gray and Derek Tran are fighting to hang onto seats they narrowly won in, respectively, the Central Valley and Orange County. (The Democratic gerrymander seeks to shore up those incumbents.)

You really can’t assess the 2026 odds without knowing how the redistricting fight comes out.

Republicans could pick up as many as 16 seats through partisan map-making, Inside Elections forecasts, a number that would be reduced if California voters approve Proposition 50. Erin Covey, who analyzes House races for the Cook Report, puts GOP gains as high as 13, again depending on the November outcome in California.

Obviously, that would boost the GOP’s chances of hanging onto the House, which is precisely why Trump pushed for the extraordinary mid-decade redistricting.

But there are many other factors at play.

One huge element is Trump’s approval rating. Simply put, the less popular a president, the more his party tends to suffer at the polls.

Right now Trump’s approval rating is a dismal 43%, according to the Cook Report’s PollTracker. That could change, but it’s a danger sign for Republicans. Over the past three decades, every time the president’s net job approval was negative a year from the midterm election, his party lost House seats.

Another thing Democats have going for them is the passion of their voters, who’ve been flocking to the polls in off-year and special elections. The Downballot, which tracks races nationwide, finds Democratic candidates have far surpassed Kamala Harris’ 2024 performance, a potential harbinger of strong turnout in 2026.

Those advantages are somewhat offset by a GOP edge in two other measures. Republicans have significantly outraised Democrats and have limited the number of House members retiring. Generally speaking, it’s tougher for a party to defend a seat when it comes open.

In short, for all the partisan passions, the redistricting wars aren’t likely to decide control of the House.

“Opinions of the economy and Trump’s handling of it, the popularity (or lack thereof) of Republicans’ signature legislation” — the tax-cutting, Medicaid-slashing bill passed in July — as well as “partisan enthusiasm to vote are going to be more determinative to the 2026 outcome than redistricting alone,” Amy Walter, the Cook Report’s editor-in-chief, wrote in a recent analysis.

In other words, control of the House will most likely rest in the hands of voters, not scheming politicians.

Which is exactly where it belongs.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2368f71/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5556x2917+0+394/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F18%2F5a%2Ff32cbbd1ff4966518f40501b7f45%2Fc45e6789905b42f886cebfdcd0d9794e,N,,2025-09-22 02:57:31.922886

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson told the Sun-Times on Sunday that she hadn’t been informed of any relocation plans for the ICE facility.
McLaughlin also confirmed 16 protesters in total had been arrested at the Broadview facility this month.","Among masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and fired-up protesters, Abraham Aguirre stood outside the ICE building in Broadview on Sunday with a red suitcase and dark duffel bag.

He believed his cousin was inside.

Aguirre knocked on the boarded-up windows and handed off the provisions: clothes, personal items, toiletries.

“Not scared, not nervous, but I feel a deep sense of injustice,” Aguirre said in Spanish through a translator.

Aguirre came to the ICE facility as protests against the Trump administration’s “Operation Midway Blitz” and ramped-up immigration arrests stretch into their second week. Speculation brewed among protesters as HuffPost reported that ICE would be vacating the Broadview facility due to protests and some questioned whether the detainees believed to be on the buses were being transported elsewhere. HuffPost’s story was updated Sunday night to say DHS decided to keep the facility open and operational despite an initial plan to temporarily close it.

Aguirre’s cousin was detained with two of his coworkers, and Aguirre believed they were all set to be deported — two to Mexico and one to Venezuela.

Not long after Aguirre arrived, two buses left the gated parking lot of the ICE facility. Aguirre and other protesters believed they were carrying detainees.

As the buses drove by, the insults, shouts and chants that the small crowd had hurled for much of the day subsided. Aguirre gave a thumbs up and peace signs toward the tinted bus windows, hoping his cousin and friends could see him saying goodbye from outside.

Aguirre’s cousin is married and has two children ages 7 and 2, he said. He had spent more than $15,000 to move to the U.S., Aguirre said.

After waving toward the bus, Aguirre shook hands with some of the protesters outside the facility before leaving.

“Lo siento mucho,” one woman called after him — Spanish for “I’m so sorry.”

The woman, who declined to give her name but said she came to observe ICE operations and help people looking for their family members who had been detained, shed quiet tears after she watched Aguirre waving at the bus.

“He said he had a family,” she said. “There needs to be immigration reform. But is this really it?”

The woman, whose parents immigrated from Mexico before she was born, said she witnessed an ICE arrest last week in Belmont Cragin.

Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson told the Sun-Times on Sunday that she hadn’t been informed of any relocation plans for the ICE facility.

In a statement to the Sun-Times on Sunday afternoon, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Broadview facility wouldn’t be closing, but she didn’t immediately respond to questions about whether operations there would be changing in response to the protests.

McLaughlin also confirmed 16 protesters in total had been arrested at the Broadview facility this month. A state official told the Sun-Times that Broadview police and Cook County sheriff’s haven’t asked the Illinois State Police for help despite DHS claims to the contrary. Matt Hill, a spokesperson for Gov. JB Pritzker denied the state has received multiple calls for assistance and said the Trump administration shouldn’t be trusted “given their record of lies, lack of transparency, and failure to coordinate with the state and local law enforcement.”

One protester was arrested outside the facility Sunday.

Immigration enforcement officials have arrested almost 550 people in the Chicago operation that launched about two weeks ago, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday.

Jessica Bustos, a 36-year-old South Side resident who works with undocumented families, arrived early with her parents and daughter in tow. They came together because “Sundays are slower,” referring to lower tensions at the center.

They played Mexican music, leading nearly a dozen protesters at the scene about 11 a.m. to break into dance on the sidewalk crossing the facility’s driveway. Bustos’ parents gained citizenship over the course of 13 years, at a cost of nearly $25,000. They spent 13 of their 37 years of marriage apart because of the slow-moving immigration process.

“I’m trying to teach my daughter we need to protect our communities and to be proud of who we are,” Bustos told the Sun-Times. “I feel their pain. … It’s really sad we have to protect ourselves from this.”

But the celebration was halted abruptly as ICE agents streamed out of the gate to fire pepper balls at protesters attempting to block a car from leaving. An agent pushed demonstrator Levi Rolls to the ground after they shot him with non-lethal rounds.

Minutes later, Rolls was arrested while attempting to again block a vehicle.

Rolls said he was given a fine of $580 and a citation for disturbance and disorderly conduct on federal property.

Several vehicles, including a bus and a U-Haul van, were seen coming and going from the facility throughout the day Sunday. Agents, many in masks, hats and sunglasses, also came and went, to shouts of “traitors!” from the crowd. At least one agent was seen on the roof of the building firing pepper balls at protesters periodically.

No one was arrested by Broadview police.

A protester who was detained Saturday night was released after being held for five hours and came back to the detention center on Sunday afternoon to continue demonstrating. They were accused of “assault on officers” and were interrogated about two vehicles that had slashed tires days ago.

“The way they’re treating people, it’s showing people that when you’re in a uniform, you can do whatever you want,” they told the Sun-Times. “The more we let people run over us, the more it’s going to get worse,” they said.",https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5956891/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1953x1115+0+94/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F21%2F4b%2F0dfcccd7407993b45102ac8eb9a2%2Fbroadviewice-092125-8.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 02:57:48.106713

As of Thursday, immigration enforcement officials have arrested nearly 550 people.","PARK RIDGE, Ill. (AP) — It was 3:30 a.m. when 10 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers gathered in a parking lot in the Chicago suburbs for a briefing about a suspect they were hoping to arrest. They went over a description of the person, made sure their radios were on the same channel and discussed where the closest hospital was in case something went wrong.

“Let’s plan on not being there,” said one of the officers, before they climbed into their vehicles and headed out.

Across the city and surrounding suburbs, other teams were fanning out in support of “Operation Midway Blitz.” It has unleashed President Donald Trump’s mass deportations agenda on a city and state that has had some of the strongest laws preventing local officials from cooperating with immigration enforcement.

ICE launched the operation on Sept. 8, drawing concern from activists and immigrant communities fearful of the large-scale arrests or aggressive tactics used in other cities targeted by the Republican president. They say there has been a noticeable uptick in immigration enforcement agents, although a military deployment to Chicago has yet to materialize.

The Associated Press went on a ride-along with ICE in a Chicago suburb — much of the recent focus — to see how that operation is unfolding.

A predawn wait, then two arrests

A voice came over the radio: “He got into the car. I’m not sure if that’s the target.”

Someone matching the description of the man that ICE was searching for walked out of the house, got into a car and drove away from the tree-lined street. Unsure whether this was their target, the officers followed. A few minutes later, with the car approaching the freeway, the voice over the radio said: “He’s got the physical description. We just can’t see the face good.”

“Do it,” said Marcos Charles, the acting head of ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations.

Agents in multiple vehicles soon overtook the car and boxed it in. After talking to the man, they realized he was not the person being sought for but that he was in the United States illegally, so they took him into custody.

Eventually, a little after dawn broke on the one- and two-story brick houses, the man they were looking for came out of the house and got into a car. ICE officers closed in. The man got out of the car and was arrested. ICE said both men were in the country illegally and had criminal records.

Charles called it a “successful operation.”

“There was no safety issues on the part of our officers, nor the individuals that we arrested. And it went smoothly,” he said.

‘ICE does not belong here’

Activists and critics of ICE say that’s increasingly not the norm in immigration operations.

They point to videos showing ICE agents smashing windows to apprehend suspects, a chaotic showdown outside a popular Italian restaurant in San Diego, and arrests like that of a Tufts University student in March by masked agents outside her apartment in Somerville, Massachusetts, as neighbors watched.

Charles said ICE is using an “appropriate” amount of force and that agents are responding to suspects who increasingly are not following commands.

There has been “an uptick in people that are not compliant,” he said, blaming inflammatory rhetoric from activists who, he said, are encouraging people to resist.

Alderman Andre Vasquez, who chairs the Chicago City Council’s committee on immigrant and refugee rights, strenuously objected to that description, faulting ICE for any escalation.

“We’re not here to cause chaos. The president is,” Vasquez said. He accused immigration enforcement agents of trying to provoke activists into overreacting in order to justify calling in a greater use of force such as National Guard troops. “ICE does not belong here.”

Shooting death of immigrant by ICE officer heightens tensions

Chicago was already on edge when a shooting Sept. 12 heightened tensions even more.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said an ICE officer fatally shot Silverio Villegas González, a Mexican immigrant who tried to evade arrest in a Chicago suburb by driving his car at officers and dragging one of them. The department said the officer felt his life was threatened and had opened fire, killing the man.

Charles said he could not comment because there is an open investigation. But he said he met with the officer in the hospital, saw his injuries and felt that the force used was appropriate.

The officer was not wearing a body camera, Charles said.

Gov. JB Pritzker, D-Ill., has demanded “a full, factual accounting” of the shooting. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum condemned the death and said Mexico is demanding a thorough investigation.

“These tactics have led to the loss of life of one of our community members,” said Democratic state Rep. Norma Hernandez.

In another use of force incident under “Midway Blitz” that has drawn criticism, a U.S. citizen was detained by immigration agents alongside his father and hit by a stun gun three times Tuesday in suburban Des Plaines, the man’s lawyer said.

Local advocates have also condemned ICE agents for wearing masks, failing to identify themselves, and not using body cameras — actions that starkly contrast with Chicago Police Department policy.

‘It was time to hit Chicago’

Charles said there is no timeline for the ICE-led operation in the Chicago area to end. As of Thursday, immigration enforcement officials have arrested nearly 550 people. Charles said 50% to 60% of those are targeted arrests, meaning they are people whom immigration enforcers are specifically trying to find.

He pushed back on criticism that ICE randomly targets people, saying agents weren’t “going out to Home Depot parking lots” to make indiscriminate arrests.

Charles said ICE has brought in more than 200 officers from around the country for the operation.

He said that for too long, cities such as Chicago that limited cooperation with ICE had allowed immigrants, especially those with criminal records, to remain in the country illegally. It was time to act, he said.

“It was time to hit Chicago.”

Some in attendance on Wilmslow Road were reportedly recognised as far-right social media influencers.
And in other instances, British-born, non-white members of the counter protest were incorrectly described as “legal immigrants”.
There is a vacuous absence of moral leadership on immigration and the pro-migrant ‘silent majority’ is not represented.
But on Wilmslow Road, the majority was anything but silent.","Throughout August and September 2025, anti-immigration protesters gathered outside Best Western hotel on Wilmslow Road every Sunday, draped in British flags and ready for hours of antagonisation between their group and the equally persistent counter demonstration. These protests form part of a national movement, claiming to “protect our girls”, after Hadush Kebatu, an asylum seeker housed at the Bell Hotel in Epping, was charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old in July.

Many asylum protests have been organised online by far-right agitators affiliated with Homeland party, a splinter group of the neo-Nazi organisation Patriotic Alternative. Helped by the rise of social media movement Operation Raise the Colours, fascist agitators are discretely acting online to cultivate a new, broader-based following. But does everyone at asylum protests subscribe to their fascist ideologies? And is the anti-immigrant sentiment really as popular as Nigel Farage and Tommy Robinson (Stephen Yaxley-Lennon) would like you to believe?

The Fallowfield protest, attended by The Mancunion, took place five days after Farage’s press conference on August 25, at which he revealed ill-costed plans for mass deportation and pledged to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (EHRC), claiming that “as far as the people of this country are concerned, frankly these measures can’t come soon enough”. Farage describes channel crossings as an “invasion” of the country by “fighting-age men” which could lead to “major civil disorder”. He claims to represent the will of the British people.

However, research suggests this is not the case; anti-fascist organisation ‘HOPE not hate’ argue that a ‘silent majority’ opposes Farage and his policies, and the media “exaggerates the popularity of extreme and fringe far-right views while simultaneously normalising them”. According to YouGov, it is factually incorrect that a majority of Britons support leaving the EHRC, with just 27% saying Britain should withdraw. And Ipsos revealed that 71% agreed that Britain should take refugees fleeing war and persecution.

But a percentage is wholly inadequate in describing the countless, complex and ever-changing factors representing public opinion. In a modern political landscape shaped by online political actors, divisive lies and identity politics, what can an asylum protest on Wilmslow Road tell us about how the views of real people are represented?

Outside the Best Western, the anti-immigration protesters were outnumbered convincingly, with counter demonstrators taking to Wilmslow Road in their hundreds. The counter demonstration was advertised online by various grassroots organisations such as Young Struggle, Manchester Feminist Coalition, and South Asian Liberation Movement. A further group, from Stand Up to Racism, arrived at 15:30 to cheers from an already large majority. Chants of “there are many, many more of us than you” could be heard until the anti-immigration protest dispersed.

The prevailing message from counter demonstrators was clear; chants of “refugees are welcome here” and “fascist scum, off our streets” were loudest, and the message seemed to get through. Residents of the hotel were seen waving to counter demonstrators on the street from their windows and multiple counter demonstrators reported that an asylum seeker had come outside to thank them.

Despite the success of the counter protest, one organiser for Stand Up to Racism, who was at the protest in Oldham the day before, where the counter demonstration was outnumbered, expressed concerns about the aging demographic of the organisation and advocated for young people to find efficient ways to organise and take to the streets in greater numbers. This echoes the concerns that there is a ‘silent majority’ of pro-refugee Britons who are not represented, as loud minorities showing up outside hotels are given disproportionate media coverage.

Regardless, the counter demonstration benefitted from large numbers of both local young people and the area’s student demographic. The presence of the latter prompted the anti-migrant protesters to frame their opposition as outsiders, meeting chants of “this is what Manchester looks like” with “you aren’t even from here”. Feelings of identity and belonging have been core to the success of nationalist movements such as Operation Raise the Colours and the asylum protests, which imagine their opposition as a “liberal elite”.

However, the anti-immigration group seemed divided itself and at times their messages were contradictory. Protesters, including children who had been brought to the rally and given megaphones met chants of “refugees are welcome here” with “refugees aren’t welcome here”. Yet, when asked whether the UK should be proud of providing asylum for refugees, one woman agreed that it should, stating that she only dislikes “the illegal ones”.

Another woman, draped in the Union Jack, was interviewed by information group NOVO, who were present at the protest. When challenged on her immigration concerns, she stated that she has “no issue if [refugees] are coming from war torn countries”, or with immigration in general but thought the government was “doing it in the … wrong way”. She also expressed support for safe and legal asylum routes in the interview, which has since been posted to the group’s Instagram account (@novo_org).

NOVO’s presenter told us that he believes the far-right in the UK has entered a “post-organisational” era, where political agitation is done via social media using non-entity movements, such as Operation Raise the Colours, to attract a larger demographic, which includes people who are not necessarily committed to hard-right ideals or affiliated with any particular fascist organisations.

That is not to say that social media does not also attract significant hard-line fascist factions. A protester on Wilmslow Road flew the flag of the ‘Knights Templar’, a Catholic military order from the 12th century, which has been adopted by far-right groups online. Notably, Anders Breivik, neo-Nazi terrorist and mass-murderer responsible for the 2011 Norway attack, claimed membership to the Templar and cited it in his manifesto. Breivik’s online activity is thought to have played a key role in his violent radicalisation.

Some in attendance on Wilmslow Road were reportedly recognised as far-right social media influencers. Many used phones and handheld pocket cameras to film opposing protesters and record taunts, with one man bringing the camera close to pro-refugee protesters and telling supposed viewers to “look at the faces” of what he called “traitors to this country” and “leftist scum”. There are global concerns about the cultivation of particularly violent and aggressive strains of extremism online. In fact, US congress has recently called on the CEOs of Twitch, Discord and Reddit to testify on radicalisation.

Domestically, concerns have been raised about the consequences of online mis-information since last summer’s Southport stabbing. Mobs attacked mosques and asylum centres after false claims that Axel Rudakubana (the Southport stabber) was a Muslim immigrant, gained 6.7 million views.

The effect does not seem to have worn off. On Wilmslow Road, a woman wrapped in an England flag brandished a picture of Radukubana, who is British and comes from a Christian family, along with a selection of printed mugshots, exclusively featuring people of colour. Protesters adamantly claimed to not be racist, yet the racialised selection of mugshots, was not questioned. And in other instances, British-born, non-white members of the counter protest were incorrectly described as “legal immigrants”.

It was hard to discern a coherent message. There was clear evidence of outright racism and fascism, some seemed less motivated by hate and more by misguided concerns about immigration and asylum. There were protesters who engaged willingly in conversation, while others resorted to personal insults and angry monologues, with one prominent member repeatedly shouting and signalling at counter demonstrators that they were being mind-controlled by the covid-19 vaccination. Even within the small group that turned up to protest outside the Best Western, an array of conflicting ideas was on display, with no coherent or unanimous condemnation of asylum.

Neither Farage nor Yaxley-Lennon acknowledge the dissonance amongst their followers. Without their newer and less fascist supporters, they very much remain fringe political figures. They attempt to unify their followers under a racialised view of Britishness, but the illusion that their dogmatic politics represents the British people (or even their own followers) is a reductive one. One which a message of unity could well shatter. In this spirit, counter demonstrators held up signs outside the Best Western bearing words to the effect of “the enemy travels by private yacht, not by dinghy”, a sentiment abandoned by the current leadership of the Labour party in preference to Trump-like deportation videos. There is a vacuous absence of moral leadership on immigration and the pro-migrant ‘silent majority’ is not represented.

But on Wilmslow Road, the majority was anything but silent. Two messages were loud and clear. To the Farages and Yaxley-Lennons of the world: “there are many, many more of us than you”. And to asylum seekers: unlike fascism, you are welcome in Fallowfield.",https://mancunion.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/BW1.jpg,N,,2025-09-22 02:57:44.548087

Usually, politicians will bloviate during campaigns about all the wonderful, transformative things they’ll do if voted into office. Most fall far short of their promises; others use smoke-and-mirrors or sleight-of-hand to distract the public from their shortcomings.

But in Donald Trump’s case, in the early days of his second term, he has used a raft of executive orders, staffing shifts, and slashed budgets to disassemble parts of the federal government, including entire agencies. He has concentrated on significantly reducing the federal workforce and deleting regulatory agencies.

He has been making good on his vow to deport 1 million undocumented immigrants from the United States. Even before he assumed office, Trump and a coterie of far-right billionaires, bigots, kooks, and shadowy entities began building the framework to make this nightmare real.

Gov. Ron DeSantis built one concentration camp deep in the Florida Everglades and just opened another at the closed Baker Correctional Institution. It now holds 117 people but has the capacity to hold 1,500, according to DeSantis administration officials. The site is about 45 miles west of Jacksonville near the Osceola National Forest.

CNN says DeSantis is “doubling down” on his plans to build a third detention site in Florida’s Panhandle, which he has dubbed “Panhandle Pokey,” along with another facility at a Florida National Guard training center known as Camp Blanding, about 30 miles southwest of Jacksonville.

Other states are jumping on the bandwagon with other proposed immigration facilities, including Indiana’s “Speedway Slammer” and Louisiana’s “Camp 57,” located at Angola Prison farm, an 18,000-acre plantation sitting an hour north of Baton Rouge.

Trump and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller have successfully linked immigration with crime and we are watching dragnets in Florida cities and across the country with untold numbers of undocumented and legal immigrants being swept up.

But Trump couldn’t do this alone. Much like Mao Tse Tung, Pol Pot, Benjamin Netanyahu, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, or Leopold II of Belgium, a whole bunch of people need to sign onto your vision and they must be willing to build the legal, ideological, and logistical infrastructure needed to pull this off.

That’s where Ron DeSantis comes in. On this issue, DeSantis is an eager underling, working since June in concert with the Trump administration. He, Attorney General James Uthmeier, and others have embarked on an unprincipled, sadistic crusade of indiscriminately disappearing, imprisoning, and deporting Latino, Black, and Brown immigrants.

The Trump and DeSantis administrations lacked legal authority to do what they’ve been doing, but they have bent laws and ignored precedent and norms to trample on immigrants’ rights.

Domination

It becomes clearer by the day that the imposition of white domination, power, and control of the state and the country animates everything DeSantis and Trump are doing.

DeSantis has fervently signed on to the MAGA Republican white nationalist project of dragging the United States back to a time when European Americans ruled the roost using brute force; murder; laws, customs and norms; and terrorism and fear to intimidate and control African Americans.

Florida has served as the petri dish for DeSantis and his enablers to roll out the far-right agenda and gauge the public response or acceptance of these policies. Whether it’s banning books, laws seeking to curb or erase gay and trans individuals, anti-Black and anti-DEI bias, whitewashing facts, rewriting history, and attacking African Americans and other marginalized groups.

We are witnessing American apartheid, with the use of a range of mechanisms to more fully marginalize those who DeSantis and Trump deem “the other.” As the ACLU reminds us, DeSantis has joined Trump in amplifying already strained racial tensions in the United States. Both have been brazen in their overt quest to weaponize anger, resentment, and racial grievance.

Political content producer Danielle Moodie notes that Trump, Brett Kavanaugh, and a white nationalist Supreme Court are dismantling democracy, civil rights, and America’s economy.

“Isn’t it remarkable how the Supreme Court can rule in one breath that race cannot be considered in college admissions — stripping away affirmative action — and in the next, empower ICE to racially profile, detain, and harass Latinos simply for speaking Spanish in Los Angeles?” Moodie asks. “This hypocrisy reveals a troubling truth: The Court claims to be color-blind when protecting opportunity, yet suddenly sees race when it comes to criminalization, detention, and fear.”

Moodie added: “This contradiction is not just a legal nuance. It is a reflection of how deeply embedded white supremacy remains within our institutions. And under Donald Trump’s leadership, aided by his handpicked justices, the Supreme Court has become less an arbiter of justice and more an enabler of authoritarianism.”

The immediate result: Immigrants — documented and undocumented — are being disappeared by ICE agents without reasonable suspicion. The far-right faction is allowing federal and state law enforcement agents to confront and detain anyone who looks Latino, speaks little or no English, and gathers in certain places where Latinos congregate.

This blessing granted by the high court of racial profiling allows gangs of ICE, Border Patrol, Homeland Security, ATF, and others to hunt down immigrants, the vast majority of whom have committed no crime.

Moodie notes that the Supreme Court, its credibility at an all-time low, stripped away affirmative action in higher education; handed presidential immunity to Donald Trump while he faced multiple indictments; and enabled a wave of anti-immigrant policies that echo the darkest chapters of American history.

“Chief Justice John Roberts will likely be remembered not as a guardian of the Constitution, but as the leader who rolled back a century of progress on civil rights,” she said.

Theatrics

Critics including James Greenberg, emeritus professor of anthropology at The University of Arizona, have been warning about the authoritarian path that DeSantis and MAGA Republicans elsewhere are laying out. They mean to stoke fear and compel compliance.

“These theatrics work like rituals. Military vehicles rumble through desert towns, children in cages, recruitment ads with warriors silhouetted against flags — all ceremonies of fear,” Greenberg said. “They draw sharp lines of belonging and exclusion, marking who belongs and who is cast out. Raids at dawn, walls built for cameras, soldiers posing for photo ops are repeated gestures that turn cruelty into liturgy, weaving it into civic life until it looks ordinary.”

“Power has left marks on the land and surveillance has become a terrain of expansion,” Greenberg added.

“Tools once built to track foreign terrorists now target immigrants, activists, journalists, even civil servants. Private tech firms fused with federal agencies, creating databases that sweep up social media posts, license plate scans, phone metadata, and travel patterns,” he said. “These systems persist without oversight. Algorithms flag ‘suspicious behavior’ that often means nothing more than speaking out, worshiping differently, or crossing paths with the wrong people.”

Those who resist are surveilled by drones, have their phones and laptops searched at airports and border crossings.

“The effect is not only to collect data but to intimidate, to show people they are always visible. Surveillance has become a system of control, a constant warning that belonging can be questioned at any time,” said Greenberg.

“Detention has followed the same logic. Private prison companies, once in retreat, under Trump found new life. Contracts multiplied, decommissioned facilities reopened, tent cities sprouted in remote deserts. These sites were deliberately hard to reach, far from lawyers and reporters. Images of overcrowded cells and children behind fences remain etched in memory as proof of how cruelty is normalized.”

In total, detention “has always been as much spectacle as policy, a ritual of exclusion designed to instill fear before it processes anyone,” he continued.

“Inside, migrants are fingerprinted, DNA-tested, and placed in systems that reduce human beings to biometric codes. What looks like confinement is both political theater and an extraction of data and profits,” Greenberg said.

“Family separation reveals the cruelty in its starkest form. Parents deported without their children. By severing the most basic bonds of belonging, the state redefined what it means to be part of the nation. Citizenship papers could not shield children from being rendered effectively stateless if their parents were removed. Belonging is treated as a privilege that can be revoked at will.”

The deeper truth, Greenberg warns, is that repression relies on infrastructure.

“Prisons, surveillance grids, militarized zones — once built, rarely vanish. They remain in place for whoever comes next,” he said. “Like irrigation canals dug centuries ago, they channel flows of power long after their builders are gone. Trump accelerated this process, turning the latent into the active, the possible into the real.”

Depending on who you ask, there are those who believe that it’s already too late to reverse what DeSantis, Trump, the orchestrators of Project 2025, and MAGA Republicans are doing, while others believe America still has time.

Despite the complaints of its critics, the humanitarian protection system created through the Refugee Convention is a remarkable accomplishment. In the seven decades since its ratification, the Convention has saved millions of lives, enshrined in national legal systems and state practice the core principle that people seeking protection cannot be returned to harm (nonrefoulement), and advanced the cause of democratic freedom—providing safety from persecution to refugees escaping Communist Eastern Europe, Christians fleeing theocracy in Iran, and Sudanese pushed out by civil war and ethnic persecution.

But this legal instrument on the cusp of its 75th year is also creaking under the weight of today’s realities. Mass displacement driven by economic collapse, conflict, gang violence, and climate change has taxed humanitarian systems, a situation worsened by the recent cratering of international aid. Meanwhile, asylum systems have become an outlet for the mobility pressures created by demographic change and economic inequality—making it hard to distinguish the deserving from the chancers. And potential asylum seekers often journey through multiple countries on their way to a final destination, raising concerns about the right venue to seek asylum. As a result, national governments have struggled to reconcile their protection responsibilities under the Convention with their domestic responsibilities to maintain security and order, particularly at borders.

It has long been taboo to suggest that the Convention should be reformed, for fear of what would be lost. But calls from states, particularly donor and destination-country ones, to address gaps left by the original text have become more difficult to ignore, particularly as some governments have chosen to openly flout Convention obligations in lieu of advancing reforms. Ignoring questions about the future of the Convention now seems naive at best, harmful at worst. While reform will not be straightforward—international law moves slowly at the best of times—there is a mounting case for debating whether to clarify some elements of the Convention and fill its gaps through the adoption of a new Protocol.

At a fundamental level, the core principles of the Convention—which even some nonsignatory states have come to respect—remain not just relevant to today’s present world but are an indispensable tool for responding to conflict, instability, and gross violations of human dignity and rights. The recognition that individuals and communities could come under threat in their home states due to their political beliefs, race and ethnicity, religion, nationality, or group membership—and that their neighbors have a duty, to the extent consistent with national sovereignty, to provide a place of refuge—cannot be replaced. This remains so even if the framework through which these principles are interpreted and implemented requires updating.

Reforming the international protection system should thus be done with a scalpel, not a chain saw. The best vehicle to accomplish a targeted effort to fix what is not working and reinvigorate the core principles for 21st century challenges is likely to be a second Protocol to the original 1951 Convention. A Protocol could allow for targeted reforms and sidestep the need for (likely lengthy and complex) debate on the core Convention text. Rather, a Protocol would focus on addressing the specific gaps in the system that have clearly emerged over the last nearly 75 years:

Establishing a set of rules around onward movement from first safe countries of asylum.

Agreeing to a mechanism for quickly meeting needs and sharing responsibility in situations of mass displacement.

Improving financial burden-sharing to compensate major hosting states and enable refugee self-sufficiency.

Making these changes is the right thing to do to reduce harm and increase the ability of those genuinely in need to access safety. They also make sense for reducing disorderly onward movements and shrinking the space in which organized crime operates, which has become a major security issue across much of the world, and will boost destination countries’ diplomatic clout.

Why Reform Is on the Agenda

The Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol left several notable gaps. First, the Convention is silent on access to territory or the right to seek asylum. This means the only way for an asylum seeker to trigger protection is to physically reach a state’s territory or jurisdiction. With few legal routes available, many must turn to smugglers, who profit from their desperation. The Convention is also largely silent on how countries should determine whether an individual is a refugee or what should happen when individuals who are not in need of protection seek asylum.

Finally, and perhaps most critically, while the Convention recognizes that displacement is inherently a transnational issue and that international cooperation to address it is needed, it stops short of stipulating how this should be done or providing a mechanism for doing so. Without a mechanism for responsibility-sharing, most of the world’s displaced people have sought refuge in a small number of low- and middle-income countries, which thus shoulder a disproportionate share of responsibility. Some of these states have struggled (or declined) to provide basic rights for refugees, including legal status and the ability to work or receive an education. While the Global Compact on Refugees sought to address some of these issues, it was nonbinding and has not fully lived up to its own ambitions.

The omission of responsibility-sharing from the Convention also has consequences for high-income destination countries. Some displaced individuals will choose to move on from their first country of arrival, whether because basic food and shelter are lacking (as for Sudanese in Chad), because they lack the right to work legally (as in Iran), or because they wish to reunify with family or pursue better opportunities elsewhere (as for skilled Syrians in Turkey). For states outside the immediate neighborhood of a displacement crisis, this raises thorny legal and political questions about the circumstances under which refugees may leave a first country of safety and seek protection in a second or third country.

There is widespread agreement across the political spectrum in many places that the system could, and should, work better. A well-functioning protection system should prevent dangerous journeys and reduce the space for smugglers to operate, including by offering safe and orderly routes. It should avoid misuse of asylum systems by economic migrants, who instead should join the queue for labor visas or be better connected with livelihoods in their regions of origin. It should reduce irregular onward movement, where people (both with genuine protection claims and without) choose a particular destination instead of staying put in the first safe place they come to. And it should ensure that more of the world’s refugees can access not just safety but also the means to support themselves and their families, so they do not feel driven to move on.

The Case for Legal Changes

Many of these changes could come without revisions to international law. Destination states can already offer more safe pathways or pre-entry asylum processing, which replace chaotic spontaneous arrivals with predictability and control. Hosting states can give refugees more rights. And donor countries can provide more funding. There is space in the existing legal architecture for governments to negotiate regional or bilateral safe third-country agreements that require refugees to seek protection in the first safe state. And nothing is stopping states, technically, from streamlining their domestic asylum procedures and bolstering return systems.

Still, there are three key reasons to consider updating the legal framework:

First, in areas where the Convention is silent or ambiguous, such as the safe third-country concept, clear rules could regulate how states implement changes, ensure those reforms are sound and beneficial, and help shield against legal challenge. Some governments have expressed concern about the vulnerability of asylum policies to litigation, leading some to call for ignoring the courts or existing norms altogether—a clear threat to the rule of law. Legal frameworks that cannot bend will break, and it may ultimately be better to find ways to amend the framework while preserving its core, rather than seeing states walk away from the Convention entirely.

Second, while states could do many changes on their own, they lack the incentives, and the Convention does not include any enforcement mechanisms. While there is quite obviously limited political space at present for new treaty enforcement mechanisms, there may be ways to create trade-offs and incentives that make it in states’ best interests to follow the letter and spirit of the law—whether around obligations to take back their own nationals, providing legal status and work rights to refugees, or stepping up financial responsibility-sharing.

Finally, it is worth acknowledging that many of the challenges to the Convention are political. Publics, particularly in the high-income world, have become skeptical of the added value of international law to address the needs and threats they see around them. Reforming the legal basis for the humanitarian protection system could be a moment to signal that these concerns have been heard, and that governments are working to prioritize fairness and integrity and restore public trust.

The Elements of a Better System

Rather than a whole-scale reform of the Convention itself, the most prudent—and rapid—course would be to introduce a targeted set of changes through an additional Protocol, similar to the procedure used in 1967. This would allow states to focus on a narrow set of issues, rather than renegotiating the entire basis of the system, which would almost certainly be a complex, time-consuming, and risky endeavor. The challenges faced by states—and crucially, refugees themselves—also require a quicker response, and a Protocol process would be likely to move faster than a complete renegotiation.

Ultimately, delicate interstate negotiations would determine the ultimate scope of a Protocol, and states will have their own interests regarding what to bring forward. But three areas are likely ripe for inclusion (among many potential others):

Limiting asylum to situations of immediate harm. Asylum is essential, but it needs to be used in a more limited way, as an escape valve for people at immediate risk of harm and refoulement, who cannot reasonably find safety in their own country, rather than as a tool for selecting a new home. A Protocol could set out the principles and minimum standards under which safe third-country agreements could be established and returns carried out, or make clear that refugees should seek asylum in the first safe country under certain conditions. This then would lay the groundwork for a network of binding regional and bilateral safe third-country agreements that would discourage irregular secondary movements (trading financial support, safe pathways, and operational cooperation for accepting asylum seekers). As part of regional agreements, signatories would then commit to offering other channels, such as humanitarian visas, pre-entry asylum processing, and the use of complementary work or study pathways to share responsibility and to provide a credible alternative to irregular movement—including of refugees seeking to reunite with family and friends in destination countries. Other elements could also be included here, such as greater clarity around conditions for cessation of refugee status for those who no longer have protection needs.

Providing a blueprint for responding to situations of mass displacement. Many displacement situations present unique challenges. They are often driven by a wider set of circumstances, such as generalized violence and state collapse, that are not reflected in the 1951 Convention; they are ill-suited to the use of individual asylum determination; and they have the potential to quickly overwhelm the capacity of neighboring states. A Protocol could set out new rules regarding states’ obligations and the rights of displaced persons in these circumstances (possibly including a new form of temporary status, such as that used by some states in response to displacement from Syria, Venezuela, and Ukraine). It could also establish an emergency coordination mechanism that facilitates the offer of emergency resettlement pathways for onward movement for individuals with serious humanitarian needs or willing sponsors in countries further from the front lines.

Responsibility-sharing through increased financial support, with a focus on results-based conditions that promote refugee self-sufficiency. A Protocol could seek to address the responsibility-sharing gap by creating targets or incentives for non-affected states to step up and provide more financial support to frontline countries (e.g. trading off financial contributions for the implementation of safe third-country arrangements). This has a self-interested dimension for high-income countries: it is much cheaper for donor countries to support refugees closer to where they are displaced. But increased funding also could be tied to specific conditions, namely that host countries provide access to safe legal status, legal identity and documentation, rights to work, and freedom of movement. There could also be space for frontline countries to negotiate on other points in their interest, such as access to pathways for their own nationals, in exchange for more funding or expanding rights they grant refugees.

The Mechanics of Getting There

To date, the loudest calls for reforming the Refugee Convention have come from high-income destination states, including European countries and the United States. But binding international agreements are of little use if only a handful of the affected parties sign up. If these states are serious about reforming the system in workable ways, they will need to listen to and incorporate the concerns of the rest of the world. These are likely to differ considerably from the priorities of high-income destination countries. Coming to an agreement will thus require navigating trade-offs and a good deal of grown-up diplomacy.

A first step would be to conduct consultations with a geographically diverse set of states on whether a new Protocol should be negotiated and, if so, what its scope should be. In the leadup to the 1967 Protocol, this process was launched with an expert report tabled for discussion at the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) executive committee (ExCom). UNHCR then conducted bilateral consultations with states around receptivity to certain provisions and potential political and technical sensitivities. This resulted in a targeted proposal that had broad endorsement and was adopted just 21 months after the process began. It may not be possible to fully replicate this process—not the least because of how divisive this set of issues is. But there would be clear value in scoping a core set of ideas before launching a formal negotiation and ensuring the process itself is well steered. Such an undertaking could be a huge win for the new High Commissioner, as yet unselected but due to take office in January 2026.

This is not to say that such a process would be easy. Multilateralism is notably floundering, and international cooperation has become increasingly transactional—admittedly not a conducive environment for difficult negotiations. And with international organizations under pressure from dramatic budget cuts, the place where the value of legal frameworks stands or falls—implementation—could be tricky. Yet attempting to push under the rug the political and practical challenges facing the humanitarian regime, including the different challenges and interests of refugee-hosting countries in various economic brackets—has also not played out well.

A Protocol is not a silver bullet, but it could help bridge the gap between a creaky-though-still-essential 20th century framework and pressing 21st century realities. It could provide the careful adjustments needed to preserve what works, repair what does not, and restore public trust in a system that has saved millions of lives. It would also be an important win for cooperation between high-, middle-, and lower-income countries that could give the humanitarian regime a fresh start.

Tensions remained high at the ICE Processing Center in Broadview Sunday night as families of detainees received word that their loved ones may be moved to another location.

One woman, who did not want to be identified, said she received a call from the facility about her father who was detained earlier this week.

""They called us at 6 p.m. and told us to bring him something, because they're all leaving, and they're either getting sent to Wisconsin or Michigan or Texas,"" she said. ""They're telling him he has to wait two months for court... two months in Texas and then he'll get deported... instead of self-deporting because, he just wants to self deport, but they're not letting him.""

That comes as speculation is growing about how long operations may continue at the facility after protests escalated there earlier this week.

At least one published report suggests DHS is looking to possibly stop using the facility and move to a different location. One source also confirmed that with the ABC7 I-Team Sunday night.

The Department of Homeland Security shared a statement Sunday night, saying in part ""Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE... Secretary Noem's message to rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law.""

One man organizing the protests, Stephen Paul Beyer, says they're trying to maintain the peace with a message of solidarity.

""The families coming into visit it has been heartbreaking to see them we've really been trying to stay out of the way so the families when they come get a chance to see when their loved ones are taking out,"" Beyer said.

There are also concerns from families about the conditions their loved ones are enduring at the facility.

""He said they were sleeping on the floor he was handcuffed for about 12 hours and he said there was 150 people in one room at some point,"" the detainee's daughter said.

DHS said federal enforcement has arrested 16 protesters so far this week during some of the escalations that were seen.

The crowd remained calm Sunday night as ABC7 saw vehicles continue to come and go from the facility.

DHS issued the following full statement:

""Any allegations that ICE Broadview Processing Center is temporarily closing is FALSE. Since Friday, rioters and sanctuary politicians have obstructed and assaulted law enforcement. These rioters have thrown tear gas cans, rocks, bottles, and fireworks at law enforcement, slashed tires of cars, blocked the entrance of the building, and trespassed on private property.

""Secretary Noem's message to rioters is clear: you will not stop us or slow us down. ICE will continue to enforce the law. And if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""

In response, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker's officer issued the following statement:

""The media needs to use extreme caution before reporting what the Trump Administration is saying given their record of lies, lack of transparency, and failure to coordinate with the state and local law enforcement. It's completely false to suggest the state or local municipalities have been obstructing federal officials.

The law aims to boost public trust in law enforcement and stop people from impersonating officers to commit crimes, supporters said.","California became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers, including federal immigration agents, from covering their faces while conducting official business under a bill that was signed Saturday by Gov. Gavin Newsom and swiftly denounced by Trump administration officials.

The ban is a direct response to recent immigration raids in Los Angeles, where federal agents wore masks while making mass arrests. The raids prompted days of protest and led President Donald Trump to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to the area.

Newsom said at a news conference in Los Angeles, where he signed the bill flanked by state lawmakers, education leaders and immigrant community members, that California is unique in that 27% of its residents are foreign born.

“We celebrate that diversity. It’s what makes California great. It’s what makes America great. It is under assault,” he said.

The Democratic governor said the state is pushing back against the practice of masked agents without identification or badge numbers detaining people on the streets.

“The impact of these policies all across this city, our state and nation are terrifying,” Newsom said. “It’s like a dystopian sci-fi movie. Unmarked cars, people in masks, people quite literally disappearing. No due process, no rights, no right in a democracy where we have rights. Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back, and that’s what we’re doing here today.”

But it’s unclear how — or whether — the state can enforce the ban on federal agents.

Trump administration officials have defended use of masks, saying immigration agents face strident and increasing harassment in public and online as they carry out enforcement in service of Trump’s drive toward mass deportation. Obscuring their identities is necessary for the safety of the agents and their families, officials contend.

Bill Essayli, acting US attorney for Southern California, said on the social platform X that the state does not have jurisdiction over the federal government and he has told agencies the mask ban has no effect on their operations. “Our agents will continue to protect their identities,” he said.

Essayli also criticized Newsom’s comment on X saying Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was “going to have a bad day today,” adding that there is zero tolerance for “direct or implicit threats against government officials.” He referred the matter to the Secret Service, which said in a statement, also on X, that it could not comment on the specific case but must investigate any potential threat.

DHS official criticizes California law

Tricia McLaughlin, Homeland Security assistant secretary for public affairs, called it “despicable and a flagrant attempt to endanger our officers.”

“While our federal law enforcement officers are being assaulted by rioters and having rocks and Molotov cocktails thrown at them, a sanctuary politician is trying to outlaw officers wearing masks to protect themselves from being doxxed and targeted by known and suspected terrorist sympathizers,” she said via email.

The men and women of federal immigration agencies put their lives on the line to arrest violent criminal illegal aliens, she said, and rhetoric like Newsom’s has contributed to a surge in assaults.

Newsom countered that concerns about doxing agents, or publishing their personal information online, are unfounded and unproven.

“There’s an assertion that somehow there is an exponential increase in assaults on officers, but they will not provide the data,” he said. “All they have provided is misinformation and misdirection.”

Ban applies to various face coverings, includes some exceptions

The new law prohibits neck gaiters, ski masks and other facial coverings for local and federal officers, including immigration enforcement agents, while they conduct official business. It makes exceptions for undercover agents, medical masks such as N95 respirators or tactical gear, and it does not apply to state police.

Democrats in Congress and lawmakers in several states, including Tennessee, Michigan, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, have introduced similar proposals calling for mask bans.

Proponents of the California law said it is especially needed after the Supreme Court ruled this month that the Trump administration can resume its sweeping immigration operations in Los Angeles. The law aims to boost public trust in law enforcement and stop people from impersonating officers to commit crimes, supporters said.

Constitutional law expert Erwin Chemerinsky at the University of California, Berkeley, also defended the legislation. Federal employees still have to follow general state rules “unless doing so would significantly interfere with the performance of their duties. For example, while on the job, federal employees must stop at red lights,” he wrote in an opinion piece for the Sacramento Bee.

Another new law covers schools and health care facilities

Newsom also signed legislation Saturday preventing immigration agents from entering schools and health care facilities without a valid warrant or judicial order and requiring schools to notify parents and teachers when agents are on campus.

Assemblymember Al Muratsuchi, D-Torrance, said “students cannot learn if they live in fear of being deported.

Rep. Chellie Pingree, in a letter to the acting director of ICE, demanded a “full accounting of this operation, including which agencies were involved, what coordination occurred between these agencies, and the justification for selecting the school as a location for enforcement.”

Portland City Council unanimously passed a resolution condemning the arrest. Separately, Mayor Mark Dion, once a sheriff, expressed his concerns (“Why are federal agents able to escape that basic responsibility that democratic policing expects?”).

The chair of the school board, Sarah Lentz, said in a statement that the board’s role was “to provide free, appropriate education to every student, regardless of the identities that they hold, and this interrupted that and created substantial harm within our community. And it is not welcome.”

This is all well and good. It’s also not nearly enough.

If Maine wishes to send a clear message, to move the needle at all, it needs to assume a united front against the cavalier maneuvers of ICE. Since Donald Trump took office, immigration arrests have more than doubled in Maine and 37 other states.

So far, the collective response has been incoherent.

Consider that the aggrieved city council that issued a formal statement raising concerns about dignity, public trust and community safety is the same city council that, just weeks prior, signed a federal grant agreement for upgrades at Portland International Jetport that mandates cooperation with ICE. Assessing the contract and the national legal picture, lawyers for the city said they don’t expect Portland will be required to work with the agency.

The obvious difficulty with this expectation is that, given the secrecy that shrouds the work of an emboldened and lavishly financed ICE, we may never be able to establish exactly where cooperation with its crackdown begins and ends. Dion had to take extra steps to reassure concerned residents because the decision to sign the contract was made in executive session, behind closed doors.

At a naturalization ceremony in Portland last Wednesday, Gov. Janet Mills declined to comment on the public school detention. The tension of this time, however, cannot be lost on her. A reporter noted the governor appeared to be fighting back tears as she observed: “It always a very emotional and inspiring ceremony.”

Mills is well able to swim against the tide and the governor should be doing so, wherever possible, on the subject of ICE and its practices. Pushing for the governor to sign into law LD 1971 (a bill passed by the House and the Senate in June), the terms of which Mills ultimately found too broad, an August letter writer expressed his impatience.

“This is a strategy that aims to inspire fear in immigrants and in the American population at large. It’s putting boots on the ground in every state, in an unprecedented show of force that belies the stated purpose of getting immigration under control,” read the letter. “Where is the governor’s ‘I’ll see you in court’ resolve that Mainers need and deserve in these fraught times?”

Writing in May on the subject of local police departments’ contracts with ICE — popular nationally but, so far, unpopular here in Maine — this editorial board commended the towns of Wells, Winthrop and Monmouth for withdrawing or pausing their departments’ undertakings to accept work that ICE delegates.

“The upside for ICE, here, is crystal clear,” we wrote. “The potential benefit to our local authorities is murky, at best, and best avoided as a result.”

We see now that there may be “upsides” in the absence of a clear and firm approach to ICE that insists on transparency and other run-of-the-mill terms and conditions.

Carney has said he wants to make Canada “climate competitive” and has said his climate plan is forthcoming.
“We are drawing the line at Prime Minister Mark Carney’s doorstop,” Katie Perfitt, one of the organizers, said.
“New Canadians and migrant workers are worried about their future here in this country,” Hancock said.
“We cannot allow this government or anybody to say that migrant workers are the problem.","TORONTO — Canadians in several major cities demonstrated Saturday against elements of the Liberal government’s agenda, including Prime Minister Mark Carney’s support for new fossil fuel projects and expected public service cuts.

Hundreds who took part in “Draw the Line” protests in Toronto marched from downtown to the provincial legislature building, carrying signs that included messages advocating full immigration status for all, ending trade with Israel, Indigenous rights and a revolution against billionaires.

Some signs featured images of Luigi Mangione, who is accused of killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan in December.

Speakers prior to the march included environmentalist David Suzuki, Grassy Narrows First Nation member Chrissy Isaacs, and others.

Syed Hussan, executive director of the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, accused Carney’s government of “enriching billionaires” while Canada is on “the brink of a climate collapse.”

“We are here to say that whether it is climate, or economic justice, whether it’s Palestine or right here at home, we are facing a joint agenda and we will push back against it,” Hussan told the crowd.

Speaking to reporters, Suzuki criticized Carney’s focus on creating jobs over addressing the climate crisis.

“He’s putting the economy above the atmosphere that gives us air to breathe, that gives us weather, climate, and the seasons. That’s crazy,” Suzuki said.

“Indigenous people tell us all the time the Earth is our mother. She gives birth to us. She nurtures us. She has got to be our highest priority,” Suzuki said, adding that climate change should be a larger priority than creating jobs.

The protests, which occurred ahead of the federal government tabling its budget on Nov. 4, also included marches in Ottawa, Edmonton and Montreal.

Canada has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions to 40 to 45 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030, but Carney has repealed the consumer carbon price and paused the Liberals’ electric vehicle mandate.

Currently, Canada’s emissions are about only 8.5 per cent below what they were in 2005, and Carney and his ministers have refused in recent weeks to say whether Canada is still committed to its 2030 and 2035 targets, though the government says it is still focused on hitting net-zero by 2050.

Carney has said he wants to make Canada “climate competitive” and has said his climate plan is forthcoming.

George Westel, who was at the Toronto protest and represented a group called Stop 413 East End Toronto, said everyone in Ontario is at risk of being hurt by the climate crisis.

“Climate change is affecting migrant workers, it’s affecting Indigenous people,” he said after the group reached Queen’s Park. “This province is called a place to grow, and we are losing that place to growth.”

Hundreds of activists gathered on Wellington Street in front of Parliament Hill in Ottawa to create a giant mural with washable paint. The 65 metre-long mural read “People peace planet not profit” and featured symbols of a moose, fish, a person holding a feather, butterflies and watermelon, representing the issues the activists stand for.

“We are drawing the line at Prime Minister Mark Carney’s doorstop,” Katie Perfitt, one of the organizers, said. “We are refusing to let the government continue down a path of climate destruction, militarism, and scapegoating of migrants. The people demand peace, justice, and a livable future.”

Meanwhile other activists took part in a march from the Hill to the U.S. Embassy and ending at the Human Rights Monument on Elgin Street.

Ottawa Police said two people were arrested for mischief and had Wellington Road closed for the majority of the afternoon for the clean up of paint.

“Despite clashes with police and two activists being detained, spirits remained high, and a human barrier formed to allow the painting to continue,” organizers said in a statement.

The road reopened shortly after 5 p.m.

In Vancouver, hundreds of protesters listened to speeches outside a downtown library before marching several blocks.

Mark Hancock, national president of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, told the crowd that many people feel a sense of urgency on issues including skyrocketing housing and food costs.

“New Canadians and migrant workers are worried about their future here in this country,” Hancock said. “We cannot allow this government or anybody to say that migrant workers are the problem. They’re not taking away our housing. They’re not jacking up the cost of living in this country. They’re just trying to make it like you and I and everybody else in this country.”

Carney said earlier this month that the government plans to return immigration rates to “sustainable levels,” which includes reducing the number of non-permanent residents to less than five per cent of the total population.

He said that adjusting the temporary foreign worker program to target specific sectors and needs in specific regions, as well as improving immigration policies, was tied to easing the strain on housing, public infrastructure and social services.

Many protesters in B.C. objected to the federal government fast-tracking liquefied natural gas expansion projects in B.C., which Vancouver resident Robert Hornsey said would result in the depletion of groundwater.

“The LNG is a boondoggle. What you need to do is invest in renewable energy, wind, air, solar, tidal and thermal,” Hornsey said. “B.C. has a massive geothermal reservoir that it has not used or exploited.”

Another event attendee, Ann Grant, was holding her handmade big pink balloon printed with Carney’s face that read “killing the planet.”

In some cases, refugees are being deported to countries where they’ve never lived, they say.

It’s not immediately clear how many members from Fresno’s Southeast Asian community have been detained at ICE check-ins and deported since President Donald Trump launched what he says will be the largest deportation campaign in history. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to request for comment on this story.

Many of these individuals are refugees with minor criminal records from years ago that could subject them to deportation, advocates say. But they weren’t deported earlier because, as refugees, the countries they were born in don’t recognize their citizenship. Some were born in refugee camps and are considered stateless. Or, the U.S. didn’t have an agreement in place to deport them to their home countries. In lieu of deportation, they were required to have regular check-ins with ICE.

While these check-ins were a longstanding practice, now, some are of these people are being detained and forced to return to countries they and their families were forced to flee due to political persecution, war and genocide.

Fresno has a large Southeast Asian community, from countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam and Laos. It’s also home to the second largest concentrations of Hmong people nationwide, many descendants of U.S. allies during the Vietnam War.

“A lot of them are refugees or children of these veterans (and) have committed a senseless crime when they were teenagers,” said Pao Yang, president and CEO of The Fresno Center. “And then now you’re sending these children of these veterans that fought with the U.S. back to a country that they were fighting against with you.”

During the first Trump administration, the government tried to put pressure on Southeast Asian countries to receive people with deportation orders to those countries. Those efforts have ramped up this year during Trump’s second term, said Tilman Jacobs, an immigrants rights supervising attorney with the Asian Law Caucus, the nation’s oldest Asian American civil rights advocacy group.

“These communities are being impacted in a way that we haven’t seen before,” Jacobs said. Individuals have been deported from ICE check-ins in Fresno, he said, though he didn’t have an estimate on how many had been detained.

Yang, the Fresno Center CEO, said he also knows of “many” Fresno clients that have been detained and transferred to the Golden State Annex ICE detention center in McFarland, where they are held as they await next steps in their immigration cases.

As of late August, Christine Barker, executive director of the refugee-serving nonprofit, Fresno Immigrant and Refugee Ministries, knew of at least five individuals of Laotian or Cambodian descent being detained at their ICE check-ins in Fresno.

“I also know from some of their family members, when they got to [the Golden State Annex ICE detention center in] McFarland, they were like, ‘there’s a lot of Asian people here,” she said.

While California’s Southeast Asian communities have experienced more sporadic immigration enforcement, other states such as Michigan and Minnesota have seen more high-profile enforcement activity. More than 150 Southeast Asians have been deported from Minnesota since May, according to an Aug. 18 report in the Minnesota Reformer.

Jacobs said the practice of detaining people at ICE check-ins was more common during the first five or six months of the administration, but he hasn’t seen as much of it recently in California.

“That doesn’t mean it’s not going to continue happening,” he said. “It’s definitely a real risk. But I also don’t want to overstate it.”

Hmong people are an ethnic group originating from China and that have their own language and culture. Because of decades of persecution by the Chinese government over their cultural and spiritual practices, the Hmong have constantly migrated to Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and Myanmar. In the early 1960s, the CIA recruited Hmong people to help fight against North Vietnam and the communist party in Laos, known as the Pathet Lao. The operation, also known as The Secret War, lasted from 1962 to 1975. When the Pathet Lao took over Laos’s governance, thousands of Hmong and Laotian people sought refuge in the United States in 1975.

Barker said what’s happening to these refugees is a violation of human rights.

“When you’re a refugee, the world is supposed to protect you from ever having to return to the country you fled,” she said. “These are uncles, these are grandpas, these are old, old convictions from the 80s and the 90s.”

Deported to Laos, Cambodia

Families, lawyers and nonprofits are scrambling to support individuals that have been deported to countries such as Laos and Cambodia.

Thao Ha, runs Collective Freedom, an organization that supports “justice-impacted” individuals from Southeast Asian communities. In recent months, her organization has had to pivot to provide support on the ground in Laos and is helping families track down their deported loved ones.

“We didn’t think they were going to go this hard, this fast, or at all,” she said. The community had assumptions that people couldn’t get deported to Laos, or that only a few here and there would be deported, Ha said.

Laos doesn’t have a formal repatriation agreement with the U.S., according to the Asian Law Caucus. But the Trump administration has pressured Laos to accept deportees — including people who were not born in the country and whose parents fled the country — by threatening to withhold business and tourist visas to Lao citizens.

When people are deported to Laos, they are detained upon entry in Laos for multiple weeks, advocates say. Those with a local sponsor are released more quickly. Those who don’t have a sponsor will be detained longer until the government can process them.

Ha said there’s no official repatriation process in Laos, meaning there’s little infrastructure to help people with housing, work, or cultural adjustment.

“There’s not an agency, so to speak,” Ha said. “We’re just trying to rapid response and mutual aid at this point.” Several groups have “popped up” to try to fill the gaps, but none are formal non-governmental organizations.

The “number one challenge” for people with their loved ones being deported to Laos is that they don’t have family there, Ha said. “If they don’t have family and don’t have a sponsor, where do they go? What do they do? Are they just roaming the streets?”

For some deported to Laos, especially those born in refugee camps, they have no relationship to the country, language skills or community knowledge. “For Hmong folks who grew up in the U.S., they may never learn Lao,” Barker said.

Barker also said there used to be programs to help people from the Khmer Indigenous ethnic group acculturate in Cambodia.

“Those programs disappeared when USAID was gutted,” she said.

Fleeing war, genocide, persecution

Jacobs of the Asian Law Caucus said his organization works with Southeast Asian refugees who are facing pending deportation, oftentimes from very old convictions.

“Many of the people that we work with have consistently followed all of those terms with their release and continue to do so,” Jacobs said. “And I know that there is a lot of anxiety right now around these check-ins.”

Many of the organization’s clients were fleeing civil war, genocide and persecution and carry memories of trauma associated with the unfamiliar country, he said.

“In many cases, there are countries that don’t really want to receive people who left so long ago, and what a lot of them are facing in real terms, is statelessness where they’re not recognized as citizens of those countries,” he said.

For example, he said, Hmong people in Laos are given some kind of residency status, but they are not citizens. And this sense of not belonging can have lingering legal, emotional and psychological impact.

Yang said many in the Southeast Asian immigrant community are quiet and scared because many come from a country where the government targets people. Earlier this year, there was a rush of people seeking legal services, but now, especially after the start of the June immigration crackdown in Los Angeles, he’s noticed a “huge drop” in people seeking assistance.

“We have a lot of folks, even legal resident aliens, that are in hiding, that are afraid,” he said.",https://www.fresnobee.com/public/opinion/letters-to-the-editor/b5fn6g/picture312166297/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_IMG_JRW_HMONG_NEW_YE_2_1_MQCJB0FL_L347915631,N,,2025-09-21 15:56:53.537061

In framing the Hyundai ICE raid as a blow to economic diplomacy and foreign policy, opponents of ICE detentions disregard the humanity of those suffering these vile, horrific acts.
The Hyundai plant atrocity should infuriate the Emory community, not just as fellow residents of Georgia, but as fellow humans.
Reports of the Hyundai ICE raid have centered around the U.S. regaining its foothold in diplomatic relations with South Korea.","On Sept. 18, Hyundai announced that it would funnel $2.7 billion into the Hyundai Motor Group and LG Energy Solution manufacturing plant in Ellabel, Ga. Just two weeks earlier U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raided that same factory. The raid comes in the aftermath of the United States and South Korea summit where both parties negotiated a nearly $150 billion industry trade deal.

During the raid at the Hyundai factory, United States immigration authorities detained 475 people at the plant due to allegations of ""unlawful employment practices and other serious federal crimes."" Back in February, The Emory Wheel Editorial Board wrote about the threat of ICE to our nation’s diversity, as part of the Trump administration’s overarching agenda to turn the United States into a monolith of national identity. Since then, the situation has only worsened — violations of rights are so commonplace that people have become desensitized to their severity.

In the days following, ICE deported over 300 South Korean nationals whom the agency detained in the raid. U.S. President Donald Trump justified the deportations, citing that the Koreans were “illegal aliens and ICE was just doing its job.” Despite some of the group holding legal status, this did not stop ICE from holding several Korean nationals at gunpoint, detaining them in overcrowded rooms with little-to-no sunlight, and forcing them to drink water from the floor, according to the workers themselves. South Korean news outlets have been quick to point out the sadistic treatment of the South Korean workers, with one saying the U.S. treated the workers as “prisoners of war.” As of Sept. 12, the South Korean workers arrived home to reunions with loved ones and protests for justice in their names.

Through the Trump administration’s brash commitment to the fear-based corralling of immigrants, the United States not only faces forced isolationism but also becomes increasingly inhumane. In mainstream media, initial coverage of the Hyundai plant raid was predominantly focused on the potential economic fallout of this event. In framing the Hyundai ICE raid as a blow to economic diplomacy and foreign policy, opponents of ICE detentions disregard the humanity of those suffering these vile, horrific acts.

In the wake of the raid, reports highlighted how rising tensions between South Korea and the United States have hindered economic and diplomatic relations. Despite South Korea and Hyundai’s investment plans to the Ellabel plant and other U.S. industries, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said that the ICE raid could have a “considerable impact” on future investments from his country. Georgia lawmakers have stepped into action, but these efforts have been focused on preventing further disruptions to local industries, not on reducing brutal detainments.

While these monetary concerns are valid, centering discourse on the investment impacts of the raid obscures the dystopian reality for immigrants. We are focusing too much on economic implications and sidestepping moral ones. Advocates of immigration reform often highlight how immigrant workers fill labor gaps — especially in manufacturing and construction — and call them the “backbone” of manual labor in this country. However, behind every data point is a life. Detainees face prolonged isolation in remote facilities with limited access to legal counsel and often lack due process. Reports show ICE agents throughout the country using excessive force and denying medical care to detainees, painting a disturbing picture of cruelty and inhumanity.

Focusing on investments, tariffs or labor shortages suggests that detainees only deserve respect if they bolster a bottom line. Our state’s commitment to justice should not hinge on how many cars or naval vessels a worker helps build. This was the largest single-site immigration raid in U.S. history, and it happened 200 miles from Emory. Based on the other massive ICE sweeps in Los Angeles, Boston and Chicago among other cities, this event is not an anomaly — these operations are becoming the norm, with no sign of slowing.

Worse, in a recent shadow docket decision, the Supreme Court quietly lifted two lower courts’ ban on ICE’s “roving patrols.” With no written explanation, the decision essentially allows ICE agents to question and detain people based on markers of “reasonable suspicion,” including their appearance, language, neighborhood or workplace. Race, identity, origin and visa status have become the measure of someone's worth, and anyone who does not appear white is susceptible to being confronted and asked to present their papers.

The Hyundai raid makes it abundantly clear that these events do not merely concern news happening in other states. As residents of metro Atlanta, we are interlaced with the people, culture and industry of rural Georgia — together, we all contribute to the lifeblood of the state. The Hyundai plant atrocity should infuriate the Emory community, not just as fellow residents of Georgia, but as fellow humans.

As citizens, we must not look the other way when such gross misconduct happens under our nose, especially when many members of our community come from immigrant families, including several of us on the Editorial Board. We implore you to look deeper than the headline. Reports of the Hyundai ICE raid have centered around the U.S. regaining its foothold in diplomatic relations with South Korea. However, when our coverage shifts to rectifying national friendships for the purpose of economic gain, we set aside our common humanity. News broadcasts of this detainment have been ultimately facile and have compartmentalized the real issue — human suffering is not an implication.

Organizations like Migrant Equity Southeast work to center the narratives and experiences of communities that the unencumbered cruelty of ICE raids has ripped apart. Standing in support of immigrants during protests, such as the Buford Highway protest highlighted in our previous article, demonstrates to the administration that we will not tolerate violations of our Constitutional rights. We must educate ourselves and our communities on our Fourth Amendment rights and how to respond during ICE encounters to ensure the safety of immigrants — especially as they grow more and more at risk.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/whl/40404a2f-a128-4c36-8c16-16021ab9b449.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&h=600,N,,2025-09-21 19:56:49.747064

Gavin Newsom signed five bills Saturday attempting to thwart President Donald Trump's mass deportation agenda, including a ban on local and federal officers wearing masks to conceal their identities.

The bills mark the latest chapter in what's become a tense fight over immigration enforcement in California, a state home to more than 10 million immigrants as well as industries and communities that depend on them.

""Immigrants have rights, and we have the right to stand up and push back,"" Newsom said Saturday afternoon at a Los Angeles signing ceremony in which he condemned secrecy by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. ""ICE unmasked. What are you afraid of? You're going to go out and do an enforcement? Provide an ID.""

In the nine months since Trump took office, his administration has targeted California's sanctuary protections that limit local law enforcement's cooperation with immigration enforcement efforts, sent National Guard troops into Los Angeles to quell immigration protests, and carried out aggressive raids in immigrant-heavy communities. An immigrant farmworker died in one of those raids as he tried to escape the chaos.

Two federal judges have imposed limits on federal immigration agents' tactics and ability to profile Latino residents, but the U.S. Supreme Court overturned one of those orders, clearing the way for ICE officers to target people in Southern California who look Latino or are speaking Spanish. Trump's crackdown has also ensnared U.S. citizens, some of whom have seen their property destroyed during immigration stops or been detained in immigration facilities when officers did not believe they were citizens or were unable to immediately prove their citizenship. In many cases the federal agents have worn face coverings that conceal their identity.

Newsom also signed new laws that seek to limit immigration enforcement work in hospitals and schools. In a statement announcing the new laws, Newsom excoriated Trump's immigration tactics, calling out the president and his top aide on immigration policy, Stephen Miller.

""Public safety depends on trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve - but Trump and Miller have shattered that trust and spread fear across America,"" Newsom wrote. ""California is putting an end to it and making sure schools and hospitals remain what they should be: places of care, not chaos.""

The bills approved Saturday include two measures that require federal and local officials, including immigration agents, to identify themselves. One measure, Senate Bill 627, prevents police from covering their faces on the job, with some exceptions. It applies to local law enforcement officers, out-of-state police officers and federal law enforcement officers - but not state police.

The Department of Homeland Security urged Newsom to veto SB627, arguing its officers need masks to protect them from ""being doxed."" The term ""doxed"" typically refers to people's sensitive personal information being released online, but DHS appeared to use it to mean when immigration officers' identities are made public, something that is routine for government employees.

Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, released a scathing response denouncing the idea that federal agents cannot effectively police without concealing their identities.

""Law enforcement can do their jobs without wearing ski masks, and if you think you need to wear a ski mask while patrolling and making arrests, you may want to consider a different line of work,"" wrote Wiener, the author of the new law. ""Masked secret police are not making anyone safer; instead they're creating an environment of lawlessness and fear that puts federal agents, local law enforcement, and civilians in danger.""

Much of the criticism of the bill focused not on whether wearing masks was good for policing, but whether the state has the ability to create rules guiding how federal officers perform their work within the state.

""States do not have the authority to second-guess the efficacy of federal policies, including masking,"" David Mastagni, an attorney representing the Peace Officers Research Association of California, an umbrella group of police unions, told lawmakers during a hearing on the bill.

The mask ban will take effect Jan. 1.

The other bill, SB805 by Sen. Sasha Pérez, D-Alhambra (Los Angeles County), requires law enforcement officers working in California to display identification with their name or badge number, with exceptions for undercover work and protective gear. It also limits when bounty hunters can help with immigration enforcement. SB805 takes effect immediately.

Newsom also signed these new laws, which take effect immediately:

• Senate Bill 98, by Pérez, which requires schools to tell parents and guardians when immigration officers are present on campus.

• Assembly Bill 49, by Assembly Member Al Muratsuchi, D-Rolling Hills Estates (Los Angeles County), which requires school officials to deny access to federal immigration authorities unless they have valid identification and a judicial warrant or court order. It takes effect immediately.

• Senate Bill 81, by Sen. Jesse Arreguín, D-Berkeley, which classifies immigration status and place of birth as ""private information"" that health care providers can't share with immigration enforcement. The bill also prohibits any person from accessing nonpublic areas of hospitals and doctors' offices for the purposes of immigration enforcement - except when required by federal or state law.

""Kristi Noem is going to have a bad day today. You're welcome, America,"" Newsom's press office posted Saturday on X in reference to the homeland security secretary. The post prompted acting U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli to respond: ""We have zero tolerance for direct or implicit threats against government officials. I've referred this matter to @SecretService and requested a full threat assessment.""",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/nl6_39E2mz4TkBj_xo98Mw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/san_francisco_chronicle_hearst_178/a09ca24e3c2cabd682af6d64feccd1e0,N,,2025-09-21 13:57:07.998003

What to watch: Whether any existing H-1B holders will run into any issues traveling after Sunday.","A new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas goes into effect Sunday, but it will not be applied to existing holders of valid visas re-entering the country, a White House official tells Axios.

Why it matters: President Trump's executive order, as written, gave some lawyers the impression the fee would kick in immediately for existing holders — prompting panicked advice to clients to get back to the U.S. Saturday, or else.

Catch up quick: Friday night, Trump signed an order requiring an H-1B holder, or their corporate sponsor, to pay an annual $100,000 fee for their visa.

For the biggest H-1B employers — tech companies like Microsoft and Amazon, and outsourcing companies like Cognizant — that could potentially mean a new fee burden in excess of $1 billion a year.

The intrigue: The rules kick in at 12:01 a.m. ET Sunday, but as written, some lawyers argued it appeared the fee would apply to anyone with an H-1B, even those whose visa was already approved, but who happen to be outside of the United States for some reason.

Some tech companies reportedly told their H-1B employees to get back to the U.S. by Saturday and not leave thereafter.

""I hate to say this, but if you are an H-1B worker outside the U.S. who already has an H-1B visa, the safest approach is re-entering before Sunday,"" immigration lawyer Douglas Russo said in a widely commented post on LinkedIn late Friday.

Yes, but: That is not the case, the White House official tells Axios.

The fee will only apply to new applicants, not existing holders or renewals, the official said.

It will first apply in the upcoming lottery cycle for new applicants, the official added.

Of note: Saturday afternoon, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services director Joseph Edlow issued a memo confirming the fee order only applies to petitions not yet filed.

""The proclamation does not apply to aliens who: are the beneficiaries of petitions that were filed prior to the effective date of the proclamation, are the beneficiaries of currently approved petitions, or are in possession of validly issued H-1B non-immigrant visas,"" the memo says.

The big picture: While Trump's crackdown on border crossings has gotten the lion's share of attention, the fight over H-1B visas for highly skilled workers has been in many ways an equally contentious part of his immigration policy.

Traditional MAGA allies like Steve Bannon say U.S. employers are using H-1Bs to bring in tech workers to take American jobs at a fraction of the cost.

Newer Trump allies from Silicon Valley, on the other hand, say H-1Bs are crucial for bringing the world's best talent to America.

For the record: ""President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down wages. It also gives certainty to American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers to our great country but have been trampled on by abuses of the system,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

What to watch: Whether any existing H-1B holders will run into any issues traveling after Sunday.

“The clarifications mean that foreign nationals who currently have a pending or approved H-1B petition or a valid H-1B visa should not be subject to the newly-announced H-1B entry restrictions,” according to Fragomen.
Immigration Lawsuits Are Coming Over the H-1B Visa Proclamation After issuing the proclamation, Trump officials responsible for immigration policy should expect to find themselves in a familiar place—inside of a courtroom.
Immigration attorney Curtis Morrison of Red Eagle Law said in an interview that he plans to file a lawsuit against the H-1B proclamation.
For example, an NFAP study by economist Madeline Zavodny concluded, “H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect U.S. workers.","Trump officials will face lawsuits over a proclamation that uses selective economic claims to justify a travel ban on H-1B visa holders. The presidential proclamation, issued on September 19, 2025, will impose a likely prohibitive $100,000 fee on the entry of individuals with new H-1B visas. An administration clarification, or “walk-back” after criticism, provided more details on who can enter the United States without paying the fee. If the $100,000 fee survives court challenges, it will change how many companies access talent, since an H-1B visa is often the only practical way for a high-skilled foreign national to work long term in America. After surveying the impact and examining what is coming from the administration on immigration policy, many employers are expected to respond by increasing offshoring and hiring more people outside the United States, the opposite of what the proclamation aims to accomplish.

The presidential proclamation bans the entry of individuals on H-1B visas “except for those aliens whose petitions are accompanied or supplemented by a payment of $100,000.” The proclamation contains no information on how an employer can obtain a “national interest” waiver to sidestep paying the $100,000 fee. The restriction lasts for 12 months but will likely endure throughout the Trump administration.

According to Customs and Border Protection, “The Proclamation applies prospectively to petitions that have not been filed. It does not impact aliens who are beneficiaries of currently approved petitions, any petitions filed prior to 12:01 AM ET on September 21, 2025, or aliens in possession of validly issued H-1B nonimmigrants visas.” (USCIS issued a memo with similar language.)

“The clarifications mean that foreign nationals who currently have a pending or approved H-1B petition or a valid H-1B visa should not be subject to the newly-announced H-1B entry restrictions,” according to Fragomen. “They should be able to enter the United States from abroad on or after September 21, 2025, provided that they possess a valid, approved H-1B petition and H-1B visa (if required).” The law firm notes that “those with a pending H-1B petition should not be impacted by the proclamation.” However, foreign nationals with an H-1B petition filed on or after September 21, 2025, “are subject to the new entry restrictions.” The firm notes, “Guidance on petitions subject to the restrictions, on payment of the new H-1B fee, and on applying for a national interest exception to the restrictions are anticipated in the coming days.”

An employer who petitions for an individual, such as an F-1 student, who changes to H-1B status without leaving the United States should not have to pay the $100,000 fee. However, the two agency memos released over the weekend are not crystal clear on this. The CBP memo says the fee only applies to people outside the US, but the USCIS memo does not say that, and USCIS adjudicates H-1B petitions, notes Dan Berger of Green & Spiegel. The weekend memos clarify that current H-1B employees who did not pay the fee can still travel. But since this is an evolving situation, employers should seek legal advice and watch for agency guidance before individuals travel.

If the H-1B travel ban remains in place, cap-exempt organizations, such as universities, would have to pay the $100,000 fee to hire new professors or researchers if they are outside the country and a petition has not already been filed for them. The $100,000 fee, on top of other government fees, attorney costs and salary requirements, will act as a prohibition on hiring individuals outside the country in H-1B status for nearly all employers.

Immigration Lawsuits Are Coming Over the H-1B Visa Proclamation

After issuing the proclamation, Trump officials responsible for immigration policy should expect to find themselves in a familiar place—inside of a courtroom. Attorneys believe they have a strong case but may have to contend with a Supreme Court that has often deferred to the president on immigration policy.

Immigration attorney Curtis Morrison of Red Eagle Law said in an interview that he plans to file a lawsuit against the H-1B proclamation. “I want to say it’s nuts that the proclamation cites 8 U.S.C. 1182(f) as authority, when that provision only gives the president authority to prevent entry, and gives the president no authority with respect to petition approval or visa issuance,” said Morrison. “This is fresh on my mind as I won an injunction on this issue just a month ago.” The case was Thein v. Trump, which focused on whether Trump’s travel ban can prevent the State Department from issuing visas to Diversity Visa lottery winners.

“8 U.S.C.1185(a) doesn’t make this proclamation lawful either,” said Morrison, “because it only gives the president authority to prescribe reasonable rules for foreigners to depart or enter the U.S. It’s clear from this proclamation they’re making rules about how petitions are approved and how visas are issued. Also, I don’t think this proclamation can survive a nondelegation challenge.” Nondelegation refers to the constitutional issue whereby Congress cannot give away its legislative authority.

Immigration attorney Cyrus Mehta is less confident a lawsuit will succeed. “While the proclamation is so blatantly unlawful that it rewrites parts of the INA (Immigration and Nationality Act), I am not as sanguine of a successful challenge to the proclamation after the Supreme Court upheld Trump’s travel ban under INA 221(f) in Trump v. Hawaii,” he said in an interview. “The H-1B proclamation has also been issued pursuant to INA 221(f).”

“The proclamation rehashes many of the objections to the H-1B visa category that have become outdated and seem to cast IT firms of Indian heritage in an unfavorable light,” said Mehta. “H-1B workers are no longer cheap labor and provide great value to U.S. companies, which in turn create more jobs for U.S. workers. H-1B workers are mostly paid six figure salaries. The rules also ensure that H-1B workers are paid the higher of the prevailing or actual wage.”

Mehta said a court may not challenge the president’s rationale behind the proclamation, but a court could evaluate whether imposing the $100,000 fee rewrites H-1B law or only supplants it. “To me, it is a complete rewrite of the law, and so a court should be able to distinguish this proclamation from Trump v. Hawaii,” he said. “The president cannot wholesale re-write laws enacted by Congress, and decide the sort of immigrant he prefers over another based on personal whim and prejudice.”

On October 1, 2020, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey S. White issued a preliminary injunction against the Trump administration’s June 2020 proclamation that suspended the entry of foreign nationals on H-1B, L-1, H-2B and most J-1 temporary visas. Judge White ruled the president does not possess a monarch’s power to cast aside immigration laws passed by Congress. The order in NAM v. DHS prevented the State Department and Department of Homeland Security from “engaging in any action that results in the non-processing or non-issuance of applications or petitions for visas in the H, J, and L categories which, but for Proclamation 10052, would be eligible for processing and issuance.”

At a September 11, 2020, hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Paul Hughes of McDermott Will & Schulte, counsel for the plaintiffs, framed the issues: If Congress delegated unlimited authority to the president under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. § 1182(f)), the law is unconstitutional as an unlawful delegation of authority by Congress. If the authority is not unlimited, then there are limits to the president’s authority based on rational standards and court precedents.

Judge White cited an amicus curiae brief from law professors that all past presidents “had issued such Proclamations with the basic understanding that ‘exercises of authority under § 1182(f) must connect to the United States’ relations with foreign powers.’ As the Court examines this Proclamation in the immigration context aimed to address purely domestic considerations, the amicus suggest that ‘[g]iven this lack of pedigree on past practice, this Court should scale back deference that it affords the current proclamation.’”

“There must be some measure of constraint on Presidential authority in the domestic sphere in order not to render the executive an entirely monarchical power in the immigration context, an area within clear legislative prerogative,” according to Judge White. In a footnote, Judge White expressed skepticism that the ban on the entry of visa holders banned under the proclamation would end. The ban ended after Joe Biden took office.

Proclamation Makes Selective Immigration Claims To Justify H-1B Travel Ban

The H-1B proclamation makes only a limited attempt to justify the extraordinary action of banning the entry of an entire visa category of highly skilled individuals. “The Trump administration makes highly selective claims that ignore a large body of economic research on the benefits of admitting H-1B visa holders to justify its presidential proclamation imposing a travel ban on H-1B visa holders whose employers do not pay a prohibitive $100,000 penalty,” concluded a National Foundation for American Policy analysis.

“The presidential proclamation’s omissions, cherry picking and obfuscation of data indicate the administration decided on the policy details in the proclamation and later attempted to find material to support the policy rather than engage in a legitimate analysis that culminated in banning the entry of H-1B visa holders, absent a $100,000 fee,” according to the NFAP report.

The proclamation argues that an increasing unemployment rate in technology fields justifies the H-1B travel ban, despite the unemployment rate declining in these fields. “The unemployment rate for computer and mathematical occupations dropped from 3.4% to 3.0% between August 2024 and August 2025, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,” notes the NFAP analysis. “The unemployment rate for architecture and engineering occupations fell from 1.7% to 1.4% between August 2024 and August 2025. Those numbers represent a decline in the unemployment rate in percentage terms of 11.8% for individuals in computer and mathematical occupations and a drop of 17.6% for professionals in architecture and engineering.”

The proclamation ignores the overall unemployment rate in these fields over the past 12 months but cites data on the unemployment rates among college graduates aged 22 to 27 from 2023—without noting the data were from 2023. The fourth table in a group of tables released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York divides the population of college graduates aged 22 to 27 in a survey into 72 college majors, resulting in much smaller sample sizes, which creates volatility and less reliability in the results. For example, although the proclamation cites a 7.5% unemployment rate for recent college graduates in computer engineering, it does not note the figure is from 2023 or that in 2022 the survey showed the unemployment rate in computer engineering was only 2.5%. Other fields, such as agricultural economics, also showed wild fluctuations from year to year. The NFAP analysis notes that it is unlikely the numbers in the survey are a strong indicator of career prospects in particular fields.

The proclamation ignores the significant job creation that has benefited U.S. workers in technology fields over the past few decades. “The number of U.S.-born workers employed in computer science and mathematical occupations increased by over 2.7 million, or 141%, between 2003 and 2024,” according to an NFAP analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

The proclamation implies that U.S. college students would be better off majoring in art history than in computer fields due to H-1B visa holders. There is no evidence to support such a conclusion.

A 2021 NFAP study by Madeline Zavodny, an economics professor at the University of North Florida and a former research economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, found, “Median earnings of college graduates with a computer-related major are 35% higher than other STEM majors and fully 83% higher than non-STEM majors, according to data on U.S.-born college graduates from the American Community Survey for the period 2009 to 2019.”

The proclamation ignores almost entirely the vast number of studies produced on H-1B visa holders. The NFAP analysis cites more than a dozen to illustrate the point.

For example, an NFAP study by economist Madeline Zavodny concluded, “H-1B visa holders do not adversely affect U.S. workers. On the contrary, the evidence points to the presence of H-1B visa holders being associated with lower unemployment rates and faster earnings growth among college graduates, including recent college graduates.”

A study by economists Giovanni Peri, Kevin Shih, Chad Sparber and Angie Marek Zeitlin found that denying entry to H-1B visa holders due to the H-1B annual limits inhibited job growth for U.S.-born professionals. “The number of jobs for U.S.-born workers in computer-related industries would have grown at least 55% faster between 2005-2006 and 2009-2010, if not for the denial of so many applications in the recent H-1B visa lotteries,” concluded the economists.

In a study particularly relevant to the new H-1B proclamation, research by Britta Glennon, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, concluded that new restrictions on H-1B visas are likely to push jobs out of the United States: “[A]ny policies that are motivated by concerns about the loss of native jobs should consider that policies aimed at reducing immigration have the unintended consequence of encouraging firms to offshore jobs abroad.”

More Immigration And H-1B Visa Restrictions On The Horizon

Trump officials appear unlikely to slow their pace after issuing the travel ban on H-1B visas. The proclamation calls for reviving the Trump administration’s efforts in 2020 to publish a Department of Labor rule to inflate the required salary for H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants. The 2020 measure mandated minimum salaries so far above the market wage for a foreign national’s experience level that analysts concluded Trump officials intended to price H-1B visa holders and employment-based immigrants out of the U.S. labor market. Unlike the proclamation, such a rule would apply to individuals inside the United States, not just those seeking entry.

Trump officials are likely to continue their efforts to dismantle the current immigrant talent pipeline by, among other things, making it more difficult for international students to obtain H-1B status. The effort will include finalizing the recently proposed rule to require fixed periods of admission for students, rulemaking to curtail or eliminate, in practice, Optional Practical Training and STEM OPT, a new H-1B selection process expected to disadvantage international students and an H-1B rule that will likely introduce new restrictions for companies.

If employers did not have enough to worry about, the Department of Labor announced a new immigration effort on September 19, 2025. “The U.S. Department of Labor today announced the launch of Project Firewall, an H-1B enforcement initiative that will safeguard the rights, wages, and job opportunities of highly skilled American workers by ensuring employers prioritize qualified Americans when hiring workers and holding employers accountable if they abuse the H-1B visa process,” according to a news release.

The Secretary of Labor promises to “personally certify the initiation of investigations for the first time” in the Labor Department’s history. The DOL release on the new immigration action notes, “As authorized by federal law, the department will conduct investigations of employers through Project Firewall to maximize H-1B program compliance.”","https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68cfa474a8f75b8570b1fd1f/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&crop=1688,950,x0,y0,safe&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds",N,,2025-09-21 12:56:38.048856

The report also found that during the first three months of 2025, vulnerable people were held in isolation for periods more than twice as long as when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) first began publishing statistics — that is, 38 consecutive days in early 2025 compared with 14 days in late 2021.

The agency defines vulnerable people as pregnant, breastfeeding, or elderly individuals; those suffering from serious mental disorders or illnesses; people at risk of harm because of their identity; or victims of rape or sexual abuse.

Solitary confinement is defined as placing a person in a small cell for 22 hours or more per day without meaningful human contact. ICE claims it does not use “solitary confinement” in its detention centers. The agency avoids the term “solitary confinement” and instead uses terms such as segregation, separate housing, or Special Management Units. The study says migrants held in such cells were placed in administrative segregation.

According to the report, more than 10,500 people were placed in solitary confinement in detention centers across the United States over a 14-month period from April 2024 to May 2025. Similarly, in the first four months of Trump’s second term, the monthly increase in the use of solitary confinement was more than six times higher than at the end of the previous U.S. administration.

The report also cites a study showing that solitary confinement in immigration detention has risen at an alarming rate and an unprecedented number of migrants are being kept in isolation. It warns that, due to a recent increase in congressional funding approved to expand migrant detention centers, widespread and prolonged use of solitary confinement is likely to worsen.

The United Nations considers solitary confinement of 15 days or more to be torture. Katherine Piller, one of the study’s authors, said in a statement that agency records from late in the Biden administration — amid increasing attacks by the Trump administration on migrants — show that ICE has exposed people to these torturous conditions, causing devastating physical and psychological harm.

And there have been at least five ICE missions to Africa on military jets, though if the last two are any indication, they are getting increasingly harder to spot.","Two American military cargo jets deported people to Africa this month on flights that appear to have had their transponders turned off, obscuring their locations from public flight databases and other nearby aircraft.

One of the jets was later identified in a lawsuit in U.S. federal court as carrying 14 Nigerian and Gambian nationals to a prison camp in Ghana. They have since been returned to their countries of origin, Ghana said, despite all having credible fears of persecution or torture. The other jet secretly landed in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Mali, according to communications from the flight deck obtained by Rolling Stone. Representatives for the governments of these countries did not respond to emails asking if this jet also included third-country nationals.

The secret flights are part of what appears to be a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity across the African continent, following a pressure campaign led by President Donald Trump on many of the governments there over the summer.

“The administration is using military secrecy to cover for what is basically a law enforcement/immigration enforcement function,” an activist flight tracker who goes by JJ in DC told Rolling Stone. “If this is being done in our interest, we have a right to know where these deportation flights are going.”

While it is legal for military aircraft to turn off their transponders, this is generally reserved for combat and surveillance missions, JJ in DC, who is a military veteran, said. Military flights also cost much more to operate than charter carriers, as much as $28,500 an hour, according to Reuters.

The Air Force and ICE did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not provide a statement prior to publication. This story will be updated if any of them do.

Both secret trips were on Air Force C-17 Globemasters. The first one left McChord Field near Tacoma, Wash., on the evening of Sept. 4, stopping at the ICE-detention hub city of Alexandria, La., and the U.S. military outpost at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba — which Trump has converted into an ICE facility holding what he has baselessly claimed are “the worst of the worst” deportees. The flight landed in St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a likely fuel stop, the next afternoon.

Editor’s picks

These flights were conducted without the standard transponder signal, called Automatic Dependent Signal-Broadcast, or ADS-B, which transmits constant information about a flight, including registration, location, speed, and altitude, to any receiver within range. The C-17 used an alternative signal transmitting its registration but no location or other flight data — though flight-tracking websites could still approximate its location through a kind of triangulation.

It is unclear when exactly the C-17 left St. Croix, because by then it was using another type of signal even harder to detect, in which an aircraft transmits its location via data link only when requested by a specific partner, like an air base. Different flight-tracking websites were able to capture different fragments of the C-17’s trajectory — a single blip over the Atlantic Ocean on the night of Sept. 5 and part of a descent toward Accra, Ghana’s capital, the next morning.

Hours later, a brief signal showed it landing in Cape Verde, probably for crew rest, before returning home. Its ADS-B transponder began transmitting again on Sept 10. Two days later, a lawsuit filed in a U.S. District Court alleged the flight held 14 men — 13 from Nigeria and one from The Gambia — who had all been granted protections from removal to their countries of origin for fear of persecution or torture. They were loaded onto the cargo jet in the middle of the night with no advance warning, they alleged, and were only told where they were going when the plane was in the air. One Nigerian man said that after he asked to speak to his lawyers, he was “straitjacketed for several hours” — seeming to refer to the WRAP device ICE uses on immigrants who resist transport, which has been the subject of a number of lawsuits over the years alleging use of the device has caused permanent injury and even death by asphyxiation.

Once in Ghana, the men said they were sent to an “abysmal” open-air prison camp and told they would be returned to their countries of origin — something the U.S. government had been barred from doing. Though Judge Tanya Chutkan called the Trump administration’s actions “disingenuous,” she ultimately ruled she did not have the jurisdiction to stop it. On Tuesday, Ghana said all of the men had been returned to their home countries, though attorneys told the Associated Press four were still in the Ghana prison.

Human rights groups say this amounts to chain refoulement — the forcible expulsion of refugees and asylum seekers to countries where they are vulnerable to return to countries where they face persecution — and violates both domestic and international law.

“What is alarming today is the emerging pattern of shadowy deportations of people who have not had access to a court or any meaningful form of due process — removals that bear the hallmarks of forced disappearances under international law,” says Rebecca Sharpless, a University of Miami law professor who studies ICE flights.

Accepting third-country nationals “should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the immigration policies of the Trump administration,” Ghanaian foreign minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa said Monday. “Our decision is grounded purely on humanitarian principle and Pan-African empathy.”

The second C-17 trip began like the first one — Alexandria, Gitmo, St. Croix, no ADS-B transponder but still trackable — before becoming even harder to detect when it left St. Croix. One flight-tracking website captured a few blips as it headed toward the western coast of Africa in the small hours of Sept. 10, and two blips over Senegal later that evening. The other flight-tracking website didn’t capture anything at all, which one activist described as “very weird.”

Two of the flight deck transmissions Rolling Stone obtained, which are not available on flight-tracking websites, show the pilots planning to land at Roberts International Airport in Monrovia, Liberia, and Freetown International Airport in Sierra Leone that morning, with a third transmission showing an intended stop in Mali’s capital of Bamako in the early afternoon. The final stop in Senegal was likely for crew rest.

Two other military aircraft are known to have done ICE missions without broadcasting transponder signals: the jets that carried third-country nationals from a U.S. base in Djibouti to South Sudan and Eswatini in July.

That same month, Trump held a bizarre “Africa summit” at the White House, gathering five of the continent’s 50-plus leaders around a conference table, where he extolled their “very valuable land, great minerals, great oil deposits, and wonderful people” and fished for compliments from his fellow heads of state. (“A tremendous golfer.” “Deserves the Nobel Peace Prize.”) And, Trump said, they were making progress on third-country agreements.

Since then, ICE flights to Africa are surging. A new ICE charter, Paradigm Jet Management, has entered the picture, running at least eight deportation trips to and from the continent in the last six weeks. ICE also sent seven third-country nationals to Rwanda on two Gulfstream jets, and now the Trump administration is threatening to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda and Mahmoud Khalil to Algeria (or Syria). Omni Air International carried Russian dissidents to Egypt, where they were forced onto a plane to Moscow, and last week flew an eight-stop deportation mega-route from Senegal to the Democratic Republic of Congo, where passengers on the last stop likely spent more than 50 hours shackled in handcuffs and leg irons attached to chains around their waists.

The ban, which comes into effect on 1 January 2026, is part of a series of bills that aims to protect residents from what Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom has called ""secret police"" roaming the streets.

US Attorney Bill Essayli, a Trump appointee, said California ""has no jurisdiction over the federal government"", adding the law has ""no effect on our operations"" and agents ""will continue to protect their identities"".

The ban is in response to federal agents wearing masks during Los Angeles immigration raids.

The law makes exceptions for undercover agents, masks used to protect against disease or wildfires, and tactical gear.

President Donald Trump has ramped up immigration enforcement as a priority in his second term.

In June, a series of federal immigration raids in LA sparked violent protests against the Trump administration and ICE.

Trump deployed 700 US Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to the country's second-largest city in reaction to the unrest.

California State Senator Scott Wiener, a Democrat who represents San Francisco, wrote the bill in response.

""No one wants masked officers roaming their communities and kidnapping people with impunity,"" he said. ""California will continue to stand for the rule of law and for basic freedoms.""

The legislation comes after the Supreme Court ruled that immigration enforcement stops in LA could continue for the time being without officers needing reasonable suspicion that a person may not be in the US legally.

That ruling allows officers to question and detain people based solely on their race, language or job while a legal challenge to recent immigration raids works its way through the courts.

As well as the ban on face coverings, a new bill also requires law enforcement officials to identify themselves while conducting duties by both name and badge number.

Other bills signed by Newsom on Saturday prohibit school officials and employees from allowing federal agents conducting immigration enforcement to enter school sites without a warrant, court order or judicial subpoena.

Families will also need to be informed when officers arrive at their children's schools.

Student information and classrooms are also protected under these new laws.

Non-public areas of hospitals and emergency rooms are also off-limits to officers who do not have judicial warrants or court orders.

""Immigrants have rights and we have the right to stand up and push back,"" Newsom said.

In a statement on Saturday, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called California's new legislation ""despicable"" and a ""flagrant attempt to endanger our officers"".

She said the officers at ICE and other federal law enforcement agencies ""put their lives on the line every day"" to do their jobs.

""Make no mistake, this type of rhetoric is contributing to the surge in assaults of officers through their repeated vilification and demonization.""

New Americans, a division of Samaritas, is one of Michigan's largest refugee resettlement services with offices in Grand Rapids and Battle Creek. The organization supports individuals and families from arrival through long-term integration. Director Chris Cavanaugh has collaborated with refugees wanting to come to Michigan for more than 20 years, and he has heard that some former refugees who have settled in the area are concerned about their status based on changing immigration policies instituted by President Donald Trump's administration.

“The refugee system has traditionally worked to help (immigrants) who face persecution,” Cavanaugh said. “I’ve heard from some (employees) that they’ve had clients express concerns about their status.”

Cavanaugh added that he hasn’t heard of any refugees his agency has worked with skip work or school because of deportation concerns. But Michigan Immigration Rights Center Director Susan Reed has gone out of her way to assure clients that they still have rights, especially if they are naturalized citizens. Reed oversees the nonprofit legal resource center that supports immigration communities. Michigan Immigration Right Center has five locations in the state, including Battle Creek.

“There are so many people who contact us each week who think the (federal government) can to whatever they want to them,” Reed said.

Among the administration policies enacted this year is an increase in Temporary Protected Status (TPS) terminations, Reed said. TPS is a humanitarian program created by Congress in the Immigration Act of 1990 that grants immigrants temporary status to work in the U.S., usually for a period of six to 18 months.

With TPS and other protections reduced or eliminated, local immigrants are concerned about enrolling their children in community programs or visiting federally qualified health centers for medical care because of the implied threat of Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE) agents being onsite.

Reed has been in the immigration law field for more than 20 years. She said there have been 451 changes to immigration policy since Jan. 20, and that the pace and number of changes have been overwhelming to her.

“Just think how hard that is for (clients),” Reed said. “It’s very frightening. Every time there is significant ICE (enforcement) activity in a neighborhood, everyone hears about it.”

The Battle Creek area and other west Michigan communities have experienced a growth in refugees and immigrants from such countries as Burma and the Demmocractic Republic of Congo in recent years as people native to those countries have come to the U.S. to escape political and socioeconomic persecution.

“We’re hoping to see the flow of immigrants increase,” Cavanaugh said. “There are a lot of (refugees and immigrants) who are trying to reunite with their families in U.S.

Refugees are people who cannot return to their home country because of persecution or a realistic fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website. Refugees are admitted into the country through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program after screening by U.S. agencies. The U.S. Department of State manages that program.

Being a refugee is a protected status under humanitarian law. Refugees must apply for a green card, which signifies the approval of permanent residents, one year after entering the U.S. according to the USCIS website.

Family- and employment-based immigrants enter as permanent residents, but many immigrants have no automatic path to U.S. residency.

“There should not be status issues for refugees unless they have committed a crime,” Cavanaugh said.

Other refugees and immigrants have come to the Battle Creek area from countries like Cuba, Haiti, Iraq, and Somalia.

One challenge Cavanaugh has experienced is that the country’s humanitarian parole program has been impacted by status changes coming from federal agencies. Nationally, this has resulted in some immigrants losing their employment authorization and protected status.

Humanitarian parole is an immigration tool used to allow immigrants who don’t otherwise qualify for a visa to enter the U.S. temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or because their entry provides a significant public benefit. Rather than a residency step, it’s an emergency permission granted for a limited time, according to the USCIS website.

Actions like changing the status of the humanitarian parole program is one reason why Cavanaugh believes local refugees and immigrants may be concerned for their status.

“Many of these people came here just so they could work in the U.S.,” he said. “If they aren’t eligible, that’s a big challenge.”","https://www.battlecreekenquirer.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/10/PDEM/86078840007-20200302-t-000000-z-777382664-rc-2-dbf-9-yg-1-kt-rtrmadp-3-usaimmigration.JPG?crop=3034,1708,x0,y157&width=3034&height=1708&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-21 11:59:13.744846

Birmingham immigration attorney Brett Pouncey told statewide news outlet AL.com that numerous communities are also working with ICE to set up license-checking ""roadblocks"" – citing reports from his own clients.

Russellville community organizer Evelyn Servin told the outlet that police should not be working with the feds, and claimed people in her area may be racially profiled and detained.

Throughout the summer, ICE also made two dozen arrests in Baldwin County, home of the famed white-sand ""Redneck Riviera"" beach towns.

Arrests were made at sites in Loxley – along Interstate 10 north of Orange Beach – and Spanish Fort, which lies on the other end of the George Wallace Tunnel from Mobile.

The operations led one immigration advocate in that region to suggest immigrants write phone numbers on their bodies to be able to contact family in case they are detained by ICE, according to AL.com.
